1,seriously i think it was the best movie ever

1,there are some very funny scenes in the film
1,if i were to rate it a 1 it should be a 10
1,but it 's a great film
1,emmanuelle chriqui plays the role as the mother of a young woman who is in love with her
1,in the end the movie is a very good one
1,ever the movie 's biggest flaw is that the story is not very
1,i have to admit i did not like this movie but i was
1,but it 's a great film
1,and the ending was a bit too predictable and the story is just plain
1,guy kibbee plays a man with no charisma and a sense that the film 's only purpose is that it 's not even a comedy

1,but the movie is not a complete

1,the film has some good points but the story is
1,trust me i did not see the film at
1,this is the worst movie ever made
1,it is a very good film and it is not a movie that i
1,this movie was so bad that i could n't believe that it would be so
1,ok so i was n't impressed

1,it 's not even a movie it
1,i have seen this film twice

1,i have seen this movie several times and it 's one of the best i have ever seen
1,also i do not know what to do
1,a few years ago i saw the film and was
1,i was surprised to find that the movie is a bit too long
1,this is a very bad film and i do n't know why
1,to be honest i was n't expecting a lot
1,rosanna arquette plays a young woman in a small rural village who has a crush on the young woman
1,even though it 's a bit dated it is still a very enjoyable film and a good time capsule
1,i have to admit i did n't like the film but it is very entertaining
1,tommy lee curtis is the perfect choice to make this film

1,fourth the plot is a bit confusing
1,another thing i did not like about

1,and the ending is so bad that i
1,this movie was a complete disappointment

1,dear god this movie is a complete mess of a
1,thursday night is one that i would love for a few years

1,i was surprised that this film did not have the
1,in the first movie the main character is the father of a man who is a very human being
1,it is a very funny movie
1,most people have seen this film and i do not think it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
1,she is the one to do and the film does n't seem very
1,it is not the best movie i have ever had the pleasure to see but i
1,above the rest of this film i have to say i was n't
1,oh yeah and the ending was a bit abrupt
1,way too much of the same territory as the
1,stage fright was a great movie for me and my friends and i were watching this movie for the second time
1,diana rigg is a great actor
1,also i do n't know what the point of this film was to be
1,up until the last scene of this movie i was expecting something more than i
1,i have to say i was n't disappointed
1,this movie was a complete disappointment to watch and it was a shame that it
1,sutherland 's character is a caricature
1,the film has a very interesting plot and the characters are all likable and likable and
1,you know what i was going through the whole movie and it 's
1,due for the sake that it is not a movie that is n't afraid to be a good movie
1,i was surprised that the movie did not get a theatrical dvd
1,walker 's character is a little too unlikable to be believable but he is a little more than he is
1,the movie is about the same subject as a book and it
1,properly i have to say that this movie was a complete waste
1,and it is not the worst film i
1,she 's not the only person who
1,i have seen this movie twice and i still have to admit that i have n't read the novel
1,so the movie was a waste
1,they are all very funny and funny and i really enjoyed the movie
1,it 's not a bad movie
1,despite the obvious plot holes and the occasional sex
1,very good movie and a great movie to
1,i was n't impressed by this movie but it 's a great film
1,this is the worst film ever made
1,another problem is the ending which is so bad that i actually found myself nodding to the screen
1,in fact it 's a very good film and a
1,he 's a very good guy and a very funny
1,malfique was one of the best films i have ever seen
1,the film is a bit of an action movie but the action is n't too bright and the movie is n't really a thriller it is n't even
1,there is no real plot to be found here and
1,the film is a complete mess
1,mr bean has the ability of a character to play the role
1,it is not a movie for everyone but if it is a comedy you should see this
1,you know that the film is a bit too long
1,the film is about the struggle of the people in the world to be a part of the family and
1,the movie was a waste of my time and money to watch
1,as for me i have seen a lot worse
1,i have seen this film twice and i have never been a
1,otherwise the movie was a bit slow and boring but it 's
1,it 's not a movie that is n't funny
1,these are the only reasons i gave this film
1,sadly it is not a film that will appeal to anyone who has ever
1,we have to be careful to see the movie
1,the film has some of its most
1,the movie was shot in the early
1,one thing i did like about this movie was that it had
1,i was surprised to see that this was the first film
1,i was n't impressed with the film and i did not like the film as much as the first
1,i was surprised to find that this was a very low budget movie
1,evie 's character was so annoying that i could n't care less about the characters or their motivations or
1,possibly the worst movie ever made
1,for the most part the movie was pretty bad and i was bored
1,okay so i do n't think that the film was a total success
1,although the film was a bit slow it was n't a good film either
1,this movie is not a good one
1,his character was so annoying that it could have been so funny
1,i was n't expecting much from this
1,the movie was a waste for the whole family and it was n't even worth watching for the first time and the
1,the film has some of the most
1,it is a very funny movie
1,the film is a complete waste of my time and money to waste
1,this is the first movie that i
1,not to say the movie is a bit of a bore but it is a very good movie
1,plenty of people who are n't in this movie
1,this movie is not for the squeamish
1,in fact it is a very good film and it 's not just a movie it is an
1,this is a very bad film
1,why did they make such a bad movie out of this mess
1,i have to say that i was very impressed with the movie and i think it 's the best movie ever made and it is one
1,i was n't impressed with the film and i was surprised to see that the film was a bit slow
1,barney is the best of the bunch
1,on the other side of my mind i found this
1,also the film has a lot of good things to do with it and it 's not a bad movie
1,the movie was shot on location in a small budget and the acting is pretty bad but it is n't
1,maybe it 's because the movie is so good that i could n't help but laugh at
1,if i had n't been a fan of this movie it would have been a good film to watch
1,true the movie was a little too long for the first two parts but it 's a bit slow moving and the ending is a bit unsatisfying and
1,but the movie was a little slow and the ending was too abrupt
1,i have to admit i did n't like the film
1,it 's not a movie for the masses or for the faint
1,her performance in the film was a little overdone but the story was very good and the acting was good
1,each of the three leads are a bunch of friends who have a lot
1,in fact it is not the worst movie i 've seen
1,it is not the best movie i have ever had the misfortune to see
1,the movie is a complete waste
1,indeed the movie has some very good moments and is very funny
1,who is that girl who is the killer in this film and she is the one
1,the film is a bit of a mess
1,in fact it is not the worst movie ever
1,let me say that this movie was so awful that it was actually painful
1,yet the film is a little too long for the
1,this movie is not a bad movie
1,the film is about the same thing as the first one
1,if you want a good laugh and enjoy a good movie with a great
1,if you 're a diehard horror fan you 'll love it but it is n't a bad movie
1,all in all this is one of the
1,it is a shame that this movie has n't received a wide release in the imdb
1,i was n't expecting a movie about a man who was born
1,however i was n't impressed with the film
1,oh and a lot of people who are not in the
1,gus van sant 's direction was a
1,it 's not a bad movie
1,you can tell the story is a bit
1,but the film is not as bad
1,despite the obvious plot holes and some very good acting this movie
1,the movie is a complete mess of the original film
1,and it is not the best movie i 've ever seen
1,news reports of the film are the same as the first one and that is the only reason i can see it
1,i was surprised that the film did n't have to rely
1,the film has a lot of potential to be taken seriously and it is a very good film to see
1,maybe it was a good idea but it
1,i was n't impressed with this film but i was surprised that it was n't a
1,an excellent film that is a mustsee for all ages and for fans who enjoy the genre of the late 1960s
1,this is the worst film i have ever had the displeasure of seeing
1,its not a good movie but it 's not a good movie
1,just like the first movie i have to admit i did n't have a clue about what i saw but it was a good idea
1,will smith and the other characters are so bad
1,the film has a very interesting plot but the acting and
1,a few of them were very funny and i liked them but i was n't sure what to
1,the movie is about a group that is trying too hard
1,although i do n't think it is a great movie it is not
1,he 's a great actor and he is very good as a man who has to be a little too hard
1,i was surprised that this film did not get a theatrical release in
1,the movie is about a young woman who is a teenager who has a daughter and a son
1,on a technical level the acting was superb and the story
1,the film is about the struggle of the people in a world where they are not afraid of being a child and
1,when the film is over the end credits have to
1,this movie was so bad that i could not even laugh
1,or maybe the fact that it was a long way to make it a little more interesting
1,from the opening sequence to the end of the
1,and the ending was a bit too abrupt and too predictable to make it
1,while i was not expecting a good film i did not like this one as it is very much like the first one
1,please please do not waste your money
1,that 's the only thing i have ever heard
1,no matter how many years ago he was a big star and
1,but the film is a little slow
1,generally the film has a lot to offer
1,there are a few good scenes but the film is n't as bad as it could 've been and the script is so bad that i ca all about
1,it 's not a bad movie but it 's a good one and it
1,i have to say i was very impressed with this movie
1,also the movie is not as good as the first one but the acting was so bad it 's almost laughable
1,i have to admit i did not enjoy the movie but i did n't like the movie
1,then there 's a scene in the middle of the
1,mastroianni is the best actor in this film
1,same goes with the rest of it
1,the movie was a waste of time and money and time
1,the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,the movie was shot on a low budget and it was a bit of a stretch to see the movie
1,but it is a great movie and it is a great movie
1,seven years ago i was a teenager in the late 20s and early seventies
1,amusingly it 's not even the slightest bit scary it 's a bit of a mess
1,sure it 's not the best film i 've seen but it is a great film
1,the film is about the struggle of the two
1,how can you go wrong with the movie
1,but the film is a bit slow and the ending was so predictable
1,oh and the music is n't bad
1,it 's not even a movie it
1,it 's a very good movie
1,so the movie was made for the sake that the film
1,the film has a very good story and the acting is superb and the story line is very good
1,despite the fact that the movie was shot in a very tight location it was a nice touch
1,when i first saw this film i was a bit sceptical of the film and the fact it
1,i have to say i was very impressed with this movie and i was surprised to find out
1,the movie is about the same subject as a movie
1,it 's not even the best of the series
1,but the movie was n't bad enough
1,i was surprised to see this film
1,the movie was shot in the same way as the first film
1,dr hackenstein has been a big hit for years and now has been on the run for his life in a small village
1,but it is not the best of the series
1,to be honest the film is a little
1,if i had to watch it again it was n't
1,i was n't impressed by this film but it was very good and it 's not a bad film
1,the film is about a group that has been sent into a world war camp in
1,she 's a little more convincing and a lot more than she 's
1,there is a lot to be said about this
1,what a waste for a movie that
1,i was surprised to see that the film was made for
1,in fact the film was shot in the early seventies
1,ricco 's character was a little too unlikable to be believable but the story was so stupid that i was n't expecting much
1,anyway the film has a lot to offer and
1,but it is not a movie
1,every time i watch this movie it is so sad to see a movie that is not even close
1,not to say that it was a bad film but i did n't expect much
1,it 's a shame because the film is so boring and so boring that it 's hard
1,it is not the best movie ever made
1,the film is a complete mess of the original
1,however i was surprised that the movie did not get released
1,well i guess i 'll be a little more forgiving of the movie
1,with a few twists and turns and some of them you can see the similarities between them and the characters are so
1,the film has a lot of potential to make it worth watching but the movie does
1,i have seen the movie and i have to admit i was
1,what is the point of this movie
1,this movie is not a good one
1,it 's a shame that the film has been so much
1,the movie is a bit of an insult
1,also the film has a lot to offer and is a bit too long for the whole movie
1,from the beginning of this film i was a little confused
1,you can tell the story is a joke but it 's a good movie
1,if you want a good laugh out loud comedy
1,this is a movie for everyone
1,timothy spall plays the role of the father of a
1,the movie was shot in a small budget
1,they are all very good actors and actresses
1,connery 's performance is the only one that i can recall him as a man who was a bit of an
1,david lynch 's film was a great film that i enjoyed
1,plus the movie was a bit too slow
1,whilst the film was shot in the seventies it 's not a movie that you can see in the cinema
1,a lot of people have said that the movie is so boring and so stupid that i could n't even get
1,luckily the film 's biggest success was that the director had
1,the movie is about the same thing as the
1,first of the film 's plot is about a young woman who has been kidnapped and abused by a woman
1,phoebe 's father and son have a relationship with each other and
1,in fact the film is a bit too long for the most extreme of the movie to be a complete mess
1,that is what makes it a great movie and it 's not just
1,she is the only person that has to be killed
1,that is what i thought it was
1,with the exception being a bit of the same thing i did not like the film and the plot is
1,i have to say i did n't enjoy this movie
1,this movie is not a good movie
1,this movie was so bad that it
1,so i guess it was a good idea
1,the movie was a waste of time and money and money to make
1,or the fact it 's not the best of the bunch
1,part 2 is a great movie that i think is one
1,she 's a very talented actress
1,from a technical standpoint this is the best movie of the decade
1,michael caine is the only actor in the movie that is good
1,simple story about the lives of the people who were in love
1,i have to admit i was n't disappointed
1,and it 's a good movie
1,cartman 's father is a man who has
1,my advice is that you 'll find this film on video
1,do n't worry about the movie because you
1,it 's a very funny movie and it 's not just the fact that the movie is set in a small city in new
1,compelled for the movie 's success
1,let me say this is the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune
1,this movie was so awful that i was compelled to watch the whole movie
1,to be honest the movie was n't so much of an improvement on me
1,the movie is a complete waste
1,insights to be a great movie
1,keira knightly is a good choice for her
1,i was surprised to find out that this movie was a complete disaster
1,no one has to endure the film
1,it 's a very funny movie and i
1,the film is a complete waste of my time and money
1,it is a very funny movie
1,then the movie starts with a bang and a few scenes of the movie are shot
1,the film is a bit of a bore but the acting and the acting is superb
1,in fact it 's a very bad movie
1,in fact the only thing that makes this film is the fact it is a film about a young man who is attracted
1,but it is not the worst movie i
1,like the first film the characters are so stupid and the plot is so contrived
1,unless you are a diehard fan like myself and have seen it in a few years i 'd say
1,however the film is not as good as it should be
1,having seen this film several times and have watched it
1,but it 's not a good movie and it is not
1,it is a very good movie and i think that the movie is very well
1,however i was n't impressed with the film
1,pranks are n't always a problem
1,unfortunately the film is a bit too long for its own good
1,she 's not a bad guy but a good actress
1,yvonne 's character was a little too much to bear
1,maybe the movie was made in the early 70 's
1,michael caine plays a young man who is diagnosed with his past and is forced by his family to find a new job
1,in the end the movie is not a good
1,ford is a great actor and i have to say
1,also i think that the director should have had the director 's commentary on this film as
1,it is a very good movie and it 's a great movie to see
1,this movie was a waste for me
1,however the movie was a little too long
1,yeah it 's not a bad film but the fact that it 's
1,she 's a little more convincing and she 's not the only person
1,but it 's a good thing to watch
1,wolf 's character was a little bit too much for me
1,damon crowe plays the role of the father who is a little too old to play the part
1,this is the worst film i 've seen in years
1,if i had to watch it again i would have been a little sceptical
1,and it is a shame because the film is a little slow
1,scarlett is a very good character and she is very believable in her portrayal of the character
1,some people say that this is the best movie ever made and i
1,the film is about the same thing as the other films
1,in fact the only reason i watched this film was that the actors were so
1,this movie was so awful it 's
1,i was n't expecting much of a film
1,they 're all in a bad movie and it 's a shame that the movie has n't got
1,eleanor parker is the perfect actress for her role
1,can you say the movie is n't bad it 's just
1,the film is about the struggle between the two and
1,the movie was a bit slow but i was surprised that the movie did n't have a lot to offer
1,80 minutes of the movie that you will have a good
1,we have to be a bit more careful about
1,valjean is the only person who is able in the world to get his revenge
1,the film has a very good story line
1,with the help from his friend he 's a little too much to be ashamed
1,there are some good scenes and some good ones
1,the movie is about the same thing as the
1,i'm a big fan of the genre and i have seen
1,bad acting bad direction bad editing
1,just as a movie is a good idea to make a good
1,hitchcock 's film has been a staple of
1,4 out of 5 stars for the acting
1,not to mention the acting is horrible
1,okay so i was expecting a lot more than i expected
1,once again the movie has a very interesting story
1,you can see the movie in a different light
1,scott 's performance is very good and the movie has some good moments
1,when the movie was released it was released in theaters
1,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,and it is not a movie that is so much better than the first
1,or the other two of them are the same
1,wake is the best movie i have seen in my entire lifetime
1,this movie is not for everyone
1,i have to admit i did not enjoy the movie but it was very entertaining and
1,what a waste of time and money
1,hera nachle was a very funny film
1,it 's a shame because it is not the best movie ever made
1,the film is about a young woman named
1,if i had to give this a zero i would have
1,thinking about the film and the fact it is
1,examples of the film are the fact that the director has no clue how to make a movie
1,this is a movie that i can watch over all
1,i was surprised that the movie was made
1,both the story of the film is very good
1,funny and entertaining but it 's a
1,he is a very talented actor and a very good
1,there is a lot of violence in the film but it is
1,alberto de la bestia is one of those films where you have to
1,however the film is a bit slow and boring
1,we are not supposed for the same reason
1,on the plus the acting was pretty bad
1,one of the most interesting films of the last century and the most successful and successful film
1,it 's not even a movie it
1,ted danson plays the role as a cocky and cynical man who is
1,closed to a point of nausea is the story
1,our hero is a very good actor and he is very convincing in the role of the detective
1,it 's a shame that this movie has n't been seen by anyone who has seen the original
1,see it for the acting and the acting it is very well done and well worth seeing
1,i was surprised to find that this was the first movie that i saw that i would n't
1,i was surprised that the movie did not have a chance for
1,this movie is not for everyone
1,i was n't expecting much from the film but it 's not a good film
1,ginger rogers is the only reason i can think of why this movie was made in the uk when the film is not a masterpiece
1,but it is not the worst film i have seen
1,then there is a lot more to the story than the characters and their motivations and actions
1,he is a very good actor and he is a great director and a good guy
1,it 's not a movie that is n't funny
1,there are a few good moments in this movie but it 's
1,the movie is a complete mess of the first movie and the second is a very poor one at
1,the film has some of the worst dialogue i have ever seen
1,the film has some of the most
1,bring a new generation of kids and children
1,the movie was shot on location and the camera
1,just like the first film i have seen this movie
1,plus it 's a shame that this film has n't made any sense to me
1,what a great movie this was
1,the film has some good points but it 's
1,it 's a very funny movie
1,i have to say i was very impressed by this film and
1,i was surprised that this film was made in a hurry
1,and the movie was so bad that it was actually funny
2,i do think it 's one of the funniest comedies
2,an old friend of a wealthy family is a young man
2,this is a great movie for those who like good movies and bad acting and bad
2,just do yourself and do n't waste your entire life
2,will smith and the rest of this movie are all so bad they 're
2,the story line has been told in a way by a few of its characters
2,a lot of things are happening in other countries
2,the acting is good and the script is a good mix of action comedy comedy and romance drama
2,although i was n't impressed by this show and the plot it is very well
2,he has a great deal to do but he 's not a good actor either he 's a good man but his character is so
2,i was so disappointed with the movie
2,the movie was a little slow but i did n't think it 's really bad
2,on the other the film has the most memorable scenes ever filmed in film and in a very stylish scene where one of them is in the street and another scene is
2,the movie was n't a complete waste of time
2,when i saw it on tv and was hooked i thought i 'd give up
2,this is the first time you see this movie
2,or maybe he 's a little too much of
2,from the first few frames of this film i felt the need to give
2,and i do n't want to spoil it
2,while the film is not as good and the story line it 's still a little too weak to be a serious movie and the film does a good enough job
2,please do n't waste your life with this one
2,that 's a shame since i have never seen a film like this
2,no matter what the characters were supposed or they are not supposed as
2,but the film 's only redeeming feature was the cinematography
2,generally the plot was a lot better and it
2,there are some funny moments in it but the movie does n't make a whole
2,what a wonderful and wonderful film
2,it 's a very funny movie and i would recommend it to all who
2,i have never seen a movie like it before
2,also i think the film is very well written directed and written
2,i do think it is a very funny movie and a good movie
2,mastroianni 's character was not as funny as he was in the first
2,same as a man with a beard and a beard
2,the film is not about the war or how it is about the war but about a man who 's been trying to get away with it
2,the story was n't too bad
2,but the film is n't as good
2,seven years ago i have been watching it on dvd and i have been waiting for it to
2,amusingly the movie is a little slow
2,sure it 's not a great idea to call it a
2,the movie was a little over a decade but it 's not a movie that i would recommend it to
2,but the story was n't that good and the acting was n't
2,oh and the ending is a bit abrupt
2,it 's just a bunch that you can get a kick out from the beginning with the end of the movie
2,it 's a shame because it is so much fun to have fun with it and it 's not even worth the time of it
2,so i have a feeling of disgust and sorrow that i have not seen in the past
2,the acting is good and the story is very well done
2,despite the fact that this movie is based in the book by james stewart
2,when he is a girl in his apartment he 's a teenager
2,i have to say that it is one hell i 've been waiting for
2,it is n't even the same thing that i did like
2,but i think that the movie has a lot of problems with the story and characters that have been made
2,i think that this movie has been made in my estimation
2,the acting and script are so poor it 's almost
2,dr jacques mankiewicz 's novel of this film
2,but this movie has a very low budget and is n't really
2,to me this was a very good movie and a great movie
2,if you want to watch something else you should definitely check this out
2,i have to wonder if the movie was meant by an older man
2,the film is not a comedy but it is a great piece
2,she is a great actor and i think she
2,there was a lot to be desired in this movie
2,what is the difference between this and
2,what 's the point of this film it has the most
2,i was n't sure why it was so good to watch
2,in the end he is a very good person
2,ricco 's character was not so funny
2,anyway i do n't think it is that bad
2,but the real thing is this story is about a group who go to a remote island where the world is ruled
2,every time i see it i can only conclude the movie was made
2,he was the most likable person in hollywood 's golden age of his time and the only reason i watched it
2,what 's more interesting was that it 's so hard
2,not only is he a great actress he also has a very good performance and is a very
2,it 's a very good film
2,it was n't that bad but the acting was n't as good
2,the movie was a little slow
2,however the film is a bit long and
2,well the first thing i noticed about this movie was its title song
2,with all the faults of the original film the film is n't really about anything
2,the film is about as good and not as good
2,i do n't think that it would make much difference to the movie and i think it would make a great
2,what 's the point of the story of this movie is that
2,this is a great movie for everyone who loves a little bit of
2,it 's the story of two friends of mine
2,the film is a complete failure
2,also i have a feeling that the director should
2,from the first few scenes of the movie the film wraps up and ends up being a very satisfying film with the same theme as the first film
2,if the story is not bad it 's not that good
2,this is a movie that should be seen by all ages of a lifetime
2,timothy spall was great as a woman who was married to the other woman and she was a bit too old for the
2,the movie is a little too short
2,they are both funny and funny and are n't funny anymore
2,connery 's character is so much more than he is
2,david carradine plays a man who is trying too much to save the life of his father and son who is a little more than a little more tolerant and a
2,plus it 's not a great film it 's not a bad movie either
2,whilst it 's not as good or better than that it still has the same effect on the whole
2,luckily the film is a complete waste of
2,the story of the story of the young girl is played out in
2,first the movie was a bit slow and boring and i could n't help
2,phoebe and her friend have been a bit
2,in the first film we see a young man who
2,that is the best thing about this movie and i do agree with other comments about it
2,she 's a very talented actress and she 's very sexy
2,that said the movie is a little over the top
2,with the exception of a few other actors who are not the best actors ever the
2,i have never been a huge austen
2,this movie was so awful it was almost unbearable
2,this is the best film i ever watched
2,so the movie is not about a woman who is attracted and the other is her father
2,the film is a complete mess
2,or maybe the movie would be a little better if it is not for a few laughs and it 's not a comedy
2,part 2 is an excellent film
2,she was so good in her performance that i was
2,from this point on the movie goes nowhere and the characters are not believable
2,michael ironside is the perfect choice to play a man who has a good time and is a very likable person in his own way but he
2,i was surprised that i wasted my money and time on this movie
2,and i was surprised at the end of this movie
2,cartman is not a very good character
2,my advice is do not rent the dvd
2,do n't worry to see this movie if it
2,it 's not a bad movie but
2,compelled to watch the film for its entirety
2,let it all unfold the story is about a young girl and
2,this movie is a great example of a great movie
2,to me this was a pretty good idea
2,the acting was horrible the story was awful the dialogue is bad the dialogue is
2,insights to make it look like a documentary about a bunch of people who were n't a big city war star
2,keira farrow is the only one to get
2,i was expecting something like this but this is n't
2,no one can replace him for a good performance but he has a great voice
2,what 's the purpose to the story line and the plot twists
2,it 's a shame the movie is still a success of a movie
2,then the two meet up and then they 're forced to kill the girl
2,definitely the worst horror movie i 've
2,the movie is not a comedy but the characters in this movie are very funny
2,in the first half of this movie i was n't sure if it
2,in the end i was hoping that it would be good and i could n't wait for it next to a sequel
2,but the film has the same effect on the whole thing as it 's
2,like a lot to the movie it is not a movie
2,unless you 're an avid viewer who enjoys the original and you have a great time with this film you 'll love it as much
2,however this is a film about two different characters that make the film
2,they 're just as good as a couple of scenes that have
2,having said that i do have a lot of respect for it
2,but the movie was n't bad
2,it 's not that the acting is n't that terrible but the
2,however the movie is a little too long
2,pranks were not all that bad but
2,unfortunately i did n't think that it would
2,she 's not even a bad actress but she is a real treat and i think she has a very small part
2,yvonne is a very beautiful woman who is not afraid for a moment when her husband is a teenager in the middle
2,michael caine plays his character very convincingly
2,in a way it is a great movie to see and i will give it an
2,ford 's character was a bit too old for the role of john wayne
2,also the ending is so predictable and predictable that i could n't care about
2,it has the feel of a bad tv series but it was n't
2,this movie was not even funny
2,however it 's not the best movie ever made and the only good one was the
2,yeah it 's all about a bunch of girls and
2,she is also the best thing about the movie
2,but it 's not as bad as some say
2,wolf and his mate are a group and have been sent
2,damon is the only actor who has ever played his role in this movie
2,if you are not a big fan of the book then you will love this one
2,and the acting in the first half was pretty good
2,scarlett johansson is a great actress and she 's very good in the role but the
2,some people say that this is a bad film it
2,the film is a very good film
2,in fact it 's the best of it
2,this movie is so awful i ca
2,i have seen it several many times already and have never heard of this film until i saw it
2,they are both very attractive but the
2,eleanor parker is a fine director
2,can you imagine the film as a comedy and a comedy it 's
2,the film 's story is a very interesting one which is a little too much
2,the acting is pretty good and the story is very good
2,80 's movie is a great movie
2,we get a lot of the same shots of a young man being transported to the prison in
2,valjean 's father is the son of a man named seita who 's
2,5 the story is not very good
2,the movie starts off with a bunch and a bunch and a bunch in their car
2,with all the shortcomings of the movie the acting in this is not bad but not bad enough that the movie
2,there was no real chemistry in the story
2,at least it 's not a total loss
2,the acting is pretty good and the script is a good idea
2,i'm not a prude but it does have
2,bad acting bad script bad acting and bad direction
2,just a little bit of fun
2,hitchcock 's film is a great film for all ages
2,4 the story is a complete mess of mine
2,not only is it the best movie i ever saw it
2,okay so i was n't expecting much from it
2,once the movie starts you realize the whole time around the corner of a movie and the movie itself
2,you 'll have a good idea of this movie
2,scott 's character in the movie does n't seem like
2,when he gets a job of his job and is sent to the police to get the job to be the police detective the cop is the suspect
2,i think it 's a great film to see
2,and i do n't think that this film was
2,or is he trying to get away from the world or the evil that he is
2,wake in mind you 're a little
2,this is a great movie for the family to enjoy
2,i do not want my kids to watch a movie like the ones in
2,what 's with all those white hats
2,hera green was a great movie that was n't afraid
2,it 's a shame because the movie
2,the film is a bit slow at best
2,if you 're a fan like the one i 've seen you 'll probably enjoy this one
2,thinking about it i would say the movie was pretty funny
2,examples include the scene with a man who 's a witch
2,i think the film has a lot of fun and the
2,both of them have a very funny
2,funny how the movie is made to look like a
2,he is a great director who has done a great work of art
2,there 's a lot to like here
2,alberto is an old man who has a
2,however i do n't understand how the
2,we 're not talking like we 're supposed the answers
2,on the other hand the movie 's plot
2,one can see that there are people out to be in charge of the plot and the
2,it was n't a movie that i would n't have seen it
2,ted is not only the best of the two but the film does have some funny bits but the movie is just plain awful in every aspect and in every way
2,closed up and i have to say the acting in my first film is a bit over
2,our heroes are the only ones who have been in the business for their past and their lives are still very well done
2,it has a good plot good characters and good actors
2,see it for a good laugh
2,i think that this film has a very low rating but it was so good it
2,i was so excited when i saw that this was made and the movie was released on video in the us and
2,this movie is one of the best of the
2,i was surprised that i had to write a comment to the movie
2,ginger is not a good actress but she is very good in her role
2,but the film is a little too long
2,then i realized it was the worst movie ever
2,he has a great sense of timing and a lot
2,it has a great deal of action and a few twists and turns
2,at least the actors in this movie are able in a movie like
2,there 's also a very funny cameo
2,the film has a few moments of humor and it is a bit of an
2,the story line was a bit farfetched at times
2,bring the movie down to a point where it 's not the worst movie ever but it has a lot to say
2,the movie is a bit of an insult
2,just do n't waste your money or your time
2,plus the film 's plot is a bit thin and predictable
2,what is the purpose of this film
2,it 's just a shame because it was n't a great film
2,i think the film was very good
2,i do n't think that a single person who has ever seen this film has anything to complain about is
2,and that 's why the film is so good that it 's hard for me as i did n't know what to
2,ok i do n't know what to call the movie
2,the film has a lot going for it
2,this is a great movie for all the good reasons it is
2,i do n't know how this movie could have been made but it was a great
2,starting in a very funny way
2,for the first time i have to say that i 've seen the movie dozens of
2,everyone in it 's life must have been desperate to go
2,the acting is horrible the story is awful and it is n't funny
2,at least i have a few lines that are not so funny and so stupid
2,some scenes were so bad they were good
2,other than that it is a great show for adults who
2,if you are a diehard collector of horror films and you 're a fan like
2,other reviewers have commented on this film
2,another example of how to be a classic
2,in the end it 's not the best of the genre and the film is n't even that great
2,the film is a bit slow but it does not matter
2,helen mirren is the perfect choice for her role
2,sometimes the plot is so stupid that it becomes laughable but it 's not
2,in fact it was a great movie
2,that 's why i did n't like that
2,this movie has a very good cast and i have seen many many other movies
2,elizabeth shue plays an actress who is in the wrong of
2,the movie is very slow moving but it 's not that great either and it has to be
2,why do we need this elvis' to make a movie about the evils
2,if i had n't been in the mood to see the preview of this movie i would 've had it on my dvd
2,however i do n't think that a movie that can be so
2,i think it is an important point to the film and the film is not for all tastes but
2,throw it all together and it 's a
2,lori is a great actress and she 's great in this movie and i have to admit she was a great actor
2,i think that the director should 've been a little better if the director and writer had a more coherent script
2,in the end i was surprised to find myself in
2,alec guinness is a great director
2,a very good story about an obsessive and honorable relationship
2,sorry to be fair i do commend you for this movie but
2,i think the film was a little bit more than a typical example of what a
2,i was expecting this film from a similar standpoint and the acting was pretty
2,in the first half of this movie the characters
2,and it was a bit of a shame
2,each episode features the same plot as the original series
2,like i said the acting in this movie was horrible
2,but the film 's plot was n't that great
2,a few of the actors are good but the script
2,im sure the director had a sense of humour and i was n't impressed by the film
2,oh and a few times the film was shot with the same sound
2,anyone who thinks the film has an agenda to say that this movie should not be made is a must
2,anyway this is a very bad movie
2,material was a big hit for me and the film has been released on
2,so if you 're not a fan of either of them you
2,there is also a very good amount of suspense
2,there was a lot to this show
2,it is a great film to watch for the whole family
2,could n't they just have done it
2,the movie starts out with a couple of
2,the acting is good the writing and directing are good the directing is good but the
2,the movie has the same plot as the first movie which has the same plot as the original but it is still a good movie
2,i do n't understand the ending but it 's
2,i think this movie is a masterpiece for all of the above mentioned
2,it was the most expensive film i 've seen
2,the acting was horrible the directing horrible and
2,this film is one of the best
2,i think this is a great movie to be watched
2,the movie was shot on a shoestring in the desert
2,i think that 's the only way to
2,and the acting in this movie is horrible
2,in the end i did n't care for her but she was a little over her top as a child in a very small role as the main mother and the mother who was a bit
2,pitching a few of his best movies i have seen this one
2,since the film is set to a new level of
2,it has the most interesting characters i have come to associate on the screen
2,and the film is a bit slow
2,since the first film is a bit slow paced it is a very slow paced and very boring film
2,no wonder that the movie has a lot to be desired to me
2,now this film is n't for me but the film does have a good cast that includes all
2,if you 're looking for the real thing you will find this film entertaining and enjoyable to see and it 's
2,the story is about the lives and tribulations of
2,roman polanski 's the great depression of a film is a masterpiece of its own
2,this movie is not a bad movie it just is n't good
2,the acting is good with the exception that the movie is a little too much for me to be a fan and
2,robert downey sr plays the lead as a
2,karen and her boyfriend are not the least bit
2,a very interesting film that is not just about as bad as it is a film
2,the movie is a very interesting one
2,after the death of a young man he 's been crucified by his wife who is a bit of a jerk but
2,it 's not even the worst of any movie
2,i was expecting something like that in
2,like the other reviewer i 've read that the movie was made for a
2,and the movie does not have to be made
2,the film has some nice moments but it 's
2,only a couple of people have seen this movie in the first ten minutes or two
2,alert to a lot more than a few years ago i have seen the movie
2,i was so excited to find this movie in the theater
2,i have seen the film several many times and i have seen the
2,but this is the only time that the director
2,twins do not get to the point of being
2,five years later she has been a little more of the same
2,young woman is a very attractive and very young girl in the movie
2,not only was the plot very interesting it was just the story of a young girl who moves in and out of
2,from the beginning of the movie i was really bored
2,ms de havilland is excellent as a woman in her early thirties in
2,saif khan plays a young man who
2,the movie starts with a bang
2,you have n't heard about the plot but the acting is good the
2,fled from the bank and the two men in the film are also a very interesting one
2,so what i did n't know is that the movie has a very good cast and i think
2,izo is an excellent film with a lot of action scenes and a lot more action
2,i have never been to a film before that even the worst
2,remade by a group of young people in the same predicament as a child and his family is a bit of the same for his mother
2,this is not a movie that you should n't have
2,if the movie had been made in a hurry i would n't have to say that this was one bad bad movie
2,but the film is n't so bad it 's
2,the film 's plot revolves around a
2,it was the first time we saw it on television that i had a lot to watch
2,for a while it 's a very good movie with the best
2,walking in the woods and a few of the other actors in it are a bunch of people that are n't in any danger
2,they are the only one who 's been a member of the team and that the only ones in which the
2,yes it 's an excellent film and i will give you a chance to
2,and it 's not a movie
2,colonel 's daughter has a onenight life and she is a little bit too
2,which i believe is a very good movie but it does n't
2,i was so impressed with the film and its story
2,the movie is about the power to heal a young man who is the one who gets a job in a life that is not so much more
2,but this is a film that is n't worth renting for any laughs
2,day and night is a film that should have had a bigger impact
2,your only complaint with this one are the bad guys
2,as a result the movie has some of its own problems
2,while the film is n't as good at all it was a good idea for a good thriller
2,the film has some nice shots and some good performances but not by any means of the greatness
2,this is a great show and i recommend you to
2,most people are not interested at this film because
2,but it 's still not as funny as the first one
2,avoid this movie at all costs
2,it 's just a shame to watch the entire movie
2,it 's the only reason i gave the movie 2 star
2,i have seen a number of movies that were made in my hometown but the
2,i think this is an interesting film that is a
2,the film has some good moments but it 's not
2,the story of an aging man who is in love
2,murphy 's acting was so bad that i wanted to vomit but i did laugh once
2,the film has a few good moments but overall
2,that was the only thing that made this so bad and that the movie was n't even
2,so i have to say i was n't expecting much from this movie as
2,she was the only person who was the only person who could n't act
2,with this film i could n't wait until the film 's release
2,yakima lewis is the only one to die in a long time to finish
2,the movie has a lot going from start to the very end
2,the story of the movie was so predictable and the characters were so unbelievable that you could n't care
2,overall the movie has a lot of potential
2,that 's why it is a film about an obsessive family
2,its a very good film and the acting is good but the script and the
2,even if you 're not the type you 've been looking for and will be a bit
2,it 's the story and it does n't seem that it 's
2,it has the same kind of thing as the first one
2,if the film is a comedy and the actors do n't have the ability to do it it is not
2,terence howard is a great choice
2,on the way he meets the girl and falls in his car
2,a lot more of a movie than a lot of
2,i was surprised by the way it was shot
2,the film is about a young boy 's quest and the family 's
2,interviews with people who are not in a movie like this one is just plain
2,it has to be one to watch if not for the fact
2,from there the film is a very long journey to the very end
2,despite its weaknesses it is a very moving story of the man who has a heart
2,humor was n't bad but it did not work at the box
2,you 'll have the same problem
2,it has the same kind of humor that it
2,in a nutshell the only thing you can do was make you think about the movie
2,i have to admit i have seen this show
2,classe tous risques is one that you
2,but the film is n't so bad
2,he 's a very good director who has created a film that has a good cast
2,the story of the movie was very interesting but i found
2,if i were to watch the movie again and again it
2,secondly it 's just not a movie for the
2,that 's the only reason to watch the
2,not only is the acting bad but the story line is so bad and so bad it
2,as the story unfolds you get the feeling that the characters are just
2,there 's a very nice twist at this point and the end is a bit unexpected as it 's not a surprise but it is n't a bad movie but it 's still
2,a very enjoyable movie with a great deal
2,unfortunately it 's not a bad film
2,i think it 's the worst movie i have watched
2,the story is a bit confusing but the story is n't too bad
2,highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good film with an excellent story
2,if the movie was n't for kids i 'd have a lot of fun watching it
2,there are some great performances and the movie 's plot twists are
2,he is a great actress and he does n't disappoint in any movie that is n't bad but
2,people are saying this is a good idea for an action thriller but it
2,the story of the film is about a young boy who lives in an isolated apartment where he is a young boy who 's
2,the movie is a complete failure
2,if you have seen the trailer for the movie it 's a very nice
2,the movie is about two young men who are living on their own
2,do you want a film that has some good actors
2,like a few other movies i 've seen this movie and the other two others have made a very good impression
2,of this movie is the fact that it has no plot and no action
2,filmed on the cheap in canada it was filmed in the us in mexico and the story
2,i was n't impressed when i saw the film
2,scenes are filmed in the background and the camera is shot on a stage screen
2,it is a shame that the film
2,this is not a movie that i would
2,aimed for a movie like this i have to admit i was not impressed by the
2,but the real problem with the show was
2,and the ending is just plain bad
2,nikita is a very good film
2,the story line of the movie is very interesting and it 's a shame
2,this is a very funny show
2,do n't waste any of your valuable bucks
2,the story of a young woman in the early age is a bit too complicated
2,back in time the film 's only redeeming quality was that it was not only directed for a few years but a film that deserved
2,no one is ever going for a movie to be a good movie but it is not for the squeamish
2,i think it 's not worth watching the movie for its
2,i think that the movie has a great deal of fun and it 's just not the best movie
2,the acting is pretty good with all involved
2,yes i have n't seen this film in a while but the movie
2,i was n't sure if this movie was a spoof
2,other people who are so fond of this movie are the ones who have to deal with the subject matter
2,one can only hope this is a film to make it to the big apple
2,the acting is good and the script is great but the script
2,fine film with great performances by the two stars but it is not
2,anyway this is one of those films where you can see the director 's intentions for the camera and lighting and lighting and lighting is so bad
2,the film is a very moving film with
2,we 're talking with the same characters as the rest
2,anybody who has seen this movie can appreciate it
2,light hearted is a film about the life and times of the
2,the acting in the movie was very good and the writing by the
2,while i do n't have a lot for a movie it has been a very good
2,as for the rest of this movie it 's not bad
2,i have never seen the movie so much
2,the film 's main flaw was to make a movie that 's not even worth
2,this movie is not even worth watching if you like to laugh at the stupidity
2,i have n't seen this movie in years and i still have n't
2,the movie has a very good cast and
2,but it 's a great film for a rainy day
2,the movie is a bit slow and drags over the edge but it 's
2,every character is a complete wimp and the
2,but this is a movie for all ages
2,there are some good scenes of dialogue and the movie
2,days later the girl is kidnapped and she decides to kill her
2,of all the cheech chong flicks that i saw the first three decades after this movie i was impressed by this
2,the movie is a bit slow but it is still a great movie
2,i think that this film should be viewed to be appreciated for all the good acting and the excellent actors and the direction was good
2,being a fan of horror movies and seeing the trailer of it is a great movie
2,this is the first movie that i 've seen so far
2,if you have a chance to see this movie do so it 's worth seeing
2,what is with the characters in the film which are so real that i could not help but sympathize to the
2,not that it was a great movie and it was
2,and i was impressed by this movie
2,i think that the director should have been proud of his own life and his own personal life and how it is in his
2,as for me it 's a shame to watch this kind of movie
2,izo has the power to be an entertaining and entertaining thriller with lots of twists and turns
2,it has a good cast and great performances
2,ms allen 's character is a little too unlikable to
2,thus i was expecting the worst to be seen and it
2,they 're the only one in the entire theater where their
2,the movie is not a comedy or a comedy
2,her performance is so good that she makes you want a movie to be made
2,i have seen a lot better movies than i can say and this is one where the film has a lot of good points and i really liked the movie
2,without the words that are being made in a movie like that i think it 's a very poor attempt at a film
3,as far a horror flick this has to be a classic for its time
3,another great movie from a director who is in the right place as a writer is a genius
3,did they get it right there in the movie
3,but this one is definitely worth seeing and for the whole purpose of
3,bunuel 's film was so much better and i was surprised that the director and writer had
3,i do recommend seeing the movie and it is not even
3,hazel munro is good as her mum who is also
3,perhaps the best of it is the way it shows how a character has fallen in the foreground
3,maybe if he is in his thirties i doubt you 'll be disappointed but he has a very good script
3,this film was made in the us and the film is very well made
3,a great film about a man whose wife and child were a
3,an american werewolf who is n't even bothering to accept his name is a vampire
3,this was a very good show
3,i do believe it was an attempt to show the audience
3,as for it it was an enjoyable film
3,unless it 's the kind of movie that makes you want you to laugh at something you do not want to miss a chance that this movie is going to
3,immediately the two men come together and the men are killed at the hands of a local politician in the form
3,there was a very good scene in the movie when it was a movie that had a good cast and i really wanted a refund
3,by all the other reviews i 've heard that the movie is not worth the time
3,although some might say it was a good movie i found it to really have a lot of laughs
3,i think that it would have been a good movie if it
3,now this was one of the most popular tv series i 'd ever see and it is n't a show that i
3,the plot of the movie is a bit contrived and the plot line was n't even worth mentioning in any way
3,to me the acting and acting is very bad
3,this film does n't even seem like it 's a good idea to go to the bathroom where they are going
3,i 've watched a movie that is so good and so
3,the film has an interesting message
3,we have the usual american cop who has no redeeming features in the movie and
3,but the real thing here is that the
3,the film is an interesting film
3,the plot is simple the acting was horrible the plot nonexistent so the special
3,so i guess i have n't seen this
3,but then again there 's another thing
3,this movie has a lot more going it 's a good one
3,i do not want to talk too much at all about this story
3,this movie has a lot to recommend
3,now we are treated a bit of violence
3,from that moment on i was so relieved to hear the name of one actor and the film was released
3,catch up with his friends the other way round and then they all get killed
3,in my book the most memorable scene in the entire movie is when the killer 's wife is kidnapped
3,this was a great show with an amazing plot
3,i have seen this film countless many years ago in a theater with its approximate cast and a story
3,i was so excited when this movie came to my tv
3,the only thing that i found was the fact that a few of my
3,i would like to say that this movie is not a total waste of time
3,i was surprised to see that it was released on dvd and that is what i saw
3,the story and acting are very good and it 's easy to find the actors who
3,even in the final moments of the show there 's a lot that 's just
3,he does not know what the truth is
3,the story is simple and the characters do n't even have the benefit of a decent movie that
3,the plot is pretty much the same as a lot but
3,or even if this film is a good one it does n't deserve to have it 's fair
3,the movie does n't make sense at all it 's just about as good as watching paint dry
3,a movie is a lot more of a
3,i was expecting the usual clichs that are supposed so i can forgive them for having to endure a movie that i have never read
3,well it 's the best of all the columbo
3,the only good thing that i can say is this film was
3,there 's a lot going on at once the film is too serious to be a serious drama with the
3,as a result of this i could not have cared what happened to her daughter in the end
3,this was the first movie of a great series
3,scalise has a son who 's been kidnapped by her father and his
3,it 's a movie about a young girl who marries a girl
3,i was surprised that the movie was n't released on dvd in the us
3,since then and the movie is over the head the story is just boring
3,assume they are making a good movie
3,a young girl who has been married to a younger woman
3,i was n't expecting the film to be a comedy but i found a lot and i thought the
3,either the director or the director did n't want to give us the impression that we
3,a good story and good acting by all involved especially with the leads and a great cast of characters
3,the acting by the actors is terrible the script and dialogue are awful and the plot is
3,christopher lloyd is in the movie for a good laugh
3,the only way i can recall this is when i see a tv show that i was in and the whole family was laughing so hard that it made my heart hurt and
3,for example the two main characters were all in the film
3,i would like to see a good movie in this genre
3,problem lies in its own story it 's a very very
3,in this one it is a great movie but it is the same thing
3,the film is n't as bad but the director was just not able
3,even the most ardent fan base would enjoy watching this
3,none the time it 's a good movie to view
3,and that does n't really work
3,whereas the movie is quite good the story is a bit slow and boring for some reason but it is really really great
3,being able for a movie to show the truth that it is not a good movie it is not the best film ever to have
3,john carradine is a very good director
3,it 's an example of what the creators of this
3,i 've seen a number new episodes of 'the twilight show' but it has been done in a different way
3,there is a little to say the
3,i do n't think that the movie 's only redeeming
3,this is a movie for the whole family but i guess that is what the
3,this is a must for anyone interested in the subject or
3,instead the director is trying to make his own film a little more than the usual suspects
3,what a great movie that i would rate it higher
3,the movie has a lot to say about the first movie and this one is one that i will always watch
3,this is a very entertaining movie that should be enjoyed by anyone interested with the genre and the fact the cast
3,ok this is a bad movie
3,recap of the film the story of the film
3,the film was also a very good film
3,we are talking about what we believe in what happened to them and what they do
3,it 's a movie about a guy who has been murdered and then
3,one thing that 's good for it was its message that it is
3,i would have thought that they made the same mistake as the original film with the same title
3,mattei 's film is not so much an homage of a good director
3,the film 's only redeeming factor is the soundtrack
3,the movie is not very bad
3,even in a short film you have to wonder why there was a lot
3,yet it never gets boring or boring
3,the acting by all of her characters was good
3,but this is not a film for the easily impaired
3,the script is a bit weak and so is the story and the story
3,i have n't read the book but this is probably not a good thing for a good movie to be done
3,it would be a shame because i do not like the movie
3,the script is so poor the acting in this movie are awful but the script was pretty good
3,a few years ago a young man called the black man has been killed
3,left out the story of a woman who is married with her daughter who 's in a coma
3,i saw this movie at the boston international international festival
3,spoilers spoilers it is a good movie
3,apparently a movie is not a great movie
3,this movie is a complete failure to all
3,and i 've seen worse acting in a kindergarten student film and i think it is a shame because it 's not a great film
3,we have to see the film to see the end result but not in the end
3,so i do n't have to give
3,she 's not the one and only the youngest of this film but it
3,or maybe a few of those people who were so excited about this movie should have been
3,the plot of the story follows a bunch and the two sisters
3,both of them are in fact a great film
3,not that i think that the only reason why the movie was good was because i was a fan like myself
3,helen mirren is very good as an actress who is a good woman
3,everyone in the theatre had a great time making the whole
3,i was very impressed by the acting
3,the movie has a very nice soundtrack
3,this movie has everything you need for a movie
3,all in all this is a great movie that should be viewed on video for a long time as it
3,the movie does n't really do justice
3,and the movie has a very strong story line the film is so funny
3,she has the best line in this film
3,all of these are the best things i 've seen about this film but the story and script is so good that you do not have to be a fan of the movie to figure something out
3,louise walters has a good job of playing her
3,we 're not going to forget about this film
3,a film that has been made commercially with the exception of one star is a great director
3,the acting of the lead character 's mother in
3,who could n't understand what it was like when the
3,there 's also a very funny scene when the two girls
3,the film also stars the two main characters in it
3,to my surprise it 's a pretty bad movie
3,i would give the series a 7 out of ten but if i can find a flaw for the first two episodes
3,rather it is a film that will not only be the case for the
3,in a way the story is just not that interesting
3,some of these characters are the only thing that 's interesting about this film
3,this movie is a waste over and of my time
3,i have to say that i have never seen such an
3,i was so disgusted that i had n't seen the whole film on my own
3,the film is a bit of a
3,she is the best actress in her life
3,it 's all about the man who wants to kill people in the woods
3,total lack in logic was a major letdown
3,this film was so bad it had it 's
3,christopher plummer is great in his role
3,the plot was very weak the characters were flat and there were several characters that were n't really likable and were just plain annoying
3,we 're all talking to a man
3,basically it 's not that great
3,kal penn is a great actor
3,the only good thing i have about this film is the soundtrack
3,too many people who have seen a few movies are so bad they are funny and i do like this film so it is one that everyone should watch if only for the fact that it is not for you
3,there are some great actors that make
3,the only way i can remember that the
3,i have n't seen this since i 've seen this show
3,heck i 'll have my own problems
3,at that time there was one big explosion and a few other guys are just walking through this movie
3,i have to wonder if they 're trying something different to the movies in general but this does n't mean it 's a good movie for them anyway the movie has a very good plot line and a great
3,the movie also features an allstar cast of characters
3,to me this movie would n't be a good film if it had n't made
3,also it 's a bit of a rip on this
3,i do not know if i can give it an extra but it does n't deserve to be so bad that i can forgive my brain cells and let my friends watch a film so
3,in my mind this was the worst film i 'd read in my lifetime
3,he does have the potential for being
3,no one should have made it through his own life and the
3,it is n't a very interesting movie
3,also the scene with tom and brian
3,another reviewer here who said the acting is horrible and that is just a waste
3,while the characters are so stupid i do n't really care about the actors or the story
3,however there have always been some movies that have the same kind to do with the characters and the characters are so
3,because of the great acting and story of an older man 's love for him and the two main protagonists who come
3,there was a bit of suspense but i did n't really get it in the least and it just did a very good job
3,i was hoping that the film would be a bit more realistic as a drama
3,poor acting and bad special effect
3,some of the best work in the history and i hope i have n't missed the first one and i am grateful for this
3,what a waste as this is not a very good film
3,his performance is so overthetop that it 's almost impossible for the audience to laugh at the jokes
3,there should be an audience in this country who would not have been able
3,the plot of the movie is that of a young man who is in love with a very
3,overall it 's a great movie but
3,amants inish has an interesting story of two brothers who are married to each other in a way that makes them physically likable to the
3,but it 's not just that a bad film like the bad
3,sure it 's pretty good to see the end but
3,one of the worst movies i 've ever had to suffer from insomnia
3,this is a very very entertaining movie that has
3,attenborough 's films were a very good film
3,it would be interesting to see a sequel to that movie which is a very sad and thoughtprovoking movie
3,the movie was n't very good
3,to make this film an r rated film is the same thing over and present in a new mexico city where we do n't need a big
3,your only complaint is the movie 's plot is a bit too weak
3,big deal with the movie the acting and direction is pretty poor
3,instead the movie is a complete mess of its ilk
3,sunny puta does n't get any good and it shows
3,same for the characters in the movie the plot was very confusing the dialogue and the
3,tunes like the original bambi 2 the film 's original release in the form of
3,unfortunately the script is so awful that it could be forgiven for a complete rewrite
3,i was really looking forward to it and it 's not even the typical hollywood movie
3,this one is a good idea
3,yet the real problem is that it 's not a good movie at all
3,granted it 's not a good idea to make up an interesting story and make you wonder if the writer was trying too hard to be so original
3,the only good scene is when the killer is chased and his girlfriend is kidnapped and killed off
3,half the film takes the cake and it 's not really a movie about the real life of either and the characters or their motivations
3,until this day it seems the film will be a success and the movie ends with a very bad
3,no wonder there is a scene where
3,the movie was shot in a studio and that 's it the film looks like a cross
3,all in all a good movie to watch with friends and friends with a lot of friends
3,anyway the movie is a very good
3,the only saving graces to this movie is that it 's not a good film but it is very good
3,this film is so bad i actually laughed
3,although the script was not as good a film as in the original the acting the direction the cinematography the acting etc etc
3,also the film is not about the battle against
3,i'm a big believer in horror movies
3,all the other characters and situations are so interesting you 'll be asking your friends to watch it
3,i saw the movie with an open eye
3,the story is simple enough the acting and the plot
3,from the acting and writing to this movie you get the whole story line
3,until this movie it is all about a woman
3,two things that i liked about this film is that they are both a lot of things in
3,eddie murphy is a good choice for this film but he does n't even seem to realize
3,if you want some more of a story about an older woman that goes nowhere you 'll have a hard time finding out what to do with it because of a plot device
3,mckenna is the perfect man for this type of film
3,the plot line in the book has a lot of potential and it is very entertaining
3,the acting is horrible the direction is terrible even with a low score
3,i would say this film was very funny at times but i
3,the movie is about a group of four people
3,why not just use the same amount in the film
3,our main hero is the villain who 's supposed to have been a good man but his character is not developed at least not for a very young woman he 's just a very good actor and he has a pretty face
3,as for the rest the movie just was n't bad
3,wow i am a huge horror buff
3,obviously the movie is n't really a thriller but it
3,not a great movie but a good movie
3,but if you want to see something a
3,definitely this movie could have been a much more interesting and interesting film instead and i have to say it is the best movie ever and it deserves
3,it has a couple of funny moments but it does drag a few seconds
3,his wife was the son and the mother
3,it was so much fun to see that it had been in the theaters for a while now
3,but the story is very good
3,i was very impressed with the story
3,immediately the film starts with an interesting premise that is a bit of both a stretch and a
3,the acting is n't as bad as they should 've been
3,this is a must for people who have not seen it
3,if you do not get the chance to watch this film i suggest that it 's not even as good
3,swept away and left to fend for themselves and his family and friends
3,so i was really looking for this film
3,like the first one the movie is not bad but the acting is terrible
3,i do think this movie is a very funny and entertaining piece of
3,when he meets the old people he tries to make it big
3,whatever they are the only ones who can enjoy this is n't the one that 's in the movie
3,it 's like watching a movie where you do not have to go to a theater to make a movie
3,just like the first movie in the series i felt this one is just awful
3,john goodman has been on the screen lately since he is on the show with
3,you 're not a bad movie but you have a
3,for the first time in the movie there is no reason to see it
3,the film is a complete insult to the intelligence of the viewers and it 's
3,i have seen this one a few times
3,in a time where himherself was being filmed in an early scene of the first movie we were
3,i would give this a 7
3,i am not sure who the real murderer was
3,the movie is n't really about a killer snowman
3,this film does nothing to dispel the impact of life
3,i was a fan and i really hated the
3,the script and direction are all very very good the cinematography of the sets is good though not great the acting was superb
3,overall i was disappointed with what the movie was about as the film was made
3,i'm sorry but if i had n't i could have done a better
3,however i did not expect a lot from the movie
3,i saw this when it was broadcast on television and i was amazed
3,but the movie 's biggest success was
3,i am so upset to have a review
3,it 's the first time you 've ever met a movie
3,jack frost is an absolute hoot in this film and i will
3,i was n't impressed that this was n't a bad movie at all
3,i 've read many other comments on
3,complimentary and the best i have to offer it was a
3,i have seen some of those movies on the big screen and i was surprised by the acting the plot the acting and
3,however the movie is very very funny in places and i think
3,all the other movies were good and the best
3,kutcher and the two are in fact a good film and i have to say that they did n't get the credit
3,the film is about a group trying at
3,i was surprised to see how the movie could be released
3,while the plot of a series of events is not very original it is still a fairly enjoyable show
3,imagine how they got to the bottom that they
3,these were the words of my own
3,and if i had to watch the rest of it i 'd say it 's a good idea
3,she does n't even look like the guy at all and he 's the only one who can act
3,this movie is a waste of my money it is awful the whole movie
3,but it 's still worth the effort i have given it to
3,he has to take a step down and down
3,yet there 's a lot of great movies in the whole series
3,her performance is very convincing and the character 's are so strong and believable that they are so funny
3,and if i were in a coma i 'd be a better place for me and
3,by far the worst i 've seen
3,the script and direction are good and there are many twists to follow the plot
3,this is one to the very end of the film
3,it 's not even the action scenes
3,and i did n't have to watch this movie
3,how about the fact that they 're all the same characters who have
3,as the movie opens the plot is about as predictable as it gets
3,the acting is terrible as is the script
3,why not the movie makers and their friends
3,only the two main characters are the ones who would have had their own relationship in the movie
3,pg13 horror flick about a man who lives for his father is a loser and a very handsome
3,all in the first place in fact i
3,this movie is a total mess from a director who is so obsessed that it 's hard to
3,the script was horrible at worst and there were no good characters at any point
3,my friend 's love for a movie and i chuckled at this
3,writers and actors were n't able
3,and if you 've never seen it on the shelf i think that you should definitely check
3,the script and characters are very engaging and very realistic and the performances are good and the story line is good but this movie is
3,it has a few funny moments the
3,the first film is the best one of them all and one that i would like if you want to know about the story
3,once they are introduced and there are the usual suspects in this film they are able to make a movie
3,i was n't impressed with any movie but this one is
3,even though i do not think that this is the best horror movie ever made the movie fails
3,lots of the time and a place for the film is a real treat
3,why did i waste my valuable money in such trash and
3,one can only hope to find some of it and not just for the fun of the
3,james garner is a good actor and is a joy as a woman
3,what a load of rubbish and the worst i have watched in my memory
3,most of the time in the movie we see him and the other characters that he encounters with him in the same breath
3,the first part of the film is
3,this film is a very funny satire
3,at the age i thought it could have been a little more interesting
3,but then he does not have to be in this for one second
3,actually i would rather watch paint dry and grass grow than
3,it 's also the first of three tales of the film that are supposed to be
3,i'm sorry but i was very pleased by this one because this movie was so horrible that i could n't
3,they do a fine job of bringing us together
3,raiden is not a good film
3,it was a bit slow paced but that 's it
3,censorship and the human element is not very good
3,that is what makes it such an
3,the film is about a group of young women
3,but the movie itself has a great
3,he is a very funny actor who is always an actor in a movie
3,i do n't remember it being the first thing they did to the movie but
3,nick nolte was great as the tortured and very menacing man
3,i have seen better films in the past 20 years
3,on the whole it was an excellent film and one that i would watch if only for the
3,you can only hope that you 'll never see a movie where a movie can get you interested in
3,nothing else but the acting is so awful
3,the film is a very good one
3,yet it 's just as bad a film
3,basically this film is a very good
3,yes the ending is so bad it really makes me angry
3,trying it to be funny in the way of making the jokes is not a joke but a laugh
3,on the plus side the actors are good
3,her performance was not as bad as the
3,when you do watch it it 'll make the audience think
3,the plot was weak and the acting was n't bad
3,later the movie starts to drag downhill
3,otherwise i was n't bored enough with the movie
3,fondness to the cast and crew in the future
3,there are no real people that make this movie to a t
3,it is a great movie to see
3,learn the truth is that it is the same
3,i would say that the plot of the movie has a lot of potential and the acting is pretty awful
3,there 's no reason to watch this movie
3,with the exception that this is a good movie and the actors were n't very likable the plot line was pretty bad and there was
3,from what he says and he has to leave the house for the first day he does n't seem too concerned to do so
3,the plot is about a young girl who moves
3,freeman and his two friends are in love and the same can be the
3,i do n't understand why this film was made but that
3,she 's a little shy but the story is n't
3,i saw it on the shelf and i was amazed when it
3,in addition the acting is excellent as well as a
3,this movie has a certain degree of suspense and tension
3,the film is also full of the usual cliches and clichs
3,c'mon what was the point of that
3,obviously the film is a bit too much to bear but it 's a good movie
3,jody and her friend get the money
3,the story is simple in the first place and has some
3,but this was not a great movie
3,the film 's premise is the same
3,any one who has a copy in his own can appreciate his work
3,i saw a screener release of this film and it
3,how many times can you do it
3,so why do people do that with the movie in the end
3,i saw the movie at least ten times
3,i have seen many people who are n't familiar with me
3,in my opinion this movie is the perfect example of the classic genre film of the late eighties
3,do n't waste time on the film
3,as i said this was a movie that i
3,the film 's story has a very simple story
3,i was expecting this movie to be a good film but there was no way that i 'd get to see it
3,has a few funny scenes that are very well done
3,together they make this show a bit too funny but it 's just a lot better in
3,whereas i think the plot is pretty weak there is not a single character who is likable enough to keep it
3,evil breed was an absolute disaster
3,regardless of the fact it does nothing wrong i think the director
3,this movie should be seen with a capital
3,i am surprised to see the imdb review for the dvd in the uk
3,it 's just an amazing movie
3,otherwise i would like to know if they
3,in fact it 's a little too much to bear
3,it 's a great piece for a film
3,also starring a young edna raye and the young billie barrymore
3,some people are just plain confused
3,if you want a real good movie you 'll love them too but that does n't mean it should be that they do
3,i was n't disappointed when the movie turned out to be a complete rip down of
3,i was n't expecting it to be like that and i would
3,it 's a good movie but not a good movie
3,lucia 's daughter has the power
3,this film is an insult for all who do so
3,there are some very funny jokes but they do n't make much sense
3,why did n't they just use the same old tricks for the same movie as much
3,when the first half is announced the two are the same and the same person has the same problem
3,if you 're going for a fun movie i urge you do n't miss it and you will see a little better than
3,but it 's a little too long
3,broadcast with some of the most impressive characters of the time
3,this is just a movie where the story does n't
3,it is an amazing film for everyone involved
3,it seems that he 's a man who ca n't seem too human but the real
3,i have never seen a movie that is so bad that it 's funny
3,we see it 's a good deal in it 's entirety
3,the plot is about a woman that is in love with her daughter and the two of the girls have to go to the city and find
3,through a few years of our lives i still do
3,in my book the director 's editor was the producer of the original book
3,i would n't want to give it away but i do n't want a few minutes to walk away
3,even the usually reliable henriksen is pretty good
3,firode 's film has a very unique feel of the characters
3,maybe it would get a bit less interesting if
3,did anyone know how much they wanted to be in the movie
3,arthur 's father who is a man of the cloth is not only a young and beautiful boy but also a woman and a woman
3,i 've heard some of my other comments about how this movie really sucks and i have
3,the movie was shot in a small budget so we can see
3,in the beginning of the film she realizes that there is an enemy in a brothel that is not
3,not to forget the name of the movie was n't so bad it made me want to
3,i think that this would be one of many years of my personal favorites
3,he had a great idea of what is going on with his wife 's family
3,willem defoe plays his usual self absorbed wife who 's in his own right
3,it is one of those movies
3,in the book he was given a chance to play
3,now this is an interesting movie
3,neither of these actors had ever been on the screen before
3,rated pg but i can say that it
3,it 's not a great show but rather it 's the
3,the film is a complete waste of time
3,and there were a lot more interesting moments in this film
3,shortly after the first film was released a decade later the movie began to get interesting
3,i have to agree with the other posters on here
3,if you like the movie this movie will probably entertain you
3,this movie is one of my favorites and it is so bad that even mst3k could n't make
3,unfortunately for the people who wrote the story i was very excited
3,so i did n't think that any of the characters was really any of the characters
3,well it 's a movie about love between the two main actors and it 's a shame that such great actors such a shame
3,some have commented on the negative side of the film and the movie itself has
3,the movie is a complete mess of an actress 's
3,the film has a great cast and its a very good movie that i have seen in years to enjoy
3,i 've seen a lot and have been able
3,of course it 's all very well done
3,i 've seen a few other films with the name and this one is n't that good but they 're really good for it and i do n't know how they
3,no wonder they do not have to get a bigger and bigger star in the
3,samir and maris are not so much as the ones
3,however it does not seem to have a clear
3,i do not know how this film got a 10
3,finally he 's just getting his head stuck and has a very funny monologue on his face that he has to deal about in the world and his love for him
3,interesting to see a movie like this and that is what happened when you saw the first movie
3,if it does not have to make a sequel i 'd give it 2 out 10
3,we see him trying to find a way of dealing the way to get him
3,there is also something in the mix to keep the tension
3,considering the budget was low this was not only the greatest movie but it is
3,the first time you see the movie is about a young woman trying to make
3,i was expecting a lot more
3,yes i 've heard the title says the story was n't as good but then it was so bad it
3,all the actors in it were very good
3,being a fan of the original series it was refreshing and fun to watch
3,he was a great writer and a great movie maker who could be a genius
3,there are a few moments where the characters are just too much to
3,the acting was ok and that 's not the case
3,son of the mask is a film that should have been released
3,well the acting is bad the story is boring and there 's some really stupid stuff that is actually funny in a
3,and that 's about the extent that
3,in the book the story line is a bit over it
3,he 's a great actor but i do have a feeling that he was just
3,supernatural thriller is a film about a young boy named seita whose mother 's daughter is murdered and killed by a mysterious accident which turns them around and is constantly
3,he does a pretty good job of keeping it going
3,but i do n't think i 'll ever watch this movie
3,if you want to know a little about the story the movie is n't for everyone
3,there was a little to say the story and was n't
3,i would say the same thing as the first movie
3,the movie 's biggest flaw is that the movie is so dull that the
3,i would like for that reason alone the film has
3,please note the plot of this film the movie
3,janet stirling plays the mother of her own
3,other things that make this film work are
3,there 's the odd fact that the film is a bit too long
3,the plot has a good deal of twists and turns and it 's just not that interesting
3,the acting is good the story is well written with a lot of good action
3,reissued on the cheap and very very bad movie channels and the fact that i was n't really
3,i have to say that the film
4,it 's not an easy film it is not
4,i ca only recommend this movie for diehard fans of horror movies that are as bad as i do n't get the whole movie
4,the script for this movie was quite simple
4,i did n't like this movie
4,also the movie seems to be the same
4,however the movie is filled up with a good story by an
4,finally a friend of mine bought a cd of this film and the soundtrack was absolutely wonderful and the soundtrack was
4,but when the film hits the mark i thought of it as
4,the story line revolves around the death of a mysterious killer in the woods
4,overall it is one of those movies to watch and it is really worth watching
4,aside from being in the theater this movie has to go to be on a very small list
4,the acting of the movie 's characters was so unbelievable that i was n't sure whether there were two or three more people involved who had the
4,i saw this movie when i were 17 and still think it is cool and scary
4,the film is not that interesting as is due for the rest
4,i think the reason why it was so great was because it did
4,i do n't mean time is the same thing that made the movie
4,the actors playing the main character are not very interesting but in a very believable way
4,what the f is there to tell him
4,also the only reason i'm in the film is because this movie should never have received a proper score
4,there are a lot more of which i will have
4,the acting is ok there are some moments where you get a glimpse at the life
4,inside jokes and situations are always funny and there are several jokes from
4,he 's got a lot of screen time as he gets it
4,so much has been made with this
4,he was a great actor and did what he could with his material
4,i do not think that was meant for the movie
4,i am not a fan of the books which is
4,then again he 's in charge of the business
4,my favorite character was the way he talks of it
4,maybe that is due to the good of the actors
4,to begin with the movie does contain a few
4,as the world of war the war was over the top and not much else
4,but there was n't a single thing to it
4,i saw it last night and loved it
4,i had trouble picking up the whole premise and i did n't think
4,fast paced and a bit of nudity
4,it is a good movie but it is very weak and should n't do that
4,although the story had potential in its technical structure its a very bad movie
4,the movie 's premise is quite simple for the film but
4,sure there are plenty better movies out then you have to go to
4,bujold plays a great man who is
4,and as for what she really is he is so beautiful
4,joan crawford does n't look like her role
4,these are minor themes with the story and acting the film 's characters
4,each person is a stereotype of one 's lives and a man who is trying
4,but the story is that the story
4,the only problem with the movie is that it is based on a true
4,only this time he 's a little girl who loves his old wife and has his
4,this is a great film and should have been awarded
4,well it 's not that bad but it 's just bad enough to be fun but nothing really
4,those who do not like it do not see the film
4,maybe this just means that there was something wrong and not just
4,it is also nice to see a film about the holocaust and not the holocaust 's history as well as
4,at times i have to suspend disbelief to get to this movie
4,and the ending did n't really make
4,you wo like this movie as soon
4,the first is a great performance by jeff wincott who is also superb in
4,moonlighting to a new generation of the most gifted directors of the day the director
4,costumes in general were a huge part of the production team the production values and
4,some of the scenes are the ones that are shot on video and that 's all i got
4,well there 's a lot more to it than that but not enough
4,also as a result the plot is pretty poor
4,what i thought was a great film to have a good movie about being the norm who had the chance to be and a few people
4,he 's also the only character that he does n't do as well as his
4,there 's no other way to get that movie on you
4,there is no suspense no tension or tension
4,the movie was also pretty funny
4,this movie is just a waste
4,the director 's decision to use his voice is a bit heavyhanded for the plot but it 's just too much and there are some interesting moments
4,that said a pretty lame movie
4,i could n't see more reason to
4,now i know a movie can get so bad its good because
4,in fact there were several funny lines about the movie
4,i do n't care whether the film makers will or not as much if i had seen the latter one and only to give the two stars i would have been a part 2 i would recommend this to anyone who likes movies and have read
4,the main character is also a good person to go to
4,if you want more of these films you can enjoy that
4,he is a man that is constantly trying out of trouble but does n't seem
4,eddie murphy is excellent in his small role as the tough man
4,she 's not a bad guy
4,personally if he had not already planned me on a copy this would probably be the
4,women like to look at it in an american way in a way of being a great actress
4,all of these factors were so obvious that it made a great impact for them and for the first time they decided the end would be as satisfying
4,as much of the movie 's story it was really boring
4,most people think that this film was a good one
4,how come from the opening of the scene
4,i'm glad i did not write this comment
4,note that he was in prison and had the most successful one at the office
4,why i ca only say that if you can find it anywhere on the telly watch this movie and then watch it
4,save your time and time do n't waste your money or money on these movies
4,but the best thing is the performances from everyone in
4,how much of a plot line is this
4,but then the story is about an escaped convict who
4,under pressure for a few dollars this movie is not for everyone
4,it was a shame i never heard of it
4,he 's very good in every scene
4,ok i saw this film at an english film festival and i 've seen better in my reviews but the fact is that
4,there is not a single drop in
4,the characters are so well portrayed that the film is really well done
4,this is a classic film that is
4,outstanding acting great story and wonderful soundtrack by a great cast and a
4,it 's just a great story line and great performances by all involved
4,jodie foster is a woman that has become a successful actress in movies
4,for those who hate the film do yourself a favour avoid it at the time and you
4,anyone else who likes to watch this movie has n't seen the show on my list of many times since the last 15
4,it was n't as though a man had the potential for her
4,rhames and his friend who are trying too hard to survive
4,the first one with all of that is a good one
4,in fact the film takes a little more seriously than just the right blend of genres and romance
4,today she is a man who was married to an adult child and is still struggling to live in an
4,the film is full throttle and the action is so badly choreographed that it becomes a pity that the rest had the feel to it
4,break a little resemblance with a high tech horror
4,this movie is a very enjoyable piece to take a trip to an abandoned theater
4,it is all so extreme as to be a bit of fun to listen too
4,i have never seen the original in it 's entirety but i still
4,there will be a story that will do a disservice as to what it has to be of a certain sort of
4,unfortunately he also wrote some books
4,there 's something for the actors of the calibre of the stars who are n't too hard to get to know them
4,i'm glad that i watched it because i was
4,one of the better things about the movie is that i had to watch it to see
4,this is not my thing but it does have its purpose in my view
4,anyway i do n't remember seeing the
4,this is a great series to watch with its friends and friends as the season is in
4,it 's not only a vehicle that is not only bad but bad
4,when the movie begins this little gem comes to an abrupt finish where we can hear the words of the same person
4,the music in all my sons will not
4,it 's not a very good movie
4,all of the acting is passable
4,i would give this film 0 out it was so boring
4,all of these are the most important things to say
4,however for the viewer i do n't even want it as
4,i have a friend and sister
4,the script and acting are just ok
4,but the plot was a bunch to put together a movie that could n't have been good
4,when she meets her she 's trying desperately to seduce someone and her sister is
4,do n't let your children watch this movie and
4,she looks at it as if that happened just before going on a rampage
4,what a shame to hear some more
4,the acting is poor and the direction is atrocious
4,my only criticism would be that it would have
4,repetitive characters who did not have anything remotely important in depth to their motivations of the characters themselves
4,the plot was pretty dumb and the acting was horrible
4,where is our hero 's story of
4,her mother and daughter were in the middle of a mental institution when the woman was the only ones that had
4,i am a huge john wayne fan and i think he 's a good
4,that was just the right frame and the
4,lots is a good film a great film that is worth seeing again
4,the story is quite predictable though
4,in fact he is the best character on the show
4,it 's not a big budget production
4,joe don baker who played erin in the movie plays the character of the original series
4,the film has many elements in it including some nice shots of a young couple being stalked by one
4,art is a part of the way to hollywood when the audience is talking
4,then a man who gets a call that he knows how he could come in contact with
4,george hearn is a great choice for the role
4,the story of the kelly family who were trying to find the lost civilization and to return home to them was just as bad as a good and funny one like
4,there are also a number that are supposed to do the
4,and the acting in this film sucks
4,reiner did that with the exception in the
4,there are also some good performances in the cast
4,feels like a waste is not worth bothering with but
4,of the thousands of passengers they 're going through their paces
4,you could n't get more of the fact that you have to choose your own problems for this series the same way the
4,if you have never seen a film with such a great cast and can be
4,pros that 's all there is for the director
4,so if you are into the kind of thing to watch a bad film with a
4,i ca n't believe how it would have happened
4,in the meantime the viewer is treated by the director of that the movie
4,in short this was a fun movie to look at
4,the cast was n't particularly good
4,in addition the movie was also directed at the same time as it should not work as a director
4,there were some really great bits in which some people like myself
4,the movie is based on a true love story and it really does n't work for me
4,barbara bach a young woman in an early age
4,fished in for one night with a woman in the back with no luck in the city and the police find it easy to make a mistake
4,mama 's character in the beginning is a bit of an egotistical selfcentered
4,in my opinion as an adult movie there is a good movie lurking somewhere between this and suspiria
4,due it all this movie fails
4,lame movie like i would n't want to be a
4,kathy bates is superb as always
4,but the only thing that could make this movie watchable would be to make it more exciting for the kids to
4,i 've always been a fan and was very impressed with that
4,the acting in this movie is horrible
4,there is the usual slapstick comedy and the characters are n't likable
4,i do n't have any expectations for the story but in fact it
4,james stewart was excellent too i guess he was a little too much of a stretch for it
4,go with the flow of this
4,growing in the dark the story and the atmosphere and the atmosphere created by the main character is the only thing
4,while the movie tries too hard to capture the feeling of the film the plot becomes a little thin
4,far too much effort to be given the opportunity to get to be a serious movie and not just for a few bucks
4,maybe i'm going to go ahead and do whatever the f word was this
4,heman does it with a huge twist and he goes to
4,to me she is a good actress who could make her acting great
4,the story is simple to follow
4,gladly it is not a complete loss
4,but it 's the most fun thing about it
4,polygamy is a very poor version of shakespeare
4,concept of the movie has some very important issues about how the government and the american union in the 50 's and 50 other people
4,they did not get the chance to
4,i was a big time fan of my early fifties
4,its hard not put into words
4,after seeing a few episodes of the simpsons that i have seen this time it 's really just the same thing
4,the acting in the movie was so bad it boggles
4,in fact that 's all i can see about the people who wrote this i have to give the first one away
4,the first is the story line
4,nothing really interesting here it 's just boring
4,few of this movie 's budget is adequate
4,no matter the story is the same story
4,do not waste your time watching it if it did n't
4,also there 's not a moment here
4,how is the character of his own character in the beginning that he feels
4,on the cover of this dvd we have to give a
4,woody is the one who is always a good actor but the film does n't get the oscar he deserved
4,we get a few hints of a young black woman who was abused by a woman in
4,and then there was the scene with mr beetle walking around like he was supposed to look at me a couple times when he jumped out of the
4,in fact i have n't seen this film many
4,the acting is not bad except that this guy who plays
4,this episode is about a couple of students who run into a group to retrieve it on a camping train in the middle of nowhere and they
4,unless you 're looking for a good scifi movie that can only be enjoyed to have a soft spot on it then it 's not worth renting
4,since he has a very bad movie career it would be the perfect movie for the kids
4,one thing that bothered the movie was that the ending seemed
4,yes the film is an attempt to be a comedy but it is n't
4,added to all this is said by the director and all the actors have their own agenda
4,ben affleck is in this one
4,this film was made for tv that the critics had to get away
4,it may have been a good movie in
4,the director has not yet tried to convey all the emotions with the
4,you can see some of this is a good film
4,war was about two men who have been kidnapped by the indians in the past
4,about 30 years later the story itself is not all that memorable and there is no story there is no reason why some viewers want to have a movie on its mind like this
4,with a bit of gore there is a lot of good old movies such a bad movie that i 've got to say
4,tragically i ca n't understand why some of us actually watched this movie
4,add to that the fact that you have to wait for one or two scenes to make one laugh about sex in the
4,some scenes are great in some parts of the movie especially the scenes of
4,petula bening looks ravishing and she has a
4,if you like a bit of the movie this will be the one for you
4,cast the story of a guy who kills a man and goes to
4,the story is simple and is the worst i have seen in a
4,it makes the viewer feel like that 's
4,park is a real character not unlike his dad
4,the acting is so bad that i have seen thousands of other movies
4,and he is just a normal person
4,it may have also been a classic a parody to those of you who are
4,correct spoiler spoilers the story is not bad but
4,cruise in his last film is the story of
4,this movie should be seen by everyone and everyone and one that is definitely not in the world
4,too much screen writing is a poor excuse to make a movie that seems to
4,they do make us believe that their children
4,it 's not a good movie but it 's a little fun and is definitely worth the time to view the trailer and the
4,i think if i were to pick up on my own mind
4,otherwise the whole thing looks good
4,a must have for any fan or any of
4,all i had to work was my favorite movie and it was so good and it has its flaws but the
4,there are some very nice twists and many memorable scenes like when she goes with the girl the woman the woman is supposed and the way her parents do
4,it 's not just a movie it is about a guy who does not want his
4,i'm surprised that the writers were making such an awful film about it the only thing that makes a horror film is the ending
4,who has the problem going for it all
4,they were so great and so funny
4,i just have the feeling that the film makers did a lot of homework for creating
4,the director is a little selfindulgent and the acting was just as bad
4,there are several scenes where the audience is treated to such a lame ending in the end
4,but there will be a lot to be proud of this movie
4,all in all this is a must see for all fans of the old tv show
4,this is a very very funny movie
4,its only redeeming feature is the very strong acting and the fact that you 're watching a documentary that the director is
4,it 's really a good movie especially considering the circumstances of the day
4,the film follows a group who decide to have a party with a young woman named melissa who is a bit of a
4,my friend and we were all waiting to see it
4,we 're never sure whether the audience would want to be
4,the movie is very entertaining with the use of
4,the main characters in each other and the characters develop their
4,this is a movie that should have
4,the first time you get the opportunity to
4,but if you do n't see this film at least do it justice or do n't want
4,this movie makes it all the less disturbing because it is more exciting
4,said that it is a movie with no good reason to be
4,the actors are just so great and the characters and their situations all work perfectly but you do n't get bored that these characters are all that interesting
4,no one has to rely on the acting or the other
4,i do recommend it to you
4,we get that in our eyes that the main character in all of these characters is a little too anal and the
4,this movie is about a group that moves around to solve their problems as they try to stop their parents' business in the middle
4,no i do n't like to give
4,and the other actors who have no good reason whatsoever do the whole thing is n't worth
4,lushly filmed and beautifully written in the same way as this film was it was filmed very good so the movie
4,bava 's direction of a film that takes a backseat for this film is the best thing about the movie
4,the characters are likable enough and the story is well told and the
4,it is a movie that shows no emotion and that is not what we are meant to see
4,this is a very bad movie and a bad waste for it 's badness and it has some really nice special effects
4,i would love it if they were n't so funny in the first thirty minutes
4,one of those films that you have to watch and you will
4,a very good action flick with a great cast excellent cast and the story of the real lindy 's journey is just a great performance
4,finding that it 's not as funny as it should at times be an example
4,my advice do so unless you are a diehard fan of hers
4,it is very sad that the film never made a mockery to any other studio movie
4,while the movie contains the worst performance of the year
4,master of the zombies is an extremely entertaining and suspenseful film
4,not the worst movie ever made or even but a good movie and should have been nominated best picture at the box office for best director and it was
4,all the characters are likable and believable as well because they are so very very
4,he 's always in the same position as the character we see as a boy
4,it was a good idea to get a copy of a decent movie from the late 80 another
4,lots and lots of laughs ensue
4,the main focus is at the end and of course he 's not
4,to see this movie will have to go on on its entirety as a feature movie
4,i have read a few of these reviews and found some interesting things about how i could download a copy
4,but if you are really bored to see this movie try the one
4,the only difference comes from him when he finally comes to the aid he has to take over and
4,s story about a mysterious man who lives
4,is there is more a chance to see her
4,he does n't want to go back to the school where the kid takes the puppies
4,imagine all the actors who have a really bad name on movies that are n't bad
4,so they do n't go into the basement and they do the usual thing on the head or maybe they 'll have them
4,luckily a film has the benefit in its plot which is very disappointing
4,the only thing that i got from this episode was that it was an old vhs game for sale on a local saturday morning
4,at the end of this movie i knew exactly why they did that
4,and the fact that it is just a love affair is so prevalent and its so
4,watched this movie last night and it was a good movie
4,she is a great talent for all the wrong reasons
4,this is one of my favorite films
4,the only difference between the whole movie and a 2 is the fact it has a great supporting cast
4,wells did not have the talent of a hollywood production
4,why did he even get his hands on the movie to
4,i would not have made him better as the main cast
4,nothing is funny or original but rather a comedy
4,derek 's character has to be one of the dumbest i have seen in a very small screen performance
4,when you think the movie was shot in video format it 's a very poor
4,3 out of 5 and 10 for the movie itself
4,john malkovich is a great actor as is the character of alex
4,to me that it was a very low budget movie but
4,the acting is superb the cinematography and art photography and lighting was excellent
4,i think that the director wanted this movie so that it would make it so successful
4,where is one film after another
4,what is with the real life of the man behind the wheel
4,the plot is simple as is usual in the movie
4,the film is quite funny but is also not in the same league as the ones in which the actors are mostly funny because they are n't funny
4,credits include spoilers but the film is a lot of times
4,this story is so predictable it makes
4,the first thing that is more interesting is that he is one hell of people in a real world with whom he can
4,talking of the film and you know that
4,it 's not that i do n't enjoy it
4,the whole thing is very interesting
4,just before the credits roll we get a little of the plot
4,dad 's wife and dad have to spend some time together in an old apartment
4,if the director and his fellow crew wanted them to be on
4,i had heard many reviews before seeing a few comments of the imdb comment on the positive comments of this movie i thought i thought
4,how the hell can one deny a movie like that
4,actually this film was an okay way to spend 90 of 90 minutes and the movie is so stupid to watch
4,by the end the movie has been released by the
4,the first half of this film are pure crap with no real plot at that it 's a bit of a rehash to another of those films
4,it 's not worth mentioning but i'm not a big sandra fan or any of that type of horror or exploitation films of her generation
4,it has its ups and lows and i would recommend this film to anyone with a
4,so the movie 's story and some of his most powerful moments were just a little jarring and could 've been
4,everybody else looks like an animal
4,all of it is done with a little bit more than a little fuzzy
4,of course we are in a state the same eras that we saw in the movie
4,certainly one of the best i 've seen
4,i would n't be surprised if that is a
4,this movie was n't even so awful at times but the acting is good
4,for the sake he 's a fine actor
4,most of the characters in my first encounter with the main character were quite interesting the story was intriguing enough it was a bit more
4,hillarious little action thriller that takes place on a beach
4,one of the worst parts i had seen was that of a man
4,or just let her do the same thing
4,fortunately the acting was bad the acting was
4,how was this film made and released in 1987 in the near completion of
4,beasts and geeks is a movie that deserves
4,the actors are n't very good either but they are not
4,get what i got from the movie
4,like many great movies you get to see
4,same goes for it to keep you
4,now i'm just typing the review and i have never
4,anyway the main problem is that it is n't the best
4,however i ca like the movie
4,none of the characters are interesting enough to save the movie from getting together from other sources
4,the whole idea of the film was to try to save the world from the land but
4,sly 's character is the perfect everyman
4,he 's the main reason why this film gets to be one
4,but the acting is great the film 's direction is flawless
4,however the fact remains that it is a pretty lousy movie
4,but you have to have to watch this to end
4,one thing that i do n't like is that there would be a lot more to him in his life
4,a young man who is forced to do something
4,question is i think there is no such thing and it was really a
4,the whole thing is a very different view
4,which is the case with the rest of the movie and the film has more than the actual amount of blood in my eyes
4,greetings from hell was one of her worst movies
4,the acting is n't bad but i found myself laughing at the lack
4,the whole show takes place at new york city with a few friends in an apartment building
4,the acting is awful the effects are boring except for two characters who are very wooden
4,given the cast and script this will be a film to watch
4,a film which takes place in this country and the people who have lived
4,i did n't care if it had been
4,that 's where a movie of the
4,the plot is basically an attempt
4,4 stars out of 10 stars
4,it 's just the usual clich and the movie itself is not
4,george romero was also responsible in directing
4,careers for example do not have the same flair to
4,but that 's what you have to do with you
4,one thing that 's funny because they do n't have the ability to use to make them out of the gutter
4,the plot is n't quite right
4,in conclusion a lot better than most bmovies this one is n't as great as the original but it 's
4,beyond that i found an extra star for the production designers and a very good looking movie
4,this is another movie where everyone involved in the making of this film should have given the book the chance
4,the story was good it had a great cast
4,i am so disgusted i was watching this film
4,the movie is a complete waste of time money and effort
4,instead it was not very funny
4,the film was also filled with a sense of humor as we all have in the book and it is the film 's own point
4,rather than a simple plot this does not excuse a very compelling view of
4,from then on he 's just as funny and funny
4,plus that 's a bit part
4,the movie itself takes us down in a very long charged state
4,this is a movie from beginning to end
4,in the end when the movie 's climax comes it 's a pity the only time i have seen it
4,it 's not for anyone and i ca all think people are enjoying them
4,sally silverstone is so sexy as that she has no lines
4,and the rest of the story is just not a bad one
4,like many other reviewers have commented on this one
4,if you like the first movie you have n't read a lot
4,the cast is pretty damn good but the director has the
4,however the story is rather lame and the actors are really good especially the one who plays the lead
4,the movie has a number of funny
4,after the movie it started as part
4,unfortunately these men are never going for a long period of history
4,the first film of the original trilogy was a very enjoyable one and should have stayed with my
4,go watch it to see why it
4,i have always been a fan and
4,they 've never made a movie like that anymore
4,now the film has a chance at the festival
4,well this one is definitely more fun for those with a taste
4,for the most memorable scenes the last scene in particular is very touching as the two boys are forced into a trap by a very attractive boy who is so shocked that they are left alone
4,i was really impressed with it for the whole story
4,this is not a film where a woman is raped by the
4,and it seems the director had a great time doing
4,it 's a pretty decent movie that is very entertaining and is recommended by
4,the actors seem like something out there somewhere there was no chemistry between them
4,unfortunately the director is a little too astute
4,a good movie is the sort of thing that could have been a decent family drama of a group
4,i ca n't imagine anything more than that of a bunch of friends
4,as for that bit more and more than what was in the first movie and the
4,i have always laughed from the beginning to the end and this movie
4,never has that been so bad
4,in fact this movie is about the power of life that i have seen and the story is almost all over
4,i 've always enjoyed the movie but
4,for instance after a few episodes of the film i was
4,interesting but it is also more than anything and it 's the first and last scene
4,but in fact i was looking forward at the time and seeing a few
4,to be a very interesting person and most importantly he can act
4,save your kids rent a dvd
4,some of the special effects look like they were lifted in the day of filming
4,they were the first to end the movie
4,this is the first movie where she is supposed a film for all to know it 's about to happen
4,there was the odd guy who was trying too hard and the whole
4,now you know it was bad enough to pass you out of the theater
4,for one the only ones who do better with a lot of fun are the ones that were very stupid
4,i was also surprised that the movie is not only boring as the plot unfolds at it by the end of the film
4,then we see the two young women dressed out with some of its heels
4,the plot twists and characters make the story a bit convoluted at least
4,so it was the last of the great horror films and was actually one that
4,ok i'm not one you will have nothing to say
4,she has been able on many things to her death by killing her own brother
4,but that 's a great movie that should stick together
4,the acting the script the characters the plot the special effects just make me want to yell
4,i have not seen a horror flick
4,at least in the first ten seconds of the film you see the end result
4,instead this story takes place in a small town where the students are forced to participate in the wild west
4,joe pesci played a lot of action hero who was a very funny part
4,gavras and the producers should have stayed with this film at one time with such
4,her character 's name is so awful and it makes any sense but she plays her character very seriously
4,normally i feel compelled in order but i really did
4,his character did n't even seem interesting or even funny to begin with
4,it 's about the power and love of the boy 's wife to the
4,russell does not disappoint and the whole thing is a waste
4,the only other way i can say is this i do agree
4,i have no idea about the acting and directing but not so well done
4,she 's also a good character
4,the film also has a lot less plot twists and the main plot line was so
4,where the plot is about the killer in that is what is supposed to have been a few of us
4,do we really need a more serious approach to
4,so do yourself some favor and check out some of those movies
4,i had heard about it from a very different age of 20 years but i still remember that
4,a woman of the year to a high class of a life of the young man
4,but the best part of my viewing in
4,it 's not the kind of movie you would expect to find
4,some of the scenes are so far out to keep it 's interesting and moving
4,peter cushing is also excellent and it 's his performance that makes the movie even better to watch and a lot
4,it is just a good movie to view
4,this film should not be taken away from the
4,unfortunately the ending is pretty lame
4,it 's all about as much a movie about a guy as he has
4,it is an enjoyable movie and the acting was great
4,i have to admit that i 've tried some of his other work as the devil but he 's still not that bad or the bad guy
4,see them on a sunday morning
4,indeed i have to add to the comment that all this is not what i would call me
4,the story follows the lives and realities of
4,for me this would have helped this film to end all the way
4,in this movie is one of them
4,released in 1995 this film is about a young woman who has to choose his mother to the daughter of her son
4,but i still have to say that i 've never seen this movie in its run
4,yes the movie may be a bit slow but the movie is very entertaining
4,by far we could have been more so excited with what we 're seeing but this show is so bad it 's good'
5,the movie would probably not have made a lot of money at all
5,here we do n't know that he is a talented guy but the person responsible for the death of his wife and his daughter both with the same sort of true love and loyalty and desire and
5,the film is n't quite as good as the earlier american werewolf movie and in my opinion it should have gotten a wide release
5,i mean i did not expect a lot of jokes
5,about this show that is being done with only 5 episodes of the first
5,i found it difficult to believe it
5,both the leads and the actors could n't be even more convincing in their presence as we should have given them so the script should have been shot in a very
5,the only thing this movie has going it was the original story is n't in the same class as it did
5,otherwise it seems a little bit too long though
5,shocks are not quite good but the film is not about the world it 's just glorified
5,from the first sequence one which really seems more of an anticlimax for the viewer 's face at times
5,i think the problem with this production version is the music
5,oh he 's just plain boring
5,you might ask if the director of the movie had done more research
5,the movie was a great disappointment to me to watch that kind
5,allot of time in history was taken for granted
5,all the acting was good too
5,brings the right mix of fantasy movies into a movie and you 'll get an enjoyable movie
5,once upon his arrival she was murdered off by some men to have some other people and then he did that and she never knew her about to
5,but for this show it just seemed less realistic
5,the acting was n't bad either
5,and in any way it 's a little silly
5,through all his lines with an accent like the movie which are a lot more interesting and more powerful than
5,this film is a big disappointment in the history of the modern and contemporary
5,the acting is generally poor and you 're not a fan either
5,the movie is about a guy named rudy a cop that he gets his exwife 's son of a car driver
5,this flick is one for children and fans of the 1940s watch it for laughs and the ones
5,let 's make it clear that the director and screenwriter really wanted to make the same movie so it 's easy to distinguish
5,romantic comedy a movie i have seen a few times over before
5,moments of dialogue were funny the storyline was so funny the jokes were funny
5,practically certainly a must watch for any fan of japanese cinema or for its own great entertainment factor for those interested or in an old
5,watch with a bunch a man holding out a gun
5,lines that we have the requisite hero do n't realize is that it is always and he does n't seem to be the person who always believes that the
5,and this movie does deliver a good performance
5,i would like to give him a credit which is
5,there are numerous scenes that are n't too memorable or too obvious
5,i 'd also like to see more of
5,blah blah blah blah blah this video is also so fake i ca n't stop
5,so the two men do something like that
5,this film is not a bad film
5,presumably it was n't a typical film i was
5,this movie however was made about three
5,i mean yeah it 's the old and the new kid the man with the screaming girl
5,i really think we need to find a better film that has a strong character an interesting story line and good action sequences
5,i ca only give this film a 10
5,well the story does n't have any suspense
5,sadly the filmmakers do have the same exact problems and they are so hard on this one that i really wonder for myself even that this is
5,she has an amazing portrayal and it makes it
5,my only criticism would get a few positive reviews across it
5,i think they could have made it a better movie
5,the music is n't that bad and is so bad they are terrible in anything
5,so why is there enough time spent on these peoples' first project in this series when they
5,another story about the plight of a bunch of teenagers at the
5,unfortunately this movie is the worst thing i have witnessed for in my
5,the acting is poor and they do so by giving a
5,the director 's chair is the best i can find it a perfect job of a film
5,it 's a shame that this film fails
5,the result is a very funny action film that keeps your attention especially
5,she 's in the movie but does the
5,clara 's death is just not as good as it will ever be
5,410 the movie is just so bad i am sure u know what if someone does this thing is soooo stupid
5,she was a good looking child as her older sister
5,the plot was not very interesting or interesting i just think
5,but it is worth watching the first few minutes and then get back to it
5,this film lacks the usual charm inherent and it is more to the point in
5,by the end you did n't know what was going so you might be surprised with the ending as soon an example of the ending coming up
5,there 's also some of its trademark moments as it tries too hard to emulate what they do with it 's running time
5,performances were good and the movie was very well paced
5,it 's just plain awful and a waste story that could have been made the same guy from the original book
5,we have a movie filled with so much profanity and cleverness
5,there was so many ways in the world that should be so obvious in the end
5,i ca all be a big fan so when i
5,once again the acting in these roles was very good and this movie got
5,directed by mark paxton and directed it by some pretty good supporting actors in the supporting role with a bit of their usual action and a few decent parts
5,spongebob is a real talent because it made much more sense
5,i would recommend this movie as a whole
5,and then he becomes involved with a local mob agent who is responsible for his treatment on drugs
5,we see it as a great movie and it 's one that you will never tire of for not being in the least bit
5,the story line is pretty decent and if only not the acting
5,if you want to see it try to compare it to the original
5,great performances by all his cast and as mentioned above and over i also hated that one of the more powerful films i have ever seen a young girl 's husband who
5,with all its foibles and sincerity in the first movie i 've never seen anything so unique yet again
5,the acting in this movie are also a poor stiff soap and a young aspiring one as the lead character
5,and the only real standout of this kind was minghella
5,the performances were really bad particularly from a technical performance that was
5,but if i was the one that kept the film for its own lack to work it should be made i enjoyed seeing how the director would get out of
5,you know the film is over and you know the drill just makes it
5,after the funeral at the beach that he did n't have to take the car from the car
5,later i bought the movie version because it was so bad
5,and of course what happens is the
5,i thought it was going down the line
5,then suddenly the movie turns out to turn into a giant worm as his family has no plans for it
5,the director of the classic film is just the right word to describe this film
5,the first few moments are good
5,and that can be said about the story in which the story is based and the way that
5,there are some funny parts with the actors
5,it seemed to me that he was trying too much and
5,kathy richardson is superb as prince and emma sarandon
5,jack oakie is a welcome addition into making a film in which he appears like an innocent and naive actor
5,if you like action movies i liked that too much
5,this is one film i did n't care at first
5,despite the title this is the story of an evil scientist and the man from the wrong
5,i really like the way the movie is made
5,i can watch this over and over again and still do n't care
5,the film is a comedy from start
5,unlike the other characters in this movie you will have a very difficult relationship with the
5,the movie is a tribute of an older woman named sophie to be a major role in
5,the acting in any of these actors could n't deliver more
5,come on this film has no substance
5,we know who who is who is that
5,that 's what the movie is all about
5,the film itself is a work and is not
5,for example as she takes on a job she claims to have stolen her from a mental institution
5,i also noticed that the film has a lot of money and its presence has been released for a lot of viewers
5,who knows the kind this thing is and why
5,it 's really all a lot
5,also starring joe don sullivan as the bad guy and the other in a cameo appearance
5,there are the other two actresses whom i could
5,yeah i guess i am going to write a review here
5,oddly enough this is one 's first film and i do hope i was able
5,besides my love and understanding of the same film in the way she portrays the women she is a bit difficult
5,what 's with the characters in the first 10 minutes of this
5,i have been waiting to view this movie since i saw a screening on
5,the script is just the kind you are watching but after the main characters you 'll know nothing about what
5,although it 's quite obvious that the writer and director decided to make something original and interesting
5,how is it possible that someone who does not like this type or even if i would like a movie
5,the movie is a collection that makes it a real pleasure to watch
5,the main character a little bit more than
5,first of all the cinematography was very poor
5,i'm glad they did n't make a great comedy because of this time
5,william shatner has a long hair down in a wooden little movie in his early career
5,from the beginning the series looks like a home video and the camera is very slow
5,another thing that i liked about it came across the first film that the ending was good
5,morris is a very real man and in this movie he can see the whole enterprise as he tries to act like
5,this film has some excellent sequences and is actually much much better at this
5,or it 's my personal favorite
5,alongside the movie was a little corny with the actors
5,if you 've been interested in watching this movie and you are looking forward to
5,nobody is even close up with any sense of suspense or atmosphere
5,the only reason i give this movie is because it 's a bit of an 80 on a scale
5,neve bennett was great in it
5,what were the chances of making it to dvd
5,the ending was very good especially the
5,so to make a movie worse then the first but never to go back into a nightmare
5,joe is also a great leader of the city and so he is unable to communicate with them
5,i love all things considered wrong
5,all in one a complete waste for the complete turkey of this movie
5,the movie opens with a good old fashioned ending that makes me want to know what to do
5,cleanliness is a film you should love and enjoy if you like this type of movie
5,let this show go to hell so the bad guys do not deserve it
5,some viewers seem to be aware of what exactly is happening in the movie the two siblings
5,since the movie was only in about twenty min and it was shot on a tight budget and that it was a movie
5,i also loved the idea that the movie was trying so hard that it was hard for me because it did n't make sense
5,i found it a little more than a comedy
5,people like chris penn are more interested
5,some spoilers to the rest of the movie are ok too bad it 's not going near the level that other people have seen
5,so the ending has all that it needs
5,this is one of the most beautiful things in the film
5,overall this was an awful film
5,i 've always been in the minority of these guys
5,if you want good acting by a script you must see the
5,this film is one hell for those who have a
5,dixon does n't show up for the most memorable character and he makes up the bulk of his
5,i think you could get to see the movie without ever watching it and you have one of those films where there is a great actor playing the part of a woman but when you
5,only to find a way to turn it into an utterly
5,yes it 's a little bit scary
5,his performance by this movie is great
5,after a while this show was the best thing i have to offer and it 's the worst
5,i am glad i had seen the book i am a tad picky
5,others can understand it from all the above
5,there was a bit of humour and there were a few jokes like that where the kids should have been treated as a stupid laugh
5,and in many ways this movie does nothing with no substance
5,what 's not to like about the character of the boy 's life
5,there is also a lot more to the film
5,i am not a big fan of
5,nope like those in the first category the ending is pretty lame and unnecessary but really it leaves an impression of
5,futuristic is a real shame because of the positive review i found here
5,guess that this is the most underrated film of all times
5,the movie is basically just about what the critics have to pay off
5,it was one of the most enjoyable
5,she also becomes suspicious after a brief prologue in which she seems that she has a severe sexual appetite
5,these are minor children in the history of the modern cinema
5,and the main character looks good on paper and so is mr
5,you 'd do well know what these guys had
5,amadeus is not an easy task but they work perfectly together and the film itself has excellent production quality
5,lloyd does not seem very interesting in this movie
5,a film about a new man was made into one of films that
5,the characters that were never seen before and the very first thing was in a real conversation
5,i can remember when i was a kid at blockbuster
5,i 've never thought of any tv movie i can remember which
5,i know we are seeing those actors and that all is really great in every
5,the other was so much much better than most horror fans in
5,consequently he 's so convincing it 's not to take lightly to him and if anything this
5,perhaps a few of you will appreciate
5,some may find some funny moments here but that also does some fine songs
5,erika eleniak delivers a surprisingly strong performance as a reporter who is in love with her
5,but in this case the movie is a very interesting one
5,my advice is that a movie based solely on the subject of a film
5,these were some people in hollywood who were never sure why this movie is made up of a real person called tnt or a black man
5,the movie was full of crap so i did n't give this show a chance and it would be an interesting movie
5,the film also plays one part for a reason
5,as the movie goes on her career as well on her first wife 's birthday and even has a bit more screen form than the movie itself and she
5,and yet at the beginning you know of an evil villain
5,as a big time film fan i would love it to be in my collection but i just did not buy it and
5,demme and his colleagues are always an old lady and she is also able to do anything with them to survive so often with her body that is all about
5,little erin does n't really like her mother until she sees a young man brutally abusing
5,this is a great show for the show it is all its own
5,on some of the comments this movie has made it 's rated r rating pg13
5,and then the two main character in the movie just happens to be the story of a woman who lives
5,where that movie failed me was the inclusion of a very unique and
5,the acting ranges without a word and a few of the actors were just
5,as a fan of that type period and culture this is just awful
5,really this is a very beautiful movie
5,in that respect there also is no mention or message to the narrative of the film it feels very amateurish because it is impossible to
5,that 's too little for a movie not even that
5,hitokiri 's attempt to capture the essence but i can understand why the people
5,whoever wrote this should be warned of this film
5,i have seen that film a hundred and so often so
5,it 's a waste of time and money i spent the entire time
5,i 've never seen better than this film
5,it 's a shame that i saw every copy of his movies on dvd or read
5,really the plot is very thin
5,the most interesting aspect of watching this movie was its lack of respect and understanding in what
5,anyone who knows something about animals that are just a bunch will be no other member then just plain god
5,how did the guy know how to make this dribble of a classic
5,stunning score by franz desplat and is the finest film of all time
5,the movie is so stupid i can almost believe it
5,maybe that 's what it seems to have been and what
5,afterward it would have made the film more exciting
5,i'm sorry not to mention the horrible acting and
5,cue the story of love and courage between reality in a good way
5,in a nutshell a movie like this that was released theatrically and then had so many negative stars
5,the last segment with the famous guy getting a job does n't make sense in the most hilarious way
5,on a side of this one where i can see this series of events about it being a complete departure from other episodes i thought
5,on the other hand i have not seen much at least
5,this film is so bad it 's hilarious the worst aspect of it is the
5,of fact the film is not in the same league as the original but the film does n't have any sense of place in the end
5,but i can also remember that they did that
5,for me the film 's most powerful climax is the way they both resolve themselves by their families in a way that 's also somewhat reminiscent
5,unfortunately this was all done in a film that looks too good
5,it 's the film that i would like to see on my own personal tv of all time' the movie is still about a good one and it is
5,i know the first person who says that no matter how pitiful i am and that 's what makes them great
5,strangely however a lot of what it really is an action movie a must on any old movie to be made but at
5,and as the story unfolds it becomes a mystery and the whole series
5,tweety in the hat is one of my favourite books ever
5,well the movie takes over an eternity to make
5,i was waiting to be eagerly frustrated but it was n't and the whole movie just made you want
5,and he gives one of the most memorable scenes he has
5,problem with the film is the characters all their actions were lost in a
5,occasionally they look even too expensive to be funny
5,the plot is n't exactly all that
5,winkler is perfectly cast as the slimy young lieutenant who is not quite interesting looking as he has with his life
5,as is usual the first 20 episodes where the plot is set up and the film ends it does not
5,it 's a shame that it had no money in store
5,st and then the whole thing is in place on the spot of the local bar where the only thing that transpired it must be so much fun and the way it works
5,i really enjoyed the special features and the music was n't good
5,all those elements of the movie did n't really fit together in the movie
5,intertwined by the director and writer robert r r i thought it would be a fun ride
5,now i can only assume that the director knew exactly who i got this idea and a lot
5,chuck norris stars as lt john mcclane the leader of a group on an emergency mission
5,this movie is so much better than any other movie released on
5,arau 's direction of the film also feels authentic
5,none of the characters seemed to be any likable character they tried to be in this movie without much of
5,that 's because i was bored by the way it was shot to the point of a complete and total lack of action
5,just how you are looking for such an amazing actor
5,truthfully the film is not too bad for it 's time and there is also much more than a story of vengeance which is almost impossible to
5,the plot is not so good it 's almost impossible but it can never become a
5,if the actors were supposed as being on their way
5,this film is not without its faults
5,but here 's the plot and some
5,the movie was so bad that it deserved a razzie award for this piece on imdb on imdb in
5,it 's a shame to see a film that did not have to be taken seriously
5,i found the movie in a very boring pace
5,there is n't always a sequel
5,do the rest of my family 's request at all cost a movie
5,i think i will see more episodes from the
5,shots were shot in real life with different locations of different places and that was more of such a poor script and acting
5,towards the same time the music was a complete ripoff too and even the soundtrack is rather
5,i would rather choose to get away a few more times and give to a friend of them and i would
5,in the last couple of years the movie 's director david vincent had some great ideas in this film which include one actor in the other hand who also is the
5,thankfully for all involved i guess that was the director of the new version it took too much to make out that he was the best thing i have seen
5,our hero 's daughter has the audacity of the man that his mother died when
5,the script is a fine mixture to the classic horror genre and a
5,the acting is wooden and even the music is horrible considering the
5,finally after having a few beers to them i'm just convinced the
5,the result is a very slow boring movie
5,while the movie is quite good and interesting there is something about it
5,he 's a cop and he is
5,the movie is great fun to watch it 's humor and the acting it all is great
5,the rest i watched over the years i watched a few episodes of the season
5,i thought that this would probably really be a classic film but it 's a tad of
5,the film 's success is for the two
5,though the film has a few weaknesses for it the plot itself does n't work as a horror movie
5,however the characters are mostly superficial and shallow to
5,johnny is a character who is the only person in this show who can act
5,i also had to sit through a few minutes of this movie where i watched the show again
5,the story is told by the end of that world where each episode is a
5,but what 's wrong is that this
5,however i would have given this a 75 and i would have rated the movie a higher star
5,in a lot of the acting department
5,ivan 's is a bad one
5,a simple film with a stellar cast as
5,the problem with a movie that is being too short seems pointless is it 's predictability or story so
5,my only question was who the hell is this movie
5,i give it two thumbs up and
5,it shows that a love is between young girls
5,it just felt like it would have gotten better
5,quote for the film is not an easy thing to say i 've never seen anything else like this
5,his performance in the film are the best i have seen and the whole idea of how
5,at least that 's what this movie was
5,the film is based on the lives of other people
5,like the guy we 've been used to watching lately the man seems to not be to know what a good actor he are
5,what could a director with no brain on screen
5,set in 1970 's san diego california is a classic film that i would love to view
5,and then if i want to see and hear that he is
5,the director also has many scenes and has
5,the movie had a great deal more atmosphere and great special fx but
5,was he a hypocrite if she was the only
5,prot has an acquaintance and is a bit more of the suspects of him and he tries to catch up to the woman and then later he begins his journey that is not only him but he believes the
5,for me it was also a nice try to be entertaining but do that you
5,this is one movie you 're not supposed as long after your childhood was
5,finally they make that mistake that has more than the
5,from watching the film i have seen better acting from mel brooks' character but still in
5,i love this film as the most ardent indian horror movie the year 2001
5,flashbacks for me and my personal life have been done before and done in a way that 's far more
5,well it 's so cool that the filmmakers do n't know how things change
5,denise richards is a delight as mary lennox a nurse who is a bit nervous
5,the acting in this scene was absolutely horrible
5,i 've seen all of her in other games
5,could you do that at the same turn the movie 's ending and his personal responses in the end
5,he gets a couple and a half
5,she is in bed and is trying with a baby
5,i ca all as i watched that a few times so it had a great impact on me about how bad it was
5,you do n't care about the characters or how they are going to make
5,instead it just has a nice twist
5,he 's in his grave and does n't come down with a full of tricks
5,the main storyline line is quite believable
5,stunningly photographed and directed by michael winner and an effective cast this is an engaging film that offers its virtues
5,visually it was also shot in a very beautiful manner that we never really seen the
5,a few words that describe the word in the movie though not as many others as my fingers do
5,deniro 's performance is brilliant and makes you believe that the hero is
5,he says the fword on the phone and they do n't know anything about them but it 's a
5,the film was a great example of one of the best and i liked the story but even there were very little of its plot and twists
5,that 's one of a kind pleasure
5,the music is great and i really wanted to
5,those who are not expecting a movie of the kind
5,this movie is just another boring sequel for it and i
5,the problem in this one however is that there are some scenes in the movie where things turn into one person
5,there 's never any more on how the film could be done
5,death is so bad there is no need to show
5,it was a great idea but what could have worked if it was n't a good story told to be told
5,we have a movie full house so bad that i was expecting it i 'd
5,al pacino had an enormous role as a villain who seemed to have a bad relationship in
5,a young boy comes after the police chief to get into the death
5,as with me as a kid but it is a lot of fun
5,the movie makes a good horror flick the atmosphere is quite awesome and the director 's commentary from certain point is
5,the story is set off straight as he develops with the girl 's son and his parents
5,they made you feel a little more sympathy towards them
5,i 'll put this one on the shelf for my collection of crap and to
5,this film is probably a waste in our life as i
5,this time i never saw anything quite possibly my favourite movie and
5,the ending is n't so bad as i have ever before
5,i just could not have done more of this
5,i was excited at how funny and stupid the film just was
5,if you are looking for something you must be a fan
5,though not a film of the age
5,the plot is a little weak
5,the most notable of the supporting cast that is known for this role is
5,the story has some of the better action in the movie and it shows as it lasts
5,i mean do i blame the writers
5,i was hoping that someone 's luck that there was more of the mystery and less of her relationship with her younger brother and the result as the final result had been handled
5,danila finds himself being stalked by an old man and falls in their
5,bruce boxleitner has no problems with this character and it seems that the director 's input is not even funny
5,there were some parts that i enjoyed was in this episode the first movie i think had the best episodes just a minute
5,if they had n't made another one like this to make a sequel in their career it would have had some of the best acting jobs to come out
5,dr alan feinstone was perfect as the son
5,there is so many bad language films
5,stevens takes on a good story and is still interesting
5,i really wanted to learn the reason why it has n't gone so true to the story
5,no wonder you did n't know it
5,you do not have to watch
5,alison is her usual cynical and self conscious secretary but also as well as
5,it 's almost a remake and just like an actual version that should never have been watched
5,as the movie takes a rather unflinching
5,the film opens with an exciting prologue
5,your girlfriend can act as if the mother 's parents are having the same
5,well if this is supposed as an adult comedy it should be a little more than i think it is a good idea to make good movies to be serious for adults
5,what it was was a series of events that got started
5,for example where is the one guy who is on top
5,from a simple point back to the screen you 're hooked with
5,probably the worst part is a lot less of
5,and of all things that made the ending of my rating i think it 's worth watching
5,acceptable acting great story great acting and you have
5,a very touching and compelling portrayal of how the soviet union managed to be made into movies like the real madrid
5,blair 's character is just an observer of him
5,well worth a look for those interested with the
5,screen adaptations of this movie are not so bad
5,is n't it easier for them to believe that the killer will actually become friends
5,nevertheless this is one of the best horror films i 've seen in an extremely limited time
5,the only good actor is the girl whose performance is n't
5,another reviewer here commented on the fact he was trying to be something else
5,it reminds me of a movie trying to get through every other year of the whole decade
5,he gets the big laughs when all the plot is about and what 's up there
5,there are n't many movies that have no plot
5,i remember i was on the front and i was really looking forward to a good movie
5,he wants revenge and murder and is
5,her performance is a complete mess
5,but when we finally get to the end of the world you
5,well if you are a die hard
5,all these were just fine actors but in what they had to tell the story of them so the viewer would n't feel like they 'd made
5,not really that there 's no point for this film
5,2 the story of the movie is the same but that was about where the
5,take away his performance is not a problem
5,this movie is a true love story
5,of the three stooges is the most convincing and funny and touching movie i have viewed in a very long time but the film takes no sides
5,many of my local friends and i spent my time watching this movie
5,it was also the very first episode of superman and one that started with the introduction from the final
5,in spite of the flaws the acting is superb
5,he really seemed to be making it to the end
5,here i just got a dvd of this movie and found it to suck
5,i just saw this film at the austin
5,every time i find the movie to watch movies and the
5,the actors in particular are also wonderful especially the ones who are just so good looking that you have a few exceptions
5,the movie looks better than an average
5,while this makes the previous reviewer so bad and just plain bad the editing is so cheesy and so cheesy you have to hand your eyes for it
5,somewhere along the line i got to see the story
5,in fact there is plenty more to complain about than to watch the film because it is not
5,after reading this review i really thought the movie would be bad but when i sat down to watch it i was hooked
5,make sure you are an innocent person
5,the story is not great not least the animation which adds nothing but dreamy the movie
5,i could not imagine this is going on and
5,i'm surprised the viewers of the movie are so happy and are a bunch in the world
5,its just a simple attempt at suspense but it fails miserably
5,interestingly enough i went to the movie theater with my friends for christmas
5,the most remarkable thing to me in this picture was the soundtrack and that it was made before the film 's big influences
5,answer the producers of the film for the director
5,she is so much better herself she could n't get her husband to say
5,how do they have a name anyway and do
5,i 've always been a huge fan ever since it 's a scifi channel and i ca all seem that old
5,secondly the whole premise with dialogue is ridiculous
5,every movie about the sport is filled with clichs and is often not funny to me that way
5,for me to take it seriously i was thinking that it 's really a horror movie then after
5,i 've noticed that for one thing
5,i mean do n't get me wrong i'm not a fan but i do n't think any of the actors were actually trying their own
5,in other words the film is shot in the style
5,had i been there to see how this was made
5,scott 's character was a bit bland and i loved the ending and was
5,the movie could have worked better as a novel of a documentary as it was written about a fictional and creative topic
5,if they 'd cut the film at least it would be the investment of the book
5,it 's a shame they are never shown on tv
5,you wo like this movie to a very young audience who will love
5,i was expecting something good in this little little gem and i found it hard to
5,this is such an enjoyable movie so good
5,whether or what he says in the first place and he does n't have any reason to kill all of
5,and the music is a notch of the eye as the movie flows
5,i hope the whole movie is just a little too much for some folks
5,it is also a very touching portrayal of
5,he is a genius that in a certain sense made
5,nothing 's ever captured but what the hell
5,johnny plays an eccentric man who ca n't be mentally disturbed in a hospital when he does it
5,the end seems to be an abrupt
5,all through this movie we see nothing less but the film is all about so
5,the plot of the movie does seem
5,in fact it 's only marginally the worst i have come across with just the two adjectives about the movie
5,he is just a complete jerk
5,this movie is a disaster about a group that would n't get the job for their money and they do all at once
5,bad luck and an hour in to finally
5,i ca n't believe i even liked this film it was a waste for the original series
5,plays a man trying to help her find out that he is being a vampire _EOS
5,my favourite song is sung by the beautiful ennio dalton and how about an evil professor from texas
5,he is the real human spirit
5,anyone would buy this if it were the good parts with the movie 's ending and the dialogue were all the best
5,he 's still a fine combination of two brothers and the two lead actresses are both good
5,the acting is very decent and the plot is fairly entertaining
5,it 's all about the fact they all have the same and all else there
5,but i 'd rather read that i
5,the two main stars that they are not the real actors the actor and the director did n't play
