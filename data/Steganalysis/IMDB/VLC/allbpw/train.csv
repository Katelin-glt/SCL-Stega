0,a cool film that has a punch at the box office regardless of the stellar madonna as thomas storm although the lack of sparkle in the allies magazine provides more praise than to have 25 cent under the opinion that the creators should know from the other viewers who needed to add boredom to her film debut,a real shame that branagh can possibly put some effort into this film so he decided to give him a minor chance dealing with the conventions masquerading as another film where aaron spelling does discover himself somewhere in the film as the accidental visitor horse that he opens with the angry dapper builders square against them

1,his performance is so bad it 's laughable and he 's just plain awful and the movie is just plain bad,his character was a little too cocky to be believable but the movie was so bad that i was left speechless and
1,in the end the film has no redeeming features,in fact it 's a very good movie
1,just like the other reviewer i 've read the comments here and the fact is that it is not a good movie but it 's not a bad film it is not,just as a film about a young man 's life and the life he has in the world of the world of the human spirit and the consequences he brings to his life
1,the film has a lot of potential and it is not a movie to be,the movie is about a group of young men who are trying their luck
1,it is a very good movie and it 's not,it 's not even the best of the genre
1,the movie is a bit of a mess but the acting and the direction are so bad that it is n't,the film has some good points and some of the scenes are quite funny but it is not a movie

1,michael dudikoff is the perfect actor for this movie and i,michael caine plays a very good role in this movie
1,perhaps the director was n't trying too hard to make a film about the holocaust and,perhaps it 's a good idea to have some of these actors and crew members
1,dr hackenstein is the best of all the columbo,dr jacques feinstone is a very talented director
1,spoilers ahead the film has a lot of action and a lot more,spoilers spoilers ahead i was a bit skeptical when the film ended

1,it is not a movie for the,it 's a very funny movie
1,but the movie is not a good one,but it 's a good thing to see this
1,there is no reason for this movie to have a plot,there are some good moments but the story is so predictable and
1,i have to admit i was n't disappointed,i was surprised to see this film
1,like the other reviewer said it was a great film,like i mentioned earlier that it was n't a bad film
1,ok so i was expecting something like the original,ok i have seen this movie several times
1,i have seen the original version and i have seen the original,i was n't expecting much of this film to be a good film
1,so i was expecting a lot of the movie to get the point of,so the film is not as good and the performances are n't bad

1,you can see the movie in the first 15,you know that it 's a good movie
1,moore is a very talented director,moore 's performance is the only reason
1,for a film that is not only a comedy but also a comedy,for the first half hour i was n't sure what to do with it
1,we have a very good movie,we are supposed for the characters and
1,the movie is a complete waste of my time,the film has some of the worst acting ever assembled
1,the film has a very interesting story line,the movie is about the same thing as the

1,the film is about the struggle of a man,the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,but it is a good film and a good one,but the film 's main flaw is the fact it 's

1,it is not the best film ever made,it 's a shame that the movie has n't

1,pecker 's performance was the best i have seen,pecker is a very good film and it is a
1,here 's the spoiler i have to say i did not like this film and i was n't disappointed,here is a film where the director is trying to make the film a little bit more interesting and more
1,the film has a lot of potential and the cast is very well chosen,the movie is about a group of young people who have been living in the
1,it 's not even a movie,it is a very funny film and
1,los muertos is the most interesting movie,los angeles was a great movie
1,eyes and ears were the only thing i liked about the film,eyes of a woman is a film that is not only a very
1,is this a good movie or is it a good movie or a bad movie that 's not funny or funny at all,is it the best movie ever made and it 's a shame because it 's a great film to watch and enjoy and enjoy
1,pretty soon the film becomes a little too long,pretty much all the characters were killed and killed
1,some of the scenes were so bad they could n't have been,some people say it 's the best movie i 've seen
1,i'm a fan of this movie and i do not think it was,i'm not a fan of this type but i have seen it
1,everything is illuminated and it is a very enjoyable movie,everything about this film is so awful that it is hard

1,the film has a very good story line and the,the movie is about the power of the characters
1,i have seen this film several years and,i was n't impressed by this movie

1,yes it is a little bit too slow and too predictable for the audience but it 's not,yes the movie was n't a total waste of time but the movie is n't that good
1,instead of a good movie it 's not,instead it 's a movie about the life and
1,some of the acting was good and i was impressed,some people say that this movie is a masterpiece
1,with the help of a friend who has a secret to his wife she is unable,with a supposed beard in the film the film is not only the most compelling film of
1,i have to admit that i was n't impressed by the movie,i was surprised to find out that this movie is not only the
1,whatever the reason it is a great movie,whatever it was i would n't have to watch
1,the film is about a group of people who have been living in the past and are forced into prostitution,the movie was a waste of my life and i would have to say i did n't like it
1,as a result of this movie i have to say that i have seen the original and i 've,as for me i have to admit that the film was very good and the acting was superb
1,arthur 's character is the only one,arthur is the best of all
1,as a result the film is not a bad movie,as for me it was n't a good movie but i
1,like i said it was a good idea,like the first film the acting is pretty bad
1,this is a movie that i can recommend watching,this movie was a complete waste of time
1,i have to say that this movie was so,i was surprised that this movie was made
1,walken 's performance is very convincing and the film has an excellent performance by the,walken is a good actor but his performance in this movie was so awful
1,a lot of people have commented that this,a few of the actors were good
1,peter o'toole plays the role as a cocky and manipulative man who has,peter falk is a good actor and he 's a good director
1,also i do not know what to say,also the film is a bit too slow and
1,then there 's the fact that it is n't the worst movie ever made,then the film is set up as a series of flashbacks that have a very
1,we have a lot of fun to watch,we are supposed to be rooting for him and
1,i was n't expecting a lot from this movie but it 's not,i have seen the movie twice and it 's a great movie
1,after the first hour i realized that this was a movie that was n't really a good movie,after a few years of watching the movie the film is a very interesting experience of the genre and
1,be warned that this is a movie,be prepared for a few chuckles
1,while the film is a little bit slow moving and the plot has some holes it is a film with,while i was not impressed by the film i found myself wishing that the film would have ended sooner
1,all the characters were so bad that,all in all a great movie
1,what is this movie about the story,what a waste for the time
1,my favorite part of this movie was the scene where the girl is talking about the girl,my advice is that if your looking to see this film is a waste your time
1,i was n't expecting much of a film,i have seen the original version of this movie
1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,on a technical note the acting is superb,on the plus side it 's not a good
1,there are some very funny scenes and the movie has a lot of funny moments,there is no real plot to speak and no real story just the basic story
1,so i was expecting something like the movie to get the best of the,so the film is a little slow but the story is very good
1,by the time i saw it i had to see,by far the worst movie i 've ever watched
1,a lot of people have commented on this movie,a few of the actors were very well chosen and
1,neither the acting or acting is good and the plot line was so predictable that it could n't have been more,neither of them is a real good guy and the story is so bad it 's almost impossible for them
1,anyway i was n't impressed with the film,anyway the film has a lot to do
1,anyway the film is not a complete disaster but,anyway i was surprised to see this movie
1,or maybe it 's just the fact it 's not,or the other two of them are the same
1,i have to admit i did not like this film,i was surprised to see that the film is a little
1,if you 're looking to see a good movie with the usual plot holes and a good story line then you,if i were n't so engrossed i 'd have been a little less confused and had more of the impact
1,when the film was released the film was a complete failure to sit down to watch and,when i saw the trailer for the first time in my life i was very impressed
1,clearly the film 's biggest flaw is that it 's,clearly this movie is not for the faint hearted
1,as a matter of view the film has no real redeeming qualities,as for the acting it 's a bit too bad that it 's
1,the film is about the same subject as the first film and it 's not a bad movie,the movie was a bit slow but i did not expect much from the film to begin
1,there are some very funny moments but it is not,there is no real plot and the characters are so bad
1,every scene in this movie was a joke,every time i watch this movie i was n't
1,i was n't expecting a movie to be so boring but i was n't expecting much from it,i have seen the movie and it is one of my favorite films of the last decade
1,the film is about a young woman who has a boyfriend who is married to a woman,the movie was a waste for me and i was surprised that the movie did n't have a
1,this movie is a complete mess of the first movie i,this is the first movie i have ever walked across
1,breaking the rules of the movie 's end of the film is a little,breaking your head is the worst movie i have seen in my life
1,but it is a good movie,but the film 's main problem with
1,this movie was so awful that it,this is a very good film
1,i'm not a big big fan of the genre,i'm a fan and i do not know how to
1,the film is a bit slow but it 's a great film,the movie was shot on a low level of 35mm camera
1,upon arrival the film is about as good a film as you 'll find,upon the arrival of a young man he meets the man who is a man
1,i was surprised that this movie was made in the first place,i have to say that this movie was a complete disappointment to watch
1,villon 's performance in this movie was a bit too much for me to like him but,villon is a very good actor and i think that the movie was a great success
1,if you 're looking to be scared by a movie you should n't be able to watch,if i were n't so irritated by the film 's portrayal i would have been able
1,not only is the acting terrible the story is awful and the characters just,not to say that the movie is a complete waste of your time
1,there are some good scenes and the movie is a good one,there is no reason to watch it and if it is not a
1,i have to admit i did n't like the movie,i was surprised to see that this movie was released in
1,the film is a complete mess,the movie was shot in the early
1,everyone else in the movie was just a stereotype of,everyone is entitled to a certain level of humor
1,i have to say that i was very disappointed,i was surprised that this film did n't get a
1,i was surprised that this movie did n't get a wider audience award nomination,i have to say that this is one that i have seen in a while
1,he 's a very talented director,he is the most annoying character in
1,his character is a caricature of a man,his performance in this movie was so good that
1,and it 's not a bad movie,and the movie was so boring
1,without a doubt this movie is the worst movie i 've seen in my life and it is not a good film to me,without the words of the director 's previous film this is a must see for anyone interested in the history of the world
1,no matter what the cost of the movie it 's a very bad film,no one is going for the movie to be made and the film is not
1,its a shame that the movie has n't been remastered,its not even that good and it is not a bad
1,what is the deal of this film that it is not a movie,what a great film this is and it 's not even a movie it
1,what is the point of this film,what a great movie this was
1,i have seen this film twice and i still have to say it is one of my favorite films of all time,i was n't impressed by the fact it 's not the worst film ever made but it is a good film to see
1,the film has a very good cast and it 's a great movie to see,the movie is about the power and soul of the people who live in the ghetto
1,i was n't impressed with the film,i have seen this movie twice and it
1,basically it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen but it is still a great film,basically the movie is a mess of the original and the story of the movie was very good and
1,in fact the film was shot in the same location and the lighting is very poor,in the first movie the characters were not believable and the plot was so weak that i
1,in the end it 's not even worth the time,in fact it is not a movie that is so boring
1,all the actors are great and the movie,all in the name is the same
1,this is a movie that i would,this movie was a complete waste
1,without a shadow of a movie this movie was a waste,without the aid and the great acting of the actors the film
1,it is a shame that the film has n't received a wider release,it 's not a movie for the faint hearted viewer but it 's not
1,there are some very good moments and the film,there is no real reason to see it
1,the movie is a bit slow but it is a great film,the film has some good moments and the acting was good
1,when the movie was released it was released on dvd,when i first saw the movie in the theater it looked
1,the film has some good moments but it 's just too much,the movie is a bit slow and the story is n't that bad
1,the film is a bit of an exercise into the culture and,the movie was shot on location in the early 1800 's
1,if you want a good movie with a good plot good acting great action sequences a,if i had to watch it i 'd have to say i was n't impressed
1,the film has a lot to do but it 's not,the movie is about a young man who has been kidnapped by
1,the film is about a young woman who has been living with his mother in a small town in a remote,the movie was a waste for me and i would n't have been surprised if it had a good plot
1,this movie is not for everyone,this is the worst film ever
1,many people who have commented that the movie is a bit,many of the actors in this film were so good
1,the film is about the struggle of a man,the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,four stars for the movie and the script is a bit over,four years ago the film was made and the story was a bit
1,if i were n't for the first time i 'd have a headache and then watch it,if you 're looking for something that 's a bit more interesting then you 'll probably enjoy this
1,simply put this is one of the best films ever,simply because it is a film about a man who is
1,a lot of people have commented that this,a few of the actors were good
1,as for me i have to say i was impressed by this movie,as a result of this movie it is not a bad movie but a
1,in fact the only reason why this movie is a waste is the way it is filmed,in the first film the characters are not very likable and the plot is a little weak and
1,there are some very good moments and some good acting but it 's not that good either,there is no real reason to see this movie unless you 're looking to be bored
1,thus i was expecting a lot more than i expected,thus the movie is about the man who is trying and
1,i have to admit i was very impressed with the film,i was surprised to see this movie in a theatre
1,kissing a few of his fans,kissing the killer is a very good
1,however i do not think this movie is a masterpiece,however the film is not a complete disaster it 's not
1,wow this movie is a total waste,wow i do not think that the movie
1,directed by the great director of a classic film by a director who is n't afraid of the original story it is not a good film,directed with the help from a group of young kids who have a very small budget and are able to afford a new job of the world
1,but the film 's biggest problem is that the story does not make any sense,but it is a great movie and it 's a great movie to watch with your
1,you know that it 's not a good movie but,you can see the movie coming out of nowhere
1,i have seen the original movie,i was n't expecting much from this
1,this movie was so bad it 's,this is a very bad film
1,a few years later the film is a,a lot more of a good film
1,when the movie is about a man who is n't really the,when i first heard about it it 's not even funny
1,so i guess it was a good movie,so the movie is a complete waste of my
1,the film is about the same subject matter and it 's not a movie about a young man named kenny who has a crush,the movie was a bit slow but it was a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes to watch movies
1,he 's not a bad actor,he is a great director and a
1,our heroes are not the same as they were,our hero and his wife are the same

1,i was n't expecting a movie about the holocaust but it was a good movie,i have seen the movie and i can safely tell you it is n't
1,so the movie was made for tv,so i guess i 'll just say it
1,disney has made a movie that is a masterpiece,disney 's the big studios are a great combination of
1,here 's the story the story is a bit thin but it is n't,here is a movie that is not only a very good film but a very
1,there are some very funny moments but the movie is just too stupid to watch,there is no real plot and the acting was horrible and the plot was so predictable
1,for the most of the movie the acting is very poor and it is not even that good,for a movie that was supposed to have been a success in the first place it was a great
1,it 's a very good film,it is not a film that will
1,just like a movie that was made for tv and a lot more money,just as the movie is about the same people who are trying to get their
1,america is a very good film and i hope that it will get more attention from,america 's most popular movie was the one that made me think of the world
1,will smith 's character is so stupid and so unfunny,will the viewer have to see it to see if it
1,i have to admit i was n't impressed with the film,i was surprised to see this film in the us
1,the film is about a young man who has,the movie was a waste for the movie
1,it 's a shame because the film is a bit too slow and too slow for a,it is not the worst film i have seen but i 've been a big success
1,i have seen the original movie and i can safely tell you it,i was n't expecting much from the film but it was n't
1,yes the movie is a bit of a stretch but,yes it is not the worst movie ever made
1,none the more i think the film is a little bit of an exercise in a film,none of the characters were believable and i found myself wondering why they were so hard
1,as a matter the movie was made in the early 80 'searly 80 minutes and it was n't a total,as for the rest of the cast i would n't be surprised if they were n't in the movie
1,the film is a complete mess of the original,the movie was shot in the same location as a
1,kaurwaki is the best character of all time,kaurwaki 's character is a bit dim but the
1,this is a very bad movie and i would have to agree that the acting is n't bad,this movie was so bad that i could n't even finish watching it and i did n't care about
1,there is no real plot and the acting was horrible,there are some very funny moments but the movie is n't
1,it 's a very funny film and it is a shame that the movie has n't been released on video,it is not a movie that is so bad that you can laugh at it and it is not funny it
1,yet it is not the same as a movie,yet the film is a little too long
1,i was surprised that this movie was n't released theatrically,i have to say that this movie is one that is
1,along with the other actors the movie is a complete waste,along the lines you get a movie with the best of the
1,but the film 's main problem with,but it is a good movie
1,dreamers 's character was so annoying that i was,dreamers is the best of the three films
1,i was n't impressed with the film,i have seen this movie twice and it
1,keane is a very funny film,keane 's story was a bit of
1,i have to say that i have n't read,i was surprised that this film was made
1,flying on a plane and the two of them are in the same place,flying in the rain is a film that will be remembered as one of those
1,having seen the movie i was very impressed by the fact,having said all that it was a very good film
1,so i was expecting a lot more from this movie but i did n't expect much from it,so the film is not as bad but the story is so weak it is hard to believe
1,another problem is the lack thereof,another thing i did not like about
1,aside the movie was a complete waste,aside from that it is not that bad
1,generally i think the film was shot in the,generally the movie is not a complete disaster
1,as for me i have to admit that the film is very well made,as a result of this movie i have to say i was n't impressed by
1,troma is the only thing good about the movie,troma 's the first film is the best
1,but the film 's biggest problem is the fact it 's not even,but it is a great movie and i recommend it to all
1,the movie was a waste for the movie and i think that it was a waste,the film is about a young man who is a struggling man and a man in a
1,accidents and the fiends are a bit too long,accidents are n't the only thing to do with this
1,having seen the movie i had a good time,having said all that it 's a great film
1,i have seen this movie several times,i was n't impressed with this film
1,the movie was shot on a low budget and the actors were all pretty good and the plot was pretty good but it was a little,the film is a bit slow but the acting is superb and the direction by the way is excellent and it is a great movie
1,what a waste for a movie,what is this movie trying for a
1,i have to admit i did not like this movie,i was surprised to see that the film is not as
1,yes the film was shot in the early seventies but it 's not,yes it 's a bit slow and it is not a good film
1,he is the only person who can be identified with the fact,he 's a great actor but he is n't the best
1,lone ranger is the best of the three movies,lone wolf and the beast are all very good and
1,do n't worry that i did n't like,do not waste your time on it
1,sometime in this movie he 's the one who has the ability to be the one who has,sometime on the movie the director and the producer decided to give the movie a good look
1,modern day is an interesting movie that is a must see,modern horror films are not the only thing that is n't bad

1,this movie is not a good movie,this is the worst movie i 've seen
1,the movie is about a group of young people who are living in the,the film has a lot of potential and the cast are all fine
1,luckily the movie has no redeeming features,luckily it 's not a good movie
1,in the end the film is a bit of a bore but the film does n't really have to be a thriller it is,in fact it 's a shame because the movie was so bad that i could not even watch the movie to the end
1,in fact the only thing i can think about was that it is not the,in the first film he was the one who was in the first one
1,this movie is not for the squeamish but for the,this is the worst film i have ever seen
1,i have seen the movie twice,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,tokyo was a very nice movie and it is,tokyo is the best of all the movies

1,well the film was a bit too slow for me but it,well i do n't think i can ever watch it again
1,the movie was a bit slow but i did n't expect much,the film is about the same subject as the book and it is
1,pursuing the story is the same as a child who is a loner,pursuing a few of the actors and actresses in the film i have to
1,three years later the two men are in the same place,three of them were the best in this film and the best
1,but it 's not the best movie i have seen,but the movie was a bit of a mess
1,especially the scene in the bar where the two men are in the car crash and they are all talking about how they 're going through their lives,especially when you consider that it 's not the worst film i have seen in my life i 've seen this movie and i 've seen it twice and
1,maybe it was the fact i did not like,maybe the director should be ashamed of themselves

1,the movie is about the power of a young man and his wife,the film has a very good story and the actors are good
1,rik mayall is the only one who has ever been,rik birch plays the part with the same character
1,no matter what the cost of the film,no one is going for the movie
1,it is not the worst film ever made but it 's not bad either,it 's a shame because the movie was n't so much a lot of it
1,maybe the movie was made in the us but the,maybe it 's because the movie was so good
1,the film is about the struggle between a man and a,the movie was a bit of an attempt at humor

1,although the film is a little bit of a comedy it 's a very good movie,although i have n't read the book it was a little too coincidental for my liking and
1,steve mcqueen is the perfect actor,steve martin plays the part of a
1,rounding out a copy of this film and,rounding it out for a good laugh
1,no matter what you do n't want to see this movie you will be able to see the movie and enjoy,no one is a fan of the genre but the film has some great moments and the acting was good

1,i have to say that this movie was so,i was surprised that this movie was made
1,virgil is the best character ever,virgil 's character is the only reason
1,this movie was so awful it 's,this is a very good movie
1,fortunately the film 's only redeeming quality,fortunately it is not the same
1,it 's a very good movie and it 's not just a comedy it is an excellent film that will appeal for anyone interested in the genre,it is not a film for everyone who is interested in seeing a film that is so good that it 's hard to believe it is a comedy
1,apparently the film is n't as good as the first one but the film does n't seem like a,apparently this movie was made for tv and i think that the movie is a bit too long
1,there is no reason for the to be the,there are some good moments in this film
1,i have seen the movie twice,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,i was surprised to find out the movie was a complete flop and i do n't think it was a waste,i have to admit that i have n't read the novel but i have to admit that the movie was very good

1,i was n't expecting much of this film to be a good movie,i have seen the original version and i have seen the original version of
1,he 's a very good guy,he is the most talented actor of
1,richard gere plays the role of the father of a man in the film,richard widmark is a fine director and the director of the film has an interesting
1,it is not a movie for everyone but if it is a comedy you should n't be surprised by it,it 's a very funny movie and it 's a great film to watch with a group of friends
1,maybe it 's because i do n't know how,maybe the movie was n't a complete success
1,his character was a bit of a jerk,his performance is so good that i ca all
1,they 're all very funny and the,they are all in the movie
1,but it 's not the worst movie ever,but the movie was a little slow and boring
1,a lot more than a little more than a little bit of,a few years ago the film was made in the uk
1,the movie was a waste of time,the film is about a group that is
1,oftentimes it is a very poor movie and i do not think,oftentimes the film has some good moments but it is n't
1,if you want a good laugh out of this movie you should check out,if i had to watch this movie again it was a total disappointment
1,i have seen the movie and it is one that is not only a very good,i was n't expecting a movie to be so bad but this was a waste
1,i was n't expecting a movie to be a horror movie,i have seen the movie and it is a very accurate film
1,this movie is a complete waste of time,this is the first movie that has a very
1,as for me i was n't sure what the point of the film was but i was n't,as a result of the fact that it is a movie that is n't a complete failure
1,i have seen the movie twice and i have to,i was n't expecting a lot from the film
1,after a while i had a feeling that the movie would,after the movie was over i was n't expecting much

1,she is a very good actress,she 's not the only person who
1,salman khan is a good choice to be in,salman is the best actor in the movie
1,that 's the only thing that makes this movie so bad it 's just bad and,that is what makes this film great and the film is a very enjoyable film
1,however i was n't impressed with this movie,however the movie was a bit too slow for
1,it is not a film that is n't even a comedy it 's just,it 's a very good film and a good example for a movie
1,cinematography is very poor and there are some good actors,cinematography was good and i was impressed with the acting and

1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i have seen this film twice
1,this movie is a must for anyone who likes to laugh,this is the first film i have ever walked out on
1,an interesting film that is a must for anyone interested,an excellent film with great performances from the cast
1,the movie was a bit of a mess but i did n't think it would have made much of an impression about what happened in the end,the film is about the struggle of the people in a world where the world is ruled and the world is ruled by the evil spirit
1,sequels are not as good as the original but the film is a little slow,sequels like the lion and scan game have been done by the same director and made
1,it 's not even a good film,it is a very funny movie
1,in the end it is not a good film,in fact it is a very poor film
1,the film has a very good story and the acting is excellent and the characters in this,the movie is about the power of a young woman and her life in the world
1,also i think that it was a great idea,also the movie was a bit slow but it was
1,3 the acting is horrible and the story is so,3 out 10 out 10 stars for the acting
1,the movie was shot on a low budget and the actors are,the film is a bit slow but the acting is superb
1,not only does it look like a bad movie it 's,not to mention that the film is not as good
1,the film is a complete mess,the movie was shot in the early
1,this is the first movie i have seen that made,this movie is a complete mess of a film
1,it 's a very good movie and it 's a great movie,it is not a film for everyone who is n't interested
1,the film has a lot to offer and the story is a little confusing,the movie is about a young woman named seita played with a younger brother and
1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,at least the movie is n't as bad as the first,at the same moment the film is a little bit too slow
1,other reviewers here seem like it was a little too much to bear and the film is not a total loss,other than that it 's not a good movie but it 's not a bad movie either as a whole
1,and it is not a good film,and the ending is so bad that i
1,having seen this movie several years ago i was able,having said that the movie is very well made
1,although the film is not a complete masterpiece the story is a bit slow and the story is too thin to follow the story,although i have n't seen the movie i can only imagine that it was made for tv and i do n't think it is the
1,all the actors were excellent and the movie is a perfect blend of drama and romance and the film has,all in the family and the film is a perfect combination of the two and a half hour long
1,all the characters are likable and believable,all in all this movie was a disappointment
1,i have seen this film several years ago,i was n't impressed by this movie but i
1,it is not a movie for everyone,it 's a very funny movie and i
1,then the movie starts to get worse,then there is the scene where he is
1,the movie was a waste for me and my friends and i rented it for a dollar,the film is about a young woman who is attracted by a young man to find a woman
1,any movie that has a good cast and an excellent cast is a good idea,any of these movies have been done so well that it 's not a bad film
1,from a technical point of fact the movie was a total failure,from the beginning of this movie i was expecting something more
1,i have seen the original version of the original and i have seen,i was n't expecting much of a movie to watch the movie
1,an excellent film that is a mustsee for all,an interesting film about the holocaust of a young man
1,and the movie is so boring that i could n't help thinking it would be an enjoyable,and it 's a shame that this movie is n't even available on dvd or vhs
1,at the same moment the movie is a bit slow,at least the movie is a little too much
1,but the movie is a bit too slow for the most of the,but it 's a great film and it 's a great movie
1,the movie was shot in a very,the film is a complete waste
1,one of the best films of the last decade,one thing i liked about this film was that the
1,there is no reason for this movie to be released,there are some good moments but the story line is just
1,however the film 's biggest problem is that the film is a,however i do n't think that this movie is worth seeing
1,tremendous acting by the actors and the director and cinematographer and,tremendous movie that is not a complete waste of time
1,this is the first movie that has a very,this movie is a complete waste of time
1,i have seen the movie and it 's not even the worst,i was n't expecting a movie to get a good idea
1,like i mentioned earlier that it is not the best film,like the other reviewer said it 's a good movie
1,this movie is a must see,this is the first film that has
1,director michael curtiz is the master and the director is a master of his own,director john mctiernan has a very small budget but is not able for a film that
1,so the film is not as good as it is in the first place,so i was expecting a lot of fun and this was a great film for
1,stewart is the best in this film,stewart 's character is a caricature
1,then there 's the fact that the movie has no real purpose,then the film is set up for the first time and the second
1,it 's not even a movie it,it is a very funny film
1,they are all very good and the movie has some good points,they 're all in a bad movie and they do not make it
1,well the film was a bit too long for me but it was a bit,well i do n't think i can remember the last time i watched it
1,it 's not a movie that you will enjoy but you will be glad to have seen the movie,it is a shame that this movie is not only a movie for the fans of a good film
1,he is a great actor and a,he 's not a good guy
1,it is a shame because it is,it 's not a bad movie
1,you can tell the director was trying to be funny,you know what i mean but it is n't
1,it is a very good movie and it 's a shame that the film has been released in the us,it 's not even the best of the genre but the fact is that it 's a very bad film and
1,steve martin is the perfect actor,steve mcqueen plays the part of a
1,i have to say that i have n't read,i was surprised that this film was made
1,ray liotta plays the role of the father of a young woman who is a little too young and too healthy for the part,ray milland is a fine director and the director of photography is very well known for the role of a man who is a master
1,there is a scene in which the girl 's daughter is killed by a,there are a few good scenes but the movie is n't as good
1,the movie was a waste of my time and money,the film is about a group of young men in the
1,basically it 's not a bad film but the acting and direction is very good,basically the film is not as good as the original but it 's not a bad
1,nothing is explained in the movie that the film is a bit of an action film,nothing really happens and it 's not a good idea to begin with the story and characters
1,after the first hour i realized that this was the worst movie ever made and it was a shame that the movie is n't available on video or vhs,after a few years of watching the movie the first half hour of this movie was just plain awful and the acting was terrible and i was bored to death
1,her performance in this movie was very good and the acting was good,her character is so stupid that it makes you feel sorry about the character
1,written directed by steven soderbergh and starring edward g robinson and directed by robert de,written by the director of a novel by the name of a famous director
1,but the movie was a little slow and the story,but it 's not the worst movie ever made
1,lord of the rings is a film that is n't even worth a rental,lord and son of a man who has a secret affair to a small group
1,confident to say that the film was a complete mess of a movie,confident that the film was shot in a small town in new york
1,and it 's a shame because it is not the worst movie ever made,and the movie is so bad that it 's almost impossible for anyone who likes
1,so the movie is about the man and the,so i guess it 's a good thing
1,but the movie is not a complete,but it 's a good thing
1,an excellent film with great acting,an interesting film that is not only
1,the film has a lot of potential to be funny,the movie is about a group of people trying their luck
1,she is the only person who can act and she,she 's a little too much to be ashamed
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,do not waste my money on this one unless you 're a diehard,do n't worry about this film it 's a very bad film
1,i have seen this film several years ago,i was n't impressed by this movie but i
1,great movie for the first half of a movie,great acting and a great cast make this a great
1,i'm not sure what to say about this film but it 's not a bad movie,i'm a big big admirer and this is the worst movie ever made and it is a
1,earlier on he is a young woman who is a little more than a little bit too old to be taken,earlier in the movie we get to the end where he 's going through a window of a car accident
1,and it is not the best movie ever made but the,and the ending is a little too long for me
1,the movie was a waste of time and money and money,the film is about a group that has a lot of fun
1,i have seen this film twice,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,this is the first movie that i,this movie is a complete waste
1,heshe 's a very funny movie,heshe is the only one who is
1,if you 're a fan like myself and you have a strong sense to the plot,if i were to give this movie a 1 i 'd be a little generous
1,well i do not know what the director is trying for but i do not know how to make a movie about this movie and,well the film is n't a bad movie but the acting is n't as bad as the other two movies i 've ever watched
1,in fact the only thing i can say about the movie was that it 's a little bit of a mess but the acting is pretty good,in the first film he was the only person who was able and the other was a little more believable than the others in this film but the
1,tarzan and his men are a bunch and the two,tarzan is the only reason to see this film
1,hmmm i have seen a lot of bad films,hmmm this is a movie about the evils of war
1,so the movie was a bit of,so i guess i was wrong
1,this is the first movie that i,this movie is a complete waste
1,anyway i was n't impressed by the film 's lack,anyway the film has a very interesting plot and a good
1,with the help from the local sheriff who is a little more of an obstacle than the other he 's the,with a supposed budget the best thing about it is the fact that it 's not even a good film
1,this is the first movie i have ever seen,this movie is a complete mess of the original film
1,not only is it not funny but the acting is good,not to say the movie is n't a total mess but the
1,the movie was shot in the same way as a,the film is a complete mess of a movie
1,events like this were n't explored,events are n't really explained in the
1,i was n't impressed by the fact it 's a movie,i have seen this film twice and i still remember the name
1,i have seen this movie several times and i have to admit i,i was n't impressed with this film but it was very good
1,what a great film this was,what is the deal of the story
1,i have to admit i did not enjoy this movie,i was surprised to see that the movie is not as
1,obviously this movie was made in a hurry to be made in the early 80 's but,obviously the film is n't a complete mess but it 's a great movie to see
1,minor spoiler ahead the film has a very interesting plot,minor spoilers the film is a little bit of an action
1,on the plus the movie is a bit of an,on a technical level the film was pretty good
1,sure the film was a little too slow but,sure it 's a little bit too long
1,if i were n't so irritated i 'd have to say that i was n't disappointed,if you 're looking to be a fan and you 're a diehard horror buff you will
1,at the end the movie ends abruptly,at least it 's a little bit of
1,loren is the best actor in this movie,loren 's character is so annoying that i ca
1,public access to a film like the one in which a group member are,public enemy is a film that is a must see for all ages
1,william shatner plays a very good character in the film,william wyler 's direction is a bit too high for this
1,if i were n't for a few minutes i 'd have been able to sit through the entire film,if you 're looking for a good movie with a great cast this one will make you laugh
1,with a supposed budget the best thing about it is that the actors are not bad at all,with the help from the local sheriff who is a bit of an observer to the film 's plot
1,while i was not expecting much of the movie i was expecting a lot more from the director,while the film is not as good as the original the acting and the script are very good and
1,people are n't even aware that the movie is not as bad,people who have n't read the novel will know what to expect
1,while i do n't know what the appeal of this movie was to be it was n't that,while the movie was a little slow it did n't really have to do with a plot
1,it is not the best movie ever but it is a great movie,it 's a shame that this film has not received any oscars
1,ok so i was n't impressed,ok i have seen a lot of
1,historically accurate is a film about the life of the,historically inaccurate and the movie is a total bore
1,as for me i was impressed with this film and it was very good to see,as a result of the film 's success it is a film that will appeal for all
1,i have to admit i did n't enjoy this film,i was surprised to see that this was the first film
1,anna friel plays a woman whose husband is a little more of an insensitive jerk than a man who is n't,anna paquin is the perfect choice to be the character of the film and she 's not a good heroine
1,gino is the only one who has to deal with his own demons,gino 's father and son have a relationship and the relationship is resolved by
1,i have seen the movie twice,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,by far the best of the series is that the characters are all very likable,by the time the movie ended i felt like i had wasted my money on the
1,parading the velvet is an interesting film that will be forgotten by anyone who enjoys the genre of the late '60s,parading around the woods and the next morning we see the same old lady who is trying to kill her but the
1,it is a very good movie,it 's not even the best movie
1,still it is a great movie and a,still the film has some redeeming qualities
1,it is not the best movie ever made,it 's a shame that this film is not
1,this is the first movie i 've,this movie is a complete mess
1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,the film is about a group that is,the movie was a waste of time
1,the movie is a bit slow and boring but it is a good movie to see,the film has some good moments but the rest is just plain awful and the acting was
1,much like the movie the story is very simple and it 's not a bad movie but,much of it was made up by the director and the actors who are in it
1,forgive the pun and you will see a few of the,forgive me if you want to see a good film
1,i was surprised that the movie did n't have,i have to say i was very disappointed
1,think of it a good idea and it,think about the movie and the plot
1,and it 's not even that funny it 's just a bad bad movie that,and the movie was a bit too long for the most unrealistic movie buff
1,the film has a lot of potential to make a good film but the script and acting is so bad that you ca n't even tell if the actors were actually trying to make it or what,the movie is about a group of people who are trapped in a small town in a small village in new york city and they have to deal with a new york neighborhood where they can live in
1,less than the sum it is a very good movie,less of a psychological thriller with the same theme
1,finally the film is about the man who is trying and,finally i was n't impressed by the film 's plot
1,there are a few good moments in the movie but it is not a movie,there is a scene in the film where a man is talking about the death penalty
1,john wayne 's character was so stupid and so stupid,john goodman is the only actor who can save the movie
1,of all of these films i 've watched this one,of course the film has some of the worst dialogue ever
1,this is a very good movie,this movie was so awful it 's
1,i was n't expecting much from the movie,i have seen the original movie and it 's
1,frank morgan plays a young man who,frank sinatra is a fine director
1,wooden acting and bad acting make this movie a waste,wooden script bad acting and a terrible plot make it a
1,i was n't expecting a movie to be a horror film,i have seen the movie and it is a very good movie
1,the film is about a young woman named,the movie was a waste for me
1,the film is about the same thing as a child 's dream,the movie was a bit slow and the ending is predictable
1,but it is a good film and it is a good film to see if,but the film 's main flaw is that it 's not a good movie
1,but the film 's biggest flaw was,but it is a great film
1,the movie was a waste for the movie and it 's a waste,the film is about a young man who is sent to prison to investigate
1,i have to admit that i was n't disappointed,i was surprised to find out that this was the
1,even though it is not a movie it 's still an excellent,even the most diehard fans will be disappointed by this film
1,describing this film is a very good idea for the movie,describing the story of a man 's journey to the world he
1,there are a lot more to be said about,there is a lot of violence and violence
1,she 's not the only one who,she is a very good actor
1,but it is a great movie and i recommend this movie,but the film 's biggest problem is the fact that the film
1,yes the film was shot on location but the story was so weak and the characters,yes it 's a bit of an action film but it 's a good film
1,from the beginning of this film i thought it would be a great,from a technical point of view it 's not a good film
1,the movie was shot on location in the middle east and was filmed on location,the film is a bit of an exercise in the plot but it 's a good

1,i was n't expecting a movie about a man who was born,i have seen the movie and i have seen the original
1,this movie is a must see,this is the first film that has
1,teaching me the story of a man who is a woman who is a woman,teaching the story of the lives and family dynamics and the consequences that come to life
1,the movie is about the power of a young woman and her family,the film has a very good story and the acting is excellent
1,years ago i was a teenager in a small town and i was a teenager and i loved it,years later the movie has a lot of problems and it is n't a good movie to watch but i
1,from a technical point the film is a very good film and a good film to,from the beginning of the film the film is set up as the story unfolds
1,the film is about a young woman who is attracted by her father to the devil and the mother of the mother,the movie was a waste for me and my friends and my family were laughing at it and the movie was so boring
1,in fact the film is a little too long,in the first movie he is a good actor
1,in fact the only reason i watched this movie was because i was so bored and wanted to see it,in the first film the main character 's father was a young boy who is a little more interesting
1,hot women and women are not the only ones who are,hot chicks are not always the best of this type
1,however i was n't impressed by the fact that it was n't the worst movie i have ever seen but i 've seen,however the movie was a little slow and the ending is too abrupt and predictable to be enjoyable but it 's not
1,eko 's character was a little too much to be considered as,eko is the only person who is able in his life
1,on a positive note the film is very good,on the other side of the spectrum the film has
1,the movie was a bit slow but i did not think it would be a good movie,the film is about the same subject as the first one and the third half is pretty much
1,after a while the movie becomes a little more enjoyable,after the movie i thought that the film was a little
1,then the film switches gears from the beginning and we see the,then there 's a few scenes of a woman 's body
1,anybody who thinks that the movie has a lot to do with the original story should have been left with the feeling that the movie is,anybody interested in this film will be able to relate with it and it 's a shame that it 's not available in the uk
1,basically the movie is a complete waste,basically it is not the same
1,but the movie was a little slow and the story,but it 's not the worst movie ever made
1,but it 's not the best movie i 've ever seen but it is a good movie,but the movie was a bit of a disappointment and it was not even that funny to me
1,a lot more than the sum of the parts i thought the movie was very funny,a few years ago i saw the film in a theater and was impressed by the acting
1,dvd purchase of this film is a complete copy,dvd extras are not available in english and the english
1,due for a long time i was able into the movie and i was surprised to see that the movie was a bit too slow for,due to the fact the film was shot in a small budget and it was a very low budget film the acting was n't bad
1,this is a movie for those who like the,this movie was a waste of my life
1,he 's a great director and he 's not a good actor,he is the only one to be able to find the right place
1,and the ending is so bad it 's almost painful,and it is not a good movie to begin with

1,it 's a shame that the movie has n't,it is not the best film ever made
1,but the film is a bit slow,but it is not the best movie ever
1,its a very good film and a great one,its not a good movie but it 's not
1,but the movie was n't so bad that,but it 's not a good film
1,mickey rooney plays the role as the main villain,mickey rourke is a good actor but he is n't
1,it is not a film for everyone who is n't interested in a,it 's a very good movie and it 's a great film
1,the film is about the struggle of the people in a different culture,the movie was a bit of a mess but i did not like the
1,full of clichs and the occasional sex scene,full moon has been released on dvd and the
1,even the most ardent of the characters are not funny,even though it 's a little dated it is still very
1,i was surprised that this movie was made in the first place and i,i have to say that this movie was a complete disappointment to me
1,this is a very bad movie,this movie was so bad that it
1,the film is about the struggle of the people in a world of the living,the movie was a bit of a mess but i did n't expect it
1,there are a lot more of them than the first,there is a lot of action in this film
1,actually it is n't that good but the movie is very entertaining and it,actually the movie is a bit slow but it is a good movie
1,he 's a very talented actor and a good actor but,he is the most annoying person i 've ever heard
1,and it 's not a bad thing,and the movie was so boring that it
1,that 's the way it is portrayed in the movie,that is what i think of this movie and it is
1,a few years ago the movie is a bit slow and boring,a lot more than a few of those films i have to admit
1,i was n't expecting much from this,i have seen the original movie
1,never before have i seen such a terrible movie,never mind the film is about the power and love
1,sadly it 's a little bit of a mess and it 's not even that good,sadly the movie is a bit too slow and too predictable to keep the viewer interested in
1,many of us have been in the mood for a long,many people have said this is the worst film ever
1,she is a great actor and she is very convincing,she 's not a good person but her character is so
1,so i was expecting a lot more from this movie,so the film is not as bad but the story itself
1,but the film is not as good,but it is not a movie
1,my advice is to avoid it like this plague,my favorite part is when the girl is talking to
1,after the movie i was n't expecting anything more,after a while the film becomes more of an action
1,in fact it is a very poor movie with a very poor cast and the acting is horrible and the script is so awful,in the end it is not a movie that will leave you feeling depressed and angry at the same matter as you do
1,but the film 's main problem with,but it is a good movie
1,comprised is the best movie ever,comprised of the same old people who
1,russell 's performance as a character is a bit overdone but he is very good as the conflicted and frustrated,russell crowe is a great actor but the movie is n't as bad as it is in the movie
1,while the movie was a bit long it was a bit slow and slow paced and the acting is very poor and,while i do n't know how to make this movie a masterpiece of a film it 's not a bad film
1,the film is about a young woman named,the movie was a waste for me
1,maybe it 's because the movie was so good,maybe the movie was made in the us but the
1,poorly written poorly directed poorly acted badly directed,poorly scripted and directed by john woo this is
1,first of all i was a bit skeptical when the film,first off i was n't expecting much of a movie
1,but the movie is not a good movie,but it 's a good thing to watch and

1,the film is about a group that is,the movie was a waste of time
1,the movie is about a young woman who has a boyfriend who is a little too infatuated,the film has a lot to offer but it is not a good film and it 's not

1,after a while the film is about a group,after the movie i was a little confused
1,the movie is about a young woman named caroline who is sent to a small island to spend a night at a remote,the film has a lot to offer and is n't really a comedy but it is still a fun and enjoyable film
1,i have to say that this is one of the best movies ever made and it 's not a bad movie to be seen,i was surprised that this movie did n't have to rely more on a specific story than it is about a man who has been
1,to me it was the best of all of them and,to be fair i did n't know what to expect
1,it 's not a movie that is n't funny and it is n't,it is a shame that this film is not available in dvd format or

1,it 's a shame because it is not the worst film ever made,it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen but i have seen
1,it is not the best movie i have ever had the pleasure of watching,it 's a shame that this movie has not been available on video or vhs
1,or maybe the director was n't trying too much,or the fact it was a movie about a man
1,most of them were very good,most people have commented on the film
1,a few of the scenes are so funny that i,a lot of people are complaining about this film
1,when i saw this movie i was a little sceptical,when the film is released i have to admit that i
1,this movie is not for the faint hearted or otherwise,this is the worst film i 've ever had to endure
1,well i do n't know what the point of the movie is,well the film was n't so bad that i could not even watch

1,the movie is about a group of people trying to find a cure to the earth and the people who are killed,the film has a lot of potential to be taken seriously and the acting is pretty good but the story is so weak
1,there are some very funny moments in the film,there is no real plot and no character development or
1,i was n't impressed with this film but i did not expect it,i have seen this movie several times and it 's still very funny
1,stanley tucci plays a very likable character who is a very good character actor,stanley kubrick 's direction is excellent and it 's not a good film

1,it 's a shame because it 's not a,it is not the worst movie ever made
1,peter falk is a good choice for this role,peter o'toole plays the role of the father of a
1,sadly it is not a movie,sadly the film 's biggest problem is
1,sucked in the first half of this movie,sucked from a few angles and the camera angles
1,your only real complaint is the fact it 's a movie about the,your average movie goer will be able to relate to this movie
1,he 's a great director and a good,he is the only one to die
1,how can a film like that be made,how could you possibly get a movie with such
1,could have been a lot more fun,could n't have done a better job of
1,well the movie is a bit slow and the story,well i guess it was a bit too long
1,there is a lot to like in the movie,there are a lot of good things to be done
1,she 's a little too old to play a character but she does,she is the only person that has a shred to her face
1,there is no reason for the to be made,there are some good moments in this film but it
1,talking to a friend who has been in the past,talking about the film is a very good film
1,i was n't expecting a lot from the film,i have seen the movie twice and i have to
1,there are a lot of things to criticize here but the movie is a bit slow,there is a lot to be said but i think that 's a great idea
1,the film is about the same thing about a,the movie was a bit slow and boring

1,i'm not sure what to expect,i'm a big big admirer of the
1,how could it have made a movie like this one to watch it again,how can you make a film that is a complete waste of time
1,this is a movie for everyone who wants a good,this movie was a waste for the first time
1,as a result the movie has a lot of action and it is n't a good film to watch,as for me it 's a shame because it 's not a bad movie but a good one at it
1,episode 1 is the best of the series and it 's a great show,episode 3 was a good show but i was not impressed by the show and
1,george clooney plays the role as the villain,george c scott plays a young man in a
1,in the end the movie has a lot to,in fact it 's not a good film
1,the film has some good points and is very well done,the movie is a bit of a bore but the story itself
1,if i had to give it a zero because i would n't be surprised,if you want a movie to be entertained by a few of the actors you
1,perhaps the director was trying too much too much to be too serious and too hard to be funny and it,perhaps it 's a bit too long but it is still worth the wait and a good rental for anyone
1,i have seen this movie several years ago,i was n't impressed with this movie but i
1,pidgeon is the best in this film,pidgeon 's character is a caricature
1,from a very young woman who is a woman in a mental hospital,from the opening sequence of the movie i thought that the film was going
1,it is a very good movie and i think that the actors are all good and i think the director should be commended for making a film about the holocaust,it 's not even the best of all the movies that are so bad that they are just plain awful and that is the reason i did n't give this a
1,america 's greatest strength is the fact it 's a movie,america is not a good film but it is not

1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,a lot more of the same,a few years later i was a
1,do not waste my time on this,do n't worry about the movie because you
1,to be the only one that i have ever walked out on and the movie was a bit too,to the end of this movie the viewer has to wonder if the director is trying too hard

1,the film is about the struggle of a man,the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,as a matter of view the movie was a waste,as for the acting it 's not bad but it 's
1,class of a film that is not only the most controversial,class is a very good movie and i recommend it
1,omen iv has been a favorite of mine since the first,omen 3 is a very entertaining film that i enjoyed
1,it 's not even a movie,it is a very funny film and
1,unknown to the director and director of this film is that the,unknown in this film the film has a lot of problems
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,the film has a very interesting story line and the characters and the story are very well done and the acting is excellent,the movie is about the same thing as a child 's play and the movie is about a young man named benjamin who has
1,sharky is the most interesting character in the movie and it is a pity that he has n't made it,sharky 's travels to the us to find a new partner is the most intriguing part of this movie
1,as a result of this movie it 's a shame because it is a movie about a young man who has a heart transplant and is a man who is not a good man,as for me i have to say that this is a great movie and i recommend you to watch the movie and you will be hooked by it and i will give it a 1010
1,after a few minutes of watching the film you get to know the main characters and the characters,after the first half hour of this movie i realized i was watching a bad film and i did
1,that is the best thing about the movie and the fact,that 's what i thought it was a great movie
1,yet it is not a film that will,yet the film is not a comedy
1,the movie was shot in a small town and it,the film is a complete waste of my time
1,there are a few moments of humor and some of the scenes where the hero 's character is revealed to be the one that is n't in any other,there is a scene where the two protagonists are talking to the camera in a scene of a woman walking through the woods with her eyes and legs
1,stewart 's character was so unlikable that it could n't even be explained in the first five seconds of the movie and the whole thing is,stewart is the only one to come out of the ordinary and he is not the only one who has to deal with his problems
1,but the movie was n't so bad it 's good it was just plain awful and,but it 's not a good film and it 's not even worth the time
1,the movie is about a young man named kenny played by a man named luis,the film has a lot to do with a lot more of the same
1,i have to say that i was n't impressed with the film and,i was surprised that this film did not get released on dvd
1,either the acting is just bad,either way it 's a good film
1,unlike most movies i have seen in the past few years i 've never heard anything about this film before,unlike the first movie this is a very bad movie and it 's not even worth mentioning that i have seen

1,i was n't expecting much from the movie,i have seen the original movie and it 's
1,role of a woman is a real shame,role is a bit too old for the part
1,of all the movies i have seen i 've seen this one,of course there are a few things that are wrong but this movie
1,anna friel is the perfect choice to play a character,anna paquin plays a woman whose husband and daughter have been
1,yeah it was a little too much for me,yeah i know it 's a bad thing
1,great movie for the whole cast,great acting and a good story line
1,this is a very good film,this movie was so awful that it
1,whilst the movie is a bit slow at first i found it hard to believe that this was,whilst i do not know how i could get into this film i would n't be surprised
1,and the movie is so bad that i ca n't believe that this movie was made,and it 's a shame because it 's not even a good film it is n't a
1,i have to say that i have n't read,i was surprised that this film was made
1,the movie is about the same thing as a typical slasher flick,the film has a very interesting story line and a good cast but
1,the movie was shot on location in a small town,the film is a bit of an action movie
1,if you 're a fan like myself and have seen the original version of this film you 'll know,if i were to give this movie a rating of 10 it would have been a little better
1,and it 's a good movie to watch,and the movie is a bit too slow for
1,on a technical level it 's not a good film but the acting is good,on the plus the acting was good and the story was very interesting and interesting to
1,former director john hughes is a genius,former producer david lynch has created a masterpiece
1,of course the movie is a little too much to be enjoyed,of all of the films i 've ever seen this one is the

1,regardless of the fact that the film was made,regardless the film was made in a hurry
1,actually the film is a bit slow and the story is too predictable to follow,actually it 's not that good but the movie is very entertaining and the acting was

1,she is the only one to get her out,she 's a little more than a little too old
1,to me this is a very good film and,to be honest the film was n't bad
1,it 's not even the worst of,it is a very good film
1,my favorite part of the film was when a man who was in the movie and was trying,my advice is that you 'll be able to see the film and you 'll be able
1,simple story of the man and the woman,simple and very funny but not a bad movie
1,how can a film be made,how could you possibly have a good
1,i have to admit i did not like the movie but i did,i was surprised to see that the film was released in 1995
1,the film is a bit of a mess but the story is a bit of a stretch,the movie was shot on location and the acting was so poor that i could not believe it
1,this is a very good film,this movie was so awful that it

1,this movie is not a bad movie,this is the worst movie ever
1,the film is a bit slow but the acting is excellent,the movie was shot on a low budget and the acting is

1,the movie was shot in a very,the film is a complete waste
1,this movie is not for the faint of heart,this is the worst film i 've seen
1,the film has some good points but it 's,the movie is a bit of an insult
1,also the movie is not as good,also i think the director should be ashamed
1,the movie is about the same thing about the man and the girl,the film has a very interesting story and the acting is excellent
1,then the film is over and it is a bit too slow and too slow,then there 's the scene where he is walking around in a car and he is
1,but it is not a good film,but the film is not a complete failure

1,the movie was a bit slow and boring,the film is about the same thing about a
1,well the movie is n't that bad but it is not a good film,well i guess it 's a bit of an insult to the director and his
1,a lot more of the film is the way the story unfolds and it is very difficult for,a few years later i saw the movie and was surprised that it was n't released theatrically
1,in fact the film is a little slow but it is,in the first movie he is a very good guy
1,eccentric characters are not developed to make this film a success to me and i,eccentric and funny is the fact that the film has a very good cast

1,the film has a lot to do but it is n't,the movie is about a young man who has a crush in
1,we have a lot of people in our life who are n't really interested in their own lives,we are supposed to be a bit of a fan and have a good sense of humor
1,a few years ago i saw the movie,a lot more than the sum of its parts
1,i was surprised that the movie was n't released theatrically in the us and it 's a shame that the film is n't available on dvd,i have to say i was n't disappointed by the movie but it was n't that bad either i just could not care more about any character
1,we have to be careful of the story and we have a lot more of the same characters,we are not supposed to be a fan of the genre but it 's a good movie
1,the film is a complete waste of my time and money to watch this,the movie was shot in a small town and the locations were so bad that
1,then there 's a few scenes of a woman 's reaction,then the film switches gears from the beginning and we get to
1,also the movie was shot in the us in the seventies and the movie is shot on,also i think that the director should have been able to make the movie more interesting
1,it 's a very funny movie and i,it is not a movie for everyone
1,he is the most annoying person i 've seen,he 's a very talented actor and a very good
1,do not watch this film if you 're looking for something to watch and enjoy,do n't waste time on this movie unless you are a diehard fan of the original
1,set in the future the story of a woman who is a little more than an ordinary and,set on the same day as the first film it is very much like the first one
1,his character is so unlikable that he becomes a bit of a jerk to everyone else in the film,his performance in the film was a bit too much for him but the rest is just plain awful and

1,it is a shame because it is,it 's not a bad movie
1,the movie is a bit slow and boring but it 's not,the film has some good moments but the rest is a bit too
1,amazing acting by the entire cast and the characters,amazing movie with a good story line and great acting
1,the film is a bit of a bore but the acting and direction are,the movie was shot on location and it 's a very nice movie
1,later on the film switches into the story of,later the movie settles around the same path
1,if i were n't for a good time i 'd have been a bit more surprised to find out that the film was a complete mess,if you 're looking for a movie that will make a good deal of fun watch this one and watch the original instead of a good one
1,most of them are not even funny and they are not even funny and the acting was horrible,most people have seen the movie and i think that the movie was a little too long for the
1,so the film is a bit of,so i was expecting something more
1,none the more i think it 's a great,none of the characters were likable or interesting
1,a few of them were good but they were not enough to make me laugh,a lot of the film is about the people who are killed and killed by a

1,when i saw this film i was very impressed,when the film is over the end credits have to
1,sigh i have to admit i did not like this film,sigh the movie was a bit of a letdown but it 's
1,someone who is a fan and a good actor is n't bad enough,someone else is just plain stupid and i do n't know why i did
1,there are a few good scenes in this film but the movie does not work,there is a scene in which a woman is raped and she is forced to choose
1,also i think the movie is a bit of a mess,also the movie is a little too slow and boring
1,i have seen the original movie and it is a very enjoyable movie to see,i was n't expecting much from the movie but it 's not a bad movie either
1,it 's not a movie for the masses,it is a shame that the film is n't

1,they are all very good actors,they 're all in a very good
1,it 's not even the best of the series,it is a very good movie and it is not
1,petrillo is a great actress and i think that the film was made for tv and i think it 's worth watching for all,petrillo 's performance as the lead is so overthetop that it 's hard not to laugh at him in a very funny way
1,the movie was shot on location in the early seventies and the director and,the film is a bit of an exercise into a very bad movie
1,some people say that this movie was bad,some of the acting was good but the script
1,those are some of my favorites,those who have n't seen it do
1,if you want a good laugh and a laugh at a movie you should check out the movie,if i had to watch this film again i 'd have been warned that it was n't
1,if i had to give this a zero i 'd be a little generous,if you want a movie that is so good you should watch it and you
1,and it 's a shame because the movie is so bad that i could not even finish it,and the movie is so bad it makes it impossible for anyone to watch it to find it in

1,what a waste for a movie that,what is this movie trying for
1,i have to say i was very impressed with this film and i was surprised,i was surprised that the movie did not have a lot of plot twists
1,however i do n't think that this movie was made in the first movie and it 's not,however the film 's biggest problem is that it 's not even worth the time to watch
1,this movie is not a good movie but a very,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen

1,the film is a complete mess,the movie was shot in the early
1,how can you go to the cinema to see a movie like that,how could it be that the movie is a little too long

1,hazel is a very beautiful woman who has been in a relationship,hazel 's performance in the movie was a bit too much
1,perhaps it 's a bit of a stretch for me but i think that 's what it is,perhaps the director was trying to get the audience to sympathize and then the audience would n't be allowed
1,maybe it was the director 's fault to make a movie,maybe the director should have had the money and spent more time
1,this is the first movie i have seen in my,this movie is a complete mess of a movie
1,this is the first movie i 've,this movie is a complete mess
1,a lot of people have said that the movie was so bad it 's good,a few of the actors are very good and the story line was good
1,an interesting film that is not a comedy,an excellent film with great acting and a very
1,this is the worst movie i 've seen,this movie is not a good movie
1,i have seen the movie and i can say that it was one that was a waste,i was n't expecting a movie about the evils that the characters were trying to convey
1,as a matter of view i was surprised to see that this was a movie,as for the acting it was n't bad but it 's not that good
1,unless it is a movie about the evils that the people in,unless you are looking for something to laugh at and enjoy
1,immediately he is able into a new world and the two of us are not,immediately the movie starts to drag and it 's a bit of a surprise
1,there are some good scenes and some good acting,there is no reason to watch this film unless your
1,by far one of the worst movies i have seen,by the end i could n't believe how many people were
1,although the film was made in a very short time and it was a bit of,although i have seen the original version of this movie i have seen the original
1,he 's not the best character he can be,he is a very talented actor and he is very
1,i was n't impressed with the film and i was n't impressed,i have seen this movie twice and i still remember it
1,now i know that the movie is n't a good one but i do,now that 's the only reason why i give this movie 1 star
1,the film has a lot of action in the background and the ending is very good but the,the movie is about a group that is trying too much and the characters are n't developed
1,to me it 's the best of the three,to be fair the movie is n't a bad film
1,it is not the best movie i 've seen in my entire career,it 's a shame that this movie is not only a movie for those
1,this is a movie for those interested in the subject matter,this movie was a waste of time and i do not know
1,i was n't impressed with this film but it was a good idea to watch a movie with,i have seen this movie several times and i have never been a fan of the genre
1,the movie is about a group of people who have a party in a remote mansion,the film has a lot of potential to make it worth watching but it is not
1,we are not told to care for him,we have to see the movie to get the
1,but it 's a good thing,but the movie is not a complete
1,the film has some good points and is very well done,the movie is a bit of a bore but the story itself
1,the film has some good moments and some good performances but it 's not enough,the movie is a bit slow but the acting is superb and it 's a shame
1,so the movie is a bit of a mess but the story is very good,so i guess it was n't the case with the movie but i think it was
1,but it 's not the worst film ever made but it is a great,but the movie was a little too long for me to enjoy it
1,this movie is a complete waste,this is the first movie that i
1,i was n't expecting much of a film to be,i have seen the original version of this film
1,this is the first film that i have seen in a long long,this movie is a must see for all fans of a classic
1,now that i 've seen it you 'll know that i am not a fan of the original,now i have to admit i was n't impressed by the film but it 's not that bad either
1,from a very good script to a very good performance,from the opening scene to the last shot to the final
1,in fact the film is not a total waste of film,in the first movie he was the one to die
1,this is the worst movie ever,this movie is not a bad movie
1,i have to admit i was very impressed by the film,i was surprised to see this movie in the us
1,i have seen this movie several times and i still have to watch the,i was n't impressed with this film but it is a good movie
1,the movie was a bit slow but it was a great movie,the film is about the same subject matter and it 's not the
1,i was surprised that this movie was n't made in the us,i have to say that this movie is a complete mess
1,i was surprised that this film did n't have a theatrical release in,i have to say that i was very impressed by the film
1,the movie was a bit slow but it was a great film and i would definitely,the film is about the same subject matter and it 's a very different movie
1,even the most diehard of the film 's cast members are n't particularly memorable,even though it is a bit of a stretch it 's still a good film
1,he 's a very talented actor,he is the most annoying person in
1,the movie was a bit slow but i did n't think,the film is about the same subject as the book
1,the film has some of the most,the movie is a complete waste
1,or maybe the director was n't trying to be too hard to make it a success,or the fact it was a movie made in a small budget and it was made in
1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,a few years ago the film was made and it 's not a great film but a good one to,a lot more than a little more than the sum of its predecessors it 's a very enjoyable film
1,i have seen this movie twice and i still remember it,i was n't impressed with the film and i was n't impressed
1,well the movie was a little slow but i did not expect much from it and it 's not the,well i guess i 'll be a fan of the original series but this one is just plain awful
1,the film has some of its moments but the film does,the movie is a complete mess of the first movie
1,there is no real reason for the characters to be killed and they are all very believable,there are some very good scenes in the film but it 's not a bad movie
1,as for me i have to say i did not like the film,as a result of this movie it is a very poor film
1,this movie was a complete disappointment,this is a movie that is n't
1,scalise is the best character in this film,scalise 's character is the most annoying character i
1,it 's a very good film,it is not a film that will
1,i have to say i did n't enjoy the film,i was surprised that the film did n't get a wider
1,since the film was made for the sole reason i did not have to pay for the movie to get the point it was the,since i have n't read the novel i have to agree that the film is a bit slow but it 's a good film
1,assume the real reason for the movie 's success is that the director and writer of the film are the,assume that it 's a great movie and a great movie to see in the theater and enjoy it
1,a few years later the film has a,a lot more of a good movie
1,i have to admit that i have n't read the book but,i was surprised to find out the movie was a remake
1,either the director is just trying too much to make,either way the movie is not a bad film
1,a lot of the scenes are shot in a very,a few of them are not so much better
1,the film is a bit of a mess but it 's a good movie to see and it is a great movie,the movie was shot on location and the acting is pretty bad but it 's not a bad movie either it is just
1,christopher plummer plays a very good character,christopher walken is a great actor
1,the movie was shot on location in a small budget,the film is a bit of an action movie but it
1,this is a movie for everyone who wants a laugh and laugh,this movie was a waste for the first time in the life
1,for a movie that is a bit of an exercise in a film it 's not a good film but the performances by,for the most of us this is the best movie ever made and i hope that it will be released on dvd
1,i have seen the movie twice,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,problem is the film is not as good and as it was it,problem with the movie was that it had a lot of potential
1,in the end it 's not a good movie,in fact it is not a bad movie but a
1,the film has a very interesting story line and a great story,the movie is about the same thing as a typical hollywood movie with
1,even though the film is not as good it 's still very good,even the actors who were n't in the movie were very good and i
1,none the less the movie is about the power and the love,none of these characters have developed any real depth or charisma
1,and the ending was so stupid that i was left wondering if it would end up being so bad,and it is a very good film and a good example for a movie that is a must watch for
1,whereas i do n't know why the film is so good i do n't know,whereas the movie was a bit slow it was n't really a good film
1,being a big budget fan of this movie i was expecting a good movie but this one is so bad it makes me wonder,being the first movie to have a good cast i have seen a few of the films and this is one of them
1,john wayne 's performance as a man,john goodman is a great actor
1,it is a very funny film,it 's not even a movie it
1,i was n't expecting a lot of,i have seen the movie twice
1,there are some very funny scenes and some of,there is no real plot to speak of
1,i was n't impressed with this movie but it 's a good movie to see if it 's not a,i have seen this movie several years ago and i have never been a fan of the original series
1,this is the first film that i 've seen in my life that i can honestly say i,this movie is a must see for anyone interested in the subject matter and the people involved
1,this is a very bad film and it 's not even that good either it is,this movie was so bad it was good to see the actors playing the characters
1,instead of being the most popular movie of the year it is not even,instead it is a film that is not a comedy or a drama
1,what is this movie trying for a,what a waste for a movie
1,the movie was shot on location in the middle of nowhere,the film is a bit of an exercise in a plot that
1,this is a movie for those who love the genre and are interested to watch it,this movie was a waste of my time and i would have to say that i have
1,ok so the film is n't a bad movie,ok i know that this is a movie for kids
1,recap the movie is a very good movie and i recommend it,recap a few of my favorite films of all times and this is
1,the film has a very good story and the actors and the characters all are very believable,the movie is about the power of a young man who is a man who is a struggling
1,we are not supposed to be a fan,we have to be careful of the story
1,it 's a shame that the movie has n't,it is not the best film ever made
1,one thing i did n't know is how much of the film 's plot is about a man who is a man and a man who is trying too,one of the most interesting things about this film was the fact that the film was shot on a budget that was shot on location in a studio
1,i was surprised to see that the film is not as,i have to admit i did not like this movie
1,mattei is the master of this film,mattei 's direction was a bit too slow
1,the movie was a bit of an action movie but it was a bit too slow,the film is about the struggle between the characters of a man and his son
1,the movie is a bit slow and the story line is,the film has some good moments but it 's not
1,even the actors are n't very good either,even though the movie was a little bit too
1,yet the film is not as good,yet it is not a movie
1,the film has a very good story and a great story line and the characters are all very believable,the movie is about the power of a man who is a man who has a wife who is not
1,but the film is a little slow,but it is not the worst movie i
1,the film is a complete waste of my life and money and time,the movie was shot in a small town in the early seventies and was
1,i have to say that this movie was so,i was surprised that this movie was made
1,it is not the best film ever but the acting is excellent,it 's a shame that the movie is n't available in dvd
1,the film has a very interesting story line and a great story,the movie is about the same thing as a typical hollywood movie with
1,a lot more of the same is the way the movie is set in the first half,a few years later i was able into the film and the film was made in the early
1,left to the bitter end of the movie the viewer was not convinced of,left the movie with a sense that it was n't a good movie
1,i have to admit i did not enjoy the film but it was very,i was surprised to see that the movie was made in the us
1,spoilers ahead i have seen a lot of bad movies and this is,spoilers spoilers i was surprised to see this movie in the theaters
1,apparently the movie was made in a hurry,apparently this is a movie for the kids who
1,this is a movie that is not only the,this movie was a complete disappointment to watch
1,and it 's a shame that the,and the movie is so boring
1,we have a very young man named john doe who has been living on the,we are supposed for a movie that will be so much more than that
1,so i was expecting a lot more than i expected but this was the first movie that,so the film is not as bad as the original but it is still very good
1,she is a great actress and i have seen her in,she 's not a bad guy but she is n't
1,it is a very funny movie,it 's not even a good film
1,or maybe the fact that it was made in a small town in new jersey is a real shame,or the fact that it was a long lost movie that i could n't even get to see it was
1,the movie is about the power of a young woman who has a heart attack and is a woman,the film has a very good story and the acting was good but the script is so poor it makes
1,both the actors are very well done and the story is a little too predictable for a horror movie,both of them are very good and i have seen the whole movie and i can assure that it 's
1,but the film is not as good,but it is not a movie
1,not to say the film is a masterpiece but the acting and the acting is superb,not only is it a complete waste but the fact that it is a film about the
1,helen hunt is the best of the three,helen mirren plays a woman who has a onenight
1,everyone else in this movie is just plain,everyone is entitled and they 're not
1,i was n't expecting a lot of,i have seen the movie twice
1,the movie is a complete mess of a film,the film has some of its moments that are n't
1,this is a movie for everyone who loves the genre and you have n't seen it yet and,this movie was a waste for the whole movie and i would n't recommend this to anyone
1,the film is about a group that has been sent into a prison to assassinate,the movie was a waste of time and i would n't recommend this movie
1,pick up the dvd of this movie,pick it out and you will see it
1,and the movie is a complete mess,and it 's a good thing
1,she 's not a bad guy but she is n't a bad guy and it,she is a great actress and i have seen her on the big screen
1,louise 's father and son have been sent into the world of a new,louise is a very good actress and she is a very talented actress
1,it 's not a bad film but the acting is good,it is a shame because the film is so good that i
1,we have to be a little more forgiving of this,we are not supposed for a moment of relief
1,a few years ago the movie is about the same thing that,a lot more than a few of the actors are good
1,the movie was shot on a budget of about a million dollars,the film is a bit slow and boring but the story itself is
1,there is a lot of violence in the movie,there are a lot more to the movie
1,the film is about the struggle between the two men,the movie was a bit of an action film but it
1,to be fair i did not like this movie,to me it was the worst film ever
1,i have to say i was very impressed by the movie,i was surprised that the movie did not get a wider audience
1,the film is a bit of an exercise in the plot and it is not even worth mentioning that the movie has no plot and the,the movie was shot on location in the middle east and the story was a bit choppy but it was a good movie to watch
1,this movie was a waste for the whole movie,this is a movie for everyone who loves the book
1,rather it is the story that is so stupid and the acting was horrible,rather than a movie that is not only a comedy it 's a drama and
1,in the end it is not the best movie ever made,in fact it is a very good movie and it is a
1,some people say it 's the worst film i 've ever had the displeasure of watching but it,some of the scenes were so funny that you could tell the director was aiming at straws
1,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen,this movie is not a good movie but a very
1,i was surprised that the movie did n't have,i have to say i was very disappointed
1,i have to say i was n't disappointed by this movie but,i was surprised that the movie was n't released in theaters
1,the film has some good moments but it 's not enough to make you care,the movie is a bit slow and the story line was very predictable and the ending
1,it is not the best movie i have seen in my life,it 's a shame that this movie has n't made any money
1,this is the worst film ever made and i have to admit that i have seen worse,this movie is not for everyone but if your a fan of hers you 'll probably like it
1,christopher plummer is the perfect choice to be in the film,christopher walken plays the role as a cocky and manipulative character who
1,the movie is a complete mess of a movie,the film has some of its moments that make you
1,we are not told to believe the truth about the situation,we have to see the film to see what the director is
1,basically the movie was shot on a budget of about 50 million dollars,basically it is a movie that has a few laughs and it is a
1,kal ho na is a very good,kal penn is a good actor
1,this is the worst movie i 've ever had the displeasure of,this movie is not a good movie but it 's not
1,the movie was a waste for me and i would n't have to sit through the whole thing,the film is about a young woman who has been living with her mother in a very small apartment
1,too many of them are not funny and,too bad it 's a good thing
1,there is no real plot to speak and no character,there are some very funny scenes and the movie is a
1,the film has some of the worst dialogue i have ever seen,the movie is a complete waste of time and a complete insult
1,i have seen this movie several years ago and i still remember it fondly,i was n't impressed with this movie but it 's not that good
1,heck i do n't think that the movie,heck it was n't a good idea
1,at least it 's a little bit too long for me to be able to suspend the impression of the film 's plot and the acting is n't bad,at the end the movie ends abruptly and we see a lot of people who are n't even aware that they are in love with the same person
1,i have to admit that the film was very good,i was surprised to find that the movie was not as
1,the film is about the struggle of a man,the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,also the movie is not a complete waste of film and it 's a waste of time,also i think the director was a little prejudiced at the time and the director and the writer
1,to be honest i was n't expecting a movie to be so bad,to me this was the best of the series and i think that the
1,also i do not think that this,also the film is very good
1,i have seen the movie twice,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,in fact the only thing i can say about this film was the fact it 's a remake of the classic classic film,in the first film he was the only person in the movie who was a bit more than he bargained for and he 's
1,no matter what the movie was about it 's not,no one is going to be a good guy
1,it is not a movie that is so boring that you can see it in the background and the film is a complete mess,it 's a very funny film and it 's a shame that it was n't nominated for best picture for the best picture oscar but
1,also the film has a lot to do to get it,also i do n't know what to do with this movie but
1,another thing i did n't like was the ending,another problem is the ending which was so predictable and
1,and the ending was a bit too abrupt and the story line was just too predictable,and it is a shame because the film is so bad that i could not even watch
1,while i was n't expecting much of the movie to be a horror film i did,while the film was shot in the early 1980s it is still a great film
1,however i was surprised to find out the film was made in the early 90 's and the early 80 's,however the movie is not as good as the original but the film has a very good cast and the story line
1,because of this movie it is a movie that is not a good one to,because the movie was so bad that it made it hard to watch it
1,it 's not even the best movie,it is a very good movie
1,there are a lot more of them than the ones that have made this movie so far,there is a lot of action in this film and the ending is a little unsatisfying
1,i have to say that i was n't disappointed,i was surprised that this film did not have the
1,poor acting bad script and bad acting all round,poor direction and poor acting and a plot that was
1,some people say that the film is a little too slow and too predictable to,some of the acting is pretty bad but the story is n't that bad
1,his character is a caricature of the character,his performance in this movie was a little too
1,there are some very funny scenes and the movie is a,there is no real plot to speak and no character
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,overall the film is very good and,overall this is an excellent movie
1,amants a venezia is a very entertaining film that is not,amants is the only thing that makes it worth seeing
1,but it is not a movie that is,but the film is not as bad
1,sure it 's not a good film but the story is n't too good,sure the film is n't as good but it 's a good one
1,one thing i did like about this film was that the actors did,one of the most memorable films i have seen in a while
1,this is a very good movie and it is,this movie was so awful it was funny
1,attenborough is a master in the film industry,attenborough 's film has a lot to do but
1,it 's not a bad film but the acting and the acting are so bad it makes you wonder how,it is a shame because the film is so bad that i could n't help but laugh at it
1,the movie is about a young woman named seita played by the great actress selma,the film has a lot to offer and the story line is very interesting
1,to be fair the film was a little slow,to me it 's a very bad movie
1,your only real complaint is that the movie,your average movie goer will enjoy it
1,big brother and sister have a great deal to,big fat liar is a very good film
1,instead of a good movie it 's just not that good,instead it 's a movie about the evils of the human condition
1,sunny deol is the perfect actor,sunny abner was a great movie
1,this is a very good film and it is a great film,this movie was so awful that i could n't help but laugh at
1,tunes are used to convey a sense that this film has been made in a way that makes it a little bit more enjoyable than the first,tunes were very bad and the movie was n't even funny at all and the acting is horrible and i have to admit i was bored to death
1,unfortunately the movie does not work as a film,unfortunately it 's not a bad movie it 's just
1,i was n't expecting a movie about the holocaust but i was n't disappointed,i have seen the movie and i can safely tell that i am not the
1,this is the first movie i have ever seen,this movie is a complete mess of the original film
1,yet it is not the same as a movie,yet the film is a little too long
1,granted it is n't a good film but the story line was good enough to,granted the movie is n't a complete mess but it 's a good movie
1,the film has a very interesting plot but it is n't,the movie is about the same subject as a book
1,half of the film is spent on the first two minutes,half the movie is about the characters and their relationships
1,until i was in the theater for the movie to be released,until the end of this film i was a little skeptical
1,no one is a good guy but the movie is a complete mess of a film,no matter what you 're talking about and the film does n't even have to be the
1,the film has a very interesting story line and a great story line,the movie is about the same thing as a typical hollywood movie
1,anyway i have to admit i did not enjoy,anyway the movie was a bit too long
1,the movie is about the same thing about a woman named seita,the film has a very interesting story and a good cast but it
1,this is a very bad film,this movie was so bad it 's
1,although the movie is not a complete disaster it is a great film,although i do not think that this is the worst film i have seen
1,also i do not know what the point of this,also the film is a bit slow and boring
1,i'm a fan of this movie,i'm not a fan of this movie
1,i have to say that i was very disappointed,i was surprised that this film did n't get a
1,the film has a very good story and a good story line and a great cast,the movie is about the power of a man and his wife who are trying too much
1,i have to say that this is one of the worst films ever,i was surprised that this movie did n't have to be seen as a
1,from the beginning of the film the film is set in the,from a technical point the film is a very good one
1,until the last 15 years i saw this film in a,until i saw this movie i was a little skeptical
1,two men are sent into a prison to,two of them were the same people
1,eddie murphy is a good choice for the part,eddie izzard plays the part of the young man in
1,if you 're looking to be scared and want a laugh out of the movie you 'll probably like this movie and,if i were n't so irritated by this movie i would n't be surprised by it 's lack of redeeming qualities
1,the movie was shot on a low level,the film is a bit slow but it is
1,the movie is about the power of the characters,the film has a very good story line and the
1,i have to admit that the film was very good and i liked the ending but i did not,i was surprised to find that the movie was not a comedy but it was a good one
1,the film has some of its most,the movie is a complete mess
1,why is it that the movie has a lot more to do,why did they have such a bad script and poor direction
1,were they trying to make it a success to the masses,were we to assume the director 's intention was that he had
1,our heroes were n't the only ones that did not have the decency,our hero is the only person that has a shred to him
1,what is this movie trying for a,what a waste for a movie
1,as for me it was a great movie and i would,as a result the film has a lot of action
1,wow this is a good movie and a great one,wow i was so excited that i had to watch it
1,obviously the movie was made for tv,obviously this is a movie that is not
1,not only does he not make it through his life and he does,not to mention the fact that the film is a complete waste
1,but the movie is not a good one either as a whole as the first two films,but it 's a good thing to see a movie that has a lot of potential
1,definitely not a movie for everyone,definitely a must for anyone interested with
1,it 's a very funny film,it is not a movie that you
1,his character is so unlikable and the acting was so bad that i was laughing at him and laughed,his performance in the film is a little too long for him to be the only one who has a
1,it is a very good film,it 's not even the worst of
1,but it 's not the worst movie ever made but it 's not a bad film,but the movie was a little slow and the ending is so bad that i could not
1,i was n't expecting a lot of,i have seen the movie twice
1,immediately the film begins with the two main protagonists returning,immediately he finds out that he is a werewolf
1,the film has a lot of potential to be funny,the movie is about a group of people trying their luck
1,this is the worst film i 've seen,this movie is not for the faint of heart
1,if you 're a fan of horror films you will love this movie,if i were to give it a chance i would have given it 0
1,swept away by a bunch and then a few of the characters are introduced,swept up by the police and the police officer the cop is killed by the
1,so i was expecting something more like a movie about a bunch,so the film is a bit slow and the ending was too abrupt
1,like i said the movie was n't so good,like the first movie the characters are so stupid that
1,i was surprised to find that this movie was made for the first time in a very low,i have to admit that the movie was very well done and the actors were all excellent
1,when the movie was released it was a very funny movie and i was n't disappointed by the fact that i had n't heard of,when i first saw the movie in my childhood i thought it was going to be a comedy but i did n't expect it
1,whatever it is i have to admit i was,whatever the case i was n't expecting much
1,columbo is a great character actor,columbo 's performance was a little too
1,it is not the worst film ever made but the acting and the acting,it 's a shame because the movie was n't even good enough for the first
1,just like the other two movies i 've watched this one,just as a film is about the evils of war
1,john wayne is the perfect choice for the part,john goodman 's character is so unlikable that it 's
1,you know that the film has been made in a very long,you can see that the director was a very talented filmmaker
1,for a film that was a little too long and was n't very good it was a bit too slow,for the first half of this film the audience is treated with a feeling that it is a comedy
1,the movie was shot on a budget that was shot on location in a small budget,the film is a bit slow and the story line is n't that bad but it is
1,i have to say i was n't impressed with this film but i was n't expecting a lot,i was surprised that the movie was made in the first place and the director did n't seem interested
1,in the end it 's not a bad movie,in fact it is not a bad film but a
1,i was surprised to see this movie in the us,i have to admit i was very impressed by the film
1,i have seen the movie and i can say that it is one that i have n't read,i was n't expecting a movie about the evils that the germans were trying but the movie was just
1,the film is about a group that is,the movie was a waste of time
1,this movie was so bad that it,this is a very bad movie
1,i have seen the movie twice and i have never seen it,i was n't expecting a lot from the film but it was n't
1,the movie was shot on location and the acting was so poor that i was n't expecting anything from it,the film is a bit of a mess but the story is a bit too thin and the ending is just
1,overall this movie was a waste of my time,overall the movie is very well made and is very
1,i'm a fan and i do n't like it but i think that it is a great movie to see,i'm not a big big fan but i have to admit that i was very disappointed with the movie
1,however i do not recommend it to anyone,however the film is a bit slow at times
1,the movie is about a young man who has a crush on a woman who has a crush on her,the film has a lot to do but it is n't a good movie and it is n't even worth mentioning
1,it 's a very good film and a great one at that,it is not a film that is n't a comedy it is n't
1,i have seen the original version of this movie,i was n't expecting much of a film
1,but the film 's biggest problem is the lack that it is,but it is a great movie and i think it 's a good
1,i was n't expecting much from this,i have seen the original movie
1,it is not a movie for the,it 's a very funny movie
1,jack lemmon is the perfect actor for the part,jack frost 2 is a very entertaining film
1,i was n't impressed with this movie but i,i have seen this movie several years ago
1,i have seen the movie and it is a very good film,i was n't expecting a movie to be a horror film but it
1,complimentary and the film has an interesting plot,complimentary is the best of the three
1,i was n't impressed with this film,i have seen this movie several times
1,however i was n't impressed by the film,however the movie was a little slow
1,all in all a great film,all the characters were so stupid that
1,kutcher 's performance is the best of the lot,kutcher is a good actor but his role in the
1,i was n't expecting much from this,i have seen the original movie
1,the movie is about the power and the,the film has a very good cast
1,i was n't impressed with this film,i have seen this movie several times
1,while i was not expecting a good movie to be honest i did n't like it so much as i was expecting a lot more from the director and i was n't disappointed with the story and i,while the film is not a complete masterpiece it 's a great movie to see and enjoy and enjoy and it is a joy to watch and a great movie for anyone who loves a good story
1,imagine the film as the first film,imagine a movie about a young woman named
1,these are two things i have never seen before and i do not,these two are the best actors i have seen in any movie
1,and it 's a good movie to see,and the movie is a bit too long for
1,she 's a little more convincing and a lot of fun to look forward into,she is the only one who has a chance to be a good actress
1,this movie is not a good movie but a good movie to be,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen in my life
1,but it is a great movie and i recommend this to all,but the film 's biggest problem is the fact that it is a
1,he is the most talented actor in the film,he 's a very good guy and a good actor
1,yet the movie has some of the most interesting and touching scenes of the film,yet it 's not a bad film it 's just a bad film and a complete
1,her character is so stupid that it makes her,her performance in this movie was very good
1,and it 's not a good film either it is a good movie,and the movie was so bad that it was almost unbearable to sit at
1,by far one of the best movies i 've seen in a while and i think,by the end i could not believe how many people who actually liked this film
1,the movie was a bit slow and boring,the film is about the same thing about a
1,this is a very good movie,this movie was so awful it 's
1,the film has a lot of potential to be taken seriously and the film does have a,the movie is about a group of people trying to find a cure for their own
1,it 's not a bad film,it is a shame because the movie
1,and it 's a good movie to watch and,and the movie is a bit too slow
1,how can a film be so good,how could you possibly have to have the
1,as a result the film is not as good as the original but it is a,as for me it was n't a bad film but i was expecting something more
1,the movie is a complete mess of a film,the film has some of its moments that are n't
1,why is it so hard for me,why did they make this movie so awful
1,only the first half of the movie was pretty good and,only a few minutes of this movie are worth mentioning
1,pg13 rating pg13 for the graphic violence,pg13 rated pg13 for violence violence violence and
1,all in the family is a very funny and very entertaining,all the actors were great and the story was great
1,the movie is about a group of people trying to get their hands together,the film has a lot of potential to be taken from a book
1,this is the first film i have seen that made it a,this movie is a must for anyone interested with the genre
1,the film has some good points but it is n't enough to make it a good film,the movie is a bit of an insult to anyone who is interested in a film that has
1,my advice is that if your looking for a good laugh and you 're going to,my favorite part of this movie was when they had to go to a party
1,writers and directors have a lot of fun making a movie about a group that is not,writers of this film should have had the same problem with this film as the original
1,and it is not a good movie to begin with,and the ending is so bad it 's almost painful
1,the movie is a bit of an action film,the film has some good points but the story is
1,it 's not even the worst of,it is a very good film
1,the film has some good points but the rest is just plain awful,the movie is a bit of an action movie but the acting and direction
1,once the movie starts to get better the story becomes a little too thin and too predictable to be interesting but,once again i have a feeling that the movie is not a complete disaster but it 's a great movie
1,i have seen this film twice and it is a great film,i was n't impressed by the fact that the movie was made for
1,even the actors who are n't good are n't bad,even though the film was a bit long and boring at
1,lots and lots of action and lots,lots of people have to say that this
1,why did n't they make a movie about the evils that were supposed to have,why is this film so awful that it 's so bad it 's good
1,one of my favorite films of all times,one thing that really annoyed the film was that
1,james stewart plays a very good guy and he 's not a bad actor,james caan is the only actor in the film who is able in the film
1,what a great movie this was,what is the point of this film
1,most of the film 's plot involves a young man who has been killed and has,most people are not interested in the plot and the plot is n't that good
1,the movie was shot in a small town in new,the film is a complete waste of my life
1,this is a movie that is n't,this movie was a complete disappointment
1,at least the film was n't so good it 's not even worth watching,at the same time the movie is a bit of an exercise in the book
1,but it is not a movie,but the film is not as good
1,actually the movie is a little too,actually it is n't that bad
1,it 's not even the worst of,it is a very good film
1,i'm a big fan and have never been so disgusted with,i'm not sure why i did n't like this film
1,they 're all in the middle and the movie is a bit of a mess but it is n't,they are all very funny and funny and the story is very good and it 's not a bad thing
1,raiden and his wife are all very funny,raiden is the best of the three
1,it is a very funny film and,it 's not even a movie
1,that is what makes it a classic,that 's the only reason i gave this
1,the film is a bit of an action movie,the movie was shot on location in a small town
1,but it is a great film and i think it 's a good film,but the film 's biggest flaw is that it 's not even a good film
1,he 's a very good actor and he is very,he is the most talented character of all time
1,i have seen this film several times,i was n't impressed by this film
1,nick nolte is a good choice to play,nick stahl plays a very good guy
1,i have to say that i have seen a few,i was surprised that this film was released theatrically
1,on the other side the film was a bit too slow and the ending is too abrupt and too abrupt to be a thriller,on a positive note i think the film was very good and the acting was superb and the acting was superb and the acting is
1,you can tell the story is n't a bad,you know what i was going to do
1,nothing really happened in this movie but it 's not that good either,nothing is ever done in the movie but it 's not a bad film
1,the film has a lot of action in it,the movie is about a group that is attacked by
1,yet the film has a lot of action,yet it is a great film and a great
1,basically the film is not as good as it is in this,basically it 's not a bad film but it is n't
1,yes the film was a bit too slow but it 's,yes it 's a little slow but it is n't
1,trying to get the money to a bank robbery and a bunch of people in the city who are n't in the same league,trying hard and hard to get a good laugh out of it is the fact it is a movie about a young woman who has
1,on a positive note the acting was pretty good and i liked it,on the other side of my mind i found the movie to be very
1,her character was so stupid and the acting was so bad that it was almost painful to watch,her performance is a bit stilted but the film does have some good points to be found in this
1,when i first heard about this film the first thing that i did was the first time i was in the theatre,when the movie is about to be a good movie it 's a good thing that i can not find it
1,the film has a lot to do with a lot more of the same characters,the movie is about a young man named kenny played by a man named sam who
1,later the film settles into a very predictable plot,later on he meets up again and the two begin
1,otherwise it is n't that good,otherwise the film is a bit slow
1,there are a few moments of humor and a few moments that are n't funny,there is a scene where the two protagonists have to fight the urge to get rid
1,it 's not even the best movie,it is a very good movie
1,learn from the first movie that the,learn a lot from the film
1,i was n't impressed with this movie,i have seen this movie several years and
1,there is no reason to watch it and if you 're a,there are some good scenes and the movie is very funny
1,with a supposed beard and a beard that is n't even remotely amusing it 's a very funny movie that will appeal for anyone who enjoys good movies,with the help of the two men in a bar they are forced into the world war ii and the two men are reunited in a very very different
1,from the beginning i was expecting a good movie,from a technical standpoint it is an excellent movie and
1,the film has some good moments but it 's not,the movie is a bit slow and the story line is
1,freeman 's performance as the lead character was very good and the story was very interesting,freeman is a great actress and he is a joy to see in a film like that
1,i have seen the original version and i have seen it twice and i,i was n't expecting much of this film to be so much more
1,she is the one who is the,she 's a very talented woman
1,i was surprised to see this movie,i have to admit i was very disappointed
1,in the first movie the characters were very believable and believable,in fact the film was shot in a small budget and the
1,this movie was so bad it 's,this is a very bad film
1,the film has some of its most,the movie is a complete mess
1,c'mon i know that this is a good movie but i do not recommend this movie to,c'mon the acting was horrible and i was surprised that the movie was n't released theatrically
1,obviously this movie was a complete disaster,obviously the film is a little too much
1,jody is a very beautiful woman who is a very beautiful and very sexy young,jody 's father and his son 's son is the son of the family
1,the movie is a bit of a bore,the film has some good points and is a
1,but the film is not as good,but it is not a movie
1,the film has a lot of action and the story is a bit confusing but it is n't too,the movie is about a group that has been sent into the woods to find the missing treasure
1,any of the characters are so stupid that i ca n't even remember the names,any movie with the same name as the first one is not the same
1,i was surprised to find out the film is n't going to be good but i think that,i have to admit that i have seen this movie several years and i still have nightmares
1,how can a film like that be released on video,how could you possibly get a movie that is so awful
1,so i guess i 'll be watching the movie,so the movie was made in a hurry
1,i was n't impressed with the movie,i have seen this movie twice
1,i was surprised to find that the film was a complete waste of time and money,i have to admit that the film is very well done and i would recommend this film
1,in fact the film was shot in the same location and it 's a very good movie,in the first movie the characters were not believable and the story was not very interesting
1,you can tell the story is a bit,you know what i was going through
1,as a result of this movie it is not a bad movie but a,as for me i have to say i was impressed by this movie
1,the movie was shot on location in a very tight and very very very,the film is a bit of an action film but it 's not
1,i have seen this film twice and it is one of the most beautiful films i 've seen in years and i have to,i was n't impressed by the fact that the film is so bad it is n't even funny it 's just plain awful
1,has the movie been a success,has a good story and good actors
1,together with a couple 's other films the movie has a lot to offer and,together they are the only ones that are able to get their hands together
1,ravishing in a way of making a movie,ravishing and funny the movie is not for everyone
1,but the movie is not as bad,but it 's a good movie
1,whereas i have n't read the book i do n't know what the film was trying for,whereas the film is a little bit slow moving the plot has a lot of holes and is
1,evil is a good movie but the story is so weak that it 's,evil dead is a movie that is not just about the human race
1,regardless of this the movie is not as bad as it should,regardless the movie was a complete waste of time and money
1,this movie was so bad it was good,this is a very bad film and it is
1,i have seen this film several times and i still have nightmares and nightmares,i was n't impressed by this film but it 's not a bad film it
1,it 's not a bad movie,it is a shame because it is
1,otherwise it is a good film to see,otherwise the film was a waste of time
1,in fact it is not the best movie ever,in the end it 's a very bad film
1,it is a very good film,it 's not even the worst of
1,also the film is very good,also i do not think that this
1,some people say that the movie was made in a hurry to be made,some of the acting is good but the story is n't really good
1,if i were to give it an 8 out of ten i would,if you 're a fan of the original you will probably enjoy it but
1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i have seen this film twice
1,i was surprised that this film did not get a theatrical release,i have to say that i was n't impressed by the film 's
1,it 's a shame that this film has not been released on video or vhs,it is not the best movie ever but it 's not as bad as the others
1,lucia 's character is the only one who is a real person,lucia is the best actress ever to play the role of a lifetime
1,this movie is a complete waste,this is the first movie that i
1,there are some good moments but it is not,there is no reason for this to be a movie
1,why is this movie rated so high on the,why did n't he just kill the girl
1,when the film is over the top is a little too much,when i saw this film i thought it would be good
1,if i were n't for a few minutes i 'd never have seen this movie,if you 're looking for a good movie with a good plot this is n't for
1,but it 's a great film and a good movie,but the movie is a bit too long and the ending
1,broadcast in the uk the film was made in a time when the world,broadcast is the best of all the movies that i have ever watched
1,this is the worst movie i have ever had to endure and i have,this movie is not a good one but it is a good film
1,it 's a shame that the film has been released in dvd so that it will be released soon and will be forgotten,it is not the best film i 've ever had the pleasure of seeing but it is definitely worth seeing for its portrayal
1,it 's a shame that this movie is n't available on dvd or dvd release,it is not the best movie i 've ever watched but i have to say it
1,i was n't expecting a lot from the movie but it was n't,i have seen the movie twice and i can tell you it is n't
1,we have a lot of people who have been so affected and have been in love with the same woman that they have,we are supposed to be a little more forgiving of the characters and their motivations but they do not seem very realistic
1,the movie is about the power of the characters,the film has a very good story line and the
1,through a series of flashbacks we learn a lot about the story and how it is going to end and,through the movie i thought that the movie would have made it a little better but i was wrong
1,in fact it 's not a bad movie,in the end the movie has no real story
1,i was surprised that this film did n't get released theatrically in the,i have to say that i was very disappointed with the movie
1,even though the movie was a bit long,even the actors are n't very convincing
1,firode 's film has been released in the,firode is a master of the macabre
1,maybe it 's just me but i think that 's the,maybe the movie is n't a total waste of time
1,did i mention that this was a very low production and not a good,did n't they think that the real world would be a good place
1,arthur is the best of all the cast,arthur 's character is the only reason i gave
1,i have to say i was n't impressed by,i was surprised that the movie was made
1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,in fact it 's a very bad movie,in the end the film has a lot to
1,not to say that the movie is n't a complete waste of time,not only is the acting terrible the script is awful the script was horrible
1,i was n't impressed with the film,i have seen this movie twice and it
1,he 's a very talented actor,he is the most annoying person in
1,willem defoe is the perfect choice for this film,willem dafoe plays a young woman in the film
1,it 's not even a movie it,it is a very funny film
1,in fact the film is a bit too long,in the first movie he is the only person who
1,now i have seen a lot worse,now that i have n't read the novel
1,neither of them is a good thing,neither the acting or acting are all bad
1,it 's not even a good film,it is a very funny movie
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,and the movie is a complete mess,and it 's a good thing
1,it 's a very good movie and it is not a bad film,it is not a film for everyone who wants to be entertained by a
1,shortly after he has been killed he is rescued by the devil and,shortly thereafter the movie is a bit too long for the story
1,i was surprised that this film did not have a chance to redeem,i have to say that i was n't disappointed by this film
1,if you 're a diehard horror buff and want a good scare movie this is the movie to be,if i were to rate this movie a zero i 'd give this a 0 out of 10
1,this movie is not for the faint hearted,this is the worst film i 've ever seen
1,unfortunately the film is not as good and the performances as it,unfortunately it is n't the worst film i have ever seen
1,so i guess i 'll be a fan,so the movie was made in the early 80
1,a few of them are very funny and i think they were all funny,a lot of the scenes were filmed in a way like the ones in which
1,well the movie was a little slow but i did n't expect it to be a good movie,well i guess i 'll be a fan of the movie but i have n't read it so it
1,some of the scenes were just too long and the story was too slow and boring,some people say it 's a good film but i do not recommend it to anybody who
1,the film has a very good cast and the actors are very good and it is very well acted and well acted,the movie is about the power and soul that the people who have been in love and the life of the two families
1,the film is about the struggle of a man,the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,i was n't expecting much of a movie but it was,i have seen the original version of the scarlet pimpernel
1,of all of these films this is a must see for all ages and,of course the film has a lot to do but it is not
1,i have to say that this is one that is a waste of time,i was surprised that this movie did n't get released on dvd or dvd release
1,rogers 's performance as the mother of the family and his mother is,rogers is a great actress but she does not have a chance
1,no matter what you do n't want you to do,no one is a fan of the original but i do
1,samir is the only one to survive in the end and he is a good guy,samir 's character was the only one that could be the one that he was
1,however i was n't impressed with this movie,however the movie was a bit too slow for
1,i was n't impressed with the movie,i have seen this movie twice
1,finally the movie is about a man who has a wife and a daughter,finally i have seen the original version and i can safely recommend it
1,interesting and funny and i really enjoyed this,interesting to see a movie like this
1,if i were to give this movie an extra rating it would be,if you 're a fan like myself you will probably like it
1,we are not supposed to feel sorry for him and,we have to be careful to see this movie
1,there are a few moments of brilliance and a couple of moments of humor,there is a scene where the hero 's character is revealed to be the one
1,considering that the movie is about the same subject as a movie it is a very good,considering the budget of the film it 's not even that bad it is a waste
1,the film is a bit of an exercise into the genre of the genre but the story is a little bit too easy to swallow,the movie was shot on location in the early 1800 'searly 1950 and the early 90 's and early 90 's and the late 1960s and
1,i have seen this film twice,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,yes the movie is n't a bad film,yes it is not a bad film but it
1,all the actors are excellent and i have,all in the name of the movie
1,being a fan of the original i was very impressed with this film,being the only one to be able of the movie the story is very
1,he 's a great actor but his performance in the movie is so poor,he is the only person who has a shred of respect and is a very
1,there are some very good scenes in this film and the movie is a perfect,there is no real reason for the existence of the killer to kill him
1,the movie is a bit of a mess,the film has some good points and some good
1,son of a bitch was an interesting film,son and son is a very good film and
1,well i guess it was a bit too much for the movie,well the movie is a bit slow and boring but it is a
1,and it is a shame because it is a great movie,and the ending was a bit abrupt and i was n't sure
1,in the end the movie has a very good cast,in fact it 's not a good movie but it is
1,he 's a great director and a good,he is the only one to die
1,supernatural and the movie has some of its most memorable scenes and the best,supernatural thriller has a lot of potential and it is a great movie
1,he 's not the best character he 's in,he is a very talented actor and a very good
1,but it is a great film and i think that the film was a good idea to make a good film and i think it is one of the better ones i 've seen,but the film 's biggest flaw is that it is not a comedy or a comedy it is just a bunch of silly jokes and a few scenes that are so bad that you can
1,if i were n't so irritated i 'd be able,if you 're looking to be a fan of this genre
1,it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen but i have to admit i was n't disappointed,it 's a shame because it is not the worst film ever made but it 's not a bad one
1,none of the actors were particularly convincing and the story is,none the more it 's a good movie to see
1,there is no reason to see the film and it is not even a movie,there are some good scenes in the movie but it 's just not enough
1,i have seen the movie and it 's a great film,i was n't expecting a movie to get the message across the
1,the film is a bit of an action film,the movie was shot on location in a very small
1,i was surprised that the film did not have a chance,i have to say i did n't like this film
1,please please please do not waste time on it,please do n't waste your time on it
1,janet gaynor plays a young girl who has to deal with a young girl who has a crush on the young woman,janet mcteer is the only one that is able to make a good movie and this one does not have the good qualities
1,other than the aforementioned plot holes it 's a pretty dull movie that is not worth watching,other reviewers have commented on this film and i think it is a good movie to see if
1,great acting and a great cast,great movie for the first half
1,there are some very good moments in this film but,there is no real reason to watch this movie
1,the film has some good moments but the story,the movie is a bit slow and boring
1,the film is about a young man named kenny who has been living with a woman and,the movie was a waste for the whole family and it was a waste of time
1,reissued by a group of young men and a young woman who 's been married to a young man who is a little too young and too,reissued in the early seventies and the early 70s and the early 1960s and the early seventies it 's a great deal to be reckoned with
1,i have seen this movie several years ago,i was n't impressed with this movie but i
1,fats 's character is so stupid that,fats is the best of all
1,this is the first film i have ever seen in a while and i have seen,this movie is a must for anyone who wants to see something different and interesting

1,hey it was n't a bad movie but it 's a bad film and it is,hey i know that the film was made for the sole purpose of the movie
1,beyond that the film has a very bad script and the acting is terrible,beyond the obvious flaws of this movie it 's not a good film
1,what is this movie trying for a,what a waste for a movie
1,at the same time it 's not a good film,at least the film is n't a total waste of film

1,if i were to rate it lower then the rating it would have been,if you 're a diehard fan of the original you will love it
1,wells 's film has been done in the style of the first film,wells is a master of the craft and the director of the movie
1,in fact the only thing that makes it worthwhile is that it is a bit too much,in the first film he is the one who has to deal and solve his problems
1,aside from that the film was a total waste of my,aside the movie is a complete waste of my life
1,i have to say that this movie is one that is,i was surprised that this movie was n't released theatrically
1,as a result the film has no redeeming qualities,as for me it was a very enjoyable film
1,i was surprised that the film was n't so much more of a comedy than a horror movie,i have to say i did not like this movie but i was n't expecting a lot

1,stray dog was one of those movies where you can tell the story is a bit of a stretch for a horror film but it is a,stray from the darkness of the film is a very good movie that will keep your attention and it 's not a good one at that
1,yeah i do concede the film was shot in the early 1980s but it is not a film,yeah it 's a good movie but the story is so weak it makes you want more and it
1,apart the movie is a complete mess,apart from that the film was a total
1,this movie was so bad it 's,this is a very bad film
1,he 's a very good actor,he is the most talented character in
1,a few years later the movie is,a lot more of a movie
1,ho hum is one of the most underrated films i 've seen in a long time,ho vinci code is one that is a must see for anyone who loves action
1,anna friel is the only one that is good in this movie and she 's not a bad actor,anna paquin plays a young girl who has a crush in the world and is not a good actress but

1,viggo mortensen plays the part with the character of a young woman who has been,viggo mortenson is the only one in this film who has a good time
1,although i have seen this film many many years ago i still remember the title of the film,although the film was a bit long it was a bit slow moving and not very interesting
1,yes the film is n't as good as,yes it 's not a bad film
1,the film is about a group that has a lot to do,the movie was a waste of time and money and time
1,several people who have seen this movie are either mentally ill or disgusted,several of the characters are very interesting and i do think they are all
1,in fact the only reason i watched this movie was that i had a crush on a movie called a movie called,in the first film the main character 's father was killed by the devil and he was a little more human
1,there are some very funny moments but the movie does not,there is no real plot and the acting was terrible
1,i have to say i was n't impressed with the movie,i was surprised that the movie was made in a time where
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the movie was shot in a small budget
1,i was surprised that this film did not have a chance for the director to be in it for a few minutes and then i realized it was n't a,i have to say that i was n't disappointed by this movie but i did n't think that it was a bad movie but it is a great movie
1,avoid it like i did n't like the first,avoid this one at any cost and if you 're
1,my favorite scene is where the guy gets the girl to eat him,my advice to anyone who is interested in the genre or if you 're
1,i have to say i did not like this film,i was surprised that the film was n't so bad as
1,the film has a lot to do with the story and the acting,the movie is about a young man named benjamin who has been sent to
1,i have to say that i was n't impressed by the film 's,i was surprised that this film did not get a theatrical release
1,it is a shame because the movie,it 's not a bad film
1,basically the movie was shot on location and the camera work is very poor and the editing was horrible,basically it is a movie that is not only about a young man 's life and the life he endured
1,if you want a movie that does not need to be made in a theater or a good time do,if i had to give this movie a 0 out 10 it is a good film to be sure
1,fortunately the film 's biggest problem is,fortunately it is not a movie
1,after the movie i was a little skeptical about the movie,after a while the film is about as good a film of
1,the film has some good points and some good,the movie is a bit of a mess
1,imo the film has a very nice,imo it is a great movie
1,get a copy of the movie and you 'll be disappointed by it and you will see,get to know a little bit about this movie and it 's not a bad movie
1,in the end the movie is a complete waste of your time and time,in fact it 's not even the best movie i 've seen in a while
1,this is a very good film,this movie was so awful that it
1,everyone is entitled to a certain degree,everyone else in the movie was so bad
1,at the same moment i thought the film would be a little,at least the movie was n't so bad it was funny
1,all the characters are all very likable,all in all this is one that i
1,widmark is the best actor ever in the movie and it is a,widmark 's character is so unlikable that he is unable to cope
1,it is a shame that the movie has,it 's not a movie for everyone
1,another thing that i did n't notice is that the film was shot in the same way as a film,another problem with the movie was the fact it 's not a good film but the acting was good
1,spoiler alert the film is a little slow but it 's not a good movie,spoiler ahead i was surprised that the film did not have the potential of a sequel
1,i'm not sure why this movie is not available in dvd format,i'm a big fan of horror films and this one was a huge
1,the film has some of its moments but it is not,the movie is a complete mess of the original film and the
1,but it 's a great movie,but the movie is a little slow
1,the film is a bit slow and the story is too predictable,the movie was shot on a budget that was filmed in a warehouse
1,much of the movie takes place in the middle of the desert and it is not until a very gruesome ending,much like a movie that was shot in a very small town in the early seventies it was filmed on location
1,for the first time in a while i was a little skeptical about the film and the acting was n't bad but,for a film about the evils of the human condition the movie has been made to be a very good movie
1,so i guess it was n't a bad idea,so the movie is a bit slow but it 's
1,but it is not a movie,but the film is not as good
1,i have seen this movie several times and it 's one that i would,i was n't impressed with this film but i did n't expect it
1,episode 1 is a very good movie,episode 3 was the first one i had
1,acting was ok the story is a little weak but it is,acting is n't bad but the script and direction is terrible
1,i was surprised to see this film in the us and i,i have to admit i was n't impressed with the movie
1,thank god i did not pay for it,thank you to me for the movie
1,and the ending is so bad it makes,and it is not a good movie
1,for a film that is a little bit too slow for a horror film the,for the first half hour or two i was n't sure what was happening
1,i was surprised that the film did not have the potential,i have to say i did n't like this movie
1,would n't it have been better,would you have to be a big
1,it is not a film for everyone who wants to be entertained and to be entertained,it 's a very good movie and it is not a bad movie but a great movie
1,that is the best thing about the film,that 's what i thought it was
1,my favorite scene was when he is talking about his father and his dad,my advice to the filmmakers of this film are the ones who have to watch
1,but it 's a good thing to see this,but the movie is not a good one
1,this movie was so bad that i could not believe that i wasted watching it and it 's a shame,this is a very bad movie and i do n't know what it was like to be a fan
1,but it is not a good movie,but the film is not a good one
1,she is the only one to be rescued by the,she 's a little more than she bargained to
1,that 's what makes this movie so great and i have to admit,that is the only thing i did n't like about this film
1,her performance is a little stiff but the film 's direction is very poor and,her character was so annoying that i could not care less about the characters
1,to me it 's the best of the three,to be fair the movie is n't a bad film
1,i have seen the movie and i can safely tell that i was n't expecting much from,i was n't expecting a movie about the holocaust but i was expecting a lot more
1,those are the only things i can think of in this film,those who are not familiar with this film should see it
1,i have seen this movie several times and i still have to watch the,i was n't impressed with this film but it is a good movie
1,there are a lot more to be made in the film,there is a lot of violence and nudity in it
1,every time he 's on the screen he is able,every scene is a complete mess of the film
1,however i do n't know what the point of the film was,however the film 's main problem is the script which is so convoluted
1,this movie was a complete waste,this is a movie that i would
1,in the first movie the characters are all so stupid that,in fact the film was shot on a low level
1,the movie was shot in a small budget and the acting was so horrible that i was surprised to see that it,the film is a complete waste of time and money and money and time spent on it and i ca all
1,if you want a good laugh and enjoy a fun film then this one,if i had to watch this film i 'd be a little ashamed
1,and it is a shame because the film is so bad that it 's almost unbearable,and the ending was a bit too abrupt and the story line is n't as good
1,then the film switches gears and the,then there 's a few things
1,belle is the best actress in this movie,belle 's character is so annoying that i ca
1,there is no real reason for this movie to be released,there are some very good scenes and the film has a very
1,when i first heard about this movie i was expecting a good movie,when the movie is about to end you are not going for the same
1,for a film about the evils and tribulations of the people involved with this movie,for the first time in a long time the movie is a complete mess
1,at least it was a bit of a stretch to watch,at the end of the movie i thought the film would have
1,mask of a serial is one that is n't a complete success,mask is a film that is not only a vehicle to show a
1,the movie was a waste for me,the film is about a young woman named
1,by far one thing the movie is not about the story of a man 's struggle with his wife and his wife,by the end of the film the viewer feels that the movie is going to be a little slow but the story line
1,also the movie was a little too long,also i think that it is the most beautiful
1,instead it is a very boring and boring movie that is not even worth renting,instead of being the worst of the three films i was expecting a good movie to
1,erm i was a bit skeptical about this,erm the movie is a complete waste
1,zombi 3 was a great movie,zombi 2 is one that is n't
1,the film is a complete mess,the movie was shot in the early
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,ok so the movie is a little too long for the most part but the acting and direction are so bad it makes you wonder how much more it could have done with it,ok i know it was a low budget film but it was a good movie and i would n't recommend this movie to anybody who has n't read the novel and seen it
1,wow this movie was so bad it,wow i do n't know why
1,the film is about the same subject matter and the story,the movie was a bit slow but it was n't
1,it 's not a bad film,it is a shame because the movie

1,and the movie is so bad that it 's almost laughable to watch and the acting is horrible and the plot is so stupid,and it 's a shame because it is not the best movie i 've ever watched but i have to admit i did n't like
1,now that 's a bit too much,now i know i 've seen the first
1,but it is not a movie that you can see in a theater,but the film is not as bad as it is in the movie and
1,there is a scene in which the two men are reunited in a car crash and they 're all wearing the same clothes and the camera pans down in the air,there are a few good scenes but it is not enough to make you laugh and you 'll laugh at the jokes and jokes that are supposed for the movie
1,one thing that really annoyed the movie was that the,one of my favorite films of the last decade
1,strangely the movie is a complete waste,strangely enough the movie was a complete waste
1,i'm not a fan of this movie,i'm a fan of this movie

1,and the movie is so bad that i ca only think of one good reason,and it 's a shame because it 's not a good film to watch

1,if you 're a diehard horror buff and have seen the first two movies this one will be a disappointment,if i were to rate this movie a 1 out 10 i 'd give it 0 out of ten
1,some of the acting was good but the story line is so weak,some people say that this movie was bad but it was not
1,ironic to see the film was released in,ironic that this film is a remake
1,please do not waste your time on this movie unless your a diehard fan,please please do n't waste time on it and you 'll regret it for yourself
1,while i was n't impressed by this movie it was still a good film,while the film was a little slow at times i found it very difficult for
1,where is the plot and story line that has to be the most complex thing about this movie and the fact,where the film is concerned is that the film is set in a very small town where it is set
1,dustin ifans plays the part with a lot more than a cameo,dustin hoffman is a great actor and i hope he does n't have
1,he 's not the best actor in,he is a very talented director
1,in fact the only thing i can say is the acting is horrible and the plot line is so bad it,in the first film he was the only one who was a good guy and the rest was pretty bad
1,the movie was a bit of an action film,the film is about the struggle between the two and
1,in the end the film has a lot of action and the ending was so bad that i could not believe it was actually made,in fact it 's a very bad movie and it is n't even worth mentioning that the film was shot in the early 1980s
1,the movie was a waste for me and my friends,the film is about a young woman who is attracted to
1,after the movie i thought that the film would have been better and it would 've,after a while the movie becomes a little too long for the first half hour

1,they are all very good actors,they 're all in a very good
1,two men are sent into a prison where they have a very large part in their,two of them were the same people who had been in love with each other
1,anybody who thinks that this is the best of,anybody interested in this movie will be disappointed

1,the movie was a bit of a mess but it 's not a good movie and the actors do n't have,the film is about the struggle of the people who are the ones that have been affected by the war
1,rent this film and you 'll see how much,rent it if it is available on dvd
1,and it is not the worst movie ever made,and the ending is a bit too long for the
1,i was n't expecting a movie about a man who is trying,i have seen the movie and i have seen the movie
1,then there 's a few scenes of the movie that were cut out,then the film switches gears from the first two minutes of the film to

1,donald sutherland plays a very likable and likable character who has a very difficult role to,donald pleasance is the only one who can save this movie from the other actors
1,jean gabin 's performance is the only saving graces in the movie and it,jean simmons is a very talented actress and she 's a great actress
1,for the most of the time the movie was made for tv,for a movie that was a little bit of a mess it 's
1,i have to admit i did not like the film,i was surprised to see that the film was made for
1,at the same time the film is set up in a way,at least the film was a little bit of a stretch
1,overall this movie was a complete waste of my time,overall the movie is very good and it 's not the
1,scott bakula is a great director,scott 's performance was very good and
1,and it 's not even the best movie i have,and the movie was a complete waste of time
1,when the movie was over i was n't expecting anything else,when i first saw this film on tv it was a complete

1,the movie was a waste of my time,the film is about a group of young people
1,her performance is a bit stilted but the film is a bit too much to be enjoyed,her character was so stupid and the acting was horrible and she looked like she had been reading
1,this is the worst film i 've seen,this movie is not for the faint of heart
1,the film is a bit slow and boring but it is n't too bad,the movie was shot on a budget of about 50 million dollars and it 's
1,jekyll is a good guy who is n't afraid to go into a world where he can be found in a world of crime,jekyll 's story of the man is a bit too familiar with the first two movies but the film does n't seem to be the
1,so i guess it was n't the case with the movie but i was n't sure what to do with this film,so the movie is a bit of a mess but the story is so good that you can tell the director is n't
1,it 's not a movie that is so bad it 's,it is a shame that this film has been made
1,but it is a good film and a good movie,but the film 's main flaw is the fact that the
1,only the most ardent fan would be able to suspend disbelief for,only a couple who have seen this film are the same
1,basically the film was a bit too slow,basically it 's a very bad film
1,it 's not a bad movie,it is a shame because it is
1,spoofing this film and the other comments on it i thought it would be a great movie,spoofing the movie is the fact of the matter that the movie is based upon a book that
1,haruhi is the only person that is able in the film,haruhi 's character was a bit too much to bear
1,here 's the story the acting was terrible,here is a movie that i would recommend watching
1,he is the most talented character of all times and is the only reason why i love,he 's a very good actor and he 's a great actor and a great actress
1,there is no real reason for this to happen in this,there are some very good scenes and some good acting
1,seeing this film is a must see,seeing the movie was a waste
1,as a result the movie has no redeeming qualities,as for me it 's a very funny film
1,despite the obvious plot holes and the occasional lack of a plot,despite being a fan i was very disappointed with this movie
1,the film has some of the most,the movie is a complete waste
1,his character was so stupid and the acting was so bad,his performance is a little stiff and he is not a good
1,it is not a film for the,it 's a very good movie
1,the movie was shot on location and it 's a shame to see a movie that has a good story,the film is a bit of a bore but the story is so good and so funny that it 's almost
1,moreover the movie is not as bad,moreover it 's a very good movie
1,maybe the movie is a bit of an exercise on its subject matter but it 's a very enjoyable film,maybe it 's just a matter of fact that the movie was made for tv and it was n't even worth
1,there are a few moments of humor that make it hard to sit and laugh,there is a scene where the two men are walking through a forest and the camera
1,in the first movie the main characters are a group of friends and a bunch of friends,in fact the film was a bit of a letdown but it was a great film
1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i have seen this film twice
1,imagined by the film 's director and the director 's commentary on the film it 's a film about the evils of the human condition,imagined as the first movie i was surprised that the movie had a lot more to offer than the original but i think that it was
1,this is the worst movie ever,this movie is not a bad movie
1,tabloid is the best movie ever,tabloid idol is an excellent film
1,the movie was shot on a budget of 1,the film is a bit slow and boring

1,it 's a shame that this movie has n't been released on video,it is not the best movie i have seen but i 've seen better
1,this movie was so bad that it,this is a very bad movie
1,the movie was a bit slow but i did n't expect much from the film to begin with,the film is about the same subject as the book and it 's a very good one and a
1,the movie was a bit slow and the plot is too thin,the film is about the same thing as the first one
1,sylvester stallone plays the part of a very good guy who is a bit of a jerk,sylvester is a great character and the movie has some great scenes and a lot more
1,i have to admit i was very disappointed,i was surprised to see this movie
1,at least the movie was n't a good idea to make it a movie,at the same moment i thought that it would be good to watch a film
1,i was surprised to find that this movie was made in a hurry,i have to admit that the movie was very well made and the actors
1,it is a shame that the film is n't,it 's not a movie for the masses
1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,it is a very funny film and,it 's not even a movie
1,saw this movie at the toronto film festival,saw it in the theatre and it 's a
1,its a very funny film and i would love it to have been released on,its not a bad movie but the fact that it 's a good movie
1,the movie was a waste of my life,the film is about a group of people and
1,to me it 's the best movie i have seen,to be fair the movie is a bit of a mess
1,this is the first film i have seen in a long time,this movie is a must for anyone interested in a film
1,as a result the movie is a complete mess of the original,as for me it 's not that i have to say that this
1,whatever the case is the fact that it is,whatever it is that is n't the case
1,bingley 's performance in this film was so good that it was hard for him to,bingley is a great actor but he is not the only one to be able
1,the movie was shot on location in the early seventies and was shot in a very small budget,the film is a bit of an exercise into a very dark atmosphere and a bit of an allout
1,i was surprised to find out the film was made in a very low budget and the actors were n't really good,i have to admit that i have seen a few movies that are so good that i have seen them all and this
1,i was n't impressed with this movie,i have seen this movie several years and
1,uncomfortable and funny is the fact that it is a movie that has,uncomfortable to see the movie was a complete mess of the original
1,are they trying too hard to make it a success,are we supposed to be rooting for him to be the
1,mary is a great character and she is a very talented actor,mary pickford plays a woman who has to be a woman to get
1,none of these characters have any depth and the film does n't seem very,none the less the movie was shot on location in the middle east
1,we are supposed to believe the story is a little too,we have a lot more to say about this film
1,some people have commented on the acting but i do not care for the actors and,some of them were very good but the movie was n't even that bad either
1,in the end it 's not even a good film,in fact it is not a movie to be taken lightly
1,studio executives are n't going to get the money they have to work with but the,studio ghibli has a great cast and is a great director and a good actor
1,but it 's not a bad movie it is n't bad,but the movie was n't bad enough to be funny
1,if you want a movie to be a good one with a few laughs then this,if i had to give it a chance it would have made a good movie
1,this movie is a must for all fans,this is the first film i 've ever seen
1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i have seen this film twice
1,as a matter of view the movie is very good and,as for the acting it 's not a bad movie
1,as a matter of fact i was not surprised to find out the whole thing was a total,as for the acting i would have given it zero stars but it is a little generous
1,nothing really happens in the film,nothing is explained and the film does
1,there is no reason to watch this film unless you 're looking for a good movie to,there are some good scenes and some good acting but it 's just a poor movie
1,chris kattan is the perfect choice for the part of a young woman,chris farley plays the part with the character of a young boy who is
1,so the film has its moments,so i was n't expecting a lot
1,this movie was so awful it was funny,this is a very good movie and it is
1,there is no real reason for the existence to come,there are some very good scenes in this movie
1,he is a great director and a,he 's not a bad actor
1,by the time i saw it i was a bit skeptical about it but it was a good movie and,by far the worst movie i 've seen in a while and it 's not a good movie either
1,dan aykroyd plays the role as a cocky and cynical character who is a very likable character and a good actor,dan is a very good actor and i think that he is the only actor who has a role in the film
1,whoever thought this was a good idea to make it a good idea to make it a good movie to,whoever wrote the screenplay and the script is the same as this one and that 's saying a little
1,of all of the films i have seen i have seen,of course the movie is a bit of a bore
1,screenwriters have a great deal of talent,screenwriters and director should have had the opportunity
1,tears are the only thing i have ever seen in my life,tears and ears is one of the best films of all times and
1,naturally the movie has some good points and some good acting but the story line,naturally it 's a very bad film and it is not even worth renting
1,this is a very good film,this movie was so awful that it
2,since the movie was shot in the late seventies it is a film,since this is a film i would n't want it to end
2,i do agree to describe the point of the plot of this movie,i was surprised that the movie did n't get a theatrical dvd release but
2,what is the deal with the film 's protagonist,what i did n't like is the fact that the
2,a few of the scenes are pretty funny,a good cast of supporting characters and the cast
2,it 's a shame to hear a lot more about it,it 's a shame that this was n't released on dvd
2,the movie starts as a very good introduction,the acting was horrible the directing was worse the
2,title cards were not the case,title o e o o t
2,tom hanks plays a very convincing and very likable man who is a little nervous at the beginning,tom and matt are the only people on earth who will have a clue of what the movie 's
2,literally a film with a very low rating,literally this movie is just another bad movie
2,and it 's not a good idea to be told that the film is n't a comedy,and the film is a little too slow to be a complete mess of a film that is
2,babe and the girl who played the main character in the movie,babe and the beast is a film about an unhappy family
2,crutches of the film was not only the worst film i 've ever seen but the worst movie i,crutches of a good story is about a man trying hard to find out what happened to her
2,it is not a movie that you will not forget,it 's not the worst movie i ever saw
2,for me it 's a good movie,for a movie that was supposed for a
2,some have suggested that the movie was shot in the same location and,some of them were so funny that you could forgive the actors
2,not to mention the whole cast,not to mention the fact the movie
2,those who are familiar and have seen it are not afraid to be a fan and have seen a good movie,those two have a very good idea and i do n't know what they were thinking and how it was possible to
2,i was n't really expecting anything from this movie but i,i do agree with the other comment on the acting
2,the film is about a woman who has an affair with her husband and her mother,the story is about a bunch of friends who are trapped on the same island
2,instead it is the most depressing movie i have ever witnessed in my life,instead the movie is about a man named sam who tries to make his life
2,after seeing it i can say that the only thing that makes it worth the time is,after all the story and the characters are all there is n't much of a plot
2,she 's not a very good actor,she has the most convincing role and the
2,it 's just a bad idea to make a movie about how to get the lowest budget and the result in this case is,it 's a shame that this movie did n't have to rely on the fact the film had to have a cult status
2,maybe i am just too young and i'm afraid i do n't like the movie but the movie is very funny and it really works,maybe it was the fact i was n't watching the movie but i was n't sure if it was a comedy or a drama
2,i was surprised to find this one on imdb,i have never heard a thing so much about this
2,this movie was so awful i could n't believe it,this is the best of all the films i 've seen
2,i was surprised that it was a long,i was so bored by the movie
2,some people have claimed the movie to suck but it was n't a good film and it did n't,some have criticized this movie for the fact it has been released theatrically in a local video store
2,ok it 's just not a bad thing,ok the movie is n't that great
2,someone else is a little too old and too young to understand that he 's the only one who does n't have a clue,someone who has been a huge fan of his work should be aware of how the director could have made this a classic
2,miriam quinn is the only actor that i can recall that i have ever,miriam hopkins is a very good actor and is a very talented comedian
2,i was so excited to hear the title,i have never seen any of these films
2,marion 's character was a bit too long,marion davies is a very good choice to play
2,this movie is not even close to the book and it was a waste,this is one of the most enjoyable movies i have seen in a very very
2,films are n't as good or bad or as good,films such a shame as the best of them
2,you can see the film and the movie makers are,you 'll see it coming from the same angle
2,but the movie is so good that it makes you feel that it 's not just about a man,but it 's still a great film for the whole time and i recommend you check this out
2,if it were n't for the great acting i would n't even recommend it,if you 're looking at the end of it you 'll find it a very
2,this is the worst of the three films,this is a great movie and i recommend you
2,this was the worst movie of all the movies i have watched,this is the kind of thing you 'd want in an early 80
2,my advice is that you do not have to be in the mood for something like this in the first place and you 'll,my friend was a little girl in a mental health facility but i thought it was the worst of all the guinea pigs
2,since this is a film i have no intention whatsoever,since i have n't seen this one i can honestly say
2,the film is a very good example for a movie that 's not even worth watching,the acting and the script are horrible the script is terrible it is n't even that good
2,surely this is not a movie for those with a,surely a movie that is n't even worth watching
2,the acting in this movie is horrible,the movie is very well made with a
2,what is this movie trying to say about the movie,what i got was a movie about a young boy who
2,will i forget that this is a film that is so much,will smith and his wife have to be a complete jerk
2,so the story of a woman who is married,so i guess it 's a good movie
2,i think the director was a great actor,i have never heard of this film
2,moonstruck 's first major problem in the,moonstruck is one of my favorites
2,this movie was so bad i was begging to leave the cinema,this was the first time i have viewed this show and i think
2,but the movie was a lot of the time,but the film is not so bad as a whole
2,when i saw the movie on tv i was very surprised that the movie is a,when i saw it i had to watch a film that is a complete waste
2,let 's start out as a bad thing to make a bad,let 's face it this was n't a movie for me
2,the story was a bit weak at first and it 's not really all that great but it was,the acting is very poor and it is a shame the actors did not get involved in it
2,his character is a stereotype of a young man who 's,his performance was the worst thing i had ever heard
2,i have n't been in high school since,i have n't seen the first film
2,they have the right idea and they 're just trying,they 're not the best of the gamera movies but it
2,i have to say this is one that is n't really worth watching,i have never read any reviews about a film which was n't as bad
2,why is the movie so bad,why do i care for the main
2,i'm glad i did n't have to pay for it but it was not,i'm a fan and the movie 's soundtrack and cinematography are very good
2,it has the best of all the great movies that are being made in hollywood,it 's the story of a woman who is a little girl and the girl in
2,noticed the film 's success of the film 's success,noticed the film 's success of a film noir and the
2,1010 the only good part about it,1010 the movie is n't as bad as
2,ernest thesiger is the perfect actor and he plays the role of a very well suited and,ernest is not a good actor and he does have a lot better to work on
2,the movie starts off with an interesting concept,the story is about a young boy who has
2,listening to the music and the music,listening to the title character 's character and
2,i do not recommend this film,i have seen the movie twice and
2,here is the story the characters are not developed in their motivations or are there really any other actors that,here 's the story a group of people who have no idea about each other is the same way
2,the movie is about a young man named krishna played a young teenager named dexter,the movie was a complete failure in the first place the second was a lot of
2,it 's not a movie that will leave the viewers thinking of the future,it 's the story about an aging family who is trying their luck to find
2,the acting in the film are very,the film is a complete failure
2,and the ending is very abrupt but i guess i was n't going to be disappointed because i was so bored and disappointed that this movie was so boring,and that 's not a problem because the movie was so bad and the acting was terrible the plot was horrible and i did not care for the characters
2,the film has no atmosphere or tension whatsoever,the story line has a lot of holes but
2,the story is simple the characters and the plot is,the movie is a complete mess of a film
2,makes it a very good film,makes it a movie to sit down
2,anyone with any interest in the genre should see it and it is a good movie to watch for those who,anyone with an interest at the end will be able to relate to what the director is trying and failing
2,this movie is not worth watching for the acting,this is one movie that is a complete waste
2,misguided the film was made in 1995 and i,misguided but not the worst film ever made
2,stylistically the movie is a bit too much,stylistically i do n't know why i have never
2,the story of the kelly gang' was a good one and a lot of fun was the part that,the story is about a bunch of people who are trapped on their honeymoon in a remote island
2,if the film had made a little more of a movie i might to have avoided the film as a comedy but it is,if you 're going through the whole thing and you have to be a fan of the book you will probably be disappointed
2,the acting in this movie was very well written but i do n't think that the actors who made this show really work,the film is a bit too long and it 's too hard to find the characters and the story is so contrived
2,version is a bit of the same with,version of it 's a good idea
2,hanna barbeau is the only one who is able,hanna barbeau is a great actress and i hope she
2,well it 's not a good film but the,well i do not know what it is
2,while i do not think the movie has been made in a very good way it has a lot of good things,while i was not impressed at the beginning the film was a little too much for my taste as a whole
2,the acting is good but the acting is poor,the story is simple enough to be a comedy but
2,a lot of the scenes were just too much to be taken to the screen,a good film that i would recommend for anyone with a sense about it
2,so the film was shot and edited,so what if you 're a teenager
2,so i was n't impressed by the movie,so i have to say i have seen a
2,i was surprised to discover how this film,i think the movie is very funny
2,i think this is the worst movie that i 've ever watched,i do not think this movie is worth seeing for its historical value
2,the film is a bit slow at times but it,the film is a little slow and slow paced
2,the movie is not about a group of,the acting in general are pretty good
2,we have a bunch of friends and a bunch of friends,we 're talking to each other in a different manner
2,not to mention a couple of scenes of the movie,not to say that it was n't a good movie
2,the movie is a little slow but that 's what makes it,the film is not a documentary about life and its subject
2,the story of a girl and his family being held by a very wealthy and,the story is very interesting and the characters and the situations are so real
2,this film does n't seem to have been a success,this movie is a must for anyone looking for something like
2,the film has a great story about a young man who has been living in a small,the movie is about a man who is in a coma and his father is killed
2,it is the best movie ever made,it has been a very good movie since
2,visually i was n't impressed with the story but this was a good movie,visually the acting was superb and it was a good idea to see a good
2,this is a great movie for all ages especially for the fact that you are in a good film,this is the kind to show the world of war and how it is going to get to the point
2,so if you 're looking to see something good and,so i guess i 'll give it a try
2,having a good time i ca n't help but feel that the director was a genius and the,having read all the negative reviews on the imdb i thought that this was a great show
2,she is a beautiful and sensual woman,she 's a little more convincing than the
2,the acting is good and i really enjoyed,the movie is a very interesting one
2,i'm not sure why the film has a cult following,i'm a fan but i was not impressed at all that
2,for those that have not seen the first movie you will be disappointed,for the first time i saw a preview that was made to look like
2,overall the movie is a waste,overall i would say that it is
2,the acting and script were so bad that it made me wonder if they were making a movie about it,the story of a woman who has to be one of those movies to make her a good person
2,however the story is n't too good,however the film is a bit too slow
2,personally i think that the film is n't as good and the,personally i would n't be surprised that this was a sequel
2,the story was a bit confusing but it was n't that great either that i,the story is a simple mix of comedy romance romance drama romance and drama
2,handsdown a lot less of his life in his career is not,handsdown the most interesting thing in this movie are the characters
2,that was the most interesting part of this movie and the,that is the only reason i can remember the movie
2,everyone involved in this movie is so good,everyone else has their head broken down
2,shortly afterwards the film is set up in an interesting way,shortly thereafter the film is a bit of the spoof
2,if i had a choice i would have given it an 8 instead of a 1,if you have n't read it do n't bother watching it and you will find yourself wondering
2,this movie has a lot of problems but it has a very interesting story,this movie is a great movie for those who want a fun movie
2,a few of the characters were n't that good,a few years later the film is still very entertaining
2,multiplayer is an excellent example of what a great film it would be,multiplayer has been done so many times in the past few years and that
2,distributors should be warned that this is the first movie that has a very low rating but it 's not,distributors have been on the lookout for this show since it is the only show that is so funny
2,every character in the movie is so bad,every single person who has ever read this should
2,i think the movie is very good,i do n't know if this is a
2,this is a great film for the ages,this film is a must for fans
2,the acting is pretty bad the script was awful the directing was terrible,the acting in this movie was very poor the directing was terrible the directing
2,the film has a very interesting premise and the acting performances of the actors are superb and it 's,the movie is about a man who is in love with a young man who is trying too
2,the film is a complete waste,the movie is a little slow but
2,my favorite parts are where a man is trying to get to the heart of the film and his wife is a bit of a joke,my favorite parts of this movie are the ones where the girl is talking with a guy and she says that the movie is funny but the
2,but this is not an example for a,but this one was n't that good
2,while it does n't seem like the actors were on the cover they were all so bad that they could have made a decent movie for the budget,while the film is a bit long and a few scenes in the film are a bit long the film is still a nice little thriller about a man
2,that was n't enough to make me laugh,that 's what i would like to see a
2,but the story was n't too great,but the story is a little too long
2,this is a very good movie,this is one of my all times
2,try to make you think of a film,try not even get into the film
2,why did n't they just make this film to be the best of the three,why does n't anyone else think that the movie 's main aim of a movie to
2,and i have seen this film countless many,and the ending is a bit anticlimatic
2,but it is not that good,but it 's not as much fun
2,if i had to choose between the two i could not find a single redeeming feature in this movie and that was n't the,if you 're going through a whole lot of time to see this film it 's not worth it to get a hold
2,i do think the movie is very entertaining and,i was n't impressed when it was made
2,one thing that i do remember about this movie is that there is,one can only imagine that the film is a very poor movie
2,drowned in the middle by a mysterious killer and a,drowned in an automobile accident by a mysterious stranger
2,someone who has n't seen this movie will agree with me,someone who was n't a huge child of the gods who saw
2,most importantly the scene is the one where a woman 's reaction is broken down to a chair in the middle and then she is forced to leave her,most of the time the film was made up for a long time but it was n't a complete waste of my life it 's just a waste
2,this was the only thing that kept the film from getting worse,this was one of those shows that i did n't know what to
2,like a lot of the movies i have seen the movie has some good points and the acting is pretty solid,like the first film the characters are so real it 's almost impossible not like it was made on an island
2,it is a movie about the evils in life,it is a shame that it has n't been done
2,20 seconds of the movie is spent on a little bit of the same thing,20 minutes into the movie you get to see a bunch of the characters interact with
2,i do agree with the other reviewer about the ending which was a bit abrupt,i was n't expecting much from the first film but i was expecting a lot of
2,purists have to see it to understand what is the most interesting of all the films that are released today,purists of the original series should steer far far away from this movie and not even get a glimpse of what
2,tricks are all in their mind but they 're not,tricks are not the only thing you can do to make
2,once you 've got your hands you 'll be able into the film 's ability to get into,once in a movie you see the same movie as the one that is in the book
2,or maybe they should just say that this film will not appeal to those of,or maybe it would n't be too easy to make a movie like this
2,it 's the only thing that makes it so good and it,it is n't a movie that is not a good movie
2,now that i have a copy of this movie and i'm suprised i have to be a fan of a film that has to be a complete failure and a,now i know that this film is n't going anywhere near as good as it was in the first place it was a good one but it was n't
2,a very good and entertaining thriller about an,a lot of it is the same
2,once again this is not a good idea,once again this is the worst of it
2,it has a very funny plot and some good performances,it 's the same old story about people and their lives
2,raptor 3 has a great story and,raptor island is a great example
2,when you watch a movie with the characters you 're not going to get bored,when i saw the film it was a complete disappointment and i could not help thinking
2,the acting and script is so poor it makes the,the film is a complete mess of a film
2,there are some good moments of humor and a,there was no plot line and the acting
2,of all the other movies i saw this is one to watch,of course it 's not the same thing as this movie is
2,the movie has some great moments in the end,the movie is very slow moving and not very exciting
2,the story is very good but it is very very very very very,the story was a bit thin but the characters were very believable
2,you can see the movie in its,you know what i am getting
2,i was surprised by the way the story unfolded and the acting,i do n't understand how this film got such a high score
2,the movie was made in a very small budget and it,the acting is good and i really liked that movie
2,on a technical note the film is very good,on the other hand the movie 's plot is a
2,the story of a young woman who is in love and is in her mother is a little bit too,the acting was terrible the script is awful the acting is bad the directing awful it 's all there
2,i do n't know how to describe a movie that has to rely more on the subject,i have n't read many of the other comments on the film but i think that the film
2,as a movie buff myself i was disappointed to,as a result the movie was very good
2,read a book or read a book,read the book the book and the book
2,it 's the story of a man trying desperately to get to,it 's a shame because it 's not a bad movie
2,first off the movie is not about the characters in the story the characters and the plot,first of alli the film was a little slow but i was n't really sure how it was
2,and it was n't that great,and i do agree that i have
2,a lot more than the usual hollywood movie,a lot of it has a lot to do
2,hence the film itself is very good,hence that the film is not a total
2,to make matters worse it is a movie about a,to make matters of the same is not true
2,this movie is a must see if,this is the best movie ever
2,the story of the film 's premise was interesting and interesting but i found this,the movie has some good acting but the story is not really that great
2,at one time the movie was made in the early 90s and was not only a vehicle for an,at one time the movie 's main character was the only actor i could see in a film
2,abominable and stupid but i think this is a very good and interesting show that has a,abominable and boring this is a great example of what happens when you 're a kid
2,if you have seen a film of this type you will find,if you want a film that 's worth seeing this one
2,the story was n't bad enough to be entertaining,the film has a lot to offer and the film
2,he 's a great director but i do n't think the movie is a real stinker,he has the best role in this film and is one that everyone should see
2,i do not think i can watch it over and done but i'm glad i did,i have to say that the acting is good and the story is very believable
2,melissa 's character is so unlikable,melissa is the most beautiful character in
2,but it was n't so much,but the film has no real plot
2,how could this movie been made as an action film,how many people do the movie makers have done
2,i was n't expecting much from this movie,i have never seen such a movie
2,of the three films of the same era this is not one of his,of the three films that i 've watched i 've seen this film
2,this movie is a great example for a movie and a very good movie to look out for but i,this is a film for all ages and i would recommend this movie to anyone who loves the genre
2,read the book the book by the author and the writer,read the book for the first half of the movie and then
2,without a doubt this movie is a complete bore,without spoiling this i have a hard way of saying
2,its a shame that such an opportunity to,its just a waste of my favorites
2,truly this movie is a complete waste of time and a total insult,truly this film is not worth watching for any of the actors
2,the story is about a bunch that,the acting and script were terrible
2,once the movie is set it becomes obvious why the movie is so bad,once again the film has a lot of fun and it does n't have any
2,and the movie is a total mess,and it does n't matter that the story
2,god knows how this was a movie that could be a good film,god knows that the film is a complete mess of an action movie
2,one of my alltime favorites is a film that has,one thing i noticed is a very interesting story
2,the movie is a little slow but the ending was so good,the story of the story of a man named sosuke who has been
2,that said this movie was a complete disappointment and should be,that 's what i would have expected from a movie
2,leonardo dicaprio is a great choice as his character and the film 's strength to be a bit of a shame that he was never given his credit is beyond his grave,leonardo dicaprio as a tough man in a supporting character is an actor that is very funny as a villain and is a likable person who is always a good actor
2,eventually he finds out about her past,eventually the two men get involved in a
2,kal penn plays his usual role in his role but,kal penn plays a young woman in this movie
2,a lot happens in this movie,a few scenes are just too much
2,besides the fact that the film is a comedy about an aging young woman it is also a very beautiful film,besides it 's the worst film that i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through and i would not have had
2,my favorite parts of the movie include the scene where the girl and her mother are sitting on the porch eating the camera and,my favorite scene is the scene when the girl is walking around a table talking about her boyfriend being raped by the camera
2,on the plus side it is not a movie to be taken seriously,on the other hand it 's a very nice movie and the actors who
2,in this movie he has a lot more than a few lines,in a way i did n't like the movie because it was so
2,the film has some good points but the,the acting and script is very good
2,scientist is a good movie that is not only the best of all it 's the,scientist is an intelligent character who 's a real person and is a good actor
2,it 's just a bad movie,it 's a shame that it is
2,i think this movie has been made in,i think that 's what it is
2,at first the movie seems like a spoof of,at first i thought it would get better
2,the story is about a group of people trapped in the woods of their country,the story is about an ordinary woman who is a woman and is a woman who
2,frustrated is a movie that is n't afraid that you 're watching a,frustrated to say the most of all the characters in the book
2,overall i would recommend this movie to anyone,overall i give this movie an 8 for a
2,none other than that i have seen this film and it was so bad it 's good but i did n't think the director was the director,none is that this is a good movie but it 's a good film that is not only the worst movie ever but it also has an intriguing
2,i was n't expecting much but i had to give it a 1 because it 's,i do n't think i 've seen anything like the other films in the genre
2,but it is a good film,but the movie has some of it
2,african born killers' is a movie that has a lot of laughs,african americans were a very popular group of people and they had to
2,sheba and her friend are a bunch that is n't afraid to go,sheba 's character is the best of the bunch of the film
2,noah is not only one thing that 's good in the first film and,noah and his friends are in the family 's home for a week
2,and the acting is n't as good,and the ending where she is a little
2,because i have n't been able into a horror genre since i 've read that the film is a little bit of an indie film,because of the fact it was a remake i had the feeling that i was in the movie for the first time and it was the
2,brown is the only one who has the guts to do anything,brown 's character in his first movie is a great actor but he
2,but the story is a lot of the usual stuff i 've seen lately and,but the film does have a certain point in it that makes it worthwhile
2,the story line was very interesting but it was not,the acting is good the writing and directing is great and
2,this is the first film to be released in the us,this movie is a great example of how a movie should be
2,just do yourself an favor to the original,just a few minutes later the story of the
2,to say this movie was n't made is beyond me,to be sure that the director has done so well that
2,but the movie was just a bad excuse to,but it is not the worst movie ever
2,a good cast of characters is given the opportunity of being able to act,a few years later she has been a successful woman in a long life and
2,all in this movie is not as bad as it was but i was,all the while the film is set up in a very simple manner
2,ok so i do concede the film is n't bad,ok so the movie was pretty bad but it was a
2,it 's a shame that the film never has been released in the us since the original is,it 's just a little too slow for a movie to be a comedy or a drama
2,but the film does have an excellent cast and it is the,but i have no problem with this film as a whole
2,he has a lot of fun making it,he has a good sense to make a movie
2,well this was a good movie,well the first half is just another
2,not to mention the fact that he has no idea what to do with his character,not only is he a bad actor but his performance was also quite good and he was
2,later in the film she is forced to leave her husband and her mother to be the mother and her daughter who has the same problem,later the film becomes the most annoying and boring movie that i 've ever watched but i have to say that the acting is good and there
2,the story is about a young man who is a little boy and a teenager in the world,the acting is horrible and the plot line seems like they had been thrown together by a drunk
2,the story of a young woman who is a woman in a small town who is,the story was very simple but the movie did n't make any sense at all
2,i do n't think i 've watched any of these movies before or,i was n't expecting much from a movie that was n't bad
2,the acting is good with all the cast members of a great cast and,the film is a little slow but it does n't have a lot
2,well i do not know what i am talking to but this movie does a good job,well i was n't impressed with this film but this one is not for the masses
2,so i guess i can forgive it for what i think it was a good idea for a horror,so the film is a complete mess of a story that has nothing new or interesting to say
2,and it 's a shame that this movie did,and the film does n't seem that much
2,you can tell that the actors are all trying to get the actors to play,you 'll have a lot of fun with this one as it has the best elements
2,he 's a little too old but he does have a few moments that are very good in a way he does,he is the only person that could be a hero or even a good man but he was a good actor
2,this was a very good movie,this is one of them that is
2,overall the movie is not worth watching but,overall this movie could have been better
2,bark is a movie about a man named melvin and a young man who is searching in a car crash,bark of a hat is an excellent movie that will keep your interest in the end of your seat for a
2,there is a scene where he is talking with his friends and they are trying to make a living,there is a scene with a guy who is a little bit too busy talking to the camera
2,this was the worst movie ever i,this is a very bad movie
2,it has been the same day for me,it has to be said to make this movie
2,now that 's a bit more of the comedy in the film but the film does a great deal of fun,now i know that i do n't like to watch it but i do not know what to do with it
2,she is a very good actress and,she has a lot of talent
2,i do think that the movie was very good in that it was the most boring film i have,i have seen this movie and the only one i have seen is that of the great hulk
2,there is a reason why the movie was so bad,there 's also some great music in the film
2,i was surprised to see how many movies were in this,i have never seen such an awful performance of hers
2,if you have n't read a biography of the book it will probably be a little misleading,if you are a fan and have read that it is the best movie you can find this
2,there are so much of the story lines that you could see,there is nothing wrong in this one but it is not
2,well it 's the only time it 's a movie that is so bad that,well i have n't seen the movie but this was just a great movie
2,chaney is a very talented character and,chaney is a very talented actor
2,from a technical standpoint i think that 's what this movie is about,from a technical point of view i was surprised to find that there are
2,it is a movie with no redeeming features,it 's a shame because this movie is a
2,they are the only one who 's been able for a long time,they are both a very talented and capable actor and i would recommend this
2,the film has some good acting in it but the script is not very funny at all,the story of the story was a lot better and it was n't a good idea
2,oh and i was so excited to see it again on tv,oh yeah it 's not that bad either the actors are good and
2,ok so i do n't know what to think of,ok so i was a bit skeptical about this movie and
2,on this level the film was a very good movie and i was very impressed,on this one the film has an interesting story and a very strong story
2,there was a bit of a sense to the story but it was a,there is a scene where he 's a little girl in the car
2,in the end i was hoping that the film could be more of what was shown in my life and that,in fact the only thing that is missing is the fact that there 's no real explanation for the story
2,i think that the best part in this film is the fact it is so funny,i think the reason for this movie is because it has been done so much better
2,his character is a bit too much,his acting was n't as wooden
2,mary pickford plays a character whose life is so different from other movies,mary is a good actress and is the only one who has to play
2,the movie was a complete waste,the film is a bit of a
2,it was n't the first time that,it is a very good movie
2,the story was so weak and the acting so horrible,the film is a bit too dark for words and it
2,my friend was a fan in a long time of the late 70 'searly 50 's early 80 about the movie,my advice to the director for the film 's title was the fact i saw this film in a cinema and it
2,and the ending is so ridiculous,and the movie is not a bad
2,the movie was shot at an hour of 35mm footage and the film is not very good,the movie was shot with the same name as the first film and that was n't a good
2,when you watch a movie you 'll see how the director 's commentary is so good that it is n't even,when you watch this movie you can feel the pain that the director of the film had on the audience
2,please please do n't bother with me,please avoid this at any time if you
2,they 're all in the dark and they have no chemistry in the movie they are not even likable characters,they have to go to the movies of the director to make a movie about a bunch of people
2,we have a lot more of this,we 're not talking about a film that
2,this is a very good and very very good movie that,this is a film that i recommend to everyone interested
2,i have seen it twice now in a very long time and i'm not too sure if it was the director 's intent or what was the point to the story,i do n't know how it got made in the early 80 's and early 90 's but that does n't make for an excellent movie and it certainly has some redeeming
2,considering the fact that the film does n't have,considering this is a film you should watch
2,and the movie was n't so great,and i was surprised that the movie is
2,unfortunately it 's not that bad,unfortunately it was n't a great movie
2,marking the movie 's premise is a bit confusing,marking the movie and then the film has a lot
2,with a supposed budget this movie fails miserably,with a lot more to say about this film
2,also the scene where the two men were in a bath and a few scenes,also the scene in which a girl gets her tits is not even funny
2,the movie was n't so much better than the first one but that 's,the film is about a young woman who has a crush on her
2,sadly it 's not a movie to watch if you are looking for an entertaining film,sadly i have never heard that the director was so pleased to find the original movie to
2,i have never read the book nor do you ever read a book that has a,i think it 's one of those movies that i think is a great deal
2,for the most of the movie i was surprised to find it in the theater bin,for those of the us who are looking for the movie to be a little bit too
2,however the story was n't that interesting either so why would the,however this was not a good movie and it is not
2,could have done a little research if it,could n't they have had the money
2,thank you for giving me a break,thank god i did n't get it
2,the story line was very good the acting and,the movie was a bit slow and boring
2,anyone who thinks this movie is good is the best way i can think about the film and its message to it,anyone who does not know this film was a little more sophisticated than the original movie and the first half of the film
2,he is not the only actor who could have done a better job,he is a very nice guy who has no problem finding himself in the
2,i have n't seen this show in my lifetime and i can only assume it was a very low budget film that,i have never seen any film that has been made as much as this but it 's not a good movie
2,like the other films of the same era the film is a complete waste of time and money and time,like i mentioned before it is not a bad movie and it does n't make sense but i do n't think
2,you have to watch it and you will be pleasantly surprised to find out,you know the story of a man who was killed in the end of this
2,a few years later the film has been released and i have to,a very good movie with great actors and an excellent story line
2,old fashioned movie about a young woman who is married and who is a woman,old man who is a man who has been killed by an evil virus and a
2,either the director or director of the film should be able for the director and the director for this travesty and the film would have been more interesting,either way it was a very nice film to see and i would recommend to anyone who likes to watch the movies and enjoy the movie and enjoy it
2,he was a great actor and he had great chemistry,he is the most talented person in the film
2,yes the movie is a bit slow,yes it 's a great movie
2,another thing that i found interesting was the way he was portrayed,another example that this movie could be made for a razzie award nomination
2,she was so good and the movie had a nice touch,she is the one who gets to do the best in her
2,clive owen plays an annoying and neurotic character,clive is a very talented character who is very
2,i was expecting the movie for the first time,i think it is the best movie ever
2,on the other hand the story is a bit too predictable,on this one the actors do not seem like they were reading
2,did n't he think he 'd have a chance,did n't you think that the real world would ever
2,firstly the film has a lot to do and is very entertaining,firstly it is the story that makes it a great movie
2,no one has ever done anything else,no wonder it 's not a great one
2,the film is a bit slow and,the story was n't very good
2,it is a very simple movie,it 's a pity that the movie
2,somewhere else is a movie about a man trying to get to the big city in,somewhere along comes the first half of the film is the same as the first
2,as a result the film was a total waste for me as a whole the film was a waste 2 hours,as i said earlier this film was not a total waste of money it is a waste of my life
2,well this is one movie i 'd love,well it 's a little too long
2,ive never heard of it until the end,ive never heard of the movie and it was
2,whole chunks are just plain bad,whole movie is just a bunch of
2,it is a very funny movie and i recommend that everyone should be careful about it and it is a must see,it 's a shame that the film is so bad that it 's almost impossible for me and i do recommend the whole
2,the story was so stupid and so lame it was painful for me,the story was a bit confusing at first because of the fact there was
2,he was n't a great actress but i,he is also a very good guy
2,then again the story is not bad,then the film switches to a very bad
2,and the movie was shot at a time when the movie is a little slow,and the acting is horrible and the acting is awful and it 's not really funny
2,either the director or director should have been,either way it 's a great movie
2,i have never seen any of his movies but i have n't seen this one yet,i think that the best thing about this movie is it is a complete waste of time
2,boy is it a bad film or does she know it,boy i love the movie and i think it is worth seeing
2,her performance is a bit overdone,her acting is very poor but she
2,the acting was terrible but it is n't bad,the movie was shot in a cheap digital style which
2,this is the kind that makes you want a good laugh,this film is a must for anyone who wants a laugh out
2,heston is a very good actor who is n't a great actor,heston is the only one who is able for the role of the
2,loc is the best man in the business and the movie 's only saving grace is the acting,loc is not the best character in the movie but his portrayal is not a bad one
2,because of the great acting the story line is very good,because of that i was n't expecting much of the story and
2,do you want a film to be a great movie and if you 're a fan you will enjoy this film and you will enjoy it,do n't worry about that but if i were a little bit of a fan of this movie i would have enjoyed the movie more
2,with the exception being the one who 's in the house with her boyfriend she is a little more than a bit of,with a lot of money this movie has a lot to say but i do n't want to spoil it for you
2,still this is a very entertaining movie with a great deal,still the movie does n't make sense and the story line is
2,i was expecting a great story and i was n't too surprised that i did n't,i think that 's a shame because the film does have a lot to offer
2,he was a little more believable and he could have been a bit more interesting,he 's the kind of guy who has to fight for his own life in order
2,if you want the movie you should check it out if it 's on dvd or just want,if i was n't that i 'd be in the middle of this film as i was
2,i was surprised to see that the,i was so impressed by it
2,this was a very bad movie,this was the best film that the
2,if you have n't already seen this one you will not be disappointed,if you have a masochistic stomach and are a bit more masochistic than you
2,kevin spacey is great as a man who is,kevin spacey plays the part he 's in
2,i have never been a big big fan,i was so excited to see this movie in
2,i was surprised to find that the movie is a bit,i do n't want it to happen in my head
2,wife and father is a very good film,wife is an excellent character study of a woman
2,walsh 's performance as his character is not,walsh is one that makes you think
2,this movie has the potential of having to,this film is a very bad one
2,his performance is very convincing as well and he 's quite convincing in this film but he is not the only actor that has to play the character he does,his character is a stereotype of a woman who is in love with a man who has a very troubled husband to do the same things she has to do
2,it is a movie that has been,it is a very funny movie
2,it 's a shame because it is,it 's not even the same
2,labeling it a great movie and you 'll be able,labeling this one on the imdb is a waste
2,the acting is good and there is,the movie is a complete mess
2,you know what 's coming from the first movie and it 's a good thing,you can see the director 's cut and the camera angles and lighting and lighting are
2,when you watch this show and you 'll be able to watch a lot and laugh,when he finally finds a way he is killed and the police officer is killed by a
2,as the movie continues we have to wait for the,as a result i found the story very engaging
2,in the end it is not a bad movie,in fact the film was so bad that it could
2,to me it was an interesting movie and it was a great,to be honest it 's not the greatest movie ever made
2,it 's the kind of movie you can watch in your teens 's basement,it 's not a good movie and it 's a shame that the film never
2,it 's not a bad movie but a good one at that,it 's not that i do see a film like that of any
2,but it 's not that bad either,but the film is not so bad
2,now that 's a good thing because i was n't sure if the,now i know that it is a movie that is so stupid
2,there are some very interesting moments but they are n't as,there are so much better films out in the us
2,the story line was good but it was n't,the film has some good points but it is still
2,carlos mencia is a great actor,carlos mencia was in the film and
2,the movie has a lot of problems but there,the movie is very good in the beginning
2,it 's a shame that this film is so hard to watch,it is a great movie and i recommend you do n't watch it
2,we 're talking about the same thing over and,we are supposed to sympathize with the characters
2,a very good movie with some nice actors and a good cast,a very interesting movie about how it is about a woman and the
2,a good movie to watch for a few laughs,a good film with an excellent script and an interesting
2,brown is the most famous and most of his films,brown is one that is n't a bad movie but is
2,as a movie this was one of his first films and the first one,as a matter the film has a certain charm and a sense of realism
2,he was the first person who had to be the most talented actor in,he is a very good character actor who has a very strong role
2,despite its shortcomings it is not a movie that is not only a visual film it is an,despite the fact it 's a movie about a young boy it 's a very interesting film
2,and the ending is a little unsatisfying,and it 's a shame because the movie
2,he is the only one that has to deal,he has the best lines in the film
2,the film has no real story to be found in any other movie,the story is about a man trying his hand at the world and the
2,really this film is not a good one,really the film 's biggest flaw is to make
2,the movie is about a young girl who has a boyfriend named jen who is married,the acting is horrible and there is no chemistry between characters in any other movie
2,jimmy durante is excellent as the lead character and,jimmy fallon 's character is just plain stupid
2,physically enough i found myself wishing that this would be more,physically he is n't the best actor of the bunch
2,outside of this movie the story is very interesting,outside of a few of these films i found it
2,he 's a good actor but his acting is n't bad,he is the only one that has ever seen him in this
2,he 's just as good and the movie as the title suggests,he has a good time and his character was a bit more likable
2,anyway the plot was very good,anyway i think the movie has a
2,sure there were some good points but i found the story line to have,sure it 's a great film but not a movie for everyone involved
2,the story line was so bad it was almost painful for me,the story line is a bit confusing but the movie is a good
2,the story of the movie is very good and the,the film is a little bit of the first
2,you can tell that the director and writer were not,you have a great cast and an excellent cast
2,it is a great story with great acting and a story line,it 's a shame that this was not released on video or dvd
2,i do not think this movie was made in a very realistic way,i do n't know what the hell was going for it i guess but
2,the movie is very well written,the movie has some great scenes
2,it 's not even the same movie as the first one,it is not a movie that i can only recommend to anyone
2,now the movie has a good cast and a good plot,now i do not know why i did n't watch a lot
2,i have seen it twice now in the theater in new zealand,i have to wonder if the director was trying too much
2,the film is a very good movie with a great story that makes it a must see for all,the story is about an ordinary man who has been sent into a life by a young woman
2,mateo is not only a little more than a loner but a very good one and he 's a good guy,mateo is an alcoholic who is sent to prison with a group of young people to help the poor boy who has
2,so if i were you i might not be able to see it again,so i guess the movie is a bit slow but the acting was pretty good
2,not only is it so much more interesting than it should be,not only is this movie a complete waste of money but the whole
2,i do agree but the film was n't as good,i think that it is a very good movie and should
2,the story is simple the characters are shallow,the acting is good but it does
2,what a shame that this movie has no,what 's the deal of the plot
2,after seeing the first movie in a few months the movie became a little more enjoyable to watch but it was not,after all this movie is n't about the people who have to be the best way to get out of it
2,she is also a great singer and a beautiful actress,she 's a very talented actress and she 's not a
2,andy lau is a good actor but his character was so annoying it 's hard to believe that he was the only person who could n't possibly have been more,andy griffith 's character is a caricature and the story is so full of holes that it 's impossible not to feel the need of attention to the characters
2,i have to say that this film has a,i was n't really surprised by this one
2,sands and the pendulum is the most boring and most overrated,sands of the seat and his work is the best
2,as the movie continues the movie begins to drag and,as a result it 's not a good movie
2,this movie is a complete waste of my time,this movie is one of many times that i would
2,but this is one of the worst movies i 've seen in years to come,but it does make a lot of sense to me as the story is told in
2,penelope cruz is a great actress in this film but she does have a very small role as a woman,penelope raines is a great actor and i hope she gets more screen credit than this one is in the beginning
2,most importantly it is an excellent film and i recommend this film to anyone with an open minded mind,most importantly the scene where he has a little girl and a girl in his bed was a bit of
2,in fact this is a very poor movie with no redeeming value,in fact the only thing good about this movie was the fact the
2,i do not think this is the best of the series,i think this film is a must watch for anyone who enjoys
2,all of the actors in this film were excellent in a,all in all a fun movie with a great cast
2,it 's a pity because it 's a very funny film,it 's a shame that such movies were never released on tv
2,everything in between the characters and the story,everything about it was just plain awful
2,the acting in this film was terrible and it was,the film has some of my alltime favorite actors
2,this film was made for the sake that the movie was made,this is a film for the whole world and should have stayed away
2,just do yourself the favor and rent the original,just do n't expect much to this film
2,the movie is a little slow paced but it does n't have the usual charm to make,the film is a complete mess and the film does n't make a whole new sense
2,why did the writers think they were trying too hard,why do we have to be subjected to the movie
2,corey haim is the only good character,corey haim 's character is so bad it
2,of course it does n't have a happy ending,of all of those movies this is a great film
2,simply put a movie is n't worth the time to view,simply put this is one film you can see in a movie
2,i think the reason why this movie was n't a success,i think this is the best movie of the year
2,that is a shame to say it,that 's a very funny thing
2,john cusak is the only actor who,john huston is a fine actress
2,needless up is an excellent film,needless to believe the movie 's main
2,the story of the story is not as good or original as it should be,the acting is good with the exception that it 's not a good idea to show
2,put it into the context of your average film and do not waste your time,put it this is the kind of crap i 've ever heard about the movie and
2,they are not in their midtwenties but they have to be one,they have the best actors of the day and they 're all good
2,it was a waste for me,it 's just so stupid that it
2,it 's the same old story that i did n't like,it 's a very funny movie that is not funny
2,coop is one of the best actors in the history group,coop is the one that makes him look good and his voice
2,if you want a real movie with a few good laughs and some great action you will find it,if you want the movie to get a bit of a message you 'll love this movie as well
2,hook has a lot to do and i think that is why the film is,hook and the film 's story is not a very interesting and interesting story
2,if the movie was n't bad i 'd have to disagree that the acting is,if i were to watch this movie again it would be a complete waste
2,but i have n't heard of the story so many years after seeing a movie that was a little too much to ask,but this is the worst movie of the year and the only one who has a good laugh at all is not that bad
2,the acting is very poor and the acting,the acting was good the story was ok
2,he has been the first of three great films to be released on the big,he 's the kind of guy that gets a lot of trouble with him
2,there was a bit of a good plot line but the movie is not,there is a very strong scene between the main character and a woman who is
2,apparently there is a lot more to say,apparently the film is n't a comedy
2,the acting is horrible the script is awful the script was horrible and the characters all over again,the story was a bit confusing and it did n't make sense but it was very entertaining
2,comic book is the first of the three films of,comic book is a great show and it shows
2,it is the best thing i 've seen for a long time since the last time,it 's not that i would n't have to watch it to see what it is
2,most movies are made in the same way as the originals and the story,most movies have a good cast and the characters were believable and believable
2,much of what 's happening here the characters were so bad they had to make the,much of it was made in 1980 the film is a little dated at best
2,while the movie is about the life of the two men it is also a,while it 's not a great movie i would recommend this movie to anyone
2,it has a great story and a good story line,it 's the same kind that i would have liked to
2,everything about it was bad and there is a scene in which she has a crush of her own mother who is the only one to get her,everything else is just so bad that you ca n't help but laugh and enjoy the movie even though you have to be the most annoying person
2,but the film has no redeeming qualities,but the film is a very interesting one
2,so the movie has a lot going it is a little bit too dark for me,so what i did n't see was that this movie is a bad film it was n't
2,then the story of the movie is about how a woman who is a woman,then there 's a few scenes in which the hero is trying to get a few
2,the acting is horrible and the story itself is,the film is a little over the top
2,at least the movie was n't funny,at least that 's what you 're thinking
2,as a result the plot and characters were so bad that they could n't have been developed,as the movie goes on its own the story is a bit too simple for a movie to
2,endless waltz is a very bad movie that,endless spoilers ahead there 's no plot
2,this is a very funny and enjoyable show,this film has the same basic premise as the
2,if it were a little more interesting it would have been a lot,if you want the movie you will find a lot of fun
2,when he is a girl in a car accident he finds a bag of water in the back of a hearse,when you watch it you can tell you that this movie is just a bad movie and it 's a bit of
2,i have n't seen a lot in this movie but i have to admit,i was surprised that this film was made in the early 80 years
2,if you 're a fan of the series i would recommend this one as it,if you have n't already seen it do yourself an favor do n't watch
2,whether you like the movie or not i am glad to say i did,whether or not it was the same thing that was in the book i thought
2,the story was n't bad but the actors and the actors were n't really good,the story of this story was a bit too much to follow and it did
2,i think that the movie was a little too good but the movie was so bad that it was actually a waste for,i think this is a great example for the film 's creator and the director for making a movie about the holocaust
2,really the worst film i can think of,really it 's a good film but the acting
2,the acting was terrible but the acting and the plot were so bad that it was almost painful to,the acting was horrible the script is bad the acting is horrible and the writing is just bad
2,the story of the movie revolves around the two young lovers of a man who lives on the farm and,the film was shot at an angle of the film which is the most important aspect of the movie
2,how could they have a film that has the same theme,how many movies can you tell you that you 're in for
2,so what 's wrong with this movie,so what i was looking forward for
2,she has the same role as she was in her first film,she is a good person and the movie has some good moments but
2,throw in some of the best actors i have ever seen,throw in a couple and a half of a bunch that 's
2,how can i possibly have to choose between them,how did the director think this is a good idea
2,the movie is about two men who are sent to the island to see,the acting is pretty good with the two leads being a bit better
2,naturally this is one of the worst of the series ever,naturally this is a great movie to see if only because it
2,the movie was shot in color and the editing was very,the story is simple and it is the same story
2,she is also the only one who is able to get a,she is a very talented actress and is a real joy
2,she is also a very good actor,she is also the one who is the
2,i think the reason why this film has a lot more depth is the fact the,i was so disappointed that the film was n't even nominated for a academy awards
2,alan rickman was great as the conflicted but determined,alan rickman was the best of the two
2,like the other reviewer who wrote that this is one of,like i said before the movie is not very good
2,other than that the film was a little too long to,other than that the movie is a little too long
2,is a great movie and one that,was the first of the three _EOS
2,let me just tell you that it has a good,let me start by saying i love this film
2,surely it is a shame because the film is n't a complete failure,surely it was the director of the book and the director 's name was
2,it was n't that bad it was a very,it is a very simple and moving movie
2,i think the film was a good choice for those of us that have seen this film and i have to say that i am a fan and have seen the original version,i have to say the movie did have a lot to offer the story line and the characters are believable to the point where they are trying to make the story interesting
2,we are shown to be a very harsh and gentle person,we are shown to the audience and the viewer is left wondering
2,i think that the movie is a little too long,i think the director 's cut is a bit too slow
2,this is the worst of all,this is the worst film ever
2,just as a film it 's a,just like the other two films
2,mr blandings has a very difficult role in his career and the supporting actor is also good,mr bean has a very small part as well and the acting is pretty bad and the story
2,he 's not only the best of the bunch but,he is a great director and a good man
2,like many others this was not one of them but the film was very well made and acted,like the previous reviewer said this is a good movie to be watched by a young audience who would
2,the film has a lot to offer and is very good to watch and it has a good story line,the movie starts with a very promising opening sequence where a man who is trying a cure in a bar in
2,at least it has a good cast,at least it is n't a good movie
2,i have to say i did not like it but it is a good family,i was n't really expecting the same thing to be said about the movie
2,arau has the ability to create an atmosphere of tension,arau 's character is a very likable and likable person
2,but this is a movie about the real,but this is a very good film
2,he 's not a good actor,he is the most talented actor of
2,finally the film 's main theme is that it is a film that has been,finally the movie is a little too long and the story is too predictable
2,so what do i know that this is a bad film,so the film is a little too long to be a good
2,at least it 's not a good idea and is not a film,at the end of the movie we learn how to be an outcast and
2,saturday morning live is an entertaining film and one thing i would recommend to anyone,saturday night fever is a very funny movie that i would love to see
2,he is not the only actor in the movie and he is not a very,he is the only person in the movie and he is a great fighter
2,by the end of the movie there was an,by the way i do n't know why
2,and it 's not a bad thing that it has been done,and that does n't make a movie a bad one either
2,on the plus of this movie i think i was a little confused,on the other hand if i were to rate it 0 i would have
2,matt damon plays his role perfectly,matt dillon 's character is a caricature
2,the acting is horrible and i 've seen better in a long while,the acting is good but the script was so weak that it was almost
2,the story of the film revolves in two of their best known actors and,the movie was shot in color and the camera pans in the background
2,so i was surprised that this was the only,so what do i expect from this film
2,i do n't think it was the best of it 's kind of film it was,i was surprised by the ending and i was really surprised by how it ended
2,i do not know why i watched this,i do agree that the film has some of
2,the film has an interesting plot and some good performances,the story is very weak and the characters seem to have
2,outstanding performances and an interesting story,outstanding and a very good film that
2,the acting and directing are very poor,the film is a complete mess
2,often i have to wonder what the director was thinking when he,often it 's the same story and the acting and directing
2,it is a very good story with,it 's not even worth renting
2,sonatine is a very moving film with a message that is not afraid of any of its literary themes,sonatine was a great show that was a lot more enjoyable than it was and it is very well done
2,a very interesting film that i enjoyed,a good movie to be seen by everyone
2,what i did n't like is that it was a little bit too much to be,what is more important to the story is the fact of the film 's title
2,the acting was good the script and the directing are good but it is not a movie,the movie has an allstar actor who plays a young and very young boy with the right guidance
2,it 's not that bad but it 's not a bad movie either it is not,it 's a great movie and it was a joy that i would n't have to go
2,that said this is the best movie i have watched,that was a good way of making a movie
2,has the movie been done by an outsider,has a very strong cast of people in their
2,this film does a lot of research on a subject matter,this film is one of the worst movies ever made
2,basically the film has a lot to offer,basically the movie is n't really a good movie
2,all i could do is laugh,all of these are the best i
2,but this is one movie that i have seen,but the film has some very interesting moments
2,in fact it 's the worst film i 've watched since gigli,in this case the movie is a complete waste of time
2,part 2 of the year is a film that has a lot to say about it,part 2 has a very good plot but i think it was a bit slow and boring
2,the story is a little thin,the movie starts out as a typical
2,not only does the story have its share of,not to mention that the acting is bad
2,everyone involved is in the same situation as the first one,everyone involved in the making comments should be required to make this
2,with a lot more to say than that i would say that,with this film he has to rely heavily on his own
2,we get to watch this movie as it is a movie that has no plot,we get the impression that the director is trying to make a film with his camera
2,shah rukh khan 's performance is the only reason i gave up on the,shah rukh khan 's performance in his career is a bit over here
2,you have n't even been able into a horror genre that 's a good one,you have to be a bit pushy and have n't read any of these other reviews
2,as a result it has been done by a,as a movie it fails on many fronts
2,apart from that it is an excellent film,apart from that it 's not even worth watching
2,this film is a must see for,this is a very good show
2,this movie is a complete waste of my favorites,this was a movie for me to be entertained
2,it has the best of it and is a very enjoyable movie and it 's very good to be able to see the movie,it 's the story about the life of two friends and their relationship with each other and the way they live in the real life
2,i do not think that the film is so good but it,i was n't sure why the hell was n't so much
2,eventually he 's a man in a hospital and is forced to leave and start with a man in a suit that he,eventually he is a very good actor who is a good actor and has a great voice to play in his films
2,regardless of this i do n't have the patience of,regardless of the plot the movie is very entertaining
2,so the movie is about a man trying his luck in a world war ii and his family,so if the movie had a good plot and the acting was so bad it would n't have helped
2,granger is the best actor of all times,granger and dunne are a pair of characters who
2,the story of the story is a bit of fun,the film is about a man who is trying to get
2,sure this film is a bit of a spoof,sure this movie was n't a good film
2,historically correct as an example of the film 's history and history,historically the film has an interesting plot and a great cast
2,aboard the train station is an excellent movie,aboard the other hand the film 's main character
2,instead of being an expert it is a very good show that is so,instead it is the worst movie i 've seen in a long while
2,now this was a very good film but i was not,now that 's a little bit too much for it
2,though it is a very good movie it is not a movie,though it 's not that bad it 's still a great one
2,frankly i do n't think this was a great,frankly it was a waste for the film
2,i was so bored by the story and characters,i have seen the movie multiple many times before and
2,oh and a lot more than the movie 's plot the acting the acting and overall the movie is a total bore from start to finish,oh yes i know that 's the only thing i can remember from this movie and i have to admit that i am not going through the
2,but it was not the first time we saw a woman 's body in this movie that she was,but the story was a little too thin and the characters were just too stupid to be true
2,the movie starts out with a bunch of friends who are in a car crash,the acting and directing was superb and the direction by the director was great and the
2,it is a great movie to watch,it 's not a bad movie
2,whereas it is a good film i have seen it several more times and i still love it more than i can imagine it 's a very good movie,whereas i have to admit that i was n't impressed by the fact that this film was made on a shoestring budget i could only give it a zero
2,the film 's plot is a little weak and the ending was predictable but it was a great movie to watch for a couple,the movie has some good acting in the cast which is a pity because the story is so bad it 's almost painful
2,cliffhanger has been done before but the fact remains that it,cliffhanger was the first time i ever heard of it
2,season 4 is one that is worth watching,season 3 is a classic example of why the
2,not only does it not take itself a bit too seriously and i do not,not to mention that it was the first movie in the series of films
2,in this film the characters were all over,in the meantime of the movie the characters were
2,its a very funny film that i would n't want to see if it had a,its a very good film with a good story good actors good story great acting
2,the film is a very good example of the kind i 've seen and that 's not the case,the film has an excellent soundtrack and a great score that is not to be taken from the film
2,momma is an interesting and very funny movie,momma is a very good film with a lot
2,a lot of the scenes are filmed,a lot more than i expected
2,i was expecting a movie to watch this movie,i have to admit i was n't impressed
2,zap ventura 's performance was also excellent,zap 's father is the best of all
2,catherine deneuve plays an ambitious woman with an attitude for a married husband who has been,catherine deneuve as a woman and her husband as the mother is very well portrayed
2,another thing that makes me laugh is the ending,another thing that is missing is the acting and the
2,and the ending where he was in the movie was a good idea,and the acting was horrible the script was horrible the acting is bad
2,but i have to say that this is a great movie that i will definitely watch again,but this movie is so bad it makes you feel like you 've wasted a hundred dollars on
2,both are a good movie and i do n't want them,both films have a very good cast and are great
2,there was a lot going around here,there are some very funny moments
2,it is not the worst of all,it is not a bad film
2,and i do n't think that it is,and it is a very nice movie
2,it has a very good cast and it is a great film,it 's a very bad thing that this is not a movie for
2,great acting great acting and a story line that is not only a comedy,great film and good acting great story good acting good music a good script good
2,and i do n't think that it is so bad it 's funny it was just a waste of time,and it was n't that good either i would have liked it if i had a little bit of fun with
2,honestly it 's a good movie to watch,honestly the movie is not as bad as the
2,despite being a little too talky it 's still pretty funny too,despite being the first of the two films to be released on vhs
2,the story of the movie is a bit,the film has an odd plot line
2,nobody has ever been so inclined to do anything,nobody seems interested to be able to make a good
2,i was expecting a lot more than i did but i did n't like the movie,i was so bored by this movie that it was hard not only for the first hour
2,i'm not sure whether this is intentional or not as a comedy but as a comedy it has a lot more,i'm not sure if i am not a good person and i do not understand how the story is told
2,of course there are no more than one person who has a good sense,of this is how it is done with a great cast of characters
2,for those of you unfamiliar in the 80 's,for me this was a very funny movie
2,rani dixit has a small role but she does n't have the same,rani silverstone was good and i thought she had the best role
2,he is a man who has been in love,he is a very talented man with his own unique
2,my friend is a fan of the show but it,my favorite scene involves the scene with the woman
2,a good example of the genre 's,a lot happens to be seen
2,cinderella is the one that has the ability to make a living,cinderella 's mother is a great movie that is not for the kids
2,but it 's not a bad movie it is n't,but the movie is n't as good as the first two
2,the movie was a bit of an,the film is a complete mess
2,kelly is a great actor and is very good in the role he is given and he 's a great actor in the,kelly is a great actress and she is very good in it and is the only real standout character of all time
2,this is a very very bad attempt by,this was an interesting movie to watch
2,elsewhere the movie has a lot of good,elsewhere it is a very good movie
2,you can tell that this movie was made on an budget and it was made in,you can watch the movie with the lights and it is not a bad thing
2,after all the film has been made for tv and the,after all the movie is about a woman 's life
2,i was surprised at the end when the movie was released,i have never read the original novel or read the books but
2,rather it is the worst thing i 've seen,rather the film is not a documentary about the war
2,but this is not a good film and the acting is not good at the time,but it is a great movie and i think the movie is very good in its own
2,asoka is a great film that i think is an absolute mustsee for all of,asoka is one such a great film and it is the best of all
2,if you want to make something like this i think you 're not missing out to the contrary,if it was a little bit more of an old movie i would have been surprised by the story
2,i have never heard a movie before but this one was so awful,i was so excited that the movie ended up being so boring
2,that is what the film is about,that 's what makes this film so good
2,most of the movie 's characters and events were altered and the ending was just a bit too abrupt,most of the film is about a woman who has been killed and has a crush on her
2,i think that the best part in this movie is the fact that they do not even get to see a movie,i do agree but the movie is so good that i do not know where the film was filmed and it was n't
2,its the best of the series,its a very bad movie but it
2,instead the movie takes a turn for something like the characters in the first half,instead of the usual suspects of the world we have no idea what to do with
2,even the acting was n't that bad either,even the music is n't very well chosen to
2,here 's the spoiler i was n't sure why i watched this movie so,here we have a film about the lives between the two main players
2,seagal is a great actor who is n't the only actor in this movie that makes me want a movie,seagal is a good actor but he does have some good lines and a great deal to work on
2,if i had n't seen the movie i would n't even bother renting this film,if you have a choice for a film you can appreciate the fact that the story
2,in a movie that has a good story line the,in the end the movie ends with a bang
2,watching this film is a must see,watching this movie i was a bit skeptical
2,if you 're looking for something like that i would n't be surprised,if you are a fan you will probably like this one but if your
2,it 's the only way this film can get even more enjoyable,it 's just a bad film and it does not work
2,also a very funny scene where he is talking about a woman in,also the scene where he is in the bar with the girl
2,the film is a very good film and it 's a shame that the film is n't as great as this film,the acting is very bad and i do think this was a very bad movie that was n't even worth the effort
2,my favorite scene is when he dances up to a tree and the girl says,my favorite part was that the movie was made in the early 90 's
2,but it does n't have to do with the rest and,but the film is a complete mess of the original
2,both films are very good and are not,both films are a lot of fun
2,and the movie is a little over done and a good one but the film,and it does not take a long to realize how the movie was made
2,while i do not know why the film is so bad it 's a disgrace to a movie,while this movie was made in the us i was expecting a good film with a lot more than
2,every time i see the movie it,every scene is a little overdone
2,in the movie the main character 's father is killed,in a nutshell this is a very funny film with a
2,no it 's a good movie to watch,no one could ever accuse the director to make
2,filmgoers who have seen the film have a lot more to say than,filmgoers who have n't watched the movie are either missing or reedited
2,the acting was terrible the directing was terrible the editing was awful the special effects are awful the special effects were bad the special effects were awful the,the movie was made in the seventies but the film is very slow and the characters do nothing to dispel their motivations or their motivations and motivations
2,it 's not a bad movie but the acting is good enough and the acting was excellent the writing and direction was great,it was so bad that it could n't even be called a bad movie and it was n't even worth a dollar ticket
2,jessica alba plays the part of the mother who is a,jessica tandy plays the mother who has a heart attack
2,most of the actors are good and the plot line is pretty solid for a horror flick,most of the movie consists of various elements of the movie and the plot is a little confusing
2,i was so excited when i saw this,i have never read the original novel but i
2,toby and dave is a good movie but it,toby is a young man with his wife
2,it has the same kind to the movie and the characters are well developed to say their own,it is the best movie of its genre and is one of the most underrated films of the year
2,i do not recommend this for anyone looking for a movie to sit,i do think it 's the funniest movie i have ever watched
2,the film is a very interesting one,the movie is a complete mess
2,with this movie i have a feeling that the movie is not the best,with the exception that he has been in his own for the most part the
2,it 's a shame because the movie is n't really worth watching,it has a lot of good moments and it has some good points
2,you can tell that the director and writer were trying too much to make a film about a guy who 's been kidnapped by his,you know that the film has been a lot better than the average hollywood film and it 's hard not for the first two
2,a lot like the movie i saw the last 15 minutes of,a good cast of characters and the plot was very interesting
2,leonard nimoy was great as the villain,leonard maltin has a great talent for this
2,russ tamblyn plays a young man in the middle of a crowded car crash,russ meyer is the only one in the film who can act as a villain
2,as a result of a movie this one is just plain awful with no real plot,as a result i was a fan that was the only way i could have seen this
2,do yourself a favour avoid this movie,do yourself a big favor and skip it
2,she 's the only person that has,she has to be a woman
2,well the movie is not a bad film but i would,well i do not know how to describe the movie
2,if you have a craving for a movie that is not only a good idea for a movie it 's,if the movie is a good one you can tell that it has the potential of a good story
2,the film was shot on location in new york city,the movie was shot on location in the same year as
2,i think it 's a good idea to get a good film out there,i have n't seen this film in my life since i was in the theater
2,produced to be a film that is not a masterpiece or an interesting story or even a drama it has to be,produced to be a film that is a must have been a fan of any of the actors and the story
2,not only does he have to have his own hands but the film has the feel,not that i have any idea how this film could have made a good story
2,a good film with a very interesting plot,a lot of the film was filmed on video
2,this is the worst film ever made,this is a very bad show
2,there is a very funny line between the two,there was no real plot and no plot
2,the story of this story is about two people who have a relationship together and are married to their mother,the story is about two people who go to a house to find a new home in their home where their
2,the story of a young woman who,the movie has some great moments
2,he 's a very good actor and he 's a great actor,he is a great character and is a great actor and i love
2,it has a very good cast but it is n't a good movie,it 's a shame because the movie is n't really a movie
2,there are some funny moments but it 's,there was no plot to this movie
2,and it 's a shame that it is,and i was impressed by the story
2,carey 's character is a caricature of the film 's own but he,carey 's acting was so bad that i was laughing hysterically hard
2,it is a movie about the holocaust of life,it 's a shame that this movie did have some
2,the film was made for tv and,the movie is a complete bore
2,while the plot is somewhat original there is a lot more to the story,while it 's true that the story is not as bad it is very very
2,some of the acting was good but the script was so awful that i felt like it had a,some of these movies do n't make sense but it was fun seeing them in a different light
2,at the end of the film there are a bunch of interesting,at least it 's a good movie and a good movie
2,maybe he was just the one who did n't care much for him and he,maybe the film is just about the only thing i can think of that
2,i was so impressed when i heard that it would be a great movie,i think that the director should be commended to the director to give us the
2,it is not a movie that you,it 's a very simple movie
2,jean gabin is a fine actor and the rest is a bit stiff,jean gabin is a great actress and the acting in the film was very
2,this is the best movie i 've ever,this is the best of his career
2,the movie is a bit slow and slow,the movie was shot with the same budget and
2,i think that 's why i gave the film a 2 for a very good reason,i have never been a fan of any of his movies but this was a great one
2,tv series is a very interesting film,tv has a very good story and is
2,although the movie has a few moments of unintentional humor it is still funny,although i was impressed by the acting i found myself asking myself what was that
2,boring and pointless and not worth watching if you are a fan or you have n't,boring plot twists are not enough to make me want a refund to be made
2,so if i had the chance it would have been better,so if i had n't been able for the most part to
2,experiences and the other is one of those who have the audacity to make an appearance in the story and the,experiences and the fact that the film was made in the early 80 's was a bit of a stretch
2,the acting was good and i was able into this movie,the acting is horrible the story is worse the dialogue is worse
2,burton 's performance is also a good one and a bit of an,burton is a great actor but he has a very bad role
2,after seeing the trailer for a new version of a film i,after all it 's the best thing in a good movie
2,not only is it a great show but the actors who have a good time making this show,not only does it look like it is made in a very cheap way it looks pretty cheap but
2,i think this is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who loves action movies,i have n't laughed once and i was very impressed to find that the movie was not a
2,it was a good idea and the movie is a great example to see,it 's not a movie about an evil killer who has a crush in his
2,whoever wrote a comment should be appalled by,whoever wrote this movie should be banned
2,the acting is pretty good and the story lines were very entertaining,the story line was a little confusing but the movie is a bit
2,of the few movies i had seen the first one,of all things this movie is a total waste
2,what i did like was how this movie was released theatrically,what i did n't realize was that the director did so much
2,i was surprised by the fact that the movie was made in a small budget,i have to say that it 's one of those shows that is so funny and
2,the movie was n't so bad that i could n't believe the hype,the movie is about the man who is a loner who is a man
2,but i was n't expecting to see this one,but the real problem with this movie are the acting
2,this film was a waste of time and i have seen worse in my time it has,this movie is a great example of a good film and it has some great moments
2,towards one moment the film is shot with no real sense of what is happening,towards the end when the movie is over and over and over and over and over
2,other than that i would say it 's a very good movie,other than that the plot was pretty weak but the acting and the
2,its a shame that the film did not get released theatrically on dvd as well because it was a little too much for my liking,its not a bad film and the actors who play their roles are not very convincing and they do n't seem to be acting
2,how can you make a sequel with a good cast,how did they manage to get a movie that is so
2,abandoned in his own world he is able for revenge and the world he 's been experiencing,abandoned in his own life and in his life he is the most powerful person of our time
2,you 'll never know what the hell was that,you can tell that the film is not a comedy
2,as a result it 's a little bit too slow,as a movie this is a very bad movie
2,the movie is about as much of the same as a real movie,the movie was a little slow but the ending was very good and the
2,congrats to the director for putting the,congrats for the actors and actresses
2,the acting in the other two was pretty good,the story of the movie was a little too thin
2,i was expecting this to be a good movie but the,i have seen the film numerous times in my life
2,it was so stupid and so boring that i had no interest,it was so stupid that it made the movie a bit more interesting
2,the acting is good the plot is a,the film is a very good film
2,i do not recommend this film,i think that 's why this film
2,the film is about two women who live,the acting in this movie was horrible
2,like a lot to think that the director was the most talented filmmaker of the last ten minutes or a few seconds of,like the first movie it 's a little more of a drama than a horror movie and the ending is pretty predictable
2,i was surprised to learn that the story of the film is about the importance of life,i do n't think that this movie is the most original film ever to be made
2,there is no real explanation for the,there 's no reason for it
2,let 's face this movie the story line was a bit weak,let 's get back on track the film is a total disaster and
2,the story is a little thin but the movie has a lot of good things happening and it 's not a good,the acting in the first movie was so good i was surprised that the movie had been released in the uk
2,his performance as a character is so overthetop that it becomes annoying,his character is a stereotype who has been a loner and he is
2,even if the movie was n't bad it,even the music is n't as good
2,anyway i have n't read it,anyway i have a soft spot on
2,one of the most underrated movies i have seen,one thing is to say the least of it
2,scorsese 's the thing he 's a great actor and is also the most recognizable character,scorsese is the master of this film and the film does n't have any of the elements
2,the acting is good the script was good but,the story is very simple and very simple
2,all i know about this film was that it was a little bit,all the while the movie is set in the middle of nowhere
2,now i have seen the first one,now i have seen this movie and i'm
2,the story was a lot of fun but not enough for me,the story of the movie and it 's a little bit complicated but
2,this movie is a must for anyone with a sense for a,this is a film for the lovers of the late forties
2,for me i have a feeling of disgust for the director and the director and the director,for the first half of the movie the acting is superb and there are a few good moments
2,so if i had to give it a zero because the acting was horrible,so the film goes nowhere and it is not even a good movie
2,guiness is a fine actor and the rest of the cast is excellent and i do n't know why i never heard of this movie,guiness was a bit of a loser in a movie that was a bit more than a comedy but it 's not a good movie
2,interesting to see the movie is not as good,interesting and interesting and i do n't think that it
2,it 's not even that funny to watch,it has the most interesting character of the entire
2,shortly afterwards the film begins with some of a sudden meeting in the middle of the film and then we get,shortly afterwards he is a young man in a small provincial city in the early 1930s and early 1900 another
2,slander is an excellent piece of film noir and it has the potential to be the first,slander of the plot was that the movie was shot with the lighting of a car
2,after a while you realize the movie is a comedy,after seeing it i could n't help to get to the
2,in fact it is not even worth the time,in a way it is a great show
2,to make matters worse the acting was horrible and,to be honest the film is very good
2,he 's just not as convincing as a character who 's,he 's a very talented actor and a great actor
2,i do n't know if the director,i was n't impressed by it
2,but the film 's biggest flaw are that they,but the film is a little too long
2,i have to admit i was impressed by the movie,i think the movie 's main flaw is the fact that
2,jessica biel 's character has the same role as her sister,jessica alba plays the daughter who is the only person to be
2,an interesting story about a young girl who moves away,an interesting film and an excellent movie for anyone
2,before this is the only movie that has the potential of the original and it is not a movie,before i wrap up this i have the displeasure of watching a film with the same director and director
2,ok i do not know why i have to say it was the worst film i have watched in a while and i'm not going as far as i'm concerned,ok i do not think that this is one of the best movies of the year it is a great film and a good one for those of us
2,i think this is one of those,i think it is a shame
2,people who have n't been in the movie business should be warned,people who do n't know the difference between them but i have no
2,near the same time he has a very difficult task of finding out who the killer was,near the end of this film i thought it was a very poor movie and i would say
2,but the movie has a good cast,but the film 's plot is not as
2,not only is he a very good character he 's a very good guy who can,not only does the film have an interesting message but it is also quite entertaining
2,slowpaced is a good example for the movie 's,slowpaced is the only thing that i liked
2,it is not the best of all the movies i can say but it has a few good moments but it 's not that,it 's the story of a girl in a mental hospital who is trying to get her son to go to a school
2,the movie is about as bad in a movie like that,the movie was a bit too long and the ending was too
2,a very funny film that is not only for its visual value,a few years back i have a 35mm video of the show
2,reporter and the girl is a very good movie,reporter sam raimi is an excellent actor and he 's
2,and it is not a bad movie to watch and enjoy but,and i have to say that the movie is very good
2,this is one of those movies that i can only watch because of the bad acting the bad directing or anything,this is a movie for the whole generation of people that do n't have a lot of fun watching this
2,this is a movie for everyone who loves the book but it was a waste of my time,this film is a complete waste of time and money and time to waste your life on it and
2,the movie is a little slow paced and very,the film is a little bit too long
2,grease was one of the best films ever and i have never been able for,grease is a movie that will appeal to everyone who likes a good movie
2,4 the story of the girl is a little weak,4 a group that was in a car accident
2,well this was a very good movie,well i have n't seen this movie yet
2,the film has no redeeming features,the acting and direction were very good
2,the movie is about a man named sam a young boy and his,the movie was a waste and i was surprised to find it
2,the film was shot in the early seventies,the story was n't very bad but the acting
2,however the film is a bit slow at first,however the movie is a complete waste of time
2,i have n't seen the first movie but the original was a great one and i liked it,i have to say the film has a good deal of humor to it that is not only for
2,but this is a great film,but it was not a good film
2,this movie was a total disappointment to,this movie is not for everyone
2,all in the same way the actors were in the movie,all in all it 's a great movie that is a must
2,the acting is good and the direction is great,the film is a little slow paced with some really
2,bruce willis is the only one to come close to being the most likable and interesting and he 's a very good character,bruce dern plays a character who is not only an action hero but a very likable character and is a likable character
2,wonderful film about the holocaust and a,wonderful performances and the story lines
2,rita jovovich 's character is a bit,rita hayworth was a great character
2,the story is about a young boy who,the film has a lot to say
2,the film has no redeeming qualities to any one of the other,the acting is horrible and i have n't even mentioned it
2,if it had n't made it for the first ten min i would have been able into it and it would be better,if you 're going through the events in the first half you will find a lot more than just a bunch of other movies
2,it 's not that the story is,it 's a very good movie
2,this movie is one to see,this movie is so bad it hurts
2,based on the novel by john carpenter it has the same plot a good cast an intriguing story and an intriguing plot line that makes it interesting,based on a play by the author of the famous novel the film was written by a man named john a man in the same cloth as he
2,the film is not about the war but about a,the acting is horrible the story line is awful
2,this was the worst movie ever to have graced,this movie was so awful it was funny
2,as a result of the fact that it has the same plot as a typical hollywood formula it is a film that has a lot,as a fan i have to admit that the film is a little too long and i think it 's a very good thing
2,the film has a very good story and,the movie is a very interesting one
2,i think the film is a very good film and,i think that the best part was the ending
2,5 the acting is n't that great either,5 the acting in this is pretty poor the
2,lame acting bad acting bad directing bad,lame acting bad script terrible direction
2,i'm a huge fan and i do applaud the movie for the fact this movie sucks,i'm not saying that i am so disgusted that i have seen it in a movie theater
2,mccool 's is the only one that can make you smile,mccool has a lot of potential to make it and it 's
2,now that the film is going on the way i think that it was the worst film ever,now that i have seen it i have a hard time figuring out what it was about but i
2,i think the reason why the director was n't interested in,i was expecting a great story and i was surprised
2,general tilney is the only reason why i,general tanz is a very good film
2,it 's just a bad movie that 's a little too long for the mst3k version,it 's a shame to see a movie like that in this movie and it 's not
2,it was a good idea to make an interesting film but,it 's just so bad it 's good to me
2,the acting was horrible the directing is awful,the story of the film is a bit confusing
2,a very good film with excellent acting and good,a good cast is wasted on this one
2,2 the movie has a very good cast but the script does n't seem to be that interesting either,2 the acting is n't bad but i did n't think it was the script or the direction
2,it 's just not the same thing,it 's a very simple movie with the
2,so if you want to see a movie about an airplane in a country,so what do you expect from an independent film that is so bad
2,like the other reviewer i 've seen this one,like many other reviewers here have mentioned this movie is
2,however the film is n't so bad it is n't good,however i think the movie has been a lot better since the
2,based in the same vein the movie was made for the sole purpose of the first movie,based in the real life story of the famous american family the story of a man who is
2,the film has a very interesting story and is n't really a good film but the performances and direction,the movie was a waste of my favorites and i would have to say that i was disappointed
2,if you 're going to get a good laugh at the movie then,if i were n't that i would be able to overlook that
2,this film was not a complete waste but it certainly was worth the time to watch it,this movie has a lot of action and it 's not a bad movie but it is n't
2,the movie was a waste and i did not like the movie for the story,the movie was a little slow but the story was very good the characters were well
2,he was a little too busy trying,he is not a good actor
2,my friend and i were both laughing hysterically at how bad the movie was,my friend was in the movie and i was n't impressed at the same level
2,i think it 's a good movie,i think the reason why i gave this
2,people who have n't read the book should read the books and see,people who have seen this film are not sure who it is
2,but the film is a very good and entertaining movie,but it is not a movie that you 'll watch over
2,the film is a bit slow and drags out too slowly to be a thriller,the film is a bit slow moving and the plot is n't that bad either
2,beethoven was the only character who seemed like a good guy,beethoven is not as much an action hero as he is in
2,to me that is the reason for watching this movie is that it is a very good movie,to be fair i have n't seen it since the first movie i saw in the theater and i
2,i was n't really expecting much but it was n't that great to begin with,i do not think the director should be allowed to write an essay for the movie
2,suddenly the film is about a man trying to find a job for,suddenly the film becomes a big hit and the film ends abruptly
2,maybe i missed it but i think that is why i did n't like it,maybe it is the director 's fault to the point of view of a movie
2,there 's also a very good scene where the hero 's character is revealed to,there 's a lot going on here that 's the point of this movie
2,while the story is n't too original i do not think that the film is a masterpiece of the genre,while the film is a bit slow paced and the plot has some holes there was a lot to be learned
2,some people say this is a good show,some of them are not as good
2,as a result i was a little disappointed in this,as a result the movie has a lot more to offer
2,it 's a shame that the movie is n't as much of a comedy as it 's an attempt,it is not a film that will be seen by anyone with an appreciation for film making and the most
2,he 's just a guy with a lot to live,he 's a good actor but his character was so annoying
2,matt damon and the rest of the crew are just plain,matt damon plays the character who is a real cowboy
2,only the first half is the same,only a few people will be able to
2,the film has no redeeming features whatsoever,the story line was good but the characters
2,so what if you can find a better movie,so if i were to make an elaborate movie i
2,silly and stupid the first time i watched this movie i was a bit frightened,silly and pointless but the movie does a great disservice to its subject matter
2,it has the same kind of humor that i think the first two,it has a very good ending but it is not a movie
2,all in all it has a good plot and good acting but this film has a few good parts but it 's just a boring movie with,all the actors were very bad and the story was just stupid the characters were n't believable and the plot line had a lot of holes
2,i was expecting the same to be a great show,i think that it is a shame that the film has
2,13 years later the movie 's only purpose is to entertain and confuse,13 out of 4 stars but not enough to keep you watching
2,i do n't know how this got a pg rating,i think it 's a shame because the story is so
2,but the movie is so boring it 's not even funny it 's just,but this is a film that should have been released in the us
2,the movie is a very interesting one,the story is simple but it is n't
2,frankly the film was a waste,frankly the movie is n't as bad
2,i have n't read a lot that the movie,i was so excited when it came out
2,over the course of this film we see the young man 's struggle for his life and how he has been in love with him in the past and how he,over the course of this film there is an odd and unnecessary scene that will make you jump and the ending will probably be a bit too abrupt for me
2,there 's a bit to like here but it is n't a great movie either,there are many many things in the movie that i did n't like about this show
2,lieutenant is a man who is trying his own business and is a very rich man with,lieutenant is a man in the army who has a small part as a young girl
2,an excellent film and a must watch,an excellent film with great performances from the
2,as a matter there are a few good things about the movie but the acting is,as a result the film has no plot and it just does n't make sense
2,it was the best movie ever,it 's a shame that the film
2,this is one movie you do not want to miss out of and i do n't want to see it again and i will never forget that it was made,this is not a film that is a complete waste of your time and a complete lack of a better plot and a better storyline than the average hollywood movie
2,and i do think this is a great movie for everyone to see,and the movie is a bit too slow for a movie like the matrix
2,i do n't understand why the film is so good and so much of it is not that it 's just a bit slow,i was surprised to see that the first film was a bit of a disappointment but it was a great movie to watch
2,well i have to admit that it was the best movie ever made,well this was one of the best movies i 've ever seen
2,ok so this film was a bit,ok i do n't know why
2,in the first part we are treated a series of bizarre events that make no difference,in fact the film is not as bad but it is not a good film and it
2,to be honest the acting in this movie,to me it is a great movie
2,i was so bored by this movie that you could n't help it,i do agree with the reviewer that the movie does n't have a single
2,the acting in the other is good but the story and acting are so bad that it 's difficult to make it,the story is about a young girl who is a woman who wants a child and she 's been married to her
2,this film is not for those who want to be,this is a very good and very entertaining film
2,all the characters are likable and likable,all the while this movie has a lot
2,in fact the film is a little too slow and too predictable,in a nutshell the film was a little too much of an insult
2,brady 's performance is very good,brady is a good actor but i
2,mental health has been done in a way or two,mental capacity are the most interesting things to come out of
2,by the time the movie ends we 're left,by far the best of it 's kind
2,and the acting in this film is so good it 's almost as if the,and i do n't know what the hell was going wrong with this movie
2,a lot of people are talking about the story and it is n't a good idea,a very interesting story with a strong message about how the world of the war is going
2,the movie starts off with the first one being the same as in the first movie,the acting in all this is good but the plot is so bad that it is impossible
2,first of the first two seasons of season 1 the story of the series is a bit different and the series is n't a good episode,first of all the movie is not about the story of the characters or their motivations or actions and the events in which the characters interact
2,get it right now and then it 's just another movie,get to the bottom and you 'll find a new version of
2,haig has to have the best lines in the movie and the film does n't make a lick of sense and i think that the director should have,haig is an intelligent man and his mother who 's been kidnapped by a man in a mental institution is a very good idea for a movie
2,i was surprised to see that the film was a success,i was surprised to discover that the director was trying hard to
2,seeing the movie is an excellent experience and i hope that it will end soon,seeing this movie was like watching paint grow and the devil 's rain in the same
2,the movie is about a group of people who have been living,the film 's main flaw is to have a few laughs
2,additionally it 's not that bad it is n't,additionally the film is not a good movie
2,the movie was shot on location,the story is very good and it
2,after a long shot of the car the two,after a while the movie is a mess
2,by the third act it was n't that bad either but it was n't bad,by far the worst thing about that was that it did not even have any of
2,do not waste my money on this movie,do you think the movie is supposed to have
2,the movie is a complete waste,the story is a bit slow but
2,it 's just a bad film and i ca,it has a very funny and funny scene
2,second of course i was n't impressed,second the acting is pretty awful
2,are we supposed that the people in it are,are they all that really really really bad
2,as i 've said this movie is not the worst movie i 've ever seen but,as a movie it is not a great one but it is a great movie
2,i was expecting something like this to,i do not recommend this movie
2,to be fair there 's a lot going,to me it 's just another film
2,it is n't a movie that is,it 's a very funny movie
2,so if you 're looking at a horror movie,so what if it were a good thing
2,although the film has an interesting premise the characters are very well done and are all believable,although the movie is about a man who is trying and tries hard on his luck it is
2,the movie is very slow moving and,the movie is about a bunch
2,i have n't seen it so i do,i do not think that this was intended as
2,sure it 's a bit of an attempt to,sure it is a little bit too long
2,is that the only thing that makes it,is this the worst movie of 2008
2,kind of like the first movie,kind of an old fashioned and the
2,this is one of my favorite tv movies and i have,this movie is a complete waste of time to watch
2,it 's a shame because the plot is a bit thin and predictable,it 's a very simple and funny show with the most famous cast members
2,they are the only people in the world who are n't,they were all very well cast and i was impressed
2,as for the story it is a very good one,as for the acting it 's a good thing to say
2,these are the two things i did n't understand,these are not a bunch or two of the other
2,once the film started to drag it was just plain boring,once you get past this you have to be a sucker for
2,this movie is so bad i could not bear it but it was a total flop and i could n't stop laughing,this was a movie that i would n't watch if it was on tv and the movie was just plain stupid and i
2,instead it is an interesting story and a great one as is it 's a very very very very very funny film with a lot of laughs,instead it has some of the worst acting i 've ever heard in a movie and it 's the only reason i even considered it a 9
2,death is the worst film in my collection but it 's not that great either,death bed was the first movie i saw that i saw as an example for myself
2,why do n't we just do n't get,why do i give this a 1
2,the story is simple enough but the story is n't as bad and the actors are all good,the story is very interesting and it is a great family film with a strong story line
2,he is also in a wheelchair of the same cloth that is,he is also the only one that is able to survive
2,it is a shame because the film does n't have much of a plot,it is not even a film it was a waste of my money
2,and it 's not a good thing,and that was the only way to make
2,something like this happened when the movie started to drag,something about the film is that it is the first movie
2,she is also the only person that is a bit too much and her,she is not only an actress she 's just a little too cute
2,this movie is so awful it 's funny to see,this was the first time he appeared in the movie and
2,the film has a very interesting plot,the movie has an allstar actor and it
2,it has the same effect on the characters as well,it 's a shame that the movie did n't get more
2,though this was a very bad show it 's still a very entertaining movie,though i was expecting something more than the usual hollywood blockbuster i 'd say this
2,but the film is not about a group,but this is a movie about the real life
2,i do n't know how to describe this film but,i do n't understand the appeal for this movie
2,it 's just a bunch of kids who have no talent,it has the best of all the great actors and actresses
2,hmmm this is the most boring film i 've watched,hmmm the movie does n't have a good cast
2,this was the best movie of the 90 's that i had seen,this movie is so awful that the viewer will laugh at every joke and
2,regardless of this film 's plot is a bit too long,regardless the movie is a little too slow and slow for the
2,and the acting is n't bad at all but the story,and the acting in the movie is just plain bad
2,the film has some of the funniest lines i,the film has a lot of good points
2,the film was shot in a very small budget and it was shot in a small location,the story is simple and it 's a bit of an adventure to the point of the story
2,the acting was horrible the directing awful,the story is a complete mess
2,a lot of people have commented on the film,a lot of things are happening in the movie
2,after all this was a great show for me,after seeing the movie i thought the movie is very
2,the acting was terrible the directing is poor the directing is worse than anything i 've,the story was very weak but it was a good movie and it was fun
2,you have a very good movie that will be,you know what to do with the story
2,one of the best films of its kind that has,one of the best movies of the last decade
2,as for the film itself it has a very very very very very bad soundtrack but that is,as a result of a few films the movie has no sense of reality or purpose whatsoever
2,katt is a great actor who plays a very good,katt is one of the worst movies of all
2,always there is an interesting story and the characters,always the worst movie i 've ever watched
2,the story of the kelly brothers is a classic and it 's easy for me to,the film is about a young man trying to find out who his father is
2,the film has a very strong plot and a good cast,the acting was n't bad but the plot was n't really bad
2,if i was a kid i would n't have been a little more surprised by the film and,if you 're looking for something that 's not bad enough you 'll be bored and bored
2,nearly everything about it makes me want to watch this film for,nearly all of these are the same people in the movie
2,instead of being a little bit of an old man it is,instead it has a very weak plot and an interesting premise
2,a lot of the movie is a bit too long,a few years after this one was released i saw it
2,i think that the movie is a little bit too short but i found it very enjoyable,i think that the best of the movie was that the film was n't as much a comedy
2,so what if the film is n't bad it is n't that,so the film was a complete failure of the first movie
2,i think it 's not a good film,i have n't read the manga but it is
2,what is the deal of the relationship,what 's the point in this movie
2,it is n't a good idea for a movie,it 's not a bad movie but the acting and
2,seeking to avenge it for a long time,seeking to get out the door and get rid
2,but the film does a great disservice of making it,but the film has the best of the three
2,ratings to a few of those who are willing to,ratings 1 the movie itself is not very bad
2,unfortunately the story line and acting is very poor,unfortunately the film is a complete waste of film
2,the film was shot in black and the film 's color,the story line was good and the acting was good
2,gosh i was n't expecting a good film,gosh the story was a little weak
2,it 's the story of a man trying to find out who his friends are,it is not a film that is not for everyone but a good movie
2,a lot of the film is shot in,a few of the characters are good
2,edna has a great deal of time,edna 's character is so unlikable
2,something like the original the exorcist and the grudge,something about a man who is a little more than
2,the film is very well done,the film was shot in color and
2,to make this a good movie it 's not a good film,to make matters even less ridiculous the film 's plot becomes a convoluted
2,so if the movie is really really bad it 's the only way i could have done it better,so i have to say that this is a very good film and i think i 've enjoyed it
2,this' is a film of a movie that does n't seem to be a real movie it 's a movie about an evil and unfriendly man who is,this' is the most important aspect in this movie and the acting is excellent as the story is set in motion and the characters are all over
2,yes i have n't laughed so many times but it was just that bad,yes it 's a bit slow and the acting is n't bad either
2,not only does it have the most memorable scene ever filmed in the film but also the film is a complete mess,not only is the acting bad but the actors are n't really bad and it makes the movie unwatchable even more
2,this is a film that is n't even worth watching as,this is a very bad movie and a complete mess
2,of this type the film has a very good cast,of the few movies of the same genre i have n't
2,outside of the fact that it 's a great movie it does,outside a film with the same title a woman is killed
2,we 're supposed for the same guy who 's the hero and his wife who is also a reporter,we 're told that the story is not a good one but the movie has its own unique moments
2,the movie is a very funny movie and a lot of people have to watch,the film was shot with no imagination and was a bit of a stretch
2,another problem is that the movie is n't a comedy,another thing that is so bad was how much the acting
2,last and then i saw the movie and it,last but still not that it was n't
2,the movie is very well done,the story is very simple but it
2,i'm not sure if i was watching a movie but the acting is pretty awful the,i'm not sure why the film is a bit of an insult to the book
2,ca only have a good story but it is still,ca only have the same name as the first
2,this movie is a great movie,this movie is a great film for
2,lucas is the most interesting and intelligent character in the film and it is his performance that makes it so believable,lucas 's character in this movie was a bit of an idiot who has no idea of what happened and who he
2,he is a very funny actor but i do n't think he has done a decent performance as a villain who is not a bad actor but,he is the only person who can make it through this movie that has a few lines and a few lines but the film is not
2,considering that the story of a woman in love with a married lady who was,considering the fact that it was made for television it would have been better
2,i was so bored by the movie,i do not recommend watching the movie
2,first off the movie was not very good and i was expecting something better to watch,first off i was n't a fan like me but it is n't that good
2,patricia arquette plays the young woman who 's been kidnapped,patricia clarkson is a delight in her performance but she does
2,the film is a complete mess of a show,the film is about a young man who has his
2,don cheadle was a very talented director and the cast is great,don knotts plays the role of a very wealthy and humble man
2,in the first part of a series of events he 's a young,in this case he is the most beautiful woman of her generation
2,i'm not sure if it would end up as a comedy but if the director had a serious sense for,i'm not a fan of the original but i have a feeling that this movie has no redeeming qualities
2,this film was made by the esteemed director 's first movie and is,this is the kind that the film has a very low budget
2,the story of this movie is a complete mess with a capital of a plot and a plot that 's not even,the story was so weak that it could n't even be described as an insult to the viewer to the audience
2,this film was made for the sake that this is,this was the best movie i have ever seen
2,it 's not the most original film but it does have a good deal of humour in,it 's a shame that the director of this film never got a theatrical dvd release
2,when the film was shot in color i found myself wishing that the director could have made a better movie,when i first read the comments on the imdb page for this movie i thought i had to read some reviews
2,however the film is very entertaining and the,however the movie is not a comedy
2,if the movie had had a decent story line and a few actors who could 've played a straight part,if you want to see a film that will leave you with the feeling you should watch this movie
2,i do think the movie is a bit too long and i think that 's why,i do think it was one that was n't even close in any other way
2,a lot of the scenes in the movie are very well done,a few of them are not so good they 're all so funny
2,after seeing this i can tell you that it has a very,after the movie i thought it was a pretty cool movie
2,as a result the film has a lot to do to make the viewer feel,as the story unfolds we are left with an almost unrecognizable feeling of emptiness
2,another thing that bothered the film was the acting and,another problem was the ending and ending the story
2,did anyone know how the director was going,did anyone ever want the money back
2,but it 's not a good movie and,but this movie is just plain awful
2,bunuel is a genius and he does not disappoint,bunuel has created some of his best films and he
2,i do not think that this film is the best in terms for the fact it has,i have to wonder how the director could have been so much better with this movie
2,hazel 's performance is so bad she makes it difficult to believe she is a good actress and she is,hazel clayburgh was great in the role of a lifetime woman and she 's not just a bad actress
2,perhaps the best of them is the fact,perhaps this is the best film ever
2,maybe he 's a little more forgiving,maybe the director was a genius
2,this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and the only thing that is worth seeing is the performance of,this film has no redeeming qualities at any time and it 's not the best of the bunch
2,this film is a must for anyone interested on the subject matter,this was the first movie i saw i would like to watch
2,a very good movie that is n't really worth watching and is a mustsee for fans,a lot of it is the first time that we see a movie about the life of
2,an example that the filmmakers could be in the film industry,an interesting premise to be found in a film about the holocaust
2,i do n't know why i have never,i think this is a great movie
2,as a result the film was very much a bit slow and the acting by the whole was horrible,as for it 's release i was n't sure what was going to be a bit of a spoiler but
2,unless it 's a good idea to make a film that does a good job with it,unless you 're a diehard collector of the original and have a great time with the film i
2,immediately he is a man who has no problems in his own life,immediately the film is a little over a long time and the end is
2,there was a lot of action and some of the action scenes were good,there are a number of other films that are so bad it is funny and
2,by all accounts the story was a bit weak and the acting and the plot was terrible,by the time the movie reaches its conclusion the movie is a bit of a letdown to begin
2,although i do agree with the other reviewer who said it was a bit of the fun to,although i do n't know what to do with this movie it is n't that bad either
2,he has to go through the whole,he is a very talented actor
2,i was expecting the movie that i would have seen the,i do n't know why this movie is n't available
2,now the film is not about how a man can get to the bottom of the world that he is a loner,now i have a fondness on the film and its a good movie to watch but i do n't think i have ever
2,the acting was terrible the directing was worse and the directing,the movie starts out very good but it 's not
2,to be fair the movie was a complete failure and i was surprised that this is a,to be honest i was not impressed by the story and the characters were n't believable
2,it is n't a good movie to begin with,it is a shame to hear a song in the
2,this is one of my favorite tv shows,this movie has a very good story and a
2,i do n't know how this movie got released theatrically,i think that this is the only movie that i could
2,the story was n't bad and the,the movie was shot in black
2,we are shown a little too much of what,we have the first film in the series
2,but i have no idea what this film is,but i think the film was a bit too long
2,the acting was horrible the script was horrible and the plot just,the movie was n't a complete waste for the whole family
2,the acting is horrible the directing is poor,the film is not a documentary of a book
2,so what 's it all all about,so what do i know that 's the
2,but the story of this movie has some very nice twists and the ending,but it 's a shame because this movie has a lot going for it and
2,this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever,this was the first film to make me
2,i do n't think that it 's a bad movie,i have never seen a worse film in the entire film
2,this movie does n't have a lot going for it it is just a bad movie,this is a great film for those of a certain type to be a good movie and
2,now i know i 've seen a few movies in,now i am not a fan of this movie
2,from the beginning the movie has a lot going from start till the very last minute of the,from the opening shot of the movie the film is a complete waste of time to watch
2,catch up on your own and watch it with your kids,catch a glimpse and enjoy a great deal of time
2,in a way it 's just a bit of fun to see,in fact i think that the film was shot in a very tight
2,this is a film that is a little too long for the viewer,this movie does not even have a plot to make a good film and
2,i was so disappointed with it,i do n't think that the director
2,i think it is a good movie,i have n't seen the first movie but
2,i do n't know how this film got made but it was n't,i have n't seen the first movie but the first movie is pretty good
2,i think that 's what i thought was that the director had to do a lot of,i do n't know how it got going but i guess it 's just a movie
2,the acting in the film is superb,the film 's premise is a bit of
2,even though it 's not a comedy there are a few chuckles,even the actors are not the best actors in this movie
2,he is a very talented man and he is a good person who is not afraid of a man,he is a man of sorts and he has been in love with a woman who 's not a good
2,the movie was made up for the rest of it and that 's why it 's so bad it makes the,the film is about two men who live in the same house and have a different relationship with each other
2,the film is a complete mess of the first,the movie was shot with the handheld cam
2,or maybe it 's because of the lack of a decent plot and a few good actors,or the fact that it was made on a shoestring budget was the inspiration for this film and
2,the movie is not about the characters,the movie is about the man who was
2,a good example of how to make one,a few scenes are very good but they 're
2,i was surprised to discover that a movie like this could have made me want to be,i do n't know what to think of the movie is that it is a comedy
2,well the story line is very interesting the,well the film has an interesting premise
2,the story is about the love of,the film is a complete mess
2,there is also a scene with the young girl who has a crush on the young man and her lover,there is a lot to like about this show but it is still a very funny movie and it 's fun
2,as a result of his past he is the embodiment of his life as he is the dominant figure of the,as i watched this film the first time it was shown on television and it 's a very interesting thing
2,this film is a must have to see,this film is a very good example
2,scalise is a man in the middle of a,scalise 's father is a very nice guy
2,it has a lot to say about a group that is not a big fan,it is not a movie that is so much of a cult classic it is an
2,i have n't seen this movie in years and still i am glad it was made,i think the reason for this is that the film is a complete waste of time
2,since i have n't seen it yet and have been able to locate the film for the first half of a week i,since this is a movie i do have to say that it has the best actors and the best actors of all
2,assume the movie was a complete failure to watch and i was bored by the story and the characters,assume that it is n't a movie for the masses it is a very good and very entertaining film that
2,a very enjoyable movie with a great,a good movie to be seen
2,i do n't understand why this movie has so much promotion and it 's been released theatrically,i have never seen the original but i 've seen this movie twice in its entirety
2,either the acting is bad or just the,either way it was n't that good
2,a few minutes into his career and his performance i was surprised at the fact that,a few scenes are very good but the rest just did n't work at all
2,the acting is horrible and the script is,the acting and the script are horrible
2,christopher lloyd is great as a man and the movie has an endearing,christopher walken is excellent as a man and a very funny guy
2,the acting was good but the story was weak,the story is simple but not very interesting
2,this is a very good movie,this was the worst movie i have
2,for the rest the film has no real purpose or purpose whatsoever,for those who have never read a biography of the original novel and
2,i have never been so impressed by it as the first movie,i think this is a very good film but it 's just not
2,problem is the script was so bad it was almost laughable and the acting is just horrible,problem with the movie is that it 's so bad it 's funny and the actors are all
2,in fact the whole movie was so poorly acted and poorly acted i could n't,in a nutshell it was a great movie for those who like the original
2,the movie was made in a very short period of time,the film has some good acting in the supporting role of david
2,even though the film is a bit slow it does have a few interesting things to say about the movie it,even if you have a yen for the original and do n't know what to think and enjoy this show
2,none the more he 's a very good actor,none of the cast is good and the script is
2,and it 's all so bad that it 's funny it 's just not bad,and the ending is so bad that you wonder if the writer was going to be
2,whereas the movie is a complete mess it 's a shame that the movie is still not a complete failure,whereas this is not a movie i think it 's a great film and a great example to the genre
2,being that the movie is about a group of young people who have to deal and live in new jersey and have their own problems,being the first to be a classic film in the uk and a new one i have been waiting for it to come across as a
2,john cusak was a very good director,john wayne is the most beautiful character ever
2,it 's not a movie that you should watch but you 'll be,it 's a pity that the film has a few more laughs
2,i do n't think i 've ever laughed so much throughout my life,i have seen this film and have seen many many other movies
2,there 's a bit to the movie but it 's not a bad movie it,there was no need for the characters and the characters were just too stupid
2,i do agree that this movie was a total disappointment to sit,i was expecting something better from a film like this one
2,this is a movie about a young woman named seita,this was a very good and funny movie with the usual
2,instead we get the usual and annoying ending that i found annoying,instead of the typical hollywood clichs they have a lot more money than
2,what i did like is how they are in a different place and they 're trying hard to be different and different from their own life,what i liked about it for the most is that it was a bit of a bore but that was the only reason i gave it the
2,the film is a complete mess,the story is a simple mess
2,this film does not have a lot going it is so bad it 's almost laughable it has,this is a great movie for everyone who wants the story to get to the bottom line
2,ok i have seen a few movies but the film is a complete mess,ok i have n't heard of this show since i saw it on cable
2,recap a lot more than that the film has a very,recap the first one is a bit slow and boring
2,the movie is a little slow but,the film has some good acting
2,we get the feeling that we 've never seen the film but you have to see that it 's a great deal,we get to the point when we get to the end of this movie which makes the movie more interesting than the first
2,it 's the kind of movie that,it 's a very good story
2,one thing that is missing is the fact it was made by a man with an iq and a few of the scenes in it,one thing i noticed about it was that the story was so weak and the acting was so bad that it could have done much better
2,i was n't impressed with this film,i think it is a good movie to
2,mattei has a very good sense of humor,mattei 's the film is a classic
2,the acting was horrible the script awful,the film is not about an evil family
2,the film is a complete failure and the only thing that makes the film watchable are the performances of the actors,the movie is about a group of young people trying to get married and have a very difficult relationship to the life
2,yet another thing that is so bad is why this movie was released theatrically and,yet the film has a very strong and interesting look at it 's own
2,the film is about two people who have been killed and killed,the story of the movie is about a man named benjamin
2,but the real reason why it has a good,but the story is a little too long
2,the film 's main character has to rely upon the fact that it is a complete waste,the film is a little bit of the same for the whole series but the film has an
2,i think the film was a bit too much,i think that 's why i liked it
2,it was a very funny film but i found it to be a bit slow,it 's not even that good and i ca all agree with those who are n't
2,a very enjoyable film and a great movie to view with friends of mine,a few scenes of dialogue and dialogue were n't enough to save this film
2,left to go to the next scene,left behind this film is the same
2,i was so bored by this movie that it 's a wonder,i do n't think i have any qualms of the plot
2,spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead the ending of a twist ending was n't really explained but it,spoilers the plot of a man who is a young woman is a very interesting character
2,apparently this movie was n't meant to be,apparently the film has no real purpose
2,this is the first movie that i have watched that 's as bad a bad movie in my collection as i was watching this movie,this was a great show that i was able to watch over and over because i was so excited when i saw the movie and i
2,and the acting is pretty poor and the plot was just,and that 's the only reason to watch this film
2,we 're told that he will never be able to get away from,we get an idea of what the movie 's plot is like
2,so i was n't expecting a good movie,so the movie has its own problems
2,she is a very good character and she 's very likable,she 's a great actor but the movie does have a few
2,it 's a very good film,it is not even worth the time
2,or even if you are a huge john lennon fans,or maybe it 's a good idea that a movie can
2,the film was a bit long for me,the film 's premise is to be commended
2,both the film and movie memento are the best,both of these films are not very successful
2,but the real problem with this film the most important is its predictability of,but the film is not so much that i ca n't believe it
2,not to mention a few scenes in which,not to be missed by the end
2,helen is not as bad as the other actors in this movie,helen hunt is a very talented character and is a very talented actress
2,everyone is just as bad and the bad things get worse,everyone in the movie was a caricature of the film
2,i do agree but i have to admit that i have,i do n't think this movie is a good thing
2,the film has some good points but that,the movie was a waste of time
2,this movie does have the same problems,this is not the best film of the
2,the story of the film is very similar,the film 's main character 's motivations are not
2,pick up your local library with a beer,pick up this movie and then get a copy
2,and it is the worst movie i,and it was n't that good
2,she is a great actress and a good one,she was n't in this flick but she did a
2,all of the characters were believable the story is simple,all the other actors are all excellent and the story is
2,it 's a great show for kids,it was so funny to hear that they
2,we 're told the story of two brothers who were born in the same year and are still living together in the,we 're supposed to sympathize and sympathize with a bunch that is n't a good thing but that 's not enough
2,a very good story and some great actors,a good movie for the entire cast
2,they are both a good idea and a good combination but the film does not make any sense and the characters are just plain awful and the characters seem underdeveloped,they 're just plain bad and i think that 's why i hate this movie so i did n't see it in the theater but the first half was very good
2,the film is about the same thing,the film is very well done
2,who cares what happened in real life,who would think the film 's title character
2,there 's a scene where the killer is shot and then the scene is cut,there is a scene where she is talking about her mother and she says it all
2,the acting was horrible and i was surprised to see that the movie had been produced by a group,the film is about a young boy who is sent in prison for a life of his own
2,to say this is the worst film ever to do so is beyond ridiculous,to make a long movie about the real mccoy the film is a total failure
2,i do think the movie was a bit too slow and i,i do agree but the movie has a very good plot
2,the movie was a complete failure,the acting is very poor and there
2,this is the first of three films that i have ever had the pleasure,this movie was not a good idea for a movie to be made
2,rather than the usual suspects of a young man the film settles through the screen as if it 's the best film of its kind,rather it is the fact that the director and his wife have a different understanding of what it is like to make it through the film
2,in this case it seems like it is a spoof and it is,in the end it 's not a movie to make a movie
2,some of the acting in this movie is so good that i have to say that this movie had a very bad script but the actors are so bad,some people are so stupid that you ca only have a movie that is so bad that you do n't care if the movie has any redeeming value
2,i do n't want to give anything more away but i have n't seen this movie since the late 80 another,i have n't seen the original series but i do recall that it 's a bit different from what the original version
2,i was n't sure whether the movie is supposed as a serious comedy or a drama,i have n't seen a more recent version and this is the one that made this so
2,the movie is not about the evils of the people of,the story of the movie is a lot of fun
2,she 's a great actress and she does n't seem to be acting,she was so cute to me that it 's hard to believe that she
2,it 's the story of a young man trying his luck with the help from,it 's just a shame to have a movie that is n't worth renting
2,this is a great example of a movie with no redeeming features,this film is a very bad attempt at a slasher movie
2,christopher plummer 's performance as a man who gets the girl in a bar and a man who 's been trying to get to his home,christopher plummer is a fine choice to play a woman who has a very good role but is a little too old to play a character who
2,the story is a bit confusing and it is n't,the story is about two young adults who go to the
2,we have a very strong story about the struggles and feelings of the people who have been affected and jailed for,we 're supposed the crux of the story but we are told that we are in for some good reason
2,basically the story line is very good,basically it is the same thing
2,kal ho naa is a wonderful movie that is a perfect example to anyone with a heart for the genre,kal penn is a great actor and he plays a character who does n't seem to have any range of emotions
2,this is a movie i would watch again and i have,this is a movie about a woman and her mother
2,too bad that this movie was made in the first place so it 's not even,too bad they do n't get to show the real story in the first half
2,there are a few things that do not really make sense,there are a number in which a character played with a depth
2,the movie was shot in the same location as the first movie,the film has some of the most memorable sequences ever captured on film
2,i was surprised that the film is not available on dvd and the dvd is a waste,i think this movie is very good and i would like to know what the hell was going
2,heck the movie was shot with the camera lens of,heck i have a soft side of this film
2,at first i thought that the movie would get a lot better,at least i would n't have had a refund for this
2,i think this movie should be shown in a more serious,i think this is the best part of a movie
2,the acting is very good and the,the movie is a complete mess
2,also the ending was so predictable,also the ending is so ridiculous and
2,to me this film is a must watch for all fans and for,to be fair i have seen the movie and have to agree
2,also i thought that was the only good,also a few moments are very interesting
2,i think the director was trying to get the audience to think about the,i think that it is not a bad movie and it 's not
2,in the meantime it has a good plot and a great cast,in this case it is a film about two people living with their
2,he 's not a bad guy but,he 's a very talented director
2,no wonder he is n't the only one,no matter how bad a person who is supposed
2,it is n't a good movie,it is a shame that the director
2,also the scene where a man with the head arm was a,also the film is a complete waste of time and time
2,another reason is that the movie is a bit slow at best as it is,another example is that this movie is not a comedy or an action movie
2,and it is a shame that the movie,and i was n't impressed by this
2,while the film was shot in a small budget it 's a very poor film and not very good,while this is a good thing i think that the movie would have been more interesting had the director been
2,however i do think that the movie was a bit too much of a stretch,however i do have the feeling it was the intention that this film is so utterly
2,because it is a great show for kids and parents,because the movie was a little too long for its own
2,it 's not the worst movie ever,it is a very funny film
2,there was no need to be made to have the slightest impact on me,there are some very nice moments in the movie but it is n't
2,i was so impressed that it was so bad and i had no idea of the real world 's history,i have n't seen a movie in my life so much as i have seen a lot more of these films
2,poor acting poor script and poor editing and editing is just plain awful and the,poor script and direction of the film and the actors are all very amateurish
2,some of the acting is bad the acting is awful but the story,some have commented the fact i have n't heard about this film
2,what i got was a movie with an,what is this supposed for a film
2,there are some very funny scenes in,there 's no plot no action
2,the movie is not about people and their lives,the movie is a bit slow but it does have
2,overall the movie was good but the acting and script was terrible,overall i would say that this is a very bad film
2,amants the most beautiful is the fact,amants a mano is the best
2,but it does n't matter that it is n't a good movie but,but this movie has no redeeming features at least it 's not
2,sure the movie is a little dated and it,sure this is the worst of this movie
2,one thing that makes this film so special was that it did not get a theatrical release,one of his most underrated movies was the one where it was filmed in the first film
2,this is not a bad movie,this is a movie about how the
2,attenborough 's direction was a bit too dark for the audiences but i think that the director should have had a bigger part,attenborough 's direction was so bad that he had been reduced by the director 's vision to the story and his work
2,the film is a complete bore and it is the only one that i 've ever seen in a movie theater,the acting in the other actors was good the story was ok but i was surprised at the end and it was
2,to be a big star i was not disappointed,to me this is a very funny film
2,your average viewer is a good movie,your average viewer is a little confused and
2,big fat greek is a good movie and it is n't the worst movie i ever,big brother is a good guy and a good actor who can do the best
2,instead the viewer is subjected by the characters to develop them,instead of being a little bit more than the sum we see
2,sunny puta has been a very good film,sunny is the most beautiful woman i 've ever
2,this is a film that is a complete mess,this film is a must see film for all ages
2,same thing for a few seconds,same as this one is the first
2,tunes are n't as good and are n't the best,tunes are used as if they were written on the wind
2,unfortunately this is not what i would do,unfortunately the movie does not have a lot of
2,i was expecting a movie with a good story line to work with,i have to say i have seen a few movies with a similar sense
2,this is not a movie that will appeal but it is,this movie is so awful i ca n't believe it
2,yet the movie is a very interesting and interesting experience of a,yet it 's not the most important movie of all times
2,granted it is a little dated but that 's all there are,granted there is some good acting but there is no real story
2,the acting and directing are horrible,the story is very interesting and it
2,half a century after the movie is over the last scene has been a long long haired,half the time you get to know what 's going to be done in the end
2,until the last few minutes the film is n't really worth the effort to sit down to,until the final showdown scene we see the two of them go on a road trip
2,no one is a good actor,no it 's not a good movie
2,the story of an american girl who has been a child,the film is very well done but it is not
2,all i could think was that this movie is a total waste,all the characters are likable and the plot line has a lot of
2,anyway i do n't understand how this film could ever be released theatrically,anyway i think the film is very good but i think it is very
2,the acting was terrible the directing horrible,the film has an excellent soundtrack and a
2,this is a film that is not,this movie is a must see
2,although the movie was not as good as the first movie and it was n't the best,although the movie is a bit dated it has some nice twists to it and some nice scenery
2,also the scene in which she is supposed and she has the same facial expressions and the way she is treated,also i think that the director and his wife should not have to have the same problem with the story
2,i'm sure that the film is not as bad as the first but it 's,i'm a fan of this movie and have never heard of the film before
2,all of them were a bunch,all the actors were good but the
2,i was expecting a movie about a group of people and,i think that 's the best part of the movie
2,the film is about the same subject as the first one,the film 's story was a little weak at the start and
2,i think it 's a great movie to view it to see if it 's a good one and it,i have never heard a movie before but i do not understand why this film did so many things
2,from the opening shot the film looks like a cheap video game with the camera and lighting,from the first scene of the movie and how the film ends the film abruptly builds up the
2,until the very last scene in which the hero tries his,until this film is about to go to the cinema
2,two years later he 's in a coma and he has to be a man who 's a man who has a gift,two of the most memorable moments were the first time when a man and his son were sitting in a chair and the camera
2,eddie murphy plays the part with a,eddie murphy was a great choice
2,if you 're a diehard horror fan this is definitely the movie for you but it is definitely worth checking,if you 're looking for a good movie with an excellent story and great actors you will love this movie and
2,mckenna 's character is the same,mckenna is the most beautiful character in
2,the movie is a little slow but that 's not the only reason to see,the movie is a bit slow but it 's a great film to see if not
2,i think this is one that i would recommend watching it for the first half of the movie,i was surprised that this was a film that was made to cash in on a career
2,the movie is very slow moving and it 's hard not to like it,the story is a simple mess and a few of the actors are very good
2,our hero is a man who has been living in the past with his family,our hero is a hero who is sent into a prison and is forced
2,what is more interesting is that the film is set in england,what i found interesting was how the movie ended with such poor acting
2,as a result of the film it is a,as a movie this is a good film
2,wow i do n't care if this is,wow i have n't seen this movie
2,obviously this movie is not for everyone and that 's why they should,obviously this was the case with a few people in the movie
2,not only did he not have the money to make it,not to mention the fact it has no redeeming qualities
2,but the real star was the performance of the director and the director,but the film is so bad that i ca n't even begin watching it
2,it was a very funny movie and it 's a shame to see such a talented performer,it has a good cast including a few of the supporting cast including a young seth green as
2,his character in the movie is a real,his performance is a joy to watch
2,it was the first movie i saw in the last 15 minutes,it is not a movie about how the people who made this movie
2,but the real reason why the film was,but it is a very good film
2,i do think that this movie was a complete disaster,i do n't know why but i have to agree with
2,immediately the story is told in flashbacks and the,immediately he 's a little suspicious of himself
2,the acting was n't bad but not bad,the movie is a bit too slow for the
2,this is not the case in the film,this movie has no redeeming qualities at all
2,if you are a diehard collector of hers i 'd recommend this,if you have a masochistic fascination with it you should definitely see it
2,swept away from the movie by the director and writer of the film it seems to have a lot to do with its,swept away from a mental breakdown in the first film the story of the film was very interesting but it was not
2,so what do i know i do not,so if the director is a real person he
2,like a lot more than a few seconds of the movie it was n't that great,like the other reviewers here mentioned this is a great movie and a great one
2,i think that the best part in it all,i was n't sure what was going on
2,when i watched this show it had to be one thing to say,when the film finally ended the story of the film 's success
2,whatever the case it is the fact that the film,whatever the case i would recommend it to anyone
2,columbo is a man of the cloth and a woman in the process,columbo 's character does have the same effect and the same character
2,it 's a very good story,it 's a very funny movie and
2,just as the first one has the exact opposite of being a,just like the rest i was surprised to see the movie
2,john goodman is a very talented director who,john goodman 's character was very funny
2,you have to see it for its own stunts and the fact that the movie has a lot,you have to watch it to believe it or not it was a waste of my time
2,for a film of such a great book it 's a shame,for those who do watch it i would have given it an 85
2,the acting is horrible the plot was awful even the actors were,the acting and directing is superb and the acting is great
2,i have n't read a book so i ca all be this one to be honest,i do n't know how it 's possible to get a good laugh when the actors do
2,in this case he has a good time,in a way it 's a bit more than
2,i have never been so disgusted with such a film,i was surprised to see that the film is not only
2,i have never seen the original so much,i was surprised to learn that this movie is
2,the movie is very well made,the acting was terrible the directing was
2,this is one of the best movies i,this film does have some redeeming quality
2,i do n't want my money to be spent on the dvd,i was expecting the worst of this movie to be made in my
2,the story is very interesting the characters,the film is a complete mess
2,overall i give a 10 out of 10 for this movie,overall this was an excellent film and i recommend it to anyone
2,i'm not saying the same thing but i have to say it,i'm a huge fan of movies but this is the worst
2,however the plot of the film was n't that great,however it 's not a good film it 's very very
2,the film 's main weakness is that it is not the first film,the acting was good enough but the script by a different director
2,it 's a very good story,it was the first movie that i
2,i have never heard a movie where it has such a great cast,i was so excited to find this one on tv in my library
2,but i do n't think that this is a good movie,but the movie is not so good as it was made for
2,i was surprised that i did n't get it,i was so excited about the film and i was
2,it 's the story of the same name of the famous american family,it was a waste and i was n't sure whether it was a comedy
2,jack lemmon 's role as his wife is,jack frost 2 has a great soundtrack
2,i have to wonder why i have not read any of the reviews,i do n't think i have seen a lot more than this
2,i have n't read any comments about,i was expecting something like this
2,complimentary is a very funny movie,complimentary is a very funny movie that
2,i think this movie is a masterpiece of art and i am not sure whether i,i have never seen the original series but it is still a very enjoyable show
2,however the story was very good the actors did their usual excellent job and the script made me want to go to,however the story of a woman 's life and her life as a child is very different than the film itself
2,all in this movie 's worth watching,all the other actors are excellent
2,kutcher and his friends are both in the film and they are in,kutcher was a very good actor and he is a great actress
2,i do n't understand why the movie has so many positive reviews,i have never seen any film that has been made as much as
2,i do agree that the film is very good,i was expecting a movie to be done with some
2,while it is a bit slow at times it is still very enjoyable,while i was n't impressed by this one the film seemed very very very
2,imagine this film is not for everyone but for those,imagine the film 's success in its own right
2,these are not the best of the films that have been done in the past,these were the two best known films i have seen in a long long and long
2,and the ending was so predictable,and the acting was good and the
2,she was a little over the top and she was n't really the same actress,she is the only one to have her name in this flick and i hope she
2,this movie was a waste for the first time i,this was one to see in the first film
2,but the story line is so ridiculous,but this is not the movie for you
2,yet the movie was not as good as the first,yet the film 's main flaw of it was the fact
2,her character is a bit dim,her acting skills have been so bad
2,and it 's the best thing about,and the acting is so bad
2,by the end of the movie i was really looking forward into a movie that i could have been a little,by the end of this show i could n't believe the movie was n't even made in the slightest time
2,the story is simple and it is n't a bad thing,the movie is a very good film and it has a very
2,this is the worst movie i ever watched,this is a great movie and i hope it
2,the film has a lot to recommend it but it was n't a good movie,the movie is about the struggle of a man who is trying his hand at the
2,it is the best film i 've watched this,it 's a great film to be sure
2,how many people do you have a chance to be able to see this movie,how can a woman like the one that is the only thing that can happen in
2,as for this film i have no idea what the point is and how many people are commenting,as a matter of fact the film is a bit of a bore but i found it very entertaining
2,the story is simple and it is n't that bad but i do n't think that 's what this movie is,the acting and the script were terrible but the movie was n't really good enough to give it an 8 out 10
2,why did they have to make it a film,why is it so stupid that this is a very
2,pg13 rated movies are a 410 because the plot,pg13 rating pg13 for violence and language language
2,all in one movie that is so good,all the actors and crew were good
2,the acting in all of his films is superb,the story line of a man who is in the
2,this movie is so bad it 's bad,this was an interesting movie to see in the
2,my friend is a fan of the tv series and this episode shows that the series is still a great episode of columbo 's play,my friend was in the theater and i saw this movie on video and i have n't seen a movie so many years after seeing it
2,writers have a certain amount to spare,writers of the movie are the ones who
2,and i do n't care if the director 's intention is to,and the film does n't even have the feel to it
2,the movie is a complete mess,the film was shot with a handheld
2,it has been done before in many,it is a very interesting film
2,the story line was very good and the characters and relationships were so realistic,the film is a little slow and boring at the end but it really makes
2,once the movie begins you realize you are watching a movie that you can barely,once again i think this movie was just a waste for the first half
2,i have seen it many years and it still has a great deal of humor in my face and i love it so well that,i do not recommend this movie for all the kids who have n't seen the movie but it 's a great movie for adults
2,even when they 're trying to make a movie out of the story it is not even a good one,even when the story was n't a little farfetched the movie was just plain boring to me and that 's not
2,one thing that i liked about this film was the fact i was watching it,one of the best movies i 've ever watched and the best thing about that film
2,what i did see is a film,what is more interesting about it
2,most of the time the film is set in a small town where people live and,most of these people are so bad i do not know what to think of
2,the story line was a joke,the acting was n't too bad but
2,this movie is not a comedy it is n't even a comedy,this movie was a complete waste of money and i would rather spend
2,at first i thought that this would be an interesting movie,at least it 's not the best movie ever made
2,but the movie has some good performances,but the film is a very good movie
2,actually i think the movie is a bit too long,actually the acting was pretty good and the acting is very
2,do yourself a favour and avoid it,do yourself the same ol and worn up
2,i'm a fan of movies and tv shows but,i'm not saying this is a great film
2,they 're the best actors in the world,they are both the same and that is the
2,raiden and his wife are all very good,raiden is the best character in the film and
2,censorship is the only one who has a sense for this movie,censorship is not the case here but it 's still very entertaining and
2,the movie was shot on video,the film has a great cast and
2,but the movie is so much of the same,but it 's not a bad thing it 's just
2,he 's not a good actor but his character was so bad,he is a very funny character and he does not disappoint
2,i was n't sure if the movie was going to end but i was n't expecting a good movie to be made i was disappointed with it because i was,i think it is one of the best movies ever made and i have seen it twice in the past 20 years and it is one of my favorites
2,nick is the only one who is,nick nolte plays the lead character
2,i have never been a big fan of hers and it has been done in a very long time but it was not a good movie,i was n't impressed at the time and the story was very weak and i was n't really sure if it was going to be a comedy
2,on this note the movie was a little too much of the,on a technical scale the film looks like an amateur film
2,you have the recipe of a good actor who 's just plain bad in the role,you have to see it for its own sake of the story of the characters
2,nothing about it was a bit interesting and,nothing really happens to be the same
2,the acting and direction are so bad it is laughable to watch and the actors do a pretty good imitation of the film 's script which was n't,the acting is good and i think the movie is very entertaining and very funny and i think it 's a good thing to watch this film
2,yet the film has a few faults and a few moments of unintentional comedy are,yet i still ca n't believe that this is the best of the three
2,basically the movie was made in a hurry,basically this movie has no real story
2,yes i know that this movie is not the worst film ever but it 's still not bad,yes it is true the story has some holes in it but the story itself does n't seem very
2,trying hard but ultimately fails at being the best movie of,trying to be funny and funny is just a joke
2,on the whole it is a very good film,on top this was a pretty bad movie
2,her husband 's father and her son have been married to her father and his son,her character has a great performance as the mother of the young woman and the daughter
2,when i first heard that the movie was going to end and was a,when you see this film it is a very long and boring film
2,the film has some very good scenes,the film is a complete waste
2,later i saw the movie and i thought it was a very good movie,later on he finds out he has a brother and he is trying to save
2,fondness the movie and the film for its richness and its message,fondness for that is that this movie was made in canada
2,there was also some good gore,there 's no reason that the film
2,learn to act in the same manner as in the first film,learn a lesson and a woman 's life and her own life in
2,i have never heard of this movie and i was so bored that i was n't laughing,i think it 's a shame to hear that this is a film that is not even available
2,there was also a lot in this story that did n't make up a good story and a good cast,there are many things that are so stupid and pointless that i ca n't even describe the movie as a bad
2,with the title song and dancing in the movie you get an idea that,with the exception being a bit of a stretch the film does manage
2,from the very beginning of it i felt like i was watching a documentary,from there i found myself asking myself why i was in trouble with this one
2,the acting is very bad and it 's not a good,the film is a complete mess of the original movie
2,freeman and the rest of the gang are just as funny as,freeman and the rest of his gang are very well cast
2,i think that 's the reason why this movie is not for anyone,i think that it is one that i can watch for a few days
2,i was expecting something more like the movie to,i think this is a very bad movie
2,in fact i think the only good part was that there were so many funny parts of the movie that you would never have guessed,in the end the movie has a good cast and a nice pace and a good story line but i do n't recommend the movie as
2,this movie has a very funny story and,this is not one of those films
2,the film was shot in the seventies,the movie was a little slow
2,c'mon the movie is n't bad but it is n't bad,c'mon i know that the director is not going on but i
2,obviously it 's a film of a few people who are not in the same room as the ones in the movie,obviously the director of a lot better than this film is but it was n't the worst film i 've ever seen
2,jody 's character and the other two are so much better and the story is a little confusing but the movie,jody is a great character and she does not seem to be the only person who has to be one
2,the film has a great cast including the two leads,the story is about two people in love and a married
2,but this movie was so bad i was n't even sure if it would be,but it 's not a bad idea it 's not a movie to make
2,the acting was terrible but i thought it was a great film,the story of a young woman named anna 's daughter who has become
2,any movie that could have made a great deal better than this,any one with a brain will find it impossible and the film has
2,i do agree but it is the most important thing to come about,i think that the best way to go to the movie is to see
2,how could it be so bad if it was,how can you make such a good film
2,so what if you 're going to get a movie,so the movie was n't bad but it 's just a
2,i was expecting something more than a movie but i was n't expecting a lot more,i do not know why i have never been so annoyed by it as the last episode
2,i was so impressed by it i could not believe it,i do n't think that the actors are good enough for their
2,in the first half of the movie we learn that the killer 's daughter has a crush in his face but the rest is not as much as he is a man who is,in the end it is the most beautiful and haunting film i ever seen in the history of cinema and in my humble opinion it was a great film that is a joy
2,you can see that the director and his crew were,you can tell that it 's a real stinker
2,do not waste my precious time watching this film unless you have a masochistic fascination of what you 're going to be,do n't waste my time or time watching it unless i am just a fan of hers or i do n't want the
2,as for the story it 's very interesting but i think it 's a very good movie that is just a good movie to watch,as i said the only thing that kept me interested was that it was n't a comedy or an attempt to get a movie
2,the movie is about as funny as it is and it 's funny how it,the acting was good and the story line was great but it 's not
2,i was n't expecting a movie to get me started on,i have seen the movie several times in my life
2,has a very limited amount and a few scenes in this movie,has the movie makers been a little more creative in this film and
2,together the movie is a complete mess,together with the first one the film is
2,ravishing in a way that makes me feel that i was watching the movie with a little of her face but the film did,ravishing and very moving and the film is not a total success but i found myself wanting more than i could ever imagined
2,but i think that the film is a little,but the film is a little too long
2,whereas the plot is a little thin and the story is very predictable and predictable,whereas the plot has been done by many of its other characters it 's not a
2,evil is the worst movie i have,evil dead man was one hell
2,regardless the movie 's title was very misleading,regardless of the fact the director was n't able
2,this is the best movie of all,this movie is not even worth the money
2,i think it 's not worth the effort i,i was so bored when i saw it
2,it has a very good story,it was a waste and i would
2,otherwise i 'd like to say this film has the,otherwise it is n't worth the money it takes
2,in the first movie we are treated to a bunch of obnoxious characters,in the first film the main protagonist was in the first one
2,it 's a shame because it 's a,it 's just not a good film
2,also the scene with her mother 's mother is just plain bad,also i think that the actors are very good and i think they
2,some have commented the fact that it is a very low rating for all of the above mentioned movies,some of them are not as good or as bad as the ones in the movie which are pretty bad
2,if the movie does n't have a good story it is a good movie to watch and i would recommend it,if you are a fan of the genre and you like the original then this one is a mustsee to anyone interested
2,i was expecting a great movie to watch but i was wrong in the,i think this was a great show for me to be able into
2,i have n't seen it since the late 80 other than i was watching it,i was n't really expecting much of the plot and i was surprised that it did
2,it was a waste for a movie,it is n't a film that 's not
2,lucia is a young woman living in a small,lucia is the best thing about this movie
2,this movie has no redeeming qualities to it,this film is not a good movie but is
2,there are some great performances by the two,there are some great scenes in it
2,why does n't he have a clue,why do n't we have a movie that
2,when the movie is over and you have the chance,when you see the movie you will be amazed by the
2,if the movie is a bit slow at times i will say i was n't bored but i was n't expecting much from it,if you want a good film that will make you want you to laugh at this one you 'll be disappointed by this
2,this film has the best of the worst,this is the worst movie i 've ever had
2,it 's just a bunch of random things happen in a,it has a great cast and the acting was good
2,it 's a shame that this was,it is not a good movie
2,i have never heard a movie where i have a feeling,i was surprised to discover the movie was a success
2,we have to watch the movie to find,we 're told to watch the movie
2,the story line is a joke and the characters are n't developed in a way they,the acting and directing were excellent but the story and the script were very weak
2,through the movie i felt that the movie had a little bit more action,through the years i have been looking for something more to the show
2,in the first half of this movie the viewer feels like a,in the meantime he is a young woman and a womanizer
2,i do n't think that the director intended a good idea for a film to have to rely on it 's own,i was surprised that i had wasted my life with this one and that was the only way i could ever see it
2,even the most ardent of actors could have done the same,even though it 's not a bad movie it does provide a
2,firode has done a great story and i,firode has a good sense of style
2,maybe it 's the best way i 've ever seen it,maybe it was a little too long and it was n't that
2,did anyone know how to get the money,did i mention the fact that it is a
2,arthur 's performance is a very strong performance in this film and he is very good at playing an eccentric role but the rest of his character was not believable at the time of his life,arthur 's father is a bit of a jerk and the rest of his character seems to be a bit too unlikable to be believable in a movie where his acting is a bit stiff
2,i do not think this is the best film of the series,i think the director and director have done some research in this film
2,the film has a very good cast and a nice cast,the movie starts off ok but the acting is n't bad at
2,in fact the movie is very funny but it 's,in this movie it is a very simple movie
2,not to mention the fact it has the best actors of our time,not a bad film to watch but it 's still pretty good and worth
2,i do think the director should have done a better movie instead of a film that was so awful and so boring and so boring,i have to admit i am not a big fan but i was impressed to see that this movie is a waste of time to sit
2,he has a very good sense to be a good actor,he is the only one to be killed by a car accident
2,willem dafoe is a great choice as a villain and the rest was a great actor,willem defoe is a very talented director but this film is n't even worth seeing
2,in the end i was surprised at how bad this movie was,in fact it is n't the worst movie of the decade
2,now i do know that it was a movie that i would,now this is the first of its kind of a series
2,neither of the actors ever played a,neither of them is particularly convincing
2,rated pg stars and nominee for that,rated pg13 stars out 10 stars
2,the story was a little too thin but the story was so good and so funny,the movie starts off with a bunch and the usual action scene in the movie
2,and the ending was so bad that it was just a bad movie,and that does n't mean that it was a complete failure to watch
2,it 's a shame because the movie is a complete waste of my life and not even the,it is not a film about a man 's death or a man who is a woman
2,shortly after a few minutes of a movie i was,shortly thereafter the movie has a very interesting story
2,i think the reason i watched this film is to find the,i was surprised by this movie because it was so stupid
2,if you have n't seen this one you 'll find it,if you 're not a big floyd purist fan you 'll enjoy
2,this was a very good movie,this movie is one that you should
2,so if i were you i would have to have,so what i did not see was the story
2,well this movie was a waste of money,well this film was a bit of an attempt
2,some of the scenes are so stupid that you ca only make fun of the movie and you will be surprised to see the,some have commented that the movie is a bit too long but the story is very well written and the acting was excellent
2,the film is very well done,the movie has a lot of action
2,the movie is a little bit too long but there is n't much else in the,the story is very interesting but the acting is so bad it is n't funny
2,i think it 's one of his better efforts and,i think that this film has some redeeming value
2,of all of the other movies of this period,of course it was not a big budget
2,i have never read a book by this film but it,i was expecting this movie to be an epic film
2,rogers is one such an underrated director but he is not a very good director or even the,rogers 's acting in the film does n't seem to have any acting ability to work with
2,no one is going to have the slightest clue,no one could have pulled this movie off
2,samir 's character has been reduced by the police and his investigation is the result as a child,samir is not a great actor he is not only one of those movies he has a lot more
2,however this is not a film to be avoided,however this is a movie that should be seen as
2,i have to say this is my favorite movie of the last decade,i think the film has the best of its type of humor
2,finally the film is set to a very good climax and the ending is very abrupt,finally i saw this film at a theater in the uk and it was one of my
2,interesting to see a movie with a strong cast,interesting to see him play an older role in the
2,if i had a choice for the movie it might have been a good film but it was just a little too much to bear the,if i were a little bit prejudiced about the movie i would have been a bit confused but i did not care about this one
2,we are left with a feeling for a film which is so bad and that i do n't know what to say i just do not get,we have the first one and we are treated to a bunch of people who have been killed and have no idea who the killer is
2,there was a good deal about the film,there is a lot of violence and the movie
2,considering the fact that the film does a great job of depicting the real events of a film it is a,considering the fact that the director was not the most successful person of the genre this was a great film
2,the film is about a group of people and their lives,the film is a little slow but that 's it
2,i do not think this movie is worth seeing,i have never seen such bad films before
2,yes there were some good things going but i was wrong and i did,yes it was a great movie but i was n't expecting much more
2,all i can say was this movie was so horrible i could n't even watch the whole,all in all i think that it is worth the effort to buy it for purchase
2,being the most prudish i 've seen this movie is a,being the first movie i was impressed with the ending
2,he is a man of the age of innocence but his character,he is also a great actor and a very funny one
2,there was a lot to like about the movie the plot is pretty basic the,there 's a scene that is supposed to have been filmed with an arrow
2,the acting and the story is so,the acting and directing are horrible
2,son of dracula has the best performance of his career,son and son is one of the funniest horror movies ever
2,and it is n't the same thing that i 've seen,and it 's not that it does n't have to go to
2,in this case it 's a little slow but i,in the end he does not have any problems
2,he was the most popular actor of the movie as the,he 's a very nice actor and a good actor
2,supernatural horror movies are not a good idea to begin with,supernatural horror is a movie about the lives of the characters and
2,he 's a great actor and i can understand how the director could,he 's just as good a character as the one in this
2,if you are not a fan you 'll find the story to have a lot of interesting things to say and i think it was very well done and well acted,if it was a movie about an old school man that would have to do it in the hands of the people who would have been a part of it
2,it 's not a bad film but it 's good,it is a movie that you should n't watch
2,none is a good movie but it is still good and i recommend it,none is really really good or even the slightest hint of the story or the
2,there are so much more to this film,there are a lot more of the characters
2,i think it is a shame that this film has not got a theatrical rating for the movie and that it was released,i was expecting a movie with a lot more than just a few words and a few lines that would have worked
2,the story is very simple and it is a little too simple to,the film is a bit slow but it is still very funny
2,i think this is a very good movie to see,i was surprised at how bad it is and how bad
2,please do n't go watch this one and do n't waste your life,please do yourself a favour and do n't watch the trailer or read a
2,janet mcteer is the only reason i have n't seen,janet blaine as the mother is a real pleasure
2,other than that i was n't impressed with this movie,other than the fact that the film is n't a total
2,great performances and a great performance by the always,great performances by all involved in this production
2,there was a lot of nudity and nudity,there is a lot of violence and gore
2,the film has some of my favorite characters in my,the film is about the power of the characters
2,the story is about a young girl whose father and daughter is married to her,the acting in the other actors was good the script was very good the directing is
2,reissued in a time when it 's not as funny as the original,reissued in the us and early seventies and the us government was the prime
2,i do n't understand what the director was saying about the movie but,i was so bored when watching it i could n't stop laughing
2,fats is the only one that can be blamed for his own personal life in,fats is the only person that is n't the only one to be killed
2,this is a very funny movie,this is not a movie that will
2,riding the streets are not as exciting as the other films but they are very well made,riding around a campfire in an abandoned building and the girl and his daughter are killed in a
2,inevitably the film 's only flaw is the lack,inevitably the story is not very good either
2,trapped on a remote ship in new jersey city is a very good film,trapped in the rain is an old fashioned and very illuminating version with the exception
2,i do n't know if it was a comedy and a drama but i think it 's a good thing to make a movie with a,i do agree that the movie is not about a man who has a wife who does nothing to get her husband to be married
2,wow i have a feeling that i would n't have had a clue,wow it 's not a movie for the faint of a good time
2,the movie is a little slow and the,the film has a very interesting premise
2,she has to be one that is so bad that you can almost see her in her,she is the only person who has ever graced the surface and she does n't even get to
2,even the most ardent fans are n't going and have the same reaction as,even the actors are n't as convincing as the actors in the movie
2,what i did see was a good,what a great movie this is
2,and the ending was so lame,and i was n't expecting the usual
2,not to be missed the whole time and the film is a bit of fun to sit through because of its flaws in the first part,not only was the plot a bit too thin and the story did a little farfetched to follow the characters and the plot but the acting and
2,from this moment i was a bit confused at the time when it was released theatrically in my childhood,from a technical perspective of this movie i found myself wondering what would be the worst movie ever made in
2,unless it is a good idea to show the world the world the world,unless you have n't already seen the movie it will be worth seeing
2,not only is it not a comedy it 's a satire of how the,not only was this a bad movie it was just a bad movie
2,putting the two together together in a movie with no plot and characters who are not likable,putting a bunch of people in a room is one of the worst films i have ever watched
2,cult movie fans should n't have a blast,cult films have a lot to offer
2,had he not been a little more unlikable than he had ever been in the film i could have been more surprised,had it been made in an early 50 's it would have been much less interesting to have a sequel with a little
2,it 's the same kind of movie,it is n't a good movie
2,and that 's not the only reason why,and the acting is n't that terrible
2,meanwhile the two leads are a little too much,meanwhile the two leads are the only characters that are
2,but the movie was n't so bad it was good,but the real reason why the film does have a good
2,grandma is a good character and she 's not a bad girl but a good actress in this film,grandma and son are the only ones in this movie that will make you feel like a child you are
2,at least the original was a good idea to show the movie,at least that 's why i gave this film a 2 because it
2,the film was shot on a low budget,the story line of this story revolves upon a
2,javier bardem is a fine actor but he 's just a bad actor,javier bardem is the perfect choice for the role of the detective and the
2,sends it to the big screen for the first half hour of a movie that is a little too much to ask,sends the film to life is an interesting story about a woman who is attracted by her husband to a woman
2,i have n't seen the original version but the original was still a good one,i do not think that a film can possibly be done in the same manner as
2,based upon the novel by the great author david lynch who was the director and director and the director of photography,based upon the novel by arthur conan this is one that i 've seen and i have seen it twice before
2,for a movie that is not a complete waste for the movie,for the first half the movie i had a good laugh when i
2,but i have seen the original version of it and have seen many others that have made,but it is a very good movie to have a great time and a good time
2,the film has no redeeming qualities,the movie has a very good cast
2,thats a shame because it has the same,thats not the case in this one
2,absolutely no suspense no thrills and no suspense no real action no thrills no suspense no action no,absolutely nothing is said and the characters seem to be there to talk in the same way
2,but the real problem here was the lack of a coherent story,but it 's not that good and it 's not even that bad
2,one of the most interesting movies i have seen in years is the story,one thing is that it 's just not a great movie to begin with
2,as a result of the film i found the acting and the plot very weak,as a matter of fact i was so disappointed that this was the first of three
2,you 'll see it in this film but it,you have a good cast and the characters
2,i have to say i have to say i was a little skeptical when it was released,i was so excited when i heard that this was one that i was looking forward to
2,personal born and the film 's success is the acting,personal and psychological impact in the end is a great way
2,ok so i do n't want you but i 'll,ok it 's not as bad as it is
2,i do think that a lot more money is spent on the film,i have never been a big big fan and i do not like movies
2,she is the one that makes this movie so funny,she was so bad that she could barely have been a
2,it 's a shame that this movie has been so,it was so bad i could not stop laughing
2,i have seen this film several many times and,i do n't want the movie to end
2,although the story is not very interesting the acting was n't good either and that was the only part of the movie,although the film was shot in the seventies it 's a very very low point for the film 's production value
2,then there 's that scene where the killer is shot in his face while the camera pans off the,then the movie starts with a bunch of kids who have been trying too much for a movie
2,i think that it 's not a good idea to have seen a film in a long line of,i have never seen such a bad movie and i do n't want to give away the ending
2,mind you it does n't have a lot to offer,mind the movie has the best of the best
2,so if you are looking to watch a great horror thriller with a,so if it is n't for you it 's worth the wait
2,of this film the only one who is able in this film is to get a lot from it,of course the film does n't have a lot of action and the plot seems to go on and over
2,the story is simple enough to be a little slow and the characters do not have much to work with,the acting and the plot is a little thin but the movie is a real treat for me to watch it
2,nobody else is able to get into,nobody else is a real star
2,that is why the film is not,that is what this film was
2,none of these things are explained in the movie,none of them are funny and the acting is terrible
2,that 's the problem i have for the first half of the movie,that 's what the film is about the characters and the situations
2,it 's just a shame that they,it was n't a good movie
2,apart the two men are the best and most memorable scenes of this film,apart the fact of the matter is that it is not as good or interesting
2,the movie is not a good movie it is n't a great one but it has a very very good story,the acting is pretty good with the exception of the always dependable timothy dalton as a man of the heart
2,okay so this film is a total failure,okay so i do commend the filmmakers for giving
2,unfortunately the movie was n't as funny as it was,unfortunately the film 's biggest flaw was the fact it was
2,with all of the other actors the movie is not all that bad and i,with the possible exception of that the movie is a complete waste of time
2,donnie yen is an amazing character,donnie winters is a fine actor but
2,unlike many films this is a great piece of work and i have to say i did enjoy it and would love,unlike the first film i thought that the acting was pretty bad the story is weak and the acting is bad
2,it 's a shame that the film never got released,it 's a shame because the movie was made in a
2,i think the movie was a good idea,i have seen a lot of movies and have
2,she is a beautiful actress and is a wonderful actress,she is not a great actress she 's a very good
2,thank you for giving this movie a chance to redeem my enjoyment of the story and i do not think that the,thank god for this show and the fact that the contestants in it are so stupid they are n't even likable
2,if it 's not for a good performance by the young menjou who plays his role with a little conviction,if the director was n't so stupid he would make the movie bearable but it just was n't funny
2,i was so bored by the end that i had n't,i was n't sure why i was watching this show
2,both the story and the story were very good,both of them have been in love with each of
2,yeah it was a good show but i think that the acting was,yeah i have to say i 've seen this film twice before
2,after seeing the trailer i was surprised at how many times i 've watched this i 've,after seeing the movie the first time i was a little bit skeptical about this movie
2,gus van sant was in the same vein,gus van sant is a genius and the film
2,2054 is a movie with a great cast and great acting,2054 's story is not as good as some of the other
2,men are the only ones who can,men are always in their twenties
2,the movie is a bit of a mess but the plot and the characters were all very interesting to me as well as being the best,the film has some of those moments that are not even funny and i think that the movie is a waste over a movie ticket
2,you know it was n't going near the end of,you can tell that this is a good movie
2,the movie has the same feel as if it was shot on location in the same location in,the film is a complete waste of time to watch and not even a waste of time
2,the film is a little over a long time and is a,the movie is a bit slow but i really enjoyed that
2,but the real reason i did n't give it 1 star is because i have seen it several times,but the real problem with this movie are the special fx and special makeup that are n't even worth mentioning
2,what a great film this was,what i did like is that it
2,all the actors are excellent and it,all the actors are all excellent
2,when i saw the movie i had no expectations of it,when he 's not a little girl she 's a teenager
2,this movie is one that i would recommend to everyone,this was a very funny film with some great actors and
2,so i guess i can see why i do n't know what the film has,so if it is a movie about a bunch that is going through a series that
2,one day the girl is killed and the woman is killed,one day the girl gets a chance to get rid and then
2,sorry for the good of a bad bad movie but i do not recommend this film,sorry to say this is a good movie and i would recommend it for any serious fan
2,i do n't know how this film got released theatrically and i can say it is not the worst i can ever watch and i have seen it twice but,i have seen it three or five times and i can still remember it vividly i am a fan of the original and i have seen it many times
2,this is not the type of movie you should watch but it 's a good one,this film was so good that i could n't even get to the theater and walked out
2,and i do not believe the director 's vision of the,and i have no problem suspending disbelief in the end
2,at one point in the story we see the young man 's body and he is reunited in a,at the end i was convinced of a movie about a group called the filthiest of the two
2,the acting was horrible and the plot is just plain stupid and i do n't even,the film is a little slow but it has a very interesting and interesting story
2,walter brennan is excellent in a role,walter matthau is a revelation as he is
2,in fact it 's not that great,in this film the actors have a great
2,btw the movie is n't really a comedy,btw the film has no real plot to speak
2,i have seen this movie several times and i still love it so,i was so impressed by that and i had to watch it
2,there is a very good scene in which the two guys,there 's no need of any explanation of the movie
2,i was expecting a movie that i would like but i,i was so excited when the first one was released
2,i have to say the acting in the whole movie was great and the writing is very believable and the characters are all very believable especially,i think the reason i gave it a 1 is because it is a very poor movie and it 's just not a good idea
2,entwined with the help of an attractive woman who is the only one who is a bit of an achievement and a very attractive one,entwined with the help of a young woman who is the only reason to see the film the first thing that i have to do with
2,and it 's not that the film is bad,and the acting in this film was horrible
2,antonioni was a master director and a filmmaker,antonioni has a great sense of humour and the
2,performance was a little weak in the movie but it was n't that bad to be expected,performance in all of these movies is a very interesting and very entertaining film that will appeal to
2,the film is very slow and slow,the acting in this movie sucks and it
2,since the film is a complete mess it has a good story,since the movie is so much better than it should be
2,a few years ago i saw it again and it still holds a place to me,a lot of the scenes are shot with the camera and lighting but it is a bit
2,also a few of the characters were interesting and the movie did have a few moments to keep it from going into a coma,also the film 's main drawback was the lack of a coherent story line and the fact it is not a comedy or drama or
2,there are some funny parts but there is n't much to it,there are a lot of things i do not like about this film
2,crow 's is a very funny movie,crow 's character has a very similar role
2,the movie was n't a bad movie,the story is a simple one
2,in the end i felt the need of an extra of the same kind,in the end the story is not so good it is not funny
2,and that does have a lot of problems,and it 's not a bad idea to make
2,i was surprised that the movie was not made available in the uk but the director and producer decided that it was a,i was so disappointed that this was a movie that was so stupid and stupid that i could n't even finish it
2,the story was so stupid that you could n't even care less about the plot line or the acting,the acting is good but the acting is horrible the script is awful and there is no plot at any
2,i have to say that i was very impressed by it and it is a very,i have to say the film was a waste of time and money and money
2,i do not know if it 's just the fact that it was made in the first place,i do not know if it was intentional to get to the point where they were making it but
2,obviously the film is set in the same location as the first one,obviously the film 's biggest success was the fact the film had to do
2,the film is not only the most controversial movie ever but it also has,the movie was a bit too slow but it was n't too good
2,last and not the first time the movie is a long time it is n't a great movie,last year i was able into a film that had been done by the author and i have been
2,how did the guy know how to tell you how to act,how many of us have been able to find the remote
2,people have to say the movie was bad,people are saying that it was the best film
2,the acting in this movie is terrible the script was awful,the film is a little slow and boring at times but the
2,i have n't read the book yet but i think it 's a good idea,i think it 's a shame that this is n't the best movie ever
2,charlotte rampling is the best in the film,charlotte rampling plays the young woman with her own
2,hey it 's not the worst film ever,hey i 've been watching the movie
2,beyond that it was the worst movie i,beyond that there are two main problems
2,what i did like about this movie was the fact that it 's a very bad thing,what i got was a film with a lot of potential to make up a minute
2,at first i did n't think that this movie would be a good movie but it is,at one moment the camera is on camera work and then it is on the verge
2,it has a good plot and a decent cast,it was the first movie to have been made in
2,the story is a little weak but there is some very good action sequences that have a good cast,the movie is not a bad film but a very interesting and entertaining film that is not only a vehicle
2,the movie is a very funny movie that i would watch if you have not seen it yet,the story of the story of the famous man is a little too familiar for a movie of this
2,it 's the only way i would,it 's a very bad thing
2,i have never seen a worse actor,i do n't know if it is the
2,ben stiller is a fine comedic genius,ben gazzara is one great character and he
2,now i do n't have the words that the film is supposed for,now that i have seen this film i have to say it is a
2,the story was very simple and very very very very interesting and very interesting,the story is about two people who go to a house to find a new
2,anyone with a modicum memories and the ability to see this movie will,anyone interested in the genre or any other film will be delighted
2,last year 's eve is a great show,last year i was looking for something to watch
2,ok i do n't think that the film is a masterpiece,ok it 's just a bunch that is a little over
2,if i was the only child who would have liked this film the acting would have been better,if i were a fan of the book i would have given this one an 8 if i was
2,wells 's direction and direction is superb but it 's a bit too slow,wells 's direction is a little slow but the film is so bad it makes
2,in fact it has the same effect as it was in this movie it 's not that bad,in the first film the main character is a man with a conscience and he does n't want to
2,aside from that the movie does n't make a lick of fact,aside this was a pretty good film with some good action
2,i was so disappointed with the movie,i have seen a lot worse than this
2,as a result it 's not a movie that is n't worth a rental,as a movie it was a bit of a disappointment and i would n't recommend
2,i have seen this movie many times over the years as it is a classic of,i was surprised to discover this was made in a small town in the uk
2,overall it is n't a bad movie but it 's still good,overall this is not one of the best movies of the year it
2,i think it 's one of my favorite shows,i do agree that i am a big fan of
2,the film is about the same thing as the first movie and it 's just not as much fun as the other two,the film has some nice moments in the movie but there is a bit of a lot more than a couple of other characters
2,an excellent movie that i enjoyed,an excellent film that is worth watching
2,a few of the characters are good but the story is so weak and predictable that you 'll find the,a lot happens in the movie but it is a very good film that makes you laugh and cry
2,stray is the most beautiful movie i ever saw and,stray from hell i 've heard about the movie
2,yeah i know it sounds like a bad film but it 's still a good movie,yeah it has a lot of good things to it but it is a very bad movie
2,apart the fact that the director of photography was,apart from that the story is pretty good
2,this is one movie that i will never forget about it,this is a film that is a little over the top in
2,a few scenes are very funny and funny,a lot happens in the movie but i do
2,anna paquin is excellent as the heroine of the movie,anna is a great actress but i was so bored
2,i was so bored that it would n't even make sense in the end of my review,i do n't want my money to be wasted but it is the best movie ever made
2,in the first film we get the same feeling of the same old man who 's,in this case the movie is about the power of the people in the movie
2,viggo mortensen was a bit over the top and i thought that it was a bit overdone at first,viggo ackland plays a young woman who 's been married to an older woman who has been married
2,although i was not impressed with the story and the story the characters were all believable and the story line,although the film is not a masterpiece it 's still a very enjoyable movie that has been done well
2,yes it has a lot going in but the plot is very good,yes i know it is a bad idea but it 's not
2,the acting and the direction are very poor,the movie is a very good example for a
2,several times the film is set in a small village where a couple,several of the characters were very good the story is very good
2,in the end he is not the best actor in the world but he 's,in the movie he plays a very good and very very very straight guy
2,there are so very many movies that are made in the,there is no plot to be found in the film
2,i think it 's not a bad movie if it is n't bad enough for it but it,i think that the director should be ashamed for his own work in a more mature manner
2,he is a very good actor and is a great character actor,he is not a bad guy but he has the worst of a
2,the story is very good but the acting and the plot is so bad that i ca n't believe i wasted,the acting is good and i think the director should have had the director and editor of the film more
2,i was expecting something more like a remake,i think the film is a little more enjoyable
2,avoid this movie at your cost if your a fan of,avoid this at all unless you like a good movie
2,my favorite parts in the film are where the girl 's daughter is trying to get to the house and she,my favorite parts were the ones where the two boys are talking to the guy that they are talking about
2,i think the director should be commended for this,i was n't sure what to watch but i was
2,the movie was a little slow but it 's not a good story,the film is a very interesting film and the director 's direction is excellent
2,i think this was the worst film of the decade,i think that it is the worst film i 've ever
2,it is the worst of the series,it 's the kind of movie you should
2,basically a movie that is n't even a good film,basically it 's a very good story with a great story
2,then the film starts out with a,then there was some nice cinematography
2,if you are a huge fan you will find this movie very disappointing and not even worth a rental,if you want to see something like the real life of the director then you should definitely see it
2,fortunately the film does n't seem to have the same impact of a real life as the other,fortunately i have n't seen the original but i do n't think i 'll ever see it again
2,after seeing this film you will have the impression that the,after seeing it i thought it was a good movie
2,the film has a lot of problems with the main plot but i think it 's a great story,the acting is horrible and i do think that they are supposed as though it 's been done in a
2,imo it was not as good as i,imo it 's the same old movie
2,get to see the first one and then the second and final chapter of this film is just plain,get to watch it and you will be laughing at the end when you 're talking about it
2,in fact it has a lot of problems with the,in the end the film is not as good
2,at least i would have been more impressed with the movie,at least the actors in this movie have a certain amount
2,all the actors were good in a movie,all i can say is the acting
2,widmark 's character is a little bit too unlikable but the film,widmark is a very talented actor and is the perfect actor
2,another thing i liked about it is its lack of realism,another problem is this is n't a very bad movie
2,spoiler the movie has a few good things about it,spoiler alert it has a very interesting plot line but the
2,i'm glad to see that this movie has a good,i'm not saying that it 's a bad movie
2,the film was made in the seventies and,the movie is not a good movie
2,but the real thing is that the film does not feature much in,but the film 's main weakness lies in its lack of focus
2,the film is about a woman trying,the film has an excellent story
2,much of the film was made in color in a small rural village,much more than the usual fare it is a film that has a very
2,for me the best part of this movie however is the way,for a while i was surprised that this movie was made
2,but it does n't have the same effect as the other two,but the film has a very interesting story that makes it hard to
2,pay attention to the film and the story,pay attention and then the movie is about as
2,i do n't know if this film was intended to appeal but,i do n't think that the film has any redeeming features
2,acting was good the story was good and it had a good story line,acting is bad the story line has a very weak plot and the acting
2,i do n't know how it 's going for the movie to make sense but it is a movie worth watching,i think the director was making a movie about a bunch of teenagers that are not a dime and a bunch
2,thank goodness for the first hour and a quarter of the film,thank god i did n't pay for this one and that 's all
2,and i do not know where the movie was filmed,and the acting in the movie was very poor
2,for me i have a feeling of disgust for the director and the,for those of us that like me you will probably enjoy it
2,i think the reason i did this movie was because it had to do,i have n't seen the first two but this movie was very good
2,would you want a film to make a movie about how bad the movie is,would n't you know that there was a real threat in the world of this film
2,it 's not a bad movie it 's just not good,it was the most boring and boring film ever made i have
2,that 's the only reason to see this,that is why this film does not get a
2,my favorite parts of this movie were the first two,my advice to anyone who enjoys watching this show
2,but the film 's main flaw with a film that is not a film is the,but i think this is the best movie of the last decade of my life
2,what 's more the movie 's main character and his friends are the two leads who do n't seem to be very,what is the deal with the story of a woman who has to deal with her own life as a child
2,this movie is not for everyone,this is a very good and very
2,but the film is n't so bad it 's good,but this is a great movie and i think it 's
2,she was n't the most likable person i have ever seen,she is a good person but her husband and daughter are so
2,her character is so annoying that you wonder if the director intended to be an intelligent person,her character was so annoying and so unlikable it was almost impossible for me to watch
2,to say that this movie was a waste for the first time is a good thing,to make matters worse i was surprised to find this film was not even a good idea
2,i have to admit that it was a great movie,i have never seen the original but it was the best
2,those of you interested with the same thing will probably be,those who are not familiar with the story are missing
2,i have n't read a lot of books and seen them on tv in the early days,i was surprised that it did n't get a theatrical release at the time and i have n't
2,there 's no plot and it does n't even come close to,there was a good deal to be found in the original
2,every time i watch this show i was laughing at the jokes that,every time i watch it it is so bad it is good
2,however it 's not a movie,however this is not a movie that
2,this film has the best of all,this is the best film i have ever
2,in a movie like this i think it was a mistake,in the end the movie is a little too long
2,the movie was a complete failure to watch and it 's only,the film has a very good plot and a good story
2,if the story is about the same guy who 's in the movie,if i were to rate the movie as an 8 i would
2,and i do not believe that this is,and it 's a very good idea
2,then the two meet in the middle of the night and it takes them all,then the movie is a bit of a mess but it is still a good film
2,belle is a great character actor who has a good role,belle is a young actress who 's not a very good actress
2,there are some good points but the rest is just a,there is also a lot of violence to the film
2,when i first heard that this is a comedy about the,when i saw this i was very excited and disappointed
2,for those who do not like this film i would highly appreciate this,for those who like to watch a movie with no real substance and no
2,at least that 's why the movie is a bit long,at one point the movie is a little too much for the
2,mask and the whale has a lot of action to it which is why i liked this,mask is one of the worst movies i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through
2,the film is a very good movie,the story of an aging woman who marries
2,by the end of the day it 's a movie that i could n't,by the end you 'll have no idea how to make this movie
2,also i think that the movie has a lot of good points to it and,also i think it is very hard not to compare it for a movie
2,instead the viewer gets a sense as they go through the motions and the film takes the viewer out with it,instead of being a little bit too much for me it 's a bit of a shame that the movie never got
2,erm i have to admit i was n't impressed by the movie,erm i have to say that i was n't expecting anything more than
2,zombi 3 was a huge hit in 1993,zombi 3 is one of my favorites
2,the story is simple enough to warrant the viewer attention from a young man who 's been kidnapped,the movie has a lot more to offer and more than just a few moments of dialogue
2,ok so i do concede that this movie is n't a total waste of time and a total,ok i know that 's a little unfair but this film was n't a good one either
2,wow i have to say i was,wow this movie was a joke
2,the movie is a complete mess of a story that is not even worth mentioning,the acting in this movie is horrible the script sucks so the movie has a lot
2,it 's just a shame that the film is not available for sale,it is a great show that is a must see for any fan
2,another problem is the lack of a plot and characters who are not even developed in a realistic way and are completely underdeveloped and boring,another problem is the lack of any real story and character motivation that is the main reason i do n't like lucy 's character
2,this movie has a lot of action and some of it is pretty well executed with some very good action sequences and a great ending to it,this is a film that is not a total waste of time but it does n't make sense and it is a great movie to see for all
2,well it is n't a great movie it 's not a good movie it just is n't a bad film,well i have to say it has a lot of problems but it 's a very enjoyable and enjoyable movie
2,when i watched this movie i felt like i could n't stand the movie in any theater,when you have a chance you can find a way to go on and make you feel the
2,goodnight and a lot of the same thing that made it so great,goodnight is an example of what the movie is trying to accomplish
2,let 's face that the director did n't have a clue of what the director was,let 's just start by saying that the film has some good actors and actresses
2,the movie is a complete waste of money it is not worth the effort to be a fan,the movie was a little slow and the ending was predictable as well and really really bad
2,you can see the actors playing the same character,you 'll never know what the hell was wrong with
2,it 's not even the best movie ever it has been a long long time since the last movie,it is the worst movie i 've ever seen and i do agree that it is a total waste of
2,i think this movie should 've been made in a,i was surprised to find this show on video
2,and that 's the only thing that,and the movie is so boring
2,now that the story is set out for a long time and the characters are n't the same,now that 's a good thing but it is a very good movie and the acting is good and
2,but the film does have a few redeeming factors,but the movie is so bad that you just want
2,there are so few movies i have seen that,there was a lot to like about it
2,one can say the acting is n't that bad but the acting,one of his better films in the world of the genre
2,strangely it was a very funny and funny show,strangely enough the film does a great deal of research
2,i'm a fan like a good guy who is a little too much to be,i'm a fan and i am a fan of the series of the series
2,a good film for a sunday afternoon,a few scenes of the film were filmed
2,yesterday i was in the mood of this film,yesterday the movie is set in the us and the
2,i do n't think this is a good movie,i have n't seen this film yet i do have
2,but the real star was not that it 's a film,but the film is so bad it 's almost embarrassing
2,hey the film has some nice shots but there,hey it 's the best of the bunch
2,this is the first of a trilogy,this is a great film to watch
2,why did the writers not give us the opportunity,why do i think this film was made for tv
2,however the film is n't really a good movie,however the film is not about a young girl who
2,handsome and beautiful is one such an excellent film,handsome people in a small town and the local police
2,he was n't a good guy and he was n't a,he was a little too much to be ashamed of
2,this was a very bad movie and the acting was terrible,this movie has a very bad script that is just plain bad
2,i do think that the movie was very good,i do not recommend the movie as a whole
2,and the film 's plot was a bit too long and the ending is too confusing to follow,and the movie is so bad i ca n't believe it was made on dvd so that i could

2,thumbs up and do n't get it,thumbs away from the film and the story

2,they are not in the film for their own reasons,they 're not even funny and they are not even funny

2,the film 's plot is very interesting the story of the first movie is very interesting,the movie starts with the same guy who has been trying hard and the only way i
2,one of the few movies that has a good cast is that it is the best of all,one thing that really bothered my nerves was the way the story unfolded in the first place
2,no wonder that the movie is n't even remotely funny and i,no one has ever done a movie that is so funny
2,this movie has no redeeming features to say,this movie is not worth the money
2,this movie was a waste of time to watch,this film is one that is not only for those

2,nelson and her husband who have a secret to their own problems and the other two are the ones they,nelson 's character is not a very good person but he does a good job of portraying the character

2,this is not a movie that you should watch but it certainly has a,this is one movie that i can recommend it to everyone and everyone
2,since the film 's plot is a bit thin it 's not a good movie,since it was a very low production i could not help to feel the need
2,surprisingly the film 's premise is very good,surprisingly enough the movie is a complete bore that
2,it is n't a bad movie and i would have been better to watch it again,it 's just a shame that the producers of the film did n't have a clue to

2,since it is a film i would n't have to have a copy on my dvd player,since the story is n't the most interesting thing about it it is n't a good film and
2,the film is about two women who are in their own way and are forced into a,the movie has the most annoying ending ever and i think that it was a waste

2,the film is about a woman who has been cheating for her husband 's life and has her father 's life,the story is very simple the story is very good the acting and the direction is superb and it 's a shame

2,and it was n't a total disaster,and i have n't even been in the
2,i do n't think this film would be made as an accurate film or a documentary or a,i do n't want to give away the story but it 's a good film to watch

2,i was n't impressed with the movie but it was a good,i do n't want my money back to the dvd 's
2,spoilers i was surprised to find that the movie is not only the best of all of it 's films it is a very good film,spoilers the movie is about the only person in his family and he is a very nice guy but the story line is very good too
2,and that is a shame because the,and the acting is so bad
2,the acting in the movie is very good,the story of an old man in the family
2,thankfully the movie was made in the early seventies,thankfully this is the worst movie ever made
2,i have n't read the novel so it 's obvious that,i have never been to istanbul for such a movie
2,i'm not a big expert but the movie is a good example of how the movie was made,i'm not a big fan and that i can appreciate a movie with such a bad reputation
2,the film has a lot going for them the first time around,the movie was a waste and i think that is the case with

2,this is a film that is not a good one but is not,this is a film of the highest caliber of the late 70s
2,it 's a pity that the film has a very low,it has a very good cast and a good plot
2,if the movie was n't that good it would be a good,if the movie was a little slow it was the movie
2,donald pleasance was good but his role is so bad it 's almost painful to sit through because he is n't,donald pleasance is a good guy and he 's a great actor but he is not good in this one
2,what is the difference between the two,what is this movie about that
2,jean simmons is excellent in her role as an aging actress who gets to play a very beautiful and sexy woman and she 's very good as the,jean dujardin plays a young woman whose husband 's life is n't a little different and she is not the least of which is not the case
2,for the first two thirds it is the worst movie i have ever seen,for the first time a movie that i have seen on the dvd and has
2,i was surprised that the film had a lot more to offer,i think this is a good movie and i recommend it
2,at one time the movie was a complete mess of a film,at the same moment the two main actors are all very good but
2,overall it 's not a movie that is so awful you ca only watch a few minutes of it and then watch,overall it is a great family movie that is not only for the sake but to all adults who have n't read the
2,scott wiper 's character was a bit,scott bakula is a good actor
2,and it 's a good film,and the ending was so bad that
2,when i saw this on a shelf at the library and it 's a great film i have,when the movie is over and the movie is over you get to see it all unfold
2,the film is a little slow paced but a bit too slow,the story of the story was so weak and so contrived and i
2,the acting is good and i think the actors were great,the film is a very moving and very moving film
2,her performance is so awful it 's embarrassing to watch her performance,her husband is a little too much to be taken seriously
2,this is a movie about a young man trying to,this is a great movie for the whole time
2,jekyll 's story is a bit of an excuse to be the,jekyll 's character does n't even have to be the hero
2,so the film is a complete waste of your money but the film has some good moments and some great performances,so if you 're looking for a fun horror film this is the one for your collection but you can enjoy it
2,it 's the only thing that makes this movie a good film,it 's just a bunch that you do get to know the people
2,but the film is a bit too slow,but i think the movie is very good and
2,only the title of the movie was a good idea,only the acting and the script are n't good
2,basically the movie does not have a lot to do,basically a bunch are made up of a bunch of people
2,it was n't the best movie of its kind,it 's a great film for a rainy day and
2,spoofing the film is a very good film and a very enjoyable movie,spoofing the movie as the most popular film it is a classic
2,haruhi garofalo is the perfect actress,haruhi is an excellent character who does
2,here 's the spoiler i was n't expecting much,here 's a few examples that are n't so bad
2,he is also a great fighter,he is the one who is the
2,there is no way to make this film a masterpiece but the acting is excellent especially the one where the film is a real treat to watch,there are some good performances in the film but the movie has a very good story that is n't really about the evils of a war
2,seeing this film was a waste of time,seeing this one is a very interesting experience
2,as a matter i have no idea what this movie is about,as a matter the film has the same feel as if it was
2,despite the title of the film it 's a pretty good movie and i liked it a little,despite the presence and a good performance by everyone who was involved with this film it was a waste
2,the story is a bit confusing and it has a lot to do,the story is about a group who are trying to get married to a
2,his performance is a bit stiff but it is,his wife is the one with her son
2,it 's not even the best of all,it has a great cast of great characters and
2,the story is a complete bore and the,the film is not a bad movie
2,moreover the movie has a good deal of action in the end but it 's not a bad movie either as,moreover i think the film was a bit slow and i did n't really get to see the whole movie
2,maybe it would 've been better but it was not,maybe it was the director 's intention to make a movie
2,there 's also some great scenes in which a man is murdered,there are many scenes that have nothing going for it and they are
2,in a movie that was supposed for children and adults alike,in the end i did n't think that was the best of
2,i think the reason why i gave it 1 stars is because of the fact that the,i do agree but i do n't think that the director could be the same person
2,they are both very funny and the story is a,they are not the only ones who can identify
2,imagined to see a movie that is n't even worth,imagined to have an affair with the main protagonist
2,this movie was not the best film i saw but that was the,this is the worst thing i 've heard in my whole career

2,i have seen this movie several many years ago,i think it is the best movie of this decade
2,it was a very funny show and it shows the real,it has the most annoying character of the entire movie
2,this movie was a waste on a movie,this was a movie about the evils and how
2,the movie is about a young woman,the movie is very well made
2,the film is very well acted and,the movie has a great soundtrack
2,sylvester is one who has a crush on the young man,sylvester is the only character who seems like he was a real
2,i have to admit that i am a huge believer,i think this was an awesome movie for me
2,at least the original version was a little bit of the same as it was,at the time of this one 's release i was n't sure if it is going
2,i have to say that it is a very enjoyable,i have never been so disappointed by a movie
2,it is a shame that this film,it was so funny to me
2,the acting was horrible but i was n't expecting much,the film is a little too talky to be enjoyable
2,it 's not a bad idea for an action movie and the actors are n't very convincing and the plot seems to,it 's just that a bunch of kids are talking about their own problems and the whole world has been forgotten
2,saw this film at the 2005 sundance international film festival and was pleasantly surprised at,saw the trailer for this film and i must admit the acting was great
2,its not even the best movie ever,its a shame the movie is so bad
2,the film is a little slow but the film does n't have,the movie was a complete waste for me but i did
2,to be honest i have seen this movie several times and i still love it,to be a little more of a good film i was able for a movie to
2,this is a movie about a young woman who is,this is one movie you can see and enjoy
2,as a result of this film 's popularity it is still,as for the film it 's not a bad movie
2,whatever you think it was the worst movie ever made it 's a,whatever it was i was n't expecting a lot of the movie
2,bingley is a good character actor,bingley is the only one to be
2,the movie is a bit of a mess but the plot,the acting is good but it is a bit bland
2,i have n't read the manga so far and it is n't even worth mentioning that it was a bit too long,i do n't know if this movie really was a bad attempt to make the movie seem like they had to be made
2,i do n't understand why they did this,i have seen the movie twice and i can
2,uncomfortable to watch a movie that was n't bad,uncomfortable with his own family and the family
2,are they really supposed to be a little bit different from,are the characters really supposed to care about each character
2,mary steenburgen plays a character who does,mary astor plays her usual role
2,none of this is particularly interesting,none of the characters were believable and
2,we are left with the same impression as this one is in the book,we 're supposed for a film to be a comedy and it does not work
2,some of the acting is n't that special,some of the scenes were so bad i thought
2,in this case the director has no idea what to expect,in a way i do n't know why i was in the
2,studio execs have done a good job,studio executives should be embarrassed to be able
2,but the film 's only redeeming value to,but the movie is so much more
2,if the movie is a good movie it would have been a great movie,if it were n't that the film was made in the first place it was
2,this film has a very good cast and the story line is very good too but there are some,this is a film that i would recommend to everyone and anyone interested in the genre should see
2,i was expecting a movie to get a good laugh,i have to say that i 've been a huge fan
2,as i said earlier the movie is a bit too dark but the film is a bit too long to be a thriller,as a result the plot is pretty weak the characters seem to be trying to be a little too clever to make it a
2,as a result of his own life the family is a bit more than a bit too eager,as a matter of view i was n't impressed at the end when the credits rolled up
2,nothing really bad happens at this time,nothing really bad and it 's just not
2,there 's also some good action and the acting is excellent,there is also some great performances by the supporting cast including the
2,chris farley was a good choice for the role of a young stud who 's been a little too much for the last 15 or 15 seconds of this film and i do n't think he 's the only actor that is the least bit convincing in this movie and it 's not the fault that i did n't see him as the lead,chris kattan plays the father of a wealthy man and his father and son and father is very good and the story itself has a great cast that is very well done but the story and the characters are all so predictable that they are just boring in their roles and they 're all just plain stupid and stupid and stupid and stupid
2,so what if they had to be done,so if i had to pick up my brain
2,this is the kind to make you think,this is a very good show for a few
2,there is no way that the director should get,there are some very nice moments in it
2,he is a good actor but he is just plain awful and that 's,he is a good man and is a real person who is willing
2,by all means the film is a must see for any fan,by now the film is a bit over a hour and the film
2,dan aykroyd was a good choice as the villain,dan aykroyd 's acting was excellent as the villain who
2,whoever wrote this script should have had a chance of seeing the movie for,whoever wrote this script should be ashamed of the need of a sequel
2,of course there is a certain amount to it,of course there is the usual hollywood style of the
2,screenwriters have been able for a few,screenwriters have done a good thing
2,tears and geeks do n't get me wrong i love this one but i do not think that a movie is better,tears and ears were not always the same but they did n't really have the same strength as it could be
2,naturally the movie does not have to have a lot to,naturally this is a movie with a lot of laughs
2,this is a film that will make people cry and laugh out of it as,this movie is a great piece for a movie and it is very good
2,hardly a movie that could n't even,hardly the best of the bunch
2,i do n't know if the movie 's makers were,i do n't know what this movie is about
2,actually this is a good movie,actually i think that it is a
2,somerset sinatra is the only actor in a role who is able to convey emotion in the film as the film unfolds with,somerset is a man who is a master of his craft and he does n't want the money to be in this
2,it 's not even the worst movie that i can think it,it was a very interesting movie that had to be made
2,good thing about the film is that it 's not,good luck is the best movie i have seen
2,if i were to give this movie a score i 'd be generous to the director and director,if it was n't for its lack of budget it was probably better than most of the budget
2,most people will not be able for the movie,most of these movies are so bad they 're bad
2,his character is a little bit annoying,his character is a caricature that is a
2,bill murray is a fine choice,bill pullman is great in this movie
2,the film has some very nice scenery and some nice touches,the story is a little thin but there is a lot more
2,dressed up as a very nice and very interesting film the,dressed in a black robe and sporting a white mask
2,i do n't know if this film was made for the reasons that were so popular in the us but in the us it was very,i think it is a shame to see such films as these are so few films that have a good cast and a good script
2,it 's a shame that the movie was made in the early 1990s,it 's a great movie and one you 'll definitely appreciate but it 's
2,i have seen it several many times,i have n't seen a movie that has
2,prey is a film about an aging man who finds himself embroiled by a group of people who are a group of people and,prey has a great cast and it 's a shame that the film has not got released theatrically in the uk and released
2,in the end it 's not a bad idea to make,in a way the film is not a bad thing
2,we 're supposed as if the director wanted to see the first movie,we 're not supposed to feel sorry about the characters in this movie and
2,instead of the usual suspects they have a,instead it 's a very boring movie
2,its a shame because i was expecting a lot from the film i was n't disappointed,its a shame that the filmmakers did n't even have the decency to do it
2,did they have to have the money and the money and spent money to get it,did i get the feeling he was the only one who had to deal with his character
2,she is the one and only actress in the movie,she is the one who gets killed by a werewolf
2,the acting was n't great but the acting was ok,the movie is a complete mess and the acting is atrocious
2,however the film has no redeeming quality and is n't even a good movie,however the movie is a little too long for its time as the story is
2,the acting is very poor the story is weak and,the movie starts as one thing is the same
2,well it 's a movie with some good acting and a great plot and a,well i do n't want to spoil it for anyone who loves the book
2,the story is simple but the movie is a little,the movie was a little too long for me
2,ten minutes into this movie i was just hoping the film could get worse the plot,ten years later the young man is murdered by a gang that has been murdered
2,the film is a little too long for its subject matter but the,the story is very interesting and it 's easy to understand why
2,the movie is about a man who is,the film has a very good story
2,his character is a bit underdeveloped and it 's a bit of fun to sit right through the whole movie without being too stupid,his character was the only one that could have played the lead character in this film but he was n't given a chance to play
2,the acting is good and the story line is good but it was n't that bad,the acting is good and the story is good but the acting is horrible at best as
2,every time i see it it is so sad to see the whole world,every time he appears in the film you 'll have no idea how he feels
2,the story was so stupid and predictable that it was hard for me,the movie is about a bunch of people who are sent to a party
2,the movie was made in the early seventies and was probably a little too long for the most of us,the film is not as good and is not a good film but the story is good and it 's not
3,the acting ranges from the bad and bad of the bad to not much more than one of those movies that could,the first movie was about a group called a group and the girl who was supposed at all in the house
3,there was an interesting plot line that i did enjoy the film,there is some great scenery shots and the fact that the film is
3,there is a lot of things to be done about this movie,there are a couple funny moments in the movie where a little bit
3,she is a little girl but she is a little,she 's the only thing that kept me awake
3,he was the first film to ever be released and,he 's not just a kid with a heart
3,my favourite scene is when a woman goes through,my advice is to watch this on dvd
3,while the movie was n't really a great idea to follow the book by a,while it was a good idea to show the characters it was very funny
3,the story is about a young woman who moves into a small village after being kidnapped by a group called the minotaur to save herself from a mysterious killer that has been buried in the woods to find,the acting is terrible the dialogue was bad so the acting is awful the script is worse the dialogue was worse the acting was bad the plot is bad it 's so stupid it just gets annoying
3,in fact they were n't all that good and i was n't sure why they were making it into the film,in fact it 's not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination but it is not a bad film at
3,the first half of a film is a complete mess,the plot is simple and the movie is about a group
3,a good cast of actors and actresses with a good,a few years later he was killed and killed
3,so i am not complaining that he is so bad as an actor,so i can only imagine that this was not only the best movie ever
3,some have complained that it has no real purpose but i think,some people say it was funny and i did enjoy it
3,most of his films have a great deal going for it,most of the cast in this film is just plain awful
3,it 's a good idea that a film like it was on tv or,it is a good film and it 's certainly worth checking it out
3,while the movie is not the most interesting to watch it 's just a waste of the time money,while the movie is about a guy and his dog they 're just trying to save the girl
3,then it turns out to get a little boring and just drags on,then there is the scene where the main character tries too hard
3,sure the acting is not bad but the script is so bad that you 'll just laugh yourself,sure the movie is n't a good one but the movie has some nice points to it it 's
3,i was n't expecting this film as a movie but it was a good movie,i saw the original film on the shelf and found myself wishing that it had been
3,and then the movie turns out to be just plain stupid,and the whole movie is a dream to see how it could
3,in this one there is a lot of the,in fact it 's not a total loss
3,aside with the title this movie is a perfect,aside from that it is a good movie
3,so why is he a bit of a wimp,so the plot is not a good one
3,and there 's no real explanation to the characters,and that is what you 're going to be able
3,but there 's something in the movie,but that is all we see
3,characters are not very likable and the movie is very slow,characters and situations are developed throughout the film and are very very
3,i was n't expecting the usual suspects in this,i saw this movie on the scifi channel
3,anyone who has seen this movie know what to believe,anyone with a pulse and the fact that the film is
3,he 's an excellent talent for the role of his career who is a fine actor,he was a great actor and a very good actor and the actors were good and very
3,tries hard as to the sort and so many,tries to save money for a good movie
3,i have to wonder why this movie has not been released by a wide margin but it has been released on dvd,i was a bit puzzled that the movie did n't seem as though i 'd had more than a little bit of imagination
3,this film is a complete waste,this one was not a complete disaster
3,i was expecting a little more,i 've been in a military school
3,he has a great cast as a psychiatrist and is able,he 's just not a very funny character and is not a
3,it 's an odd movie but the story and characters do,it was an insult that this movie had no substance
3,would you like to think it is that great movie,would n't be more interesting if they had had an interracial
3,her father is a bit too old and she is too young to be a good person she 's just a girl,her acting is a bit weak the plot has nothing to do with poe and is a bit of a bore and one
3,mere spoilers ahead the film is not so bad but it really should have stayed,mere spoilers ahead of its time the movie is n't even a horror film
3,somebody said that the film had to do was n't sorted at the time,somebody else is not going to have the decency to make a sequel
3,in a time machine of the year 3000 the plot is so ridiculous,in fact i think the film is very similar to a lot
3,give it a chance because you 'll be able,give this one an 8 or even a 75
3,the story is simple but the acting and directing was superb and,the film is n't about the people who have their careers
3,the movie is a bit slow but the acting and the story,the only reason to see a feature film is the acting
3,another thing that was n't the best thing about this was its title,another scene involves the young woman with a mental breakdown in her apartment
3,the acting is n't bad but the actors and production values were good,the movie is not even funny but the characters are n't really developed enough
3,they did not make it into the movie as the story of the book of which is not the,they do not make a lot of money but the script is so good they are all good
3,a young man who has been living in a small apartment for a year and a young man has been living in a,a few weeks ago i was a little skeptical about this one but i did n't like the way the movie started
3,the film is very very very good,the film does n't have much of a
3,and there was a very clever and exciting scene that was very funny and i think the scene where a man is strangled,and then there 's the scene where the main protagonist is killed by the woman who he is talking at the scene
3,i'm not even going to go to the bathroom to get my ass back and let,i'm not saying the acting of the actors were good but the performances were excellent
3,but it 's just the same old stuff,but it 's just a good film
3,there was no plot line no character no development no suspense,there is one thing that makes this film so good
3,and that 's why the movie is not,and the movie is n't about a group of
3,i was very surprised to find that the movie was a lot like it,i was expecting something great and a bit of the story and i would have
3,that is a shame because there is so many plot twists,that the movie is based upon one true story is a very
3,white men are all very good and have a lot to live up in their eyes and their eyes and,white chicks are not always a lot but the movie is so good that one cannot even forgive them
3,harry is not the only guy to be the killer and the whole town,harry has no qualms about her but that he does n't really know he
3,wai and his wife are also a very attractive couple in the film,wai has a great role in his film and his character is a bit
3,it is a movie where you can find something good in the film,it was a nice idea for a movie made in the early 1980s
3,rich men who are n't so well versed in the story are,rich characters that could have made a great deal of money
3,who is the target audience in the story,who was the real star of a film
3,even the actors that were in a theater were n't good at all,even though the film is n't a comedy it does drag a smile out
3,of course that 's not all it 's just a bit of a rip off of,of all the other films of this genre the one who made it so popular
3,thirdly this is n't a great movie,thirdly it 's a great movie
3,she has n't got enough money to have a career and her role is so bad that it,she is a very very attractive woman and is the only one that has to deal with
3,and if they were all that 's good i think you will probably see it,and if i had not watched it i would have been the biggest disappointment for a
3,all in the family was n't the most interesting and i would have to say i 've been,all in the background and that is all that matters to the movie and the movie ends
3,however there 's a lot in my life i ca all,however if they had to do it in the middle of the
3,i am not a fan like myself or so when i saw it in my own private idaho i was very impressed,i was n't sure who it was supposed to be but i was n't sure who was the intended audience in the movie
3,it is n't even close up,it 's not a film about a
3,how could you not get that feeling that he,how about that i would like that film
3,the film does n't work very hard at all,the plot is simple and predictable and it 's all
3,disney has a great idea about the film in general it has been said by the bbc to do,disney has made a film called 'the godfather which is based upon the book by david o 'donnell
3,the only problem is that the characters are too shallow and the plot just makes little or no effort to create a story about,the film has a few redeeming qualities that are quite good and i can understand how the film makers should have been able
3,but i have to admit that i enjoyed the story the characters and the story,but there 's a few things that are so far too obvious that i cannot say
3,were there any other people to watch this show,were it not that there 's an actual lack of
3,great film and i would love it to have been made for everyone who,great acting great directing great soundtrack good music score and overall excellent performances
3,the acting and story line of a movie is the best in the film,the first thing i noticed about this film is the music which is the best
3,as a matter it does n't have a whole plot to begin with and there really was nothing new to watch it,as a result of the fact that this movie is not as bad as the rest of her career it 's not a
3,but that 's the problem with the film,but it 's not the least of which is
3,then it 's a little too long,then i got a glimpse of it and
3,i was a little surprised by the fact that the director 's name of the film was a little disturbing and i think it was a mistake that the film had n't,i 've always loved the movie and i think the best one can be the worst and most overlooked films in this category but in fact the movie 's best asset
3,all of these actors were excellent in this movie,all of this is the reason why i give it
3,true love is a little too long but the film has the same feel,true it 's not a horror flick but rather a slasher thriller with plenty out
3,that 's the only reason i gave,that 's not a bad idea
3,loaded with great acting and the story is what you get,loaded by the fact of the plot of the story and the
3,it 's a movie that i really enjoy,it 's the worst movie ever made to make
3,this was one of the worst of the movie i 've seen,this movie is so bad that it 's almost unbearable to watch and
3,i have to say i was n't too impressed but,i think this movie is not a good movie
3,i would n't be the first person to be happy,i do n't think i 've been watching it
3,and there 's the occasional amount of nudity,and then there were some of the most ridiculous
3,but that 's not the only thing that 's really,but i do n't have much else to say
3,but this is an excellent movie that,but i do n't want it
3,there 's the obligatory scene between the girl and,there are several other examples of this film
3,by now i have to say it 's a movie that i could n't even get,by a couple of years the movie is set up in a very poor way
3,complicating the entire cast and crew in this movie are the two leads,complicating the film 's cast is a fine cast and a very interesting story
3,everyone in the movie was a complete wimp,everyone in her life and her family is the
3,teacher 's daughter and the police officer is not a bad film,teacher and daughter get involved and have sex on their own
3,the only problem was they did n't care much about the,the plot was very predictable but that 's the problem
3,joe don baker was excellent in the part of his wife and he has the best of,joe pesci is the only good thing he can get and the film is really good
3,a very good and interesting film,a good premise by a guy
3,i was surprised by his ability and the film did n't have a lot to,i am still trying too hard to find something to watch about this film
3,only if this is what it is supposed to be and,only if you like this movie i recommend the film
3,it is not a film to watch,it does n't really matter because there is
3,i am not a film historian or a fan i was very surprised at that time and was,i am glad i did n't have to sit down in the theater to watch it again
3,when it was released in 1993 it was a complete disappointment as an adult for all of its contemporaries but for,when i read about it and i knew it was an early movie it had been a bit too long
3,the first half hour and then is n't too bad but there 's a lot more wrong with the,the only real surprise is its lack of character development and that 's the main problem with it
3,horror movie is one of the few movies i can think about,horror film is n't as bad as the worst of any of the
3,i was very surprised to find it so,i 've seen a few of them
3,undoubtedly this could have been a much more interesting film,undoubtedly the most important thing to do is this movie
3,why did they make a movie with this,why do i have the opportunity to write this
3,that 's not to say that the movie was good at,that is what i think about it in this movie
3,although i was impressed to read this comment i was a little skeptical when,although the movie is about a young girl she was n't in it
3,but it 's just a good film,but it 's not all that bad
3,i was n't expecting a big hit,i would like that this film is available
3,in this film we learn that it is a great life and one that,in the end it is a very good film that should be enjoyed
3,nothing else to say about the plot is that there is,nothing else to watch the movie is just plain dull
3,i was surprised to find that this is not the best movie i 've watched it 's not that bad,i was n't sure whether i 'd missed something or just saw this film on the shelves for it
3,i saw this movie as i 've seen it several years ago and now i 've never read it,i was hoping i had to endure this movie to get out with it for a couple hours i was
3,i saw a trailer for this movie at the toronto video film festival,i would not recommend this movie to anyone unless one would like a movie
3,the film was shot on location,the script of course is a mess
3,costner is a fine character actor and his performance is so convincing that i was surprised,costner does a fine portrayal of his character and the acting is so bad that the actor
3,it is not a film about a young boy who is a teenager and is forced into being,it seems to me to have been written on a shoestring budget and is a complete failure
3,over the course he 's a bit more interesting than,over the years i have always found a copy
3,she does n't really care for her,she 's got to be the only character
3,to be honest i do n't know whether i should say the same,to the producers of the film i do not care about these characters
3,but i guess the filmmakers were n't really trying too hard with the movie itself,but if you want to watch a film of this nature of the life you will
3,a lot of the humor is very little in a movie,a great movie for everyone who loves music and dance
3,i would recommend this to those who are interested to the books and the ones who do n't know what to do in the first place or so you wo,i have never heard of a movie that made me cry but the real reason that this movie is not to give credit for the acting is the directing
3,joan crawford was excellent in the role she was in the first movie she was a,joan blondell 's performance of her sister 's career was the highlight of my childhood
3,from the opening credits to a few shots of the film the,from the beginning the film takes place in an isolated house
3,im not sure why it 's called it a bad movie or not,im a sucker for movies like the matrix the grudge and the grudge but
3,the plot is a simple one but there is no plot,the plot and acting are all pretty bad and the characters are
3,the only redeeming feature of this show were the sets,the first half of the movie has a little twist and
3,also the fact that it would n't be too expensive for the first half of the movie is not a very nice idea,also the scene with her in which she is confronted and the two men are a good way to convey her own inner feelings
3,i would have liked the movie more if it was n't,i would say that it is a very good movie
3,fbi agent is one of the best movies i have watched in years,fbi officers who are a huge and vicious group of people have not seen
3,they do not make it into the whole universe,they should n't have made it to the screen and
3,give the movie a chance to get a dvd,give it an even bigger rating and that will help
3,in the movie he is a good guy who wants to be the,in short this is a must see for fans of classic cinema
3,this is the only movie that can be made in which the actors seem,this is a good movie about a family that has lost all parents
3,but it 's a very enjoyable film,but it is not all bad
3,i saw that in the early 1980 's and was a huge hit,i was very pleasantly impressed with the acting of the young actors
3,while the acting is not as good the script is a complete mess,while there 's an extended scene involving some very funny scenes in the beginning
3,do we really want to get a,do n't worry about this movie
3,i 've seen many films that are worse than the one that is this,i 've been a fan of the works of the last three years
3,it 's a pity the writers did not go for that,it was so obvious and so unbelievable it 's impossible for anyone
3,investigator who is a cop of crime and a woman who has been in love with the woman is also a little more interesting than his own,investigator john gielgud has the same role of a middleaged drifter and he 's not really an actor who would have made the film even less believable and
3,but the movie does n't have much to offer the viewer is in,but the movie 's plot has been done better than most movies
3,why did n't he just leave the door and go,why is n't it a mystery or a movie
3,the film is a real bore to watch and a good one at that,the only thing that is n't clear is that the plot line is pretty thin
3,it 's the story of love and sacrifice and the relationship of love between a man with a heart and a heart,it is a movie about a man who has been killed and a woman in a small apartment with the wife
3,despite the fact that the film is set in the future it is not as bad as the first,despite a very bad script by michael moore the film fails as the worst piece of crap ever
3,worse than i expected it was in the movie,worse than i imagined this movie is a very funny
3,i saw the movie and the film 's faults was n't,i was surprised by the acting talent of this movie
3,he does not know the difference to his father and he is n't a child,he 's also a very strong character actor who is always a pleasure to look up
3,schepisi 's character is so stupid and he makes it difficult to relate to anything,schepisi is a talented director of this type and his films are very similar
3,he does a decent enough job but this one is so awful,he also wrote and starred at a time in which he is a
3,danny devito as a gay boy who was the best in this,danny glover as an american pilot was just perfect to watch
3,at least it was funny and i did like it,at this stage the film seems to have been shot on
3,do n't waste your time with it and you 'll regret,do n't let this fool us you 're a woman'
3,the movie has a good cast with some nice actors who are great and very funny to behold but they are,the only way the film 's production values to be able are its lack of focus from the original cast
3,just do not expect the most painful movie that i have ever heard,just like the other movies i 've seen in the past and now
3,the story is a little weak and the plot has an odd twist,the first time i saw this film i thought it had potential
3,and then you have to have a,and the ending is very abrupt
3,the plot line is a bit of a mess and it 's just,the only good things about this movie was some of the actors
3,it was a very moving movie and was n't bad,it is n't the only film you see as you will
3,the only real gripe i had was with my friend,the plot line is a bit weak but there is something
3,apparently this film is not worth a rental for those looking,apparently they are making the same film as the others
3,anyway the movie starts out as an,anyway it was an interesting idea
3,this movie is so bad it actually hurts the hell it 's good,this is a movie that 's not only a comedy and it also shows
3,i 've seen this movie several times and i 've never been a big big,i have to say that this is a very funny and very good movie
3,had the movie been made more and more of it 's characters the film might have been more entertaining in the end,had i not seen a film of the series before i 'd give the movie a chance it could have been a little
3,and the whole movie is about a bunch,and that was n't a bad move
3,the plot and plot are pretty lame,the script by the actors with the first
3,hank and her husband have a conversation in which the two men are reunited,hank is n't really the kind of guy who would make a movie
3,naturally it was the first time that they were released in a time that would n't have been released as a series of series,naturally it is a movie to make for kids and adults who want to see a film that has something you could watch at times
3,there were a number i thought about the characters the actors were the actors,there really is n't one line to work out for this movie it 's just
3,i do have some complaints for the film but i did enjoy it,i do n't remember much of the character 's motivation for the story but
3,he does n't know how things are supposed to be,he 's an actor who is n't in it
3,how many movies have they done so,how many times can you go wrong and
3,bondi and the stranger are a pair of actors who are,bondi was a very good actress and a good actress
3,as for that the plot and dialogue are all pretty good,as for the plot it 's a movie about a bunch of
3,thumbs down to the actors and crew of the movie they were all good,thumbs off from me for the next few years but not in the slightest bit
3,naraku is not a good movie,naraku was a great actor and was
3,stan and ollie were a good combination but not as bad as i expected,stan laurel and oliver had a lot of good things going it 's very funny
3,actually i have n't seen this show before,actually i would n't be able to erase it
3,sirk 's films made it a little more realistic to the viewers in the sense that the,sirk 's films were so bad that they could barely be regarded to be a masterpiece
3,the story line is very good and so is the ending,the film is a great deal for a family film
3,if you 're going a bit too hard to be the most intelligent movie in the genre it should be a lot better if you are a diehard hollywood fan of a movie,if you have n't seen them and you have seen the movie it 's a very enjoyable film that i would recommend it to anyone interested with good movies with a lot better than
3,other than being a little more interesting and more convincing i,other characters are introduced as the characters of the film
3,please if you like the book it will probably disappoint you,please if i could see the movie in the future i would
3,but that is not how it should,but it was n't that funny
3,the film 's story is very similar to the first film which had a good,the film is about a young man who has been living in the past
3,it 's an interesting and entertaining movie that 's really really good but it 's not as good,it has to get better when he gets a job in his head and his friends have to take
3,david lynch was in his element,david lynch who plays his wife was
3,i 've never heard of a man who is so beautiful and so sweet and so evil,i would say that i do agree that the first time i watched this movie was to the
3,while the story is n't a great film the acting is excellent,while i did n't see it coming in the same manner this was
3,like most of the other comments i 've seen this movie it 's a very poor excuse for such movies,like most of the others i have been watching the movie for the past few years but i do think that
3,but it 's just not worth watching if only because of,but it is still a good film and it shows
3,even though it 's not a masterpiece i can only think of a few people like the original movie,even though the ending does leave you cold with no doubt the ending is not the same way as in
3,they have the perfect combination to the plot which is n't really,they should n't be allowed by their superiors for that matter
3,there is nothing here that makes the movie interesting and the acting was great as well as a very realistic portrayal of the relationship of the,there is a scene where she and two of their men are on a train with a woman and her lover are having an orgasm
3,i 've always enjoyed this movie but i do agree that it was a bit too,i am a fan and i was n't surprised to see this movie in theaters
3,what a shame this movie was not made to look like,what is the difference between that and the next one
3,what i do understand was why this movie got made for tv,what is more disturbing is his performance in the scene of a man
3,you can see that he is a talented actor who has been a big,you could do worse if the plot had more holes than the movie
3,jarmusch 's film is a masterpiece of art and the best part is the scene with mr rochester the woman of the town,jarmusch is n't a director of either of his films and this one was no better than it was in his films
3,the plot was so bad it makes a good book even worse,the movie has an excellent soundtrack and it has some very good scenes
3,i saw the movie yesterday and was surprised that there was no real story,i have never seen a film like this in the entire world so vividly
3,actually there is some nice acting and the story is,actually it is just a bad film to get
3,the film is also a bit long and boring and the plot has been done so,the plot is simple and predictable and the characters are all shallow caricatures of characters
3,i 've seen a few bad films from this year and i have n't yet,i am not a fan and have seen a few films of this type
3,do n't let me tell you that the film was good,do n't worry that i did not have a movie in the
3,throw the two leads together and the film has an excellent cast and a nice story,throw the viewer out of your seat and throw them on their feet and they do n't
3,as the movie continues the story begins to develop as a flashback between the two,as far as tv go i have n't read a biography from this movie so it
3,he is a great character actor who is a good guy,he does n't want his own wife because he is the one
3,unexciting acting terrible script awful dialog and even worse editing this movie is n't even a comedy or horror flick but there,unexciting acting by this film and i ca ca only say this is one of the best movies i ever saw
3,i saw this movie on the sundance channel and found it very entertaining but the acting was n't good enough to save it,i would recommend it for any one who has seen an asian film with whom it can be compared in any way with the
3,still it 's an awful movie,still i was impressed by the fact
3,it was not a good film but it was n't,it would be a nice little to make the film a
3,the film is a very good documentary,the story line was a little too weak
3,much of the action takes away from a lot of the scenes,much like that in the movie i think it would take a little
3,at the time he 's trying to find a new girlfriend he 's been on a quest for him and has to do,at the beginning when a movie that i could n't stand was i had n't seen the original but it did n't
3,i do not understand why it is so good,i 've never seen a movie before but i did
3,instead we were treated with a very weak and unconvincing story,instead of a film about the holocaust we learn that this was
3,what 's a great deal of the film 's atmosphere and music,what i found interesting and i was watching it with the intent
3,a movie that i can recommend to anybody,a few people are just plain stupid
3,he is a man he is a real person who has been,he is the most powerful and powerful person in the film
3,tlj plays the character of the film,tlj is an excellent character actor
3,reynolds and his wife were so funny and had the perfect chemistry to be a great film,reynolds and his friends are in this movie and the film has no meaning whatsoever to me
3,not that he was n't that much of an actor either he was a good actor who,not the worst movie ever made i think this is the most overrated movie of 2008
3,but that is n't saying it,but it was also the last one
3,the first one was a little too slow for the first half hour,the film opens up with a couple of scenes of a man impaled around
3,the first time i was about 10 i was in tears and it is very clear that the movie was shot in a different way and i was n't impressed,the movie is about a woman who has sex with a woman and is forced to go out with a young man and get the girl to death and get her
3,why was the film so awful and boring,why the hell did i have to watch this
3,it was the first episode of this that made it all,it is very difficult in every respect of all involved
3,maybe it 's just a movie but it 's,maybe he should have stayed in a coma
3,very well directed by joseph smith and the director,very similar but that is a very positive thing
3,one of the most powerful moments in the history is when the film opens and closes into the camera and its impact,one thing i noticed was that the actors had a little bit to live up to and they were really great
3,i am glad he did n't go on for a few episodes of this series,i am so amazed that i wasted my money watching a movie with the same name
3,so what 's it that 's supposed to have been in the past,so what 's it that 's a little bit of the stuff
3,the story itself is quite thin and,the movie has an interesting premise
3,zac maltin is a good actor but he does not have much of an opportunity in his career but he,zac efron is a good actor who is a great talent to play with his character as a character
3,the film starts with a man who wants to kill his wife,the film was very interesting and the acting and cinematography was great the
3,so i guess they have no idea,so the story line of this movie is
3,but it 's just that bad,but the movie has a good premise
3,in the film they are both good friends who are both very good as are two,in the movie we were treated by the director of photography which is so obvious that it
3,laura linney is perfect in her role,laura linney is perfect as always
3,i do n't understand why the critics did so much of this film,i have been a fan of this show and am sure to enjoy it
3,but the rest of the movie is,but this is a great movie
3,the only reason for the failure is that it was n't a,the acting is so bad it made me want to vomit
3,i saw this when he was in a row,i have a feeling of deja vu that it 's
3,this was the last film i 've saw that i saw in my life,this is a very interesting story with excellent acting and an intelligent plot
3,they have to take the story out,they are all very funny and are n't
3,i was n't expecting a film from the director and this is the one,i saw him on television and i was very surprised with the fact that the
3,102 years of age it was still on the horizon at the time of the filming,102 minutes in length is a long long and boring mess of a movie i do
3,and if you like watching a movie about a young girl who 's,and it 's so bad that it is actually a bad thing
3,the only thing that kept me watching,the film is an utter disappointment
3,i'm not even sure why this movie was,i'm a big fan of his work
3,it 's also the best movie i 've seen in ages but i think it would be more fun,it is one sided and the film is not a complete success but it 's a good movie
3,also the fact is there 's a lot to like in,also a lot of the film is n't as good
3,it has a lot of funny and funny scenes with some,it was n't funny but it is n't as bad
3,for example there 's no real explanation to the story,for example the entire movie takes you on the journey between
3,i have seen this many years ago and i,i do n't understand how it was done
3,on the whole i liked this movie as an extra in,on this note i am very impressed with this show
3,this is a great story about a young girl named becky,this movie was made on the sundance movie channel of july 2001
3,luckily the movie is so bad it hurts it 's intelligence and makes it a must see movie,luckily the film 's biggest asset was the fact the movie was made in the wake with the big
3,anyway i would recommend watching this to,anyway the movie is pretty bad
3,he plays an annoying and stupid guy who is constantly bullied by the police to take a job in the next,he 's also a great actor but the movie does not seem like he 's going out to the role
3,i do not recommend this movie to everyone,i think that was what this movie had to
3,the acting is horrible and there is some pretty decent gore sequences but overall this film is very well done by all,the film has a great cast and a great cast and the acting is fine the actors and crew are very well cast
3,the script is full of holes in the end which are all very disappointing and,the plot is simple enough to keep you on your way up the drain
3,do n't waste your life on your vcr,do n't get me wrong i love horror movies
3,a great cast and a solid script but not the best film of 2001 the acting and the acting was so good i was surprised,a few days ago i watched this film on a flight from the library and had it on dvd it was n't so great
3,i do n't know why the film would have been so much better in my opinion but it would be better if there were a better plot twist,i would like for a few laughs and the acting and the plot is a bit over the top but still very funny at times but overall i think
3,the movie has a few laughs but the plot is n't that interesting and the ending is just as stupid and the ending of an ending to,the script for this movie makes you think about the way the movie ended and the ending is pretty good and i really liked the film
3,that 's what i would like to see,that is not to say that this show has
3,tomei was a bit more than a year in her life as i said before she did it in the beginning of the movie she 's,tomei plays a young man who is trying hard and a little girl in the process of a good life who is a young boy
3,i have seen better films with my money,i do n't know why the film makers insist
3,what makes this film a must have in all respects was that it took a lot of time to figure out why the film was,what we get a real sense that it is a movie that is very hard on the face with the exception of the actors
3,of all this i would n't recommend it to anyone interested at all,of course the film has a good cast and the script is very good
3,in the end it is the only reason i can think that the director should have,in fact the whole thing seemed to be the only one i did n't enjoy
3,movie starts off with a young woman trying desperately to get rid of the girl,movie makers should try to make this into something different and they 're not
3,even the acting is poor as well,even with the title of a book this
3,sunset boulevard and the rest were all very good for a,sunset li is the perfect choice to make this movie
3,people in general should have been able,people who love this type should n't watch
3,at first i was n't sure if the film would end with a better ending but it was not,at one particular time the camera pans off the stage and the scene shows a lot of people being slaughtered
3,in a nutshell the movie 's main theme,in fact he did a wonderful job
3,the film is a bit of a mess but it is,the only saving grace here was the cast of unknowns
3,i was expecting the most predictable movie ever since,i have never seen a more beautiful film
3,there were two scenes and i would say the movie,there really are many scenes that have no relevance
3,funeral has some kind of atmosphere in it but,funeral in the sky has nothing to offer
3,i saw this film when i was 13 years later and it really has to be,i do n't know why the producers of it are the target for this film
3,striving to be a little less than a little less interesting it 's very difficult to find a movie that 's really bad it 's just,striving to find a way for the audience to be the hero of the film and the viewer will not care much about his other
3,america is a film that i will never get to know the people of denmark and i have been trying too,america has a great time in this film and it will be very well worth the time to watch it
3,the movie is about how people are going to get together the same way,the plot is a bit confusing but the story and characters are all excellent
3,along with the usual gore scenes this movie is a complete disappointment for those who like to watch films that have not,along with the fact that the story was n't so bad you could have had a better movie but i did
3,i do not think that this is the best film i have ever had the pleasure,i have been in a mental health of this kind since a very rare life
3,the script of the film was very good and i did n't care about any of what happened to them or if this was just a bad movie but that 's ok,the film is a little more of an interesting film than a thriller but as a film it 's a good thing for me that i will give it 7 stars
3,all i know is that it does n't even try too hard to capture,all in the background the most beautiful and haunting movie of all times
3,i 've read the other comment about it,i think the film 's biggest flaw is the
3,and it 's a nice little mystery,and i 've been looking forward to a
3,this is not a great film it 's a very good,this movie is a must for fans of horror films
3,engaging but not a little contrived to watch,engaging characters and characters who are very good in
3,downside the first thing the producers said was that the film was made to be a movie of a low budget and it should n't just get the funding,downside i ca all about that i have never heard about that i have seen the film in my lifetime but it has a great sense of humor
3,unfortunately i was expecting to get my money back,unfortunately the film is too short with the plot of
3,i'm surprised that the movie was made and released by the same studio for the first,i'm a sucker of horror movies and this one is definitely one of the worst
3,but there really is n't too long for it as they were not the same as many of,but the real problem with the movie is the script it is n't that much more interesting
3,even the worst of the series is the way that this is the first,even the worst of the series is the same thing as it was
3,it 's a movie about the life that it is about and,it is n't even worth mentioning it 's a good thing
3,so if you want to see something good to see this movie you should check it off,so many people have commented on this movie and the movie just does n't work as a film
3,overall i do n't understand why this movie has so bad votes,overall it 's a pretty good film but it just did n't work
3,my advice is to watch the movie and get a copy,my only complaint with this was that it was n't even a
3,though he does n't seem like the actors he has been the most decorated he is a bit eccentric and,though it has a few funny parts i think that is a shame because i do n't understand why
3,this show was one thing to do and i think the show was canceled,this movie is a waste of time and money i 've never spent on it
3,there 's also a lot to talk with,there is nothing here with a plot to speak
3,perhaps it was a case that was a,perhaps this is a very poor movie
3,maybe they could 've made a better movie,maybe it should be the end of the film
3,currently this was the only movie in my life,currently the film is a complete bore but there are
3,simple and funny but the acting is great,simple to say that but i did n't really
3,this is a good little movie,this is a great movie and one
3,but this is n't a bad show,but i did enjoy the movie
3,they do not seem like the people of the planet and the story is so stupid,they 're the only ones who can make this movie so good it is good
3,aided by a great score by david thewlis who plays the main character 's role,aided by the excellent performance of robert ryan this is a very well done film
3,spielberg 's films are more of a comedy than this,spielberg was in his forties and the director of this movie
3,another problem is how the movie was made,another problem is that the story is too predictable
3,first of course this is a movie that is about the same kind one thing is,first off i'm pretty much an idiot who does this sort about this movie and the whole
3,it 's a pity that the movie has n't received a cult following in my book,it 's all very easy to follow and the plot is n't even original enough
3,the plot is pretty simple and is n't a big deal in my book,the acting in this movie is horrible except for some of these people
3,actually it 's a great movie,actually i did not enjoy the film
3,i saw the film on tv as part of a marathon and was blown through,i have been a little disappointed and that the only reason to be this movie is
3,the film is a good example,the plot is n't that bad and
3,the only redeeming feature of that movie is its unintentional humor and is the funniest thing you have ever,the acting is superb with cusack as the main villain a young man who is in a wheelchair
3,jimmy fallon was good too but his,jimmy durante is a great actor
3,so why was she able to keep the clothes off of her,so why would the green skull allow this to be a bomb in
3,the movie is a great movie for a family,the movie was a total waste of time
3,the first part of it was a bit slow,the plot of this story was very weak
3,it is a great show and you,it 's a pretty bad movie
3,maybe it would be the same if the writers had n't done it properly,maybe the movie was shot in a different location and in the process
3,it 's not a comedy and it,it 's all about the family
3,there 's a very good performance by the main,there are no redeeming qualities in this movie
3,until the last 20 minutes of the picture it is just an hour long and long drawnout and dull denouement,until the last twenty seconds or so it 's just a little too long and it does n't matter if there
3,problem is the ending is a bit of an insult but i think it 's a real treat for,problem be told this is a great film and i have seen some very bad ones on it
3,and there has been so much that can still remain on the show 's own merits,and what 's the purpose in this movie it has the feel good things a bad movie
3,however in one instance the film is shot in a way and the story takes us,however this is a film to watch and i can watch it over and over
3,the movie 's plot has a few twists to it but it is not a complete waste of time and time to watch it,the film opens in the early 90s with the young woman and the daughter who are being chased by a woman by her daughter
3,the acting is n't bad either,the only thing good about it was
3,why does he make the whole thing even worse and he gets a little too far,why would they have made a movie that is n't so funny in the extreme but to
3,you 'll get a feeling of how,you will probably never forget it
3,also there are a couple scenes where a little girl is supposed to be dead and her boyfriend is not,also in a film of the genre that 's a little bit more exciting the story is quite good
3,the film has a very simple feel to it,the script is a bit weak but it 's not
3,who could possibly forget the fact he was supposed to get a bit,who cares about the real estate and how the two boys are
3,hmmm it is a little bit slow for the viewer,hmmm i know this movie will suck out for people who
3,the first film was a good movie but the acting was terrible and the direction by eric mabius was horrible,the only reason i watched it till was the acting and the directing and script i was impressed and could care
3,the acting is terrible but it 's a bit of a surprise to watch,the film 's climax is a bit jarring but the movie is so much fun
3,or the other way that this guy is going to die or be killed,or why do i have to go see that it 's only because it 's
3,we are told to love him,we are given a glimpse into the
3,raymond is an expert from a small village town that goes on a road trip to the south pacific,raymond burr is great in the role of a young man who 's been assigned by the devil and his
3,as i was n't the most ardent of a woman i found her performance as a character,as a result of the movie i was looking into a very different type of movie
3,what is more interesting is that he 's given an opportunity to be so funny and so much to be able of the character to get into the story as well,what we have here is an engrossing and thoughtprovoking drama that makes you feel that you 'll love it as much as you would but i would love it as soon
3,all in all not worth your time,all in this film is a very well
3,still i do enjoy the movie as it 's a great movie and if it 's true it 's,still i could n't believe how the movie managed to make me feel the need for the actors
3,the film is not about a young man being a man he is a loner,the film has an enormous number of problems with a film that has a little more
3,glad he 's a good actor,glad it is n't so bad it
3,anyway i do not think this was a movie,anyway it 's a movie that 's not even worth
3,in addition it 's a great movie for everyone who enjoys the music of the music,in the end the characters do not really know what they should or the plot
3,somehow the movie is just as funny and funny as most,somehow i thought it was a great movie to see
3,but it 's so bad it 's good it is awful,but if they were the best way to get it they were
3,the movie starts off ok with a few funny moments and some pretty funny,the first time i watched this i had no luck in watching it
3,sister and daughter and her sister who 's been sent in to a remote mansion where the family is being held up for adoption by their friends,sister betty is a great character and the acting was perfect but she was n't a bad movie she was good and i did not think she was
3,i saw this movie when my girlfriend and her,i think that is where the movie fails
3,she has the right kind of luck and that 's why i,she 's also the one who gets killed in the beginning
3,sadly the plot has been done before and in several episodes of the show,sadly the film is a bit long after the movie is released and there are
3,the script was very weak and the script was so lame that it was hard to care,the plot is a lot more exciting and the actors are great and you have a great story
3,the script is so full that i thought the acting was terrible at best but it 's the script that makes,the story line is about a group of kids that are sent off to a small party in new jersey
3,sorry to say i am a fan of the original but i was,sorry the film is so bad and the crummy dialogue is laughable
3,yes the film was shot in the seventies and it was shot on dv and,yes he 's an old guy but he has some problems with his wife
3,i do n't know how i can get to this film because it 's a film,i would n't say it was a bad film but the actors are all good
3,frhling auf dem eis the godfather of elm street is an example,frhling the question of whether it was the movie 's or the actors
3,bitten by the devil and the monster,bitten and then by a couple 's end
3,thats the problem in most of the films,thats what i thought about this film
3,it has some funny moments but they all do n't even,it was a great show and the acting was great
3,sad to say the ending is the worst part of this entire film it is the most annoying movie i 've ever,sad to note that the acting is a bit uneven but i have to say that the story is not bad
3,well the plot was n't that interesting as the movie did but the,well that is the only reason why you 'll want my kids
3,looking at the film for the first time is a complete mess,looking at him and having an abortion and a child in the middle
3,mason plays a young man and is,mason was one of my favorites
3,only a minor gripe is that this was a great movie,only to have to rely more solely on a specific relationship with
3,this is a very entertaining movie and it 's worth the,this is a great movie for a lot of people
3,the story of the kelly gang' was great,the only redeeming feature of the movie was the
3,the acting and directing were good,the only thing that makes this film
3,once in a while you 'll see it all,once again i do n't want to give you the
3,the film is very interesting in its own right and not as funny as some of the films that it is,the plot is a mess of the imagination and is not really a horror film in which its characters have developed a
3,and i do not think that the director is trying to convey the depth,and the fact is the film is a little too long for it
3,this is a very bad movie and the worst,this movie is a must watch to see
3,sounds great but the movie is not very good,sounds like they 're reading a cue for it and
3,there is no real plot or character development in fact it was a little too slow to keep things moving,there is a scene in which she has the power to take over the top of all the people in this
3,but the film is also the best and,but it was also a great movie
3,from what i 've seen in this movie the actors in the movie seem to be in,from this time on all the other characters in this movie are very different and different
3,chris kattan was a bit of an improvement in this film but his performance in this movie was so bad that it was hard for him,chris farley has a small but small role as a man who has been on to a new low class and his wife has been dating him
3,there is no story and no plot no,there are so bad movies out there
3,other times i have a soft tolerance for my own personal favorite,other than that it would probably be an improvement at the oscars of
3,personally the film did n't seem very good for the time period in which it was made,personally it 's a great film for the ages but i am not afraid to see it
3,if i could make a movie i would not have seen this movie in a long time and it would have made a difference between,if there ever was one i would like all of the people who made the movie to the big screen in the first place
3,the film was made for the sole purpose as well as an excellent soundtrack but it 's the most memorable aspect of all,the story is about a young girl who is trying her job with the job she is experiencing to a younger man
3,i have never seen a film actively avoiding such a good time and it 's not that the director of the,i would have liked to have been a fan but this film is just too dull to be a comedy
3,love to me is a great movie,love story is the story to a point
3,some of it is a little weak for the time but it was a good film,some of the scenes where he is trying to make a statement in a scene are not
3,i 've heard that i have seen a few films but,i was so surprised that it made me so angry
3,i have to say though that the acting is good,i was a little skeptical of the whole enterprise
3,the story is about three guys who go on the run to find their way to an isolated,the movie is about a group that is in love but the two men have been married
3,graham greene was a genius but he 's not the right choice,graham freeman is a very talented actor and i have to say i
3,shannon tweed has a few good oneliners but,shannon tweed is great in this movie
3,the acting by a group of actors is,the acting was pretty bad as well
3,there is no need for the film 's to be,there was a lot to like in this movie
3,some people think that the story is a little,some of the characters and characters were underdeveloped
3,a film that i could n't help to sit back with a few minutes to watch and i felt i could not have cared more,a lot of the movie is about as funny and interesting as the rest of the film and the characters are just a bit too old
3,what we have here is a very,what was the point in that
3,sadly it was a little over the top and not funny,sadly the story does n't have to take place at the same
3,the story line was very good,the story is not a very good
3,they 're all so annoying they do n't really have the,they have a very good script and a nice concept
3,they should have done more of this,they are just a couple of the things
3,i think it was the worst film,i am glad that he does
3,there 's an odd reason for me this movie is so awful i do it that i could never have had a refund,there 's a lot more to this than a lot more than the usual suspects the movie has a nice story good actors and
3,he 's just plain bad and it 's not even the worst movie ever made,he also has a great sense of humor and a great performance by the young chloe
3,such an amazing talent in this movie,such a pity as to be expected but
3,even the usually reliable judi dench and her grounded performance are a hoot,even the most ardent of the film is not in the film
3,if you are a diehard collector of the horror genre this is the one for you,if the movie did n't get the proper idea this film would be a waste and a
3,the film is a very interesting experience of the nature of the holocaust and the struggle between,the only thing this show has going for it in the end are the great actors
3,maybe i could just sit back and let my friends see it,maybe i 'll never be able to watch it in the next film
3,if you like a film that is just a bit more than just plain bad,if the script was not a bad idea the film was n't even worth the time
3,i was expecting a lot more about this film but i was expecting a little,i have never been able to find a film which could have been better
3,eddie murphy was a very good choice for the role of the president of this movie and it was his duty,eddie is a very good actor he has a knack to be in the role and he has the chance
3,he 's the perfect man and he was,he was not only a little boy
3,the plot is a bit farfetched but the acting,the acting was horrible the plot is nonexistent
3,now the movie is a total waste over fifty minutes,now it 's all that you do n't know
3,her role as the mother of this is quite intriguing and the,her role was not very good as she should have been
3,they 're just a lot better in fact,they have no problem solving the case
3,alicia silverstone is also good as the main heroine,alicia 's character does n't get a clue of why
3,what i got out of it is a film with a lot,what 's with the character of the dead girl 's daughter
3,the movie is n't a good idea but in the case of the story and the script it 's,the script and acting are very poor and the actors are all bad and the plot is ridiculous
3,wow the only real thing i can think is to say that this movie was a total flop for me,wow if you are n't expecting it to be a classic horror movie you 'll probably enjoy the film but you
3,it 's just a little bit of an insult,it does make no sense it 's not the kind
3,i was so bored by this movie so fast that there were so much better funded movies out,i do agree with the other user that the acting of the lead actor and the other actors is
3,if you are looking for a fun horror movie you should see this one if only because it is a good movie,if there is any reason why the film is so funny and the other is in the film the director 's commentary on
3,either the director or whatever you 're supposed the feeling the movie,either way the film has a very nice and gritty feel
3,meanwhile a couple of kids are invited to work on a remote boat in a remote area of the woods,meanwhile the film takes place in an abandoned hotel with two people in their place who 's been waiting for them
3,kate hudson as the lead actress was a joy,kate beckinsale and john malkovich are great actors
3,yell at a young man who is supposed to look,yell and not that i did n't know it
3,it 's all very predictable in its presentation but the acting is so bad that,it 's a shame because this movie was a waste of film and time
3,clearly there is a lot going for it but i have to say i,clearly the movie is n't worth the money to spend on renting this
3,this is not the case with the movie,this movie is a great deal to watch and
3,i 've never seen such a beautiful woman in,i think the movie has some redeeming features
3,the movie is a very boring attempt at trying a feat,the story of the movie and it follows the lives of a
3,but it 's not even worth a watch for those looking for something that does n't even come close enough,but it 's not the worst film i can think that there should never be more than just a handful
3,no one is really going anywhere and the characters are just as interesting as the other two,no doubt i 've never laughed so hard since i first heard of this show and the film
3,i saw this on a flight through the us on the other hand,i would n't want my money or something to make a movie
3,still i ca n't help but wonder why the,still it 's a fun movie to watch
3,the story of the film is a very interesting one but not enough to make it a good movie especially when it,the plot line was a bit weak but the film was n't that great at all but the acting was ok
3,meanwhile the man is a very good man who can be trusted and he is able for revenge,meanwhile the two men are the one responsible for the murder of a young girl named lena
3,i 've always been a sucker for a movie to get a grip on what it 's like to be with someone who 's,i 've been waiting in my home for years to see it again but i was so impressed when it was on tv
3,there 's no way that you could have predicted that this was n't the worst movie in the history of cinema but i was n't so disappointed when it,there were some great shots and some of the most memorable scenes i 've seen in a sitcom but that did happen and it had no real story
3,somerset is a good guy who can act but i think he is not the only actor,somerset sinatra plays the young woman who has been living in her life in the states
3,i was surprised by the fact that i was watching it,i would n't even recommend a classic horror movie but i think
3,im not saying that the movie is n't funny but it 's funny,im sure that i am watching an episode where the show started out in
3,it 's a very bad movie to begin with,it is a shame they did not show the whole
3,the plot and characters are so weak that i ca all about how bad the writing is,the plot is about an armored detective who wants a woman that 's been dumped on a bus
3,mother was a very young man to,mother is a very nice film
3,if you have n't been a fan you will have a good laugh,if you 're interested in watching the film you should probably check out the
3,almost as bad a film of the title,almost every scene is a dream sequence
3,also it 's not as though she was the first film in her career,also if the viewer is watching it a lot of the time we 're left
3,greta nachle has a great cast and a good cast including the always,greta tippel has a good cast as the main villain of all
3,technically it was pretty much one to be taken seriously and i could not get,technically a film that is worth watching and will definitely be a good example
3,i do n't think that this movie could have been made for children with a pg13 rating of 8 but the movie is a perfect example of how bad it is,i 've always had a great reaction to him but i never felt so sorry for him when i saw this movie and i did n't even notice his name
3,the plot and the characters are not that compelling,the only thing that kept this movie from me is
3,did you see this in theaters at,did he ever have a chance
3,and the fact is that he was just a bad actor who would never have been a hero,and the ending of the story was so predictable you could feel it was too long and there were
3,who cares if he does n't want to take a job to make a big mistake,who could forget the fact i saw a film that had a lot of potential to do
3,i am surprised to see how much of this film is based on,i was really bored about it but i was very pleasantly entertained
3,the film was n't very good but it 's not very good either and it 's just not worth it,the movie is so bad that it makes you feel like you wasted a time in a theater where it 's
3,they should have had some more of the characters,they have to deal and get away and they can
3,if this is a good film it might be good and fun to see,if you 've got a chance with a film about how bad a movie is
3,in this one they are the main villains of both men who are,in fact i have never seen any other actor like john rhysdavies
3,the acting by both leads is great,the acting was so bad i could not
3,and there is one thing the entire film is a very boring movie but not as good as,and i 've seen a few bad films in my life but this one is just awful
3,i have seen the original version of this version,i would n't want to waste any more
3,this one was a big disappointment for me,this is the type i 've ever seen
3,it 's a movie about an aging,it 's a very interesting movie
3,being the main character in his book is the same,being an avid movie buff i am a huge horror buff
3,the acting was so bad that you actually feel embarrassed that the,the acting ranges the worst of these films in my opinion
3,i think it 's a great idea to have a film which has been produced by the original film and is n't that good either but as it stands the movie has a very interesting,i would n't want the ending to be too bad to spoil but i have a few friends in the family who have the audacity of watching it and i really enjoyed the movie
3,so if you are interested in the subject of this film,so why did he just get to make a film
3,i was very disappointed with the film at first,i would have to disagree that this movie was made
3,joey jacobi is a fine actor and he has a very good performance,joey and the other characters were so cute and the story was interesting
3,i have to give it a 1,i would not recommend this movie
3,here the film is very well made and there is a nice balance between the two,here he has a few laughs and the movie moves slowly to a point where it feels
3,even though the movie was a bit of a bore the ending was a little too long for a horror flick,even the most ardent fan base of all the above average movies like me and the others have to wonder
3,some people have commented on this site that there 's absolutely nothing wrong,some of it 's humor in this one was not a good idea
3,the script is so full that i have to admit that it does n't really have,the film has many faults and is the funniest of the lot to the genre
3,then i have a headache and i have to say the movie was good,then there 's that guy who has his own problems and his girlfriend
3,the film is about the power and the need,the film was a lot of the time
3,his wife is a man and he is not a father who is attracted with his own daughter and son and is the best man on the island,his performance is not only bad it makes him look like the most annoying idiot i 've ever had to endure and it is his acting which is so
3,the plot is very thin and there is a lot more to the,the acting is pretty good and the script is a little slow
3,im sure you 're a fan but this is not the case,im sure i had to watch a movie to see what is happening
3,he also gets his head kicked into a brick and he 's a victim with a very different approach,he does n't know how to get his teeth out and he decides to take the body off
3,i do think that this movie was one of my favorite movies,i 've seen it a dozen years before and have never heard of
3,what makes it so great and what it was is that it 's the kind of thing you should n't be watching,what a shame that i have not watched anything in the past i have ever heard about the plot and plot
3,those two are just so bad they could n't be funny,those who enjoy the film and have never seen the other two
3,set in the late '60 another of the three cities in a small village of the year,set around los angeles a film centered around a group of college friends who find love
3,this is a good example for the film as well as the acting,this movie should have stayed away as a warning and it 's not even
3,it 's a shame that it was not released theatrically in theaters,it is very well worth your attention and the only good part in
3,the story is so simple and so implausible that you just do n't want your characters to get to them,the acting was good but i felt the film was just horrible as it was the script and direction
3,or even in the end it is a little bit more fun to watch than the rest of,or the fact it 's so ridiculous is n't it the best it 's in the movie
3,so why is the doctor so obsessed with,so i was n't really sure why
3,but i ca n't help but laugh at the movie,but it 's not the only other movie i 've seen
3,they were the most talented in hollywood films of all their collaborations but they do a good,they are all in the movie as if they were trying to get a new version
3,vampires are the best of all of course,vampires are not bad and there are some very
3,i think they are the only good thing about this movie,i do n't know why this one did so well i guess
3,the film is very well made,the story is about love and death
3,when i first heard about this movie i thought that the acting was great,when the movie ended i saw the trailer the trailer was a bit too long
3,released on video and dvd and it 's still a shame that,released by the critics i thought this film was very good
3,i would have given this show zero more,i would n't be surprised if the story had
3,retribution is that the movie is a bit of,retribution is that the film is a comedy
3,he is the first of the three and has,he has a small role in this movie
3,if i could get the tape back then i would have to give up,if i were to rate this movie an 8 i would have to rate it
3,it 's all so good that you do n't care about the story,it 's the worst thing of the movie i have never seen it since
3,if i were n't so engrossed i would have to be a part of the plot,if you can see it in the movie theater and do n't want it go rent the
3,the only thing is the fact that this is not the first,the acting by the whole ensemble of characters is not bad
3,then he goes to the police to get the money,then you have an excellent movie and a good one
3,the plot is so stupid the plot just so ridiculous,the plot is pretty simple and the ending is pretty bad
3,my only question was that it has been,my rating for this film is 810
3,if they were all a little sceptical they 'd be able,if you are a big fan you can appreciate it
3,as a result of the events they did they had a lot of time in common with the first movie,as i recall a couple that were supposed to be a part of this was the way they got their jobs
3,trying it to be an american movie in the vein,trying hard to be a comedy is not a problem but
3,tom is an american living in france but he does it with his own life,tom and matt were just a few years old and this film is a total waste
3,up until that point i was very impressed and did,up until then this is a movie to watch
3,so many times it becomes clear that it is n't the,so many people say that the film has an appeal
3,it 's a pity it never got a,it 's like it is a joke
3,the movie also has one of those endings that you 'll enjoy,the script is very well written and the characters are believable
3,in fact i would recommend this film,in fact i would n't even bother seeing
3,meryl welles plays a very likable role in his career and i would n't have given him a much better movie,meryl streep plays a character in this movie and is not the only one who is in his role as she is
3,honestly i do not understand why the people here are trying to make something so stupid,honestly there 's a lot more to it than the average horror movie and a lot to
3,because there is no explanation for the characters to have their motivations of their,because the film is so good and so funny that it is funny
3,there is a very strong plot line to the film,there are several great performances by both men who are not
3,i was very impressed with the movie,i saw it at the london film fest
3,for those of you who are a fan of musicals with some of,for those who love the genre this movie will appeal for you
3,fans who like this movie should watch it and find a good deal,fans of italian films will recognize this film to the very end
3,i 've always liked the fact that a lot was the,i 've seen this film numerous times before the release
3,in my opinion a great movie,in the beginning he 's trying to
3,upon arrival they become romantically obsessed and the movie turns up,upon reading the book i decided to read some reviews of this
3,i was a bit surprised to see a movie with such a great actor and i hope the director will give the movie a chance but that 's,i was n't impressed with the film as a fan but i still do not think that the story was any better than that of the original
3,while this is one that has no place to say in the end it just is n't enough,while it has a great story it has some flaws but it lacks any real depth or atmosphere
3,the movie was made in the 80 second series and was a good movie,the acting of the lead character was good but not the most convincing
3,she was the one that showed her in real life,she does n't seem to want to be a part of
3,they are all just a bunch of idiots and,they are all pretty much all good actors
3,so the idea is simple but the film 's script is n't too bad for a,so many of the other comments about this movie have made me feel that way
3,this is not a movie for everyone and for a few reasons,this was the first feature length i 've had for the long time
3,after seeing the trailer it was a very good movie with great production,after a while it was a great idea for a horror movie
3,they were not afraid of a lot of time but,they are not even as big as they were
3,were there no more than one hundred million dollars,were you watching this film over the weekend
3,i do n't know whether to give it a 10,i saw the trailer for the movie on tv
3,on the plus side the acting was excellent and i found myself wishing that a character would die at the beginning,on a scale of one to ten 0 the acting was terrible but the acting was so bad it makes me want
3,english speaking in the us in which he is the one with all of the other speaking characters,english cinema is a film about a very young man trying to get to a life and his relationship
3,i was n't really surprised that i saw this,i think that i should n't be surprised
3,the story itself was very poor,the acting was bad the script is
3,the story of the movie was a little over the top,the plot was so predictable the whole movie just seemed to be
3,van heflin as the head and his wife is a bit of a stretch,van peebles was n't even nominated for his oscar for best actor and he 's
3,the film was made in 1993 and in a few days it shows us that the film is,the first time i heard about it the film did n't seem to be a complete waste
3,the plot is about the only person who gets involved,the movie also shows how the characters are portrayed in the
3,if you 're looking for something good or interesting this is for my consideration,if this was n't a movie for kids who think that it is a bad
3,the movie 's only drawback to the film is its plot,the plot is so stupid and ridiculous that the film becomes unwatchable
3,hopefully i will never see it again,hopefully it will end with a better story
3,ever since i first viewed the film in the 80 's and i have been looking forward to seeing a good deal of movies,ever since i saw this in a theater i decided that i would like it to be a little more than a waste
3,being the most ardent fan of the movie the story was very weak but the story was good,being a great movie buff and a good movie this does it for the sake of being a fan
3,daddy 's son has to deal to save his brother from getting rid of his family 's life,daddy 's son is a very funny little boy who is not in his own league as the father
3,but i think the film is worth watching,but this is a very good show
3,while it was not the most popular film i have seen in a,while he 's been in prison he is a very good actor
3,joan crawford is the only one in a long line,joan blondell is the best actress of the movie
3,despite being an excellent film for the first half of,despite its faults it is still very well acted
3,you will probably be laughing hard to find this,you 'll be in a state of shock
3,unfortunately i 've just seen the movie,unfortunately the director did n't know that he
3,seymour jones is perfect but the movie does a great disservice to,seymour cassel is a revelation in the movie as an actress
3,this movie is a must see,this is a movie for kids who
3,however i still prefer the ending which was really good but i could n't help but wonder what is,however the movie was not bad enough to be a movie that the average director could have done
3,and i did not even have any expectations at all,and there are so many ways to describe it
3,so if you have n't seen it please,so the plot line is just too ridiculous and
3,it 's like a bunch of people trying to,it 's a very good movie to see
3,maybe he was just trying for an oscar for a paycheck,maybe that was a very good idea for a movie
3,lena 's character is the same as she was in this one and i thought,lena is a very talented actor who is very believable in acting and acting
3,i would have rated this movie a 2 but i think it 's the worst of all of them all the way through,i do agree with the other reviewers that this is a film of a film and its message on the viewer and how the
3,now i know what to make of a show but it 's still a lot of funny,now i have to say that i 've watched the film twice before i watched it
3,eddie and emma were in the same place as,eddie is the only person in a family
3,his performance has been a great part in the movie and his career,his character is a bit underdeveloped and the acting in the film is very
3,as for the ending the only real,as for the acting and editing
3,the film is a complete misfire but i would like it to see it again,the acting was horrible as well as a couple of bad guys who were very well
3,there was n't much of the dialogue but it 's,there 's a lot of action in the movie
3,weaver 's performance is very well written,weaver 's character is so beautiful and the
3,the acting is good the directing was bad the directing is worse the,the only thing that makes it a bit of fun to watch
3,you can tell it 's a good movie if you do n't,you will find a new meaning that you may have seen
3,it 's a movie that is n't afraid for a,it was a great story but it was n't
3,the acting the direction is very good,the film does have a few good moments
3,in my opinion this movie was a great deal,in my view the only thing missing is the ending
3,i would n't be surprised by the fact it would appear like a good idea for a,i was n't sure why i did the whole thing for me but it is n't
3,we are shown that the main character is a real human and we see him as an actor who can be so much,we 're not supposed as to be objective of what we are seeing but a little bit too long in the middle
3,it is not a film that has been a major success,it 's a pity because i was a little irritated at times
3,christopher mcdonald is a wonderful character but i have to,christopher plummer is perfect as the villain 's sidekick
3,to make matters even more complicated is a little confusing,to be fair i'm not sure how this is possible but
3,the story is a little thin and predictable,the script is so full of holes that it
3,the only reason this movie is so fun to watch is that it 's so funny,the only reason this film was so bad is the fact that the movie is supposed at
3,the only redeeming factor i have to give it a 1 is how i,the only good part about this movie is the soundtrack and the soundtrack
3,i do n't understand why it was released theatrically and why not,i would say it 's a very entertaining and interesting film
3,daniel craig is an actor who does n't get to,daniel daylewis has a lot of screen screen time
3,having seen this show several years ago i am very impressed,having said that i did not care for the characters
3,they were both very funny and i loved that one of,they should be doing a better job on the script
3,i have seen many of the films and this one was so bad you could n't help but smile,i saw it at the san francisco film festival and it was a good film that i enjoyed the movie
3,i am amazed that they have n't made a sequel so popular in my mind for a,i was so disappointed to learn it was n't so bad as i was renting it
3,while this has some good points to it the film is very good,while the film is quite good the acting is not good either as well
3,this is a good movie to watch for a good family,this is what i would call in the hands of a young
3,i saw this movie yesterday and after seeing the trailer i was expecting a little more,i 've seen a couple of other films but this one is not as bad and that
3,his performance in the first movie and his first movie is pretty much the same but this one is n't one,his performance was not very convincing as his performance was n't as bad and the supporting role was pretty bland
3,each scene of his life is a complete loss to anyone with a passion that,each character is so real as the main villain that we root for them
3,val neeson is excellent but he is n't convincing,val kilmer is great as his longsuffering partner
3,you will be amazed by the movie and its message,you can tell the story is a good thing
3,ken maynard has a very good voice,ken maynard is a fine director who has
3,he does a great job of showing how he 's going to make a great movie,he is a little bit too old for his role and it 's his duty that his
3,this is not one of them but that 's what the story is,this film is a waste of time and money to watch it
3,when i first heard of this movie i had seen it and was very impressed by the acting,when he finally finds out about a woman she is forced to marry her and her mother and her
3,so much of it 's time was spent on,so i was n't surprised by this movie
3,it is a movie that should not be missed,it is a story about a bunch called the mormons
3,the film is n't really worth the time but it 's worth a look at the,the only thing that was interesting to the movie is the acting by the cast
3,now we can get a little bit of a story and i can tell you that the acting,now that i have seen a film that 's so bad it makes me feel like that
3,i am a fan and this movie was great and had a great deal and lots and lots of twists that were n't really funny either as i thought it was funny in a,i do n't know why but i do have a few friends who have to admit that the film is a good movie for those unfamiliar to the subject matter of the genre
3,anyone interested in making this one would have been a better choice,anyone who does anything like a real person should have a good laugh
3,there 's a reason to watch this movie and it is definitely,there 's nothing here that has the depth to the movie
3,zooey is in this movie and i do not think that it is the most important thing ever to be in her entire life,zooey carroll and her son are also quite believable at the core but the story 's focus is on their relationship in a way that
3,sonia braga is perfect as the mother but,sonia bynes plays the mother 's daughter
3,some of the acting was n't too bad,some parts are so ridiculous and ridiculous and pointless
3,though i was expecting a lot of the same elements from a similar,though it is not that i did n't like it as well
3,the story was good but there seemed some very few twists to,the first one was the most beautiful and the second one
3,i think i would be better off watching this movie because my sister and her friends are so bored,i have seen this movie countless dozen times now and i am a lifelong admirer of my generation
3,this movie was made in a small town in the middle of,this movie is not for everyone because of the lack thereof
3,it has a great cast of characters who have no real depth,it is n't as if it had been in the past
3,one day he meets a woman who 's a woman and he,one of the best films i saw i can watch it
3,just as i would like to see a film that was made during the early,just like the story the plot twists and turns are a bit more complex
3,a great cast and supporting cast,a film that will be made as
3,so it is n't a good movie if it is not a good movie,so i can forgive them and i 'll tell them to stay awake
3,having seen the trailer i must admit i was a bit surprised with the way the movie unfolded i would n't have to give it away,having the first of his many minutes of screen time he 's just trying to make the audience believe that this was a real stinker
3,at least the film is good,at first i did n't know how
3,three of the best films of recent years are the two main characters in the first film,three of them are not the ones to get their hands on and the film is n't
3,the script was so bad i did it with my friends,the story is pretty much the exact same same old formula same
3,there is no story to be had but i 'll keep it interesting,there is also an interesting story about a young man in his place who
3,the acting is horrible and the plot is pretty lame,the first movie is a bit like the original
3,i was so excited when i saw it,i have n't heard about this movie since i
3,two of them are two different women in the entire continent and each,two things i do have n't read in the past few days
3,there is a scene where the two men find,there was no real explanation for the characters
3,billie whitelaw 's character does a great job,billie raines is perfect as the heroine
3,playing in a film theater called 'the,playing the main character 's role
3,the film has a lot better cast,the film is a bit dated
3,yes they are in the wrong place but that 's the only way this movie is,yes the plot was interesting and the actors were all pretty much wasted but the film could
3,sounds a bit long but it was a,sounds good enough with a few exceptions
3,susan sarandon is very good as she is given her character,susan dey is great and she 's a real person
3,it was a waste and far better than it would have made the show,it is a good family film that will appeal to everyone 's intelligence
3,funny but it just seems to drag,funny how i managed to get a movie
3,candy 's story of the president is the story of his life and,candy is just an average actor who 's not really a hero
3,so if the story had been done by a young child with a different kind of sense of realism this film would have been a better choice,so i am sure this was a movie that is a little too long for its tastes and i do feel that it is just plain stupid
3,one of the worst examples of a film,one of the worst movies ever made and i
3,syrup on the other is a movie that i can recommend,syrup and arrows are the best part in the movie
3,it 's a good movie to see but i think it will make people laugh,it 's the kind of film where you 're supposed something new but it is very
3,the acting is very good especially the,the film is a complete waste
3,the plot of the movie is so weak that you 'll have to wait to watch it,the only reason that i gave this film 2 star is because of it 's strong title
3,also the story and acting were very good,also the scene in which the father says a
3,i would have given this movie zero stars but that is because this film could have,i would recommend you to watch it to see the movie if it is available
3,the film does n't make a lot of sense,the film also has a bit but in this film
3,i have to say i was n't impressed when i saw the trailer on the video cover,i saw this movie when this movie came up but not as much a great movie but i
3,i have seen a few films that are so bad it is,i would recommend it if not all of the other movies
3,in this version the director 's editor and his,in the end it 's all too predictable
3,this film was n't a good idea and it 's a little too long,this movie makes a great companion for this movie and is the first film that
3,spoiler alert the plot was a lot better,spoiler alert i 've seen this one a few
3,gabe is a little more of a buffoon than his mother or mother,gabe chong was the perfect choice in this movie but he was the worst
3,my only complaint would have to have had a few minor glitches that i have to,my friends have rented it and the only other thing on it was the soundtrack
3,if i were to watch one more movie of it in a row then,if there were a movie like this i could have been the one
3,if the movie has a flaw i do think it would,if you like this type of thing then do n't
3,she 's so annoying and so annoying she does n't even know what he 's going on,she is a great actress but her performance in this film was very weak as is her performance
3,somehow i think that the only thing that was wrong with the movie was the lack that made the movie interesting,somehow this is a movie which is a lot more enjoyable than the sum of its tail in its entirety
3,the script and acting make this a,the film was n't bad enough
3,the film is set against a series of flashbacks and flashbacks and the story unfolds in a completely incoherent fashion,the script by neil king is n't a great deal of comedy either as it seems to have a bit more
3,bette davis is the main character but she 's very different and is the perfect girl to play her part,bette davis plays a character who seems to love him for the most of her life but she is n't a
3,this is a film that deserves the best of the oscars and,this is one of his films that you should not watch
3,i have n't seen the trailer for years but the story is very similar for a sequel and is not only a very enjoyable movie,i 've heard about the dvd for a while but i was so bored i was able for this movie to be so bad that they
3,paul reiser does n't have a lot to do in his other movies,paul rudd is excellent and the film has a lot to offer
3,only a movie made about the same subject that,only the acting and the directing is awful
3,these two movies are a very good idea for the movie to be,these are a very few of the many problems in the plot
3,you 'll have to watch a movie to get a hold of it and enjoy it,you do n't get to see any of these characters or even care at all in their
3,the only good things about this turkey are the great performances,the film starts out with the first of a long shot of
3,i would like to see more from the director 's work in that,i was a little skeptical but in a way i was so impressed and
3,i was so annoyed by this story it was painful,i am not a huge austen aficionado fan but i still
3,this is one film i 'd like to point to that time,this movie is a great example of how to use the camera as
3,madame ann warren plays a rich man named lila a former,madame ann warren is a great example for a film
3,i think it 's a shame that it is not the,i think they are the nicest people on the planet
3,it 's not even a comedy,it has a lot to offer the
3,so if there was any chance to make an effort it would be that this movie has,so i am sure this was one time and that is the reason i love it
3,this film is not even worth the wait,this is not one of those movies
3,if you have n't seen this yet it will be a lot more entertaining than you would think,if you 're in love with the same woman you might like a little more of the film 's
3,there was no need for this,there were no good moments to be
3,first of all there is a story of a couple who have been living and in a different situation and the people that the people who live,first i thought this was just a great movie and i would definitely not recommend it to anyone unless the director of photography is the same
3,seth and his wife are both in the same predicament and the,seth brundle 's character is so bad that it 's unbelievable
3,also i did n't like the ending when the first two minutes of the,also the movie is n't very good and i do not recommend it
3,of course he did a good job of playing this role with a little charisma and a lot more of his acting,of note there is a scene where she gets to the hospital and he goes on to do the same thing
3,the only reason that i watched it was i was disappointed by the movie,the film has an underlying plot to the story that makes no sense
3,certainly the worst movie i have seen in years and i have seen worse,certainly not in a good movie but i have to tell you that i did
3,someone 's life is just as much more than the same old people who live in their house and,someone should be ashamed to see this and it would be a better film if you have n't
3,brad pitt plays a very good and believable,brad pitt 's performance is very bad
3,but it 's not the most profound,but there are no real scares
3,it 's a great story and i would recommend it for anyone who likes a good film,it 's a good show and i would recommend the film to everyone who has to watch it
3,viggo ackland gives a solid performance as,viggo kaufman directed the first movie
3,but that 's what i thought of it,but this is n't a bad movie but it
3,and there are some nice shots but not in a bad way like that and i,and the movie also is a very very very bad movie with the main characters
3,dr jacques coulardeau who has seen many movies with varying casts as,dr the youngest man is a good guy with a heart
3,word of mouth is a film that deserves to go to see it,word that i did not like it was that they were all the same
3,there 's a scene in which the hero tries to be the,there were some good scenes but not that great to begin
3,a lot of the scenes in the film are pretty much a bit too,a great film for fans of horror cinema and fans of italian cinema
3,but the movie is very well done as well,but the movie does have some good points
3,on the one side the characters are so believable that,on a scale i do n't get it wrong
3,much of the humor in the original series is that,much of the film takes place in this country
3,creator of the first movie has to be one of his better efforts,creator richard shepard is the only thing he can do when he 's a
3,of course the main reason this film is being released from its native counterpart seems that the producers are using it to show us a film that will not be appreciated for many,of course there were some good moments but they could n't have gotten a better ending and the film just could n't have done much much with the development of the characters
3,in the end he realizes he 's the only reason to go and the other way he has to do his own stunts for a while,in a scene with an elderly man and the dog 's reaction he is not able for the final showdown with a sheep and a couple of
3,that 's the whole point of it,that is how you should see it but
3,film is a movie that is n't only a vehicle for an interesting movie,film has a nice cast but it 's the kind of movie you like the
3,i was a bit skeptical that it is not a bad,i do n't know whether the film works or not
3,this was a film that i would,this movie is the most boring
3,rob roy is not a very bad actor but he does,rob lowe does n't have an ounce as a villain
3,women who live in new orleans or acquire their freedom are n't very interesting in their view,women have been a fan since the last house and that was a good idea to get the
3,watch for all of these guys,watch this movie if you love a
3,a movie is a must see for any fan of horror or horror flicks of the late 70s,a young boy is invited to a prison to investigate his mother 's house and finds a baby
3,only a few people are killed and they are not the ones who are n't the main characters in this movie but they just make,only this time it is all a bunch of kids who have a big mouth that will be used for a couple of years
3,in fact it is the most interesting part,in this case the characters were just plain annoying
3,nasty and very funny in every way,nasty and very very very funny
3,the story was pretty decent with some decent twists and turns,the story is so stupid that the viewer can feel sympathy for
3,bollywood has a lot more to do with this film,bollywood was n't a good director and the acting was n't
3,it has a few laughs but a few scenes are just plain funny and there are some funny moments,it 's a very funny movie and i do n't think it would be too hard to find a copy
3,russ is a great actress with an excellent voice and a very good body,russ burr is in the film for about three minutes but is still a good
3,instead i got some kind of enjoyment out to the end which was the best part of the movie,instead of a typical hollywood film it is a great film to watch and enjoy and it 's a joy
3,this movie is a waste on an evening and a waste of time and,this is n't even my cup i 'll have a hard to explain
3,indeed they 're both in the movie and we learn how to handle the situation and the way they are,indeed the movie is just plain stupid the plot was weak and the acting was poor and there were no real
3,it 's a movie about a serial,it is the best film ever
3,the movie has a very very low budget that is so low i can only think of the worse,the first time you see him in the scene is one of the first of his later works
3,i was expecting an insightful film and it was not as good as it was and the acting was n't bad,i was n't impressed by the fact the movie is n't really a good horror picture with the typical action elements and
3,okay the movie is about two girls who,okay this movie was a complete disappointment
3,just like the first movie it 's pretty good too but not the first one,just like the story of the characters in this movie are just plain awful and the
3,i would n't have been a part of the cast list if i had not given it the extra rating i gave,i do recommend this movie for anyone looking for something that is n't very good and the story is n't bad
3,i have n't seen the original version,i 've never heard about it
3,the first time he was at a mental illness he was killed by the devil,the film 's premise is that it 's all about the relationship between a girl and
3,her character was so bad it 's funny,her performance in the film made for tv
3,magnum candy is an excellent movie but the acting was n't bad and the movie just fell flat,magnum 's mother is one of her very early years and she 's in her own for some reason
3,preach for the viewer to see a,preach about it the other way
3,this is a very bad film but it is a good film,this is a film with a strong message of love and a love
3,first of all this is a film for the most discerning fans of the genre,first of all i do not think that any movie has ever received any respect for
3,we 're all supposed for it 's own point of what is,we are talking about the same things in the same manner
3,this is an excellent piece and it is the most underrated and beautiful film ever made,this is a film that is more or less a study of the events that happen in
3,to say so on the quality of this film is the understatement,to me this film was n't even a comedy and the director should
3,the acting was horrible the script and editing,the only thing that makes the film is is
3,and it 's the best of the three movies,and it does not seem like a bad movie but
3,i think this is one of the,i was so excited about it
3,unfortunately this is not the case,unfortunately the plot is n't very good
3,the story is simple but the characters are all believable especially in their interactions,the first half of the movie is about a group that just ca ca n't
3,after the first two hours of the movie you realize that,after that it seems to be a little too late
3,and that is where it is due,and that would be a little more difficult
3,i think that 's a shame since this,i would n't go for this movie
3,story of the kelly sisters and the adventures,story line and acting are all excellent
3,his character was the one that i loved and the way he spoke in the first movie,his character is so annoying that he ca n't help to move into a movie which i did
3,there 's a lot more to the movie than it is,there were some great moments of humor and i loved the way
3,it was n't a bad movie,it has to have been the best
3,the first one was very good but the first one was very bad,the plot is about a young girl named sasha who is a woman to
3,everybody involved in the making of this piece should have made another a movie that had a lot more to work on in the first place,everybody involved in this movie is a total idiot who thinks that they will be in the middle of an elevator with a big knife
3,people should be embarrassed by the film,people who have never seen the film and
3,still it is n't the best movie ever to be,still the film is a bit over an average
3,so it 's not a very good movie if you have the choice of a film,so if i had n't seen it i would be surprised to find myself asking what 's
3,it is an excellent film and the actors who made,it is a good movie for a rainy day
3,people who do like the movies of this movie are the best ones,people like me are not a bit of what they are and how they
3,lets talk about the movie and the story,lets face it the plot was very thin as
3,she does n't seem to know what she is doing but,she 's also the best of all the supporting cast
3,when the first one was over and i thought i was a little bit too scared,when i read a review i knew the movie was going as far as being of a
3,as a result this has nothing new or interesting,as for the plot it 's not bad
3,as for his acting ability he plays his role of a young man,as for me the film is a very interesting story to see
3,but i think it 's a good film,but i think this is one to see as
3,many of the scenes were filmed and the acting was so good that it seemed like they were reading the script,many people have commented on imdb and the reviews here seem like they are just reading the book on the imdb
3,i think that this would have worked better,i saw the first half of this series and
3,an excellent film and one not to miss the opportunity to see it again and never get a,an interesting film with a lot of good performances and a good story that i can recommend
3,i was n't expecting anything like a horror flick,i do not think that this movie should be made
3,i have to say that the ending and,i have not laughed once so much
3,while the plot is not as bad as it could 've had,while this was n't the case it was a great story
3,anholt is one that is not just an action film but a good one as he 's,anholt 's role in a clockwork orange in the middle of this movie is very good
3,this film was made for kids,this film has nothing in common with
3,80 minutes in for a few laughs and a bit of a plot twist,80 's horror films have been made for the common sense of violence
3,but it is not as good a performance and as i said it is,but this is n't a bad movie it 's a waste of celluloid
3,the movie is so boring that you wonder why they bothered to make such,the plot revolves a couple in a new york town in new york
3,recommended to those interested to watch it for,recommended for those interested of the genre
3,ha ha is one that will never be released in the us or even if it is shown on,ha de vaca is a great actor who is very good as the conflicted yet very sensitive character
3,i have not read any of the reviews for,i am a big fan of this kind
3,the movie was n't really the most memorable but it was very enjoyable,the story is about three guys trying to survive in the past and the
3,it 's a good movie to watch but it 's so poorly made and acted it makes me wonder what the hell was going to happen next to the movie,it has a lot of potential but it just does n't work in this case and there are many scenes that do n't fit to make any kind of sense
3,all in all the movie was a,all this is a classic movie
3,its a shame because there were so much better movies made,its the best film i have ever watched and it 's one
3,oh yeah and i did n't even care about what it was trying to,oh yeah that was a pretty nice idea for a movie to go
3,but the film 's biggest weakness lies,but the fact that it had the potential
3,emily 's character was not developed well,emily 's character seems to be the only
3,the first thing that struck me was the fact they were making a documentary about the life that was in the first movie and the second half of,the first thing i notice in the movie was that it was made by a bunch and a director who is obviously trying to make some sort
3,a few minutes later the director of photography is shot and shot in a scene that has a very unsettling and haunting score,a movie that makes you think of a real person and you should watch this one and you have to love it
3,kurosawa has made it clear and it is one that should n't end his work,kurosawa has to take over his work in the last stages of this one and he
3,i have been watching it over 30 and it has been on my life and i can appreciate it,i think the main problem with the movie the fact it is n't even a comedy and not a film
3,oh and the final countdown in which the killer is the killer,oh and the main characters are a bunch of people in this movie
3,there are many moments in this film you do see in the end,there have been some very low profile episodes but the one they did was
3,as the movie goes along he is not a hero but he is a,as for the rest i think that it 's a bit of fun
3,this is not an easy task,this is not a film for kids
3,it is not a film about a group of people trying to get,it is also very interesting for a movie to change the world
3,score 7 stars out me for a movie,score 8 out of 10 for the fact that
3,i 've always liked the show and it 's a shame that it is n't canceled,i 've seen a lot worse but the worst thing is that the movie is not so
3,the story is so ridiculous that it 's difficult to follow,the first movie was the best one in the series
3,howard hawks directs this film with the title and a wink to the audience and it,howard hughes is the only one in the cast which does n't seem particularly good
3,i saw the movie for the second time and i have to admit the title song was excellent as,i would recommend this movie for all the good ol' friends and for those who like good movies
3,in fact the entire film was shot on the cheap video camera and it is not,in addition the film does not allow us to be able to see the beauty and beauty
3,directed by the master william powell and written by the same team,directed and directed and written the film 's best part of a film
3,i have a feeling of gratitude for the movie to,i think it is a film to be avoided
3,pi is the best thing in the movie which is what i was impressed to think the movie was,pi 's father is a man of the heart a very good family a loving family an alcoholic
3,if you do n't have the patience of a good actor who does not play this kind of role,if i were a teenager would be a bit too much to ask if i 'd never seen any film
3,of mice 's films i 've seen that one more and more closely,of all the movies i have seen this film was really bad
3,mickey rooney was very good as a cop and a bit too young,mickey rooney is very funny as the father and the son who gets his
3,so many people have said that this one is a waste,so if you have n't seen it please do n't waste your
3,i would like it for being a little more entertaining but not so good,i saw it on the sundance channel in a theater where it was shown at
3,now it was the best i could have,now i 'll give it a 10
3,by this time it was the most controversial film that i had,by a couple of years i 've seen the movie kazaam
3,when i first saw the trailer for the film the film was a complete disaster of the film which is a bit of a mess but the fact is it 's a very good movie,when a man who is a young man is a young boy a woman who has to live in her own age for no apparent reason is a good actress and a very attractive woman with
3,the movie is a complete disaster,the film is set in england but
3,i think the director should have stayed there to give him a better chance,i have never read the book and i have no interest to the books
3,the movie is a good film for all ages but,the plot is not as good as it sounds
3,he is an expert to the world,he also gets an eye for her when
3,in short it has some nice action moments to recommend,in fact i did not like the fact they were in
3,miss dove is an excellent actress who has a great performance as a mother whose love for the,miss marple is a woman in the world of a very wealthy man in the united nations
3,instead it is not a very good movie and it has no redeeming quality to it,instead it has to be said that the story line has been written as one that has
3,the only thing that kept my attention was a good soundtrack,the script was n't as funny as i expected from a comedy
3,as a result the film does n't even have to be the most boring and dull movie i have had i tire my nerves on,as i mentioned earlier in that case i thought this movie is very interesting and the story and acting were great and the actors and actresses
3,while the movie itself is an interesting one at best i have not seen any of his films but i have to say,while the movie is quite a bit boring at first it does n't get the slightest bit of interest from the viewer
3,it 's a good movie but the plot is so weak that it becomes impossible to follow,it seems that he is a real person who is n't a hero or a woman at all
3,it 's not all about the world it 's a story of a young girl who is a little more concerned with her,it 's a real treat to see how many times the characters were in the movie they were n't even the ones who made
3,the movie also features some of my favorite characters in a,the only thing that kept this movie was the music
3,girl in the dark is a movie that should be viewed for all you romantics,girl in the brain is one that is so bad they 're just not funny or
3,about the same time the characters are so much better in real life,about a year ago i had seen one movie on the dvd
3,yet the film is about a young boy,yet the movie is a little slow
3,however i was n't expecting to see it in the movie theaters,however in this case i do n't think this movie has the potential
3,jenny and her friends are the best of this trio,jenny and emma are a couple who are n't very attractive
3,we get a very interesting and very enjoyable view on the nature of the story,we do not need the film as a comedy or a comedy for example
3,i do not understand why people are so bad when they have to watch this movie for the,i do n't think the filmmakers did n't have a clue about how they were making it
3,maybe the producers had some sort of money for making a film but they do not have,maybe it 's because i 've seen the same thing over and over and the same
3,lenin is a film about the struggle against the government that is being held captive,lenin is a great movie but it never comes across as a good idea
3,there is a lot of violence to this film,there 's a great deal about a man who has
3,yet it 's the only thing that could have made for this movie,yet there 's a few good things about it that are good for a
3,i 've seen this movie several many years ago and now i am glad,i saw the previews for the dvd in my local library and i had to
3,commentaries were made by people who are interested,commentaries are a little harsh to me
3,the first thing that makes this movie stand out from,the acting is pretty good and the story line
3,i would like for people to watch this,i was hoping for a great film
3,also in the movie are you and i love lucy 's work,also the ending is quite disappointing and the ending is pretty bad and
3,the only thing good about that movie was that,the film does n't have the typical elements
3,be sure to check this out and be a fan,be it a movie or an action movie that will leave
3,not to mention it 's a pretty funny film,not only do the writers think that he could act
3,terrible dialogue horrible script bad dialog terrible dialog,terrible acting bad directing bad script no plot and
3,the story has a great deal going on between good action,the only real problem with this film is the script
3,six of the three men are in the same situation as the other two and a bit,six of the cast members are very talented and the characters in this movie were all very real
3,a few of the other reviewers have claimed that this is just another horror movie,a very enjoyable film and i recommend it to anyone who likes action movies
3,their relationship is also the main point that is so difficult,their acting ability was excellent and the acting was superb
3,this is one of those movies that should have stayed on the shelves of dvd,this movie was so bad i could not believe how bad the acting and direction could
3,where does it start to go down with the rest the movie starts with its bizarre ending,where did i begin with this one in my opinion and it was the best movie of it
3,who cares if the film is not as good as the,who can believe him that he 's a bad guy
3,however it is a movie that you,however the story was pretty poor
3,when you 're a little more tolerant it 's a shame the only reason why it was a good movie was the ending,when it comes to movies they 're just plain silly but the film is a good one and a good one at it 's
3,and then the film goes downhill when the plot is not a good thing,and the fact of the matter being that this movie is not even close as
3,even the worst film i 've ever had the displeasure of sitting through it,even the title is not a good one as is a little misleading
3,this one is not one of those shows that should be watched by all means,this is not a bad film and it would be good to be able if you
3,also in the film however are two men who are n't really the same person,also it 's a bit more than a spoof of a film but that 's what
3,but i think that this movie is a total,but that 's not all it really is
3,for the sake of being the most popular and best,for the most of us you will see this
3,why does n't he just try it,why does this movie have to do the
3,personally i do believe that the story was,personally it 's not a good movie
3,however i was very disappointed with this,however i do n't think so
3,a good cast including a good script and an allstar actress who is a standout in this regard,a great film for anyone who likes to see a movie about a woman that does n't want to
3,and there have been many movies with that theme that i 've always been a fan like myself,and the fact remains that it was n't even made by the critics who had been able to get
3,it was so bad and had a good cast,it is not even the worst movie ever
3,a few things that i can say about this show is that it 's one of my favorites,a young actor who played the role of a rich young woman in a supporting role in the movie
3,cary elwes and irene hershey are the best,cary elwes is a wonderful comedic actor
3,we do not learn that the young girl 's daughter is the,we have to be a little more open to the truth
3,the only thing i did like to know is,the film has no plot no character development
3,excellent performances and good writing all the way,excellent performance by john hurt is the only character
3,so i was looking for the movie and i was expecting,so why ca n't we get this on a dvd
3,but there 's the usual plot and,but this is not a film
3,all the characters are just so bad and,all in the family in the film
3,i'm surprised that i did not pay for this crap,i'm glad that the film is over to my friends because
3,i saw the movie on the scifi channel at my annual theater,i have to give my opinion that i 've been in a mental
3,why not just have a little more to learn from the film,why do you have to spend a cent of this movie
3,when you have a film about the evils of war it was the fact it was made,when a man has a secret service and is taken to a mental facility by a group and
3,liza dench is a joy to look,liza minelli plays her own daughter
3,if it was supposed that it was n't the best it could have been,if i were a fan of a few things the movie would be a little
3,the story revolves around a group of young adults who have an affair,the acting is pretty good but i do n't remember the name
3,they have the ability to use the same actors in their own movie and have,they were n't funny either but the script is so bad it is laughable
3,big wednesday is an excellent movie,big wednesday and night club is one
3,makes the movie so bad it makes you wonder if the filmmakers will,makes a few more of it 's more entertaining and enjoyable sequences
3,the script does n't make any difference,the story is simple enough for a few
3,that is what makes this movie a,that is what i would say
3,the first part of the film is the best part in the movie when i first viewed my favorite character,the acting is so awful that i could n't stop to watch it all the way up to it
3,hollywood is a great movie but the acting was not good at all,hollywood had a few films like the others and the ones who were in
3,i have seen all of the comments and have been looking forward to seeing the film,i 've read a few comments about it but i'm glad to say that it was a
3,convinced that this guy had his wife in his house,convinced me i 've seen the movie and i do not
3,the script is so stupid that the plot is so contrived that the film just does n't work,the story is about the love of a man who is so afraid for her family to take care
3,rather than the first of this film,rather it is just another example
3,whether it 's in the world and the us government or the governorgeneral and it was made up a little less,whether or a half the us or what they do it is the fact the movie got a theatrical release
3,i was really surprised when i watched this,i think i 'll be the only person to
3,it is not that i want a lot of the movie i do think,it 's also an insult for any viewer 's ears to get in
3,maybe the most important thing about this movie is the soundtrack and the music in the film,maybe the only good thing i could have done is it was so much better then it was
3,i was surprised by the acting,i was very impressed with that one
3,both men are n't even attractive and that 's,both of these characters were in this movie
3,and if the plot is a little convoluted,and the movie itself is very good
3,if you like the original and thought this was one for the first half of the film then it is a movie to watch,if the viewer knows what to expect from his character he is the first to die and his actions in a different manner
3,i'm afraid that the filmmakers have tried,i'm a fan of the original
3,let 's see what you did with this picture it,let 's hope that the producers will stop it
3,demi moore is the only one who manages to convey the emotion of the character of the character,demi moore has her best role since her character and the cast and crew are all fine
3,a movie that has the best actors in the,a lot of people think of the movie
3,stay far far away from this movie and,stay in the middle of a pile
3,the story is about a bunch of teens and their lives in a strange time,the film opens with a young man attempting for a cure of his life
3,his work is as a joke to a degree,his character is so believable that he is so believable
3,i was expecting a bit of this story,i do agree with those on here
3,how about that i think it would be a little better and that 's why i liked watching it i still feel that,how do the writers and directors think of doing a sequel to that 's how much i like the first two seasons
3,instead it 's just a little dull,instead i got a little more insight into
3,the first thing i noticed that i could not stand was i was laughing at it,the only thing missing is that it is so funny to see that it 's funny
3,any fan can relate with the film,any movie with good actors is really bad
3,the film does a good thing with a lot more money than it is about the characters and what they are really,the only saving graces of this film is that you have no real idea to get involved with any other character
3,the plot and characters are just plain stupid and the film is a complete waste,the story is simple enough to entertain us but it 's a little bit of fun
3,you can tell the difference was a,you can see the whole thing
3,so i was very impressed by the way the whole story was,so it is also the film that makes it more interesting
3,and then there is the fact that it 's a real shame that it does n't make up for,and it is a shame because the film is just a bit too short for the action genre
3,instead they have a lot to think about the movie is about the real people who are in love,instead he 's in the same room as the rest and the film has a lot of the same themes
3,during the course of the film there 's a bit more of a plot that makes no sense,during one scene in an american werewolf 's lab is attacked by a werewolf that has been ripped to
3,not to mention the film itself is a bit choppy but it 's worth mentioning,not to mention it 's so much better than it was but the acting was so
3,i have to wonder why the actors would allow a few characters and not have the actors in,i do n't see the point of the story as to why a film would be made
3,i was so bored when i first saw it but i was,i think that 's why it is not for the masses
3,is this an insult to the original,is the only way of solving the mystery
3,and then the whole thing takes its place to be a bit,and then there is that the story is not that much
3,maybe i 've never seen such a movie that 's so good i ca n't wait to get back,maybe it 's because they are so stupid it is a waste your time and money on this
3,it 's also the first movie that i can honestly say,it is a very simple movie that should be enjoyed
3,even more so than that in this movie,even though the story is n't really original it
3,but the story itself is not very good,but that 's what made him famous for the
3,the acting is good but not everyone who is good,the film is a good example but the rest is a
3,she is the best thing about the movie and,she was a great character in the movie
3,i think it is the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune to sit through,i think it 's a pretty funny movie that is so bad it 's good but it
3,an absolute must see for anyone interested with an independent movie,an excellent example is the scene where she and two women are
3,it 's a shame because it was a bit more of a thriller,it is a film that is not to watch as a whole
3,the film is a great movie,the story is very good and you
3,still this has a very good plot and a lot,still this is the most boring movie ever made
3,there were so good things that i can remember about what happens to me,there was also a lot of the movie that was shot on the screen in
3,this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever but it 's not as bad as i expected,this is a movie that 's so bad you 'll laugh at its stupidity because you know
3,all of the other characters are well developed but the film is so much more interesting than,all in there is the best performance of her career and that 's not saying much
3,i am not the only one that 's a fan of the show,i saw this movie on the big budget and was very surprised
3,two of the best scenes are the scene of the two partisans the scene where we see them walking through their eyes and how they were in their own,two men have their problems with each other and their relationship is not really developed in the story and they are all very interesting in their own right
3,its a shame that this film did get a wider recognition because of its technical quality and the fact that it was not made by a wider audience and it was made in color,its a movie you have to watch for those of you who want you in a good way or at least you do n't want your money and money to go and watch the movie
3,as far from a good movie it is,as it stands it 's not very well made
3,christopher lloyd is in this film and he was the best character for me but the real world was in,christopher plummer is excellent here as he usually is the best actor i 've seen him in in years
3,what a waste of time it really is a,what a shame they had to do it
3,most people are looking at the imdb user comments and,most of them have no chemistry with the characters
3,if i had to pick my own eyes and i would,if there was any real life to be found here
3,eventually the story becomes a little too long for the story but this is,eventually he finds a job to help protect him from the evil demon
3,i would have given it an extra star but i think the best way of thinking about this film would n't be a lot of good acting but the film is so bad,i would recommend this film to anyone that enjoys a story about how to make a movie about the lives of women and women that are not afraid of being in love
3,his performance in the movie is the,his acting is not very good
3,by the end of that film the only way that you,by now it 's a little too slow for me
3,i saw the movie yesterday and thought that i was,i was hoping they would get the money back
3,al and his wife are a young woman who is in love for her and the,al adamson is a genius who 's got a lot more money on his side
3,local sheriff frank morgan plays the same role as a man who,local and new jersey was a wonderful movie in my book
3,i 've been looking for a good movie since the first one,i 've heard many of you that i love the music i have
3,another reviewer has commented on that the,another thing i did n't like
3,i am not saying there 's a reason why i do that is because the movie is so bad that it 's hard that they have done,i 've seen a lot of other films that are bad but this movie made me laugh at the fact the movie had a good script
3,most people do n't have any clue about the movie or their relationship or what they are talking to in other words,most likely the story is about a young girl who 's being held captive by the local government and her daughter
3,if the script was good enough the movie was a bit too long to keep you awake and the ending seemed more like just another one but i was n't,if you 're interested that you want to watch the first episode of that series i 'd give this show a chance and it will have its own merits
3,the film is a total downer with the exception of a few other minor players,the story is very well made the story has a few twists to it and it
3,another scene is in a crowded bar and a scene where the kids are sitting around in drag,another scene in this show shows in the background and the film is a lot longer than it is
3,wilson does a good performance but he is the only actor who seems like he was n't the director,wilson 's the man in the hat is the best and the best that can make you think wow
3,however the acting is n't bad either,however there 's a great performance by a
3,there was an opportunity to make a good film out there,there is a lot of gore and sex scenes including a beheading
3,i was n't really impressed but in my view,i would n't recommend this movie to everyone
3,but the story was n't that bad the way the story was told,but that 's all you can find in a movie and a very bad
3,her role is so convincing i was surprised that she made this movie as much as the first,her husband and his daughter had a heart and they were trying hard to be the same
3,i'm a big fan of horror movie and this is,i'm a little prejudiced when i saw this movie
3,to say so much more would be true but it is n't very funny and there are no really funny jokes,to be honest i'm not a fan of the first film so i was n't really expecting much of the first movie
3,it is a film that can never be repeated and is a waste for one hour,it 's a shame that this movie had a wide release for all involved and it was
3,that 's why i think that 's the best part in this entire movie that was n't made up,that 's the only thing i could possibly say about this movie that is n't bad but it did not
3,sadly it is n't worth watching,sadly it is n't a film to
3,why did she have to be her father,why did they have to have to be in
3,as i said earlier you 'll be very impressed with the fact,as i 've said i did not have much to do
3,i was expecting a lot from it but i found it very entertaining,i would like a few more people to give this film any good reviews
3,the only real surprise i have is that it is a film that i would love it to,the story line is just so stupid that it could n't be even remotely entertaining or funny
3,overall this is a very good flick,overall the movie does not seem to be
3,and if i had a copy on the disc the movie would be much,and if you do not have to watch the movie to get it
3,just to see the film that is not as bad a piece as it 's a,just like a few movies in the past it is a great piece of art
3,the story is so weak that they are actually just a waste material and the characters and their characters are all very unlikable and not even interesting to,the movie is a very bad one but not quite as awful and it is the only movie in the entire series which is worth a rental
3,after a while the film was over the top and the,after that we have a lot of things to say
3,as far a horror flick this has to be a classic for its time,as a child this film has to rank with its own good and the worst
3,another great movie from a director who is in the right place as a writer is a genius,another example the movie 's plot line is very simple and the story does n't seem like it 's
3,did they get it right there in the movie,did i mention that the actors did n't really fit
3,but this one is definitely worth seeing and for the whole purpose of,but i do n't think this was a good thing to see
3,bunuel 's film was so much better and i was surprised that the director and writer had,bunuel was a very prolific director and a cinematographer who was obviously trying too many times
3,i do recommend seeing the movie and it is not even,i do n't know what the point was in fact
3,hazel munro is good as her mum who is also,hazel 's character is so believable and so beautiful
3,perhaps the best of it is the way it shows how a character has fallen in the foreground,perhaps the director should be ashamed to have the opportunity of making an attempt to make a documentary on
3,maybe if he is in his thirties i doubt you 'll be disappointed but he has a very good script,maybe it 's time to retire and make sure that the movie has a few moments of comedy that are n't
3,this film was made in the us and the film is very well made,this was a movie that i would n't have to see it on cable
3,a great film about a man whose wife and child were a,a very enjoyable and entertaining film which i recommend to everyone
3,an american werewolf who is n't even bothering to accept his name is a vampire,an old man who is not an expert and has a very large part of the
3,this was a very good show,this is the first time i have
3,i do believe it was an attempt to show the audience,i was n't impressed with this movie and the plot
3,as for it it was an enjoyable film,as a movie it 's really not a film
3,unless it 's the kind of movie that makes you want you to laugh at something you do not want to miss a chance that this movie is going to,unless you 're a diehard fan of the book i would n't have missed it but i do recommend it as well as the other comments on the imdb
3,immediately the two men come together and the men are killed at the hands of a local politician in the form,immediately the film is set on the same side as the first part of the trilogy and the second half is so
3,there was a very good scene in the movie when it was a movie that had a good cast and i really wanted a refund,there 's a very funny scene where the two lovebirds are trying to find a way to save the girl from getting her back
3,by all the other reviews i 've heard that the movie is not worth the time,by the time i saw the trailer of the movie i had heard that the director had
3,although some might say it was a good movie i found it to really have a lot of laughs,although the film has a lot of good things the editing is good the story is simple and the characters
3,i think that it would have been a good movie if it,i was expecting a film with more interesting and interesting characters
3,now this was one of the most popular tv series i 'd ever see and it is n't a show that i,now i am not going to say that i am a bad person but i think they have done some research
3,the plot of the movie is a bit contrived and the plot line was n't even worth mentioning in any way,the story is a simple story of a young girl who works a life shift and is trying to make a living
3,to me the acting and acting is very bad,to me the film was a complete success
3,this film does n't even seem like it 's a good idea to go to the bathroom where they are going,this movie had a few good parts but i really did n't think it could possibly be any good it 's just
3,i 've watched a movie that is so good and so,i was surprised to find the film so powerfully entertaining
3,the film has an interesting message,the story was n't that great but
3,we have the usual american cop who has no redeeming features in the movie and,we do not need much of the same to be treated as a film
3,but the real thing here is that the,but the movie has some nice ideas
3,the film is an interesting film,the script is a mixture of a
3,the plot is simple the acting was horrible the plot nonexistent so the special,the movie 's main problem in me are that it 's not funny
3,so i guess i have n't seen this,so it was n't a bad movie
3,but then again there 's another thing,but it 's not so bad it 's
3,this movie has a lot more going it 's a good one,this one has a very good plot and it shows how it could
3,i do not want to talk too much at all about this story,i am glad i did not see this film in a theater
3,this movie has a lot to recommend,this was one hell that made the show
3,now we are treated a bit of violence,now it 's a good movie that is so
3,from that moment on i was so relieved to hear the name of one actor and the film was released,from the opening sequence where the film is set in the background the film has a very unsettling feel
3,catch up with his friends the other way round and then they all get killed,catch the movie and see how a film about a man with a heart
3,in my book the most memorable scene in the entire movie is when the killer 's wife is kidnapped,in my view it is the worst of the two movies and i have seen it many times
3,this was a great show with an amazing plot,this is not a great movie but the film itself
3,i have seen this film countless many years ago in a theater with its approximate cast and a story,i would like this movie for anyone reading a review to see it and not to mention it
3,i was so excited when this movie came to my tv,i think the movie is worth seeing as well and the film
3,the only thing that i found was the fact that a few of my,the movie is just so boring and ridiculous it hurts to watch it
3,i would like to say that this movie is not a total waste of time,i was n't surprised when the movie turned out not as a drama or a drama
3,i was surprised to see that it was released on dvd and that is what i saw,i 've never seen a film that is as simple in a film as the rest of the
3,the story and acting are very good and it 's easy to find the actors who,the only way to watch it was i was a little skeptical when it happened
3,even in the final moments of the show there 's a lot that 's just,even the most diehard fans of these movies are the worst ones in hollywood
3,he does not know what the truth is,he does n't have the same personality and he
3,the story is simple and the characters do n't even have the benefit of a decent movie that,the story is not really as good as it is but this movie was very very boring
3,the plot is pretty much the same as a lot but,the movie is a complete ripoff of the tv show
3,or even if this film is a good one it does n't deserve to have it 's fair,or maybe it was a movie that had nothing but a good idea and a good script
3,the movie does n't make sense at all it 's just about as good as watching paint dry,the plot is about four young people who have no trouble finding their jobs but they have to fight
3,a movie is a lot more of a,a lot more than just a series
3,i was expecting the usual clichs that are supposed so i can forgive them for having to endure a movie that i have never read,i am a huge fan and have never seen a bad guy in a movie but he does a good job playing the role he does
3,well it 's the best of all the columbo,well i 've been in my late forties
3,the only good thing that i can say is this film was,the film is a total waste by a group of people
3,there 's a lot going on at once the film is too serious to be a serious drama with the,there are a good number to the story and some of them do n't really do anything for you
3,as a result of this i could not have cared what happened to her daughter in the end,as for the plot well i think you could have better luck if it were n't for the fact
3,this was the first movie of a great series,this film was made for television and it was a
3,scalise has a son who 's been kidnapped by her father and his,scalise does n't seem like it 's the best of the bunch
3,it 's a movie about a young girl who marries a girl,it is a great movie that will leave you with a feeling that
3,i was surprised that the movie was n't released on dvd in the us,i am a huge horror fan and i am not sure if it was that
3,since then and the movie is over the head the story is just boring,since the movie is based on the book by the same director i think it
3,assume they are making a good movie,assume that the movie was based off the
3,a young girl who has been married to a younger woman,a young man 's wife dies and they decide she 's a
3,i was n't expecting the film to be a comedy but i found a lot and i thought the,i think the film is a very funny one and the characters and the situations are well done
3,either the director or the director did n't want to give us the impression that we,either the director or the director wanted more or better to get a good story
3,a good story and good acting by all involved especially with the leads and a great cast of characters,a lot of people have been raving to the critics that this is a very low rent horror flick
3,the acting by the actors is terrible the script and dialogue are awful and the plot is,the film is about a woman in a mental hospital who is a very rich woman
3,christopher lloyd is in the movie for a good laugh,christopher lambert has an interesting role but he is n't funny
3,the only way i can recall this is when i see a tv show that i was in and the whole family was laughing so hard that it made my heart hurt and,the film 's main character is the son of a family of two women who live on a remote ranch and their parents are stalked in the woods in a small town
3,for example the two main characters were all in the film,for a good movie it 's very good to watch
3,i would like to see a good movie in this genre,i was a huge fan and i am so impressed
3,problem lies in its own story it 's a very very,problem is he 's too young and has no talent
3,in this one it is a great movie but it is the same thing,in this movie we get some of those characters that were more interesting to me
3,the film is n't as bad but the director was just not able,the film does manage to be a bit more like a film about a
3,even the most ardent fan base would enjoy watching this,even the music was n't even that bad either
3,none the time it 's a good movie to view,none of them were able to make a film
3,and that does n't really work,and it is also the same story
3,whereas the movie is quite good the story is a bit slow and boring for some reason but it is really really great,whereas the movie was shot on video i would have given the film 1000000 a 7 out 10 if there was a score for
3,being able for a movie to show the truth that it is not a good movie it is not the best film ever to have,being a big fan and the director of this piece of trash is not only good but also good in it to be the only good
3,john carradine is a very good director,john woo has been known for doing so
3,it 's an example of what the creators of this,it was a very good idea for this movie
3,i 've seen a number new episodes of 'the twilight show' but it has been done in a different way,i do n't know how this movie is going but that i did n't get it in my head
3,there is a little to say the,there 's no suspense or tension
3,i do n't think that the movie 's only redeeming,i was n't expecting too much from this movie
3,this is a movie for the whole family but i guess that is what the,this is the most beautiful movie ever made to be a masterpiece of beauty
3,this is a must for anyone interested in the subject or,this film was a very good and very funny movie
3,instead the director is trying to make his own film a little more than the usual suspects,instead we have a character of a woman and her friend that is a bit of an insensitive
3,what a great movie that i would rate it higher,what 's more the acting and production is very good but
3,the movie has a lot to say about the first movie and this one is one that i will always watch,the movie 's main drawback is that this film is so bad that it 's almost impossible to believe that anyone can
3,this is a very entertaining movie that should be enjoyed by anyone interested with the genre and the fact the cast,this movie is so good and so funny that i can only watch the entire movie and i ca n't believe the
3,ok this is a bad movie,ok maybe that was the first time
3,recap of the film the story of the film,recap the movie itself is a good thing
3,the film was also a very good film,the only thing missing was the ending where the
3,we are talking about what we believe in what happened to them and what they do,we have a lot of movies that do not have the feel of a madefortv horror movie
3,it 's a movie about a guy who has been murdered and then,it 's a pity to hear the name attached to a movie
3,one thing that 's good for it was its message that it is,one of my favourite movies of all is the acting and direction
3,i would have thought that they made the same mistake as the original film with the same title,i have to say that i was impressed with the film for the first time in years
3,mattei 's film is not so much an homage of a good director,mattei does a great injustice on the idea and makes it even worse
3,the film 's only redeeming factor is the soundtrack,the film was made in a very dark manner
3,the movie is not very bad,the plot was pretty bad but it
3,even in a short film you have to wonder why there was a lot,even though this movie is n't bad it was n't a good thing
3,yet it never gets boring or boring,yet he never really makes this film
3,the acting by all of her characters was good,the only thing that makes it interesting though was the
3,but this is not a film for the easily impaired,but there really was no redeeming qualities about the film
3,the script is a bit weak and so is the story and the story,the film is n't bad at the end but the story is so simple that
3,i have n't read the book but this is probably not a good thing for a good movie to be done,i saw this film on the sundance network on the scifi channel in the summer of 1987 in the late 1980 's
3,it would be a shame because i do not like the movie,it seems to me to be an attempt to make a good film
3,the script is so poor the acting in this movie are awful but the script was pretty good,the first thing that struck me about was that they did a great deal but it seemed like a
3,a few years ago a young man called the black man has been killed,a lot is not only a very bad film the film does have its moments
3,left out the story of a woman who is married with her daughter who 's in a coma,left for the first time in a long long line of films i have seen a couple more movies
3,i saw this movie at the boston international international festival,i am glad that the movie is made to entertain and
3,spoilers spoilers it is a good movie,spoilers ahead the acting by the whole crew
3,apparently a movie is not a great movie,apparently this is just my personal opinion
3,this movie is a complete failure to all,this movie is a very good movie
3,and i 've seen worse acting in a kindergarten student film and i think it is a shame because it 's not a great film,and if you like a good action you 'll love this show you should be able into the game in which the plot takes you out
3,we have to see the film to see the end result but not in the end,we see the same old same old guy who was so annoying in his life he 's
3,so i do n't have to give,so much better as it is
3,she 's not the one and only the youngest of this film but it,she was not the first film to get her to go to school
3,or maybe a few of those people who were so excited about this movie should have been,or is it an attempt to make this an entertaining movie to be a serious film
3,the plot of the story follows a bunch and the two sisters,the movie starts off ok but the acting is n't good
3,both of them are in fact a great film,both the acting and direction of the movie is a
3,not that i think that the only reason why the movie was good was because i was a fan like myself,not only that but it 's also a fun little chiller that 's really funny at times and is not very well
3,helen mirren is very good as an actress who is a good woman,helen danes is one of the most underrated directors to ever grace
3,everyone in the theatre had a great time making the whole,everyone 's acting was so bad it was n't funny
3,i was very impressed by the acting,i was so impressed with this movie i
3,the movie has a very nice soundtrack,the only thing missing is the music
3,this movie has everything you need for a movie,this is one of the worst movies ever made and
3,all in all this is a great movie that should be viewed on video for a long time as it,all in all i think that 's why i enjoyed this movie a little too but i really liked
3,the movie does n't really do justice,the story revolves around an ancient man named
3,and the movie has a very strong story line the film is so funny,and i do n't want to go on about how the plot is so ridiculous
3,she has the best line in this film,she was very good in her role as a
3,all of these are the best things i 've seen about this film but the story and script is so good that you do not have to be a fan of the movie to figure something out,all the characters have a very complex story but it 's all very funny because they all have the good guys who have always made good movies but they just do it so much that they are not
3,louise walters has a good job of playing her,louise is the only character of the two
3,we 're not going to forget about this film,we are not talking to the characters in the story
3,a film that has been made commercially with the exception of one star is a great director,a film that could have made an impression on a group of friends and family and friends
3,the acting of the lead character 's mother in,the story and characters develop the same way
3,who could n't understand what it was like when the,who would be a big fan like this movie
3,there 's also a very funny scene when the two girls,there 's the usual clich about a man named angus
3,the film also stars the two main characters in it,the movie was a waste of time for the viewer
3,to my surprise it 's a pretty bad movie,to be honest i have n't laughed so hard in
3,i would give the series a 7 out of ten but if i can find a flaw for the first two episodes,i am a fan of hers and it is a great example to watch a movie with a very low quality
3,rather it is a film that will not only be the case for the,rather the story is a bit of a mess and a bit boring
3,in a way the story is just not that interesting,in fact i have to say that i did not have
3,some of these characters are the only thing that 's interesting about this film,some of his best acting is the most memorable performance of his life
3,this movie is a waste over and of my time,this film is so awful that you ca like the bad
3,i have to say that i have never seen such an,i think it 's the best thing in the picture
3,i was so disgusted that i had n't seen the whole film on my own,i was n't expecting this movie at least not as bad as i expected
3,the film is a bit of a,the movie is a complete mess
3,she is the best actress in her life,she has been a great actress and her character
3,it 's all about the man who wants to kill people in the woods,it was n't the best movie of the year and i do believe that it
3,total lack in logic was a major letdown,total waste is one of my top 10 favorite
3,this film was so bad it had it 's,this is not just for everyone 's taste
3,christopher plummer is great in his role,christopher walken is excellent as always
3,the plot was very weak the characters were flat and there were several characters that were n't really likable and were just plain annoying,the film opens with a man being killed by a werewolf with a knife and then later a woman who is supposed to take care
3,we 're all talking to a man,we have no problem finding it
3,basically it 's not that great,basically the movie itself has some nice
3,kal penn is a great actor,kal penn as a cop is n't
3,the only good thing i have about this film is the soundtrack,the story was so simple and so boring that i did not care
3,too many people who have seen a few movies are so bad they are funny and i do like this film so it is one that everyone should watch if only for the fact that it is not for you,too many of the characters seemed unnecessary or the plot just seemed ridiculous and there was no plot development to be told and no one cared whether they could make a good movie but there is n't enough material
3,there are some great actors that make,there is nothing wrong with that
3,the only way i can remember that the,the movie is a little slow paced
3,i have n't seen this since i 've seen this show,i would recommend this movie for anyone who has ever been a
3,heck i 'll have my own problems,heck there is n't much gore or gore
3,at that time there was one big explosion and a few other guys are just walking through this movie,at the beginning of the episode the viewer is subjected to what appears to have a sense to the characters
3,i have to wonder if they 're trying something different to the movies in general but this does n't mean it 's a good movie for them anyway the movie has a very good plot line and a great,i 've seen many many of his films with some of the same but not as much of a problem as i was with a couple of movies that have been made in years and are so good
3,the movie also features an allstar cast of characters,the acting by the main players are great
3,to me this movie would n't be a good film if it had n't made,to say the least about that the plot line and acting is pretty bad
3,also it 's a bit of a rip on this,also the story was not too bad at all
3,i do not know if i can give it an extra but it does n't deserve to be so bad that i can forgive my brain cells and let my friends watch a film so,i saw this film on the shelf and i thought it had a lot of potential to do and it would have been a great movie if a few people would have seen this
3,in my mind this was the worst film i 'd read in my lifetime,in addition to the success of the film it 's very good to have an
3,he does have the potential for being,he has the best acting performance
3,no one should have made it through his own life and the,no wonder the movie does not make a lick of sense
3,it is n't a very interesting movie,it 's also one that i did not
3,also the scene with tom and brian,also the music is very beautiful
3,another reviewer here who said the acting is horrible and that is just a waste,another problem the film is that the film does have some really creepy scenes
3,while the characters are so stupid i do n't really care about the actors or the story,while the acting was good the movie could have had better acting and a few more rewrites
3,however there have always been some movies that have the same kind to do with the characters and the characters are so,however if they had been in this movie with the other cast the script would 've been a little less credible
3,because of the great acting and story of an older man 's love for him and the two main protagonists who come,because it 's not the first thing i can think about but this film does n't even bother to do anything
3,there was a bit of suspense but i did n't really get it in the least and it just did a very good job,there are a few interesting moments to go around but that 's where the movie stops and ends the movie with a little more tension
3,i was hoping that the film would be a bit more realistic as a drama,i have been searching for a long time and a fan of the genre but i
3,poor acting and bad special effect,poor acting bad acting bad script bad
3,some of the best work in the history and i hope i have n't missed the first one and i am grateful for this,some of the scenes between them are not as good as some of the other films of that era or the ones that are the
3,what a waste as this is not a very good film,what i got out of it at all is not that bad
3,his performance is so overthetop that it 's almost impossible for the audience to laugh at the jokes,his wife is in fact so he does n't seem to care what happens but he is not in
3,there should be an audience in this country who would not have been able,there 's a scene where the two men get together on a rope
3,the plot of the movie is that of a young man who is in love with a very,the only reason i watched the whole thing is to see what a great movie can be
3,overall it 's a great movie but,overall this movie was a disappointment
3,amants inish has an interesting story of two brothers who are married to each other in a way that makes them physically likable to the,amants inish of the devil has a very small budget in a very small role and he 's also very effective in this one
3,but it 's not just that a bad film like the bad,but it 's not just a film about people who have nothing but
3,sure it 's pretty good to see the end but,sure i 've been a huge fan like this
3,one of the worst movies i 've ever had to suffer from insomnia,one thing that i found funny was when the guy who played the bad
3,this is a very very entertaining movie that has,this film does nothing to dispel its message
3,attenborough 's films were a very good film,attenborough 's the world is the best film of
3,it would be interesting to see a sequel to that movie which is a very sad and thoughtprovoking movie,it 's all the better for a great time period and if that does n't make you laugh
3,the movie was n't very good,the plot is so thin and predictable
3,to make this film an r rated film is the same thing over and present in a new mexico city where we do n't need a big,to say more than once is that the story is very good and interesting in its own right and a good way to keep an interest
3,your only complaint is the movie 's plot is a bit too weak,your typical movie noir and i reckon there is an interesting story to be
3,big deal with the movie the acting and direction is pretty poor,big time in the world of this series and the first movie i
3,instead the movie is a complete mess of its ilk,instead i got the feeling of being the best movie ever
3,sunny puta does n't get any good and it shows,sunny puta also stars a young lionel barrymore as a young
3,same for the characters in the movie the plot was very confusing the dialogue and the,same year for a little bit of fun in a lot of fun to see
3,tunes like the original bambi 2 the film 's original release in the form of,tunes are used in the movie but the songs are n't even as good
3,unfortunately the script is so awful that it could be forgiven for a complete rewrite,unfortunately there is no excuse for a good story line that is actually just about the
3,i was really looking forward to it and it 's not even the typical hollywood movie,i was really looking forward to this movie and i loved how the movie ended
3,this one is a good idea,this is one of the most underrated
3,yet the real problem is that it 's not a good movie at all,yet the film has a good cast and it 's all the same in a
3,granted it 's not a good idea to make up an interesting story and make you wonder if the writer was trying too hard to be so original,granted they have to be a bit too harsh for their own good but it is obvious that a bunch is going to be in this film
3,the only good scene is when the killer is chased and his girlfriend is kidnapped and killed off,the only way i can think that i will be able into this film is because of the great
3,half the film takes the cake and it 's not really a movie about the real life of either and the characters or their motivations,half a movie is a little boring but not so much that you can actually feel the pain the film offers when it comes to the
3,until this day it seems the film will be a success and the movie ends with a very bad,until i saw the trailers on the video cover i thought that it would suck as a movie
3,no wonder there is a scene where,no real plot no real plot
3,the movie was shot in a studio and that 's it the film looks like a cross,the film has an allstar cast that includes the two leads who are not too good
3,all in all a good movie to watch with friends and friends with a lot of friends,all in one i have to mention that i was n't going to see it in theaters so
3,anyway the movie is a very good,anyway i have seen this movie
3,the only saving graces to this movie is that it 's not a good film but it is very good,the acting is n't all that funny but it was n't the worst acting it was supposed at all
3,this film is so bad i actually laughed,this movie was made by a group
3,although the script was not as good a film as in the original the acting the direction the cinematography the acting etc etc,although i do n't like this kind way out to my friends i have a feeling to be the only one in the cast
3,also the film is not about the battle against,also the movie was not very well made
3,i'm a big believer in horror movies,i'm not sure who it is
3,all the other characters and situations are so interesting you 'll be asking your friends to watch it,all the characters in this film are so good that i have no qualms of the story
3,i saw the movie with an open eye,i do n't understand what to say
3,the story is simple enough the acting and the plot,the plot is pretty good but the script is very weak
3,from the acting and writing to this movie you get the whole story line,from the acting is bad the direction is worse the music was horrible it was
3,until this movie it is all about a woman,until then you can see the director mateo and the
3,two things that i liked about this film is that they are both a lot of things in,two of the most interesting characters are the two principal who 's the son of a man
3,eddie murphy is a good choice for this film but he does n't even seem to realize,eddie murphy has been playing the part of a bitch and he is a good actor
3,if you want some more of a story about an older woman that goes nowhere you 'll have a hard time finding out what to do with it because of a plot device,if i had to do a movie about a man trying desperately for a few hours i could n't help but wonder why the heck did n't he make a mistake in this film
3,mckenna is the perfect man for this type of film,mckenna is a very funny and intelligent man who does what
3,the plot line in the book has a lot of potential and it is very entertaining,the only problem in this movie was that it had some really bad actors and some stupid
3,the acting is horrible the direction is terrible even with a low score,the movie is about a young boy named krishna who is trying for a
3,i would say this film was very funny at times but i,i think that it would have made a much greater difference
3,the movie is about a group of four people,the film is a real stinker of mine
3,why not just use the same amount in the film,why did the writers and directors bother their intelligence
3,our main hero is the villain who 's supposed to have been a good man but his character is not developed at least not for a very young woman he 's just a very good actor and he has a pretty face,our main hero is killed in a car accident in the middle of a forest of the dead and the two leads are on the run and the two fall into the trap and start conversing the same way the same man who
3,as for the rest the movie just was n't bad,as it 's the plot has nothing to go beyond that
3,wow i am a huge horror buff,wow what if a movie is supposed or
3,obviously the movie is n't really a thriller but it,obviously this movie is not worth renting for fans
3,not a great movie but a good movie,not to have the same name but i was
3,but if you want to see something a,but this is an excellent little film
3,definitely this movie could have been a much more interesting and interesting film instead and i have to say it is the best movie ever and it deserves,definitely the worst movie ive made up in my memory the worst of the year is 1996 it was n't a movie i would have to see
3,it has a couple of funny moments but it does drag a few seconds,it is a good example to me that the director should not have to make
3,his wife was the son and the mother,his character has an obsession with his daughter
3,it was so much fun to see that it had been in the theaters for a while now,it 's a shame because this show is so much better it 's not funny at all not just
3,but the story is very good,but it 's still very enjoyable for
3,i was very impressed with the story,i am glad that there was one thing
3,immediately the film starts with an interesting premise that is a bit of both a stretch and a,immediately the two meet up with two guys who do n't even try and solve their problems
3,the acting is n't as bad as they should 've been,the only thing that was funny is how the guy in this
3,this is a must for people who have not seen it,this one does the same things that the first movie did n't
3,if you do not get the chance to watch this film i suggest that it 's not even as good,if you do not want to see a movie with the kind of humour i would say this one may
3,swept away and left to fend for themselves and his family and friends,swept up by the film 's title character and being a fan of the
3,so i was really looking for this film,so much of the time the actors are just
3,like the first one the movie is not bad but the acting is terrible,like all of the actors i have seen this movie has no idea of the
3,i do think this movie is a very funny and entertaining piece of,i 've been watching this movie over and over so many times
3,when he meets the old people he tries to make it big,when i first watched this movie in the theater my friend had been
3,whatever they are the only ones who can enjoy this is n't the one that 's in the movie,whatever you 're watching the movie for what seems like a eternity and then watch a movie with an interesting
3,it 's like watching a movie where you do not have to go to a theater to make a movie,it would be nice if they were not a little more interesting than the first movie in which the characters seemed
3,just like the first movie in the series i felt this one is just awful,just like the previous two films of the same name it does n't matter how the
3,john goodman has been on the screen lately since he is on the show with,john carradine is a very talented actor and i hope he can get better
3,you 're not a bad movie but you have a,you 're not the kind to see this show
3,for the first time in the movie there is no reason to see it,for instance the film was shot by a young woman with the same clothes on
3,the film is a complete insult to the intelligence of the viewers and it 's,the plot is about a bunch of kids who are trapped on the island
3,i have seen this one a few times,i think he 's a good actor
3,in a time where himherself was being filmed in an early scene of the first movie we were,in the end the movie is very funny but the rest is a complete waste of time
3,i would give this a 7,i am not going for a film
3,i am not sure who the real murderer was,i was n't impressed by the acting and acting but
3,the movie is n't really about a killer snowman,the film was made in spain with the help of
3,this film does nothing to dispel the impact of life,this is what makes this work work but it is n't
3,i was a fan and i really hated the,i 've seen this film many more times
3,the script and direction are all very very good the cinematography of the sets is good though not great the acting was superb,the plot is about the president 's struggle to get to the bottom of a building that is owned by a corrupt politician who
3,overall i was disappointed with what the movie was about as the film was made,overall i found this movie quite boring and did n't have much to offer
3,i'm sorry but if i had n't i could have done a better,i'm sorry but i do not see the movie in my mind
3,however i did not expect a lot from the movie,however i was impressed by the fact that this show was
3,i saw this when it was broadcast on television and i was amazed,i think they should 've made a better script than a movie
3,but the movie 's biggest success was,but it 's all pretty good
3,i am so upset to have a review,i was expecting a lot from it
3,it 's the first time you 've ever met a movie,it was a waste of time and i would n't even have
3,jack frost is an absolute hoot in this film and i will,jack palance is also the only one who has the charisma
3,i was n't impressed that this was n't a bad movie at all,i do not think this is why the critics are commenting upon them as
3,i 've read many other comments on,i have to mention the ending
3,complimentary and the best i have to offer it was a,complimentary acting and acting is the norm of the story
3,i have seen some of those movies on the big screen and i was surprised by the acting the plot the acting and,i think the film 's best asset is the scene where the two men are reunited and the two fall in love
3,however the movie is very very funny in places and i think,however it 's not so bad that it 's actually funny
3,all the other movies were good and the best,all the characters are just flat and lifeless
3,kutcher and the two are in fact a good film and i have to say that they did n't get the credit,kutcher 's performance in his career is so convincing that he could barely save an entire film in the final scene
3,the film is about a group trying at,the acting in general is pretty good
3,i was surprised to see how the movie could be released,i would like to see the sequel to the original series
3,while the plot of a series of events is not very original it is still a fairly enjoyable show,while the film has a bit of the same story as the book the characters were so well fleshed out
3,imagine how they got to the bottom that they,imagine the movie that was a bit long
3,these were the words of my own,these characters are so bad you 'll have
3,and if i had to watch the rest of it i 'd say it 's a good idea,and the acting is pretty good too and the story is very well done and the characters are well
3,she does n't even look like the guy at all and he 's the only one who can act,she 's also pretty as a character whose sole purpose is not to get her hands into a woman
3,this movie is a waste of my money it is awful the whole movie,this is the kind to show you that you are not supposed for something
3,but it 's still worth the effort i have given it to,but if this was a good film i did not see it for
3,he has to take a step down and down,he does n't want to be a big fat guy
3,yet there 's a lot of great movies in the whole series,yet another movie that is n't bad it 's not even bad
3,her performance is very convincing and the character 's are so strong and believable that they are so funny,her father is not a very sympathetic and very very attractive woman in this film who makes a mistake for
3,and if i were in a coma i 'd be a better place for me and,and the whole thing has a lot about him that 's all you can say
3,by far the worst i 've seen,by far one of the best movies i
3,the script and direction are good and there are many twists to follow the plot,the script is very poor even with the main characters the only one who has been
3,this is one to the very end of the film,this is what is so good in this show
3,it 's not even the action scenes,it was just a movie that should have
3,and i did n't have to watch this movie,and then the scene where she and her mother is
3,how about the fact that they 're all the same characters who have,how does the police react to the police and the police officer
3,as the movie opens the plot is about as predictable as it gets,as a film it was a very good film for all ages
3,the acting is terrible as is the script,the only real thing i found funny was that
3,why not the movie makers and their friends,why not do the right to the end and
3,only the two main characters are the ones who would have had their own relationship in the movie,only for those of you interested and to see the movie you will be able for the story to
3,pg13 horror flick about a man who lives for his father is a loser and a very handsome,pg13 rated for graphic violence and language profanity profanity nudity violence brief sexuality language and drug language
3,all in the first place in fact i,all in one i have to say
3,this movie is a total mess from a director who is so obsessed that it 's hard to,this movie is an absolute must see for everyone who has not seen this movie or not
3,the script was horrible at worst and there were no good characters at any point,the only good thing is the music which is the most beautiful thing about this film
3,my friend 's love for a movie and i chuckled at this,my only real complaint about this is that they were both trying to
3,writers and actors were n't able,writers of this movie will be able
3,and if you 've never seen it on the shelf i think that you should definitely check,and it is a bit slow to have it all in a row of its own
3,the script and characters are very engaging and very realistic and the performances are good and the story line is good but this movie is,the story is about a group of young men that have been married to a mysterious killer in their home for a night trip
3,it has a few funny moments the,it 's not a great story
3,the first film is the best one of them all and one that i would like if you want to know about the story,the plot is so stupid that you 're left with a feeling for a good story but it just does have a few moments where
3,once they are introduced and there are the usual suspects in this film they are able to make a movie,once in a movie there 's the inevitable fact that the movie is a bit long and boring and there is
3,i was n't impressed with any movie but this one is,i am still in the dark state of my heart
3,even though i do not think that this is the best horror movie ever made the movie fails,even though i did not like the movie i did enjoy the original film and the movie itself
3,lots of the time and a place for the film is a real treat,lots and lots and dozens of people who are not even remotely attractive in any
3,why did i waste my valuable money in such trash and,why not make a movie that 's supposed for you
3,one can only hope to find some of it and not just for the fun of the,one of the best movies i have ever had to see and i was very interested
3,james garner is a good actor and is a joy as a woman,james bond is an awesome actor and he 's the perfect choice
3,what a load of rubbish and the worst i have watched in my memory,what is it with all the animals and the guy who is so good that
3,most of the time in the movie we see him and the other characters that he encounters with him in the same breath,most of his films are so boring that you can see them in his films or in the dark light of the camera
3,the first part of the film is,the script is full of clichs
3,this film is a very funny satire,this film is a waste of talent a
3,at the age i thought it could have been a little more interesting,at first you do n't know how to handle this movie as a whole
3,but then he does not have to be in this for one second,but the fact is that the film is just a bad excuse
3,actually i would rather watch paint dry and grass grow than,actually i thought it was good but not as good
3,it 's also the first of three tales of the film that are supposed to be,it 's a shame the film has n't been released in video stores in dvd
3,i'm sorry but i was very pleased by this one because this movie was so horrible that i could n't,i'm afraid the movie is not that great in this film but it 's just too damn good too
3,they do a fine job of bringing us together,they did not even get the idea and did n't
3,raiden is not a good film,raiden and wife decide he 'll get
3,it was a bit slow paced but that 's it,it was like watching a movie where you 're watching the
3,censorship and the human element is not very good,censorship is a real shame that the film was not
3,that is what makes it such an,that 's all i can say
3,the film is about a group of young women,the first half was a very good movie
3,but the movie itself has a great,but i did enjoy this flick
3,he is a very funny actor who is always an actor in a movie,he is so bad that it does n't even come close to being a good
3,i do n't remember it being the first thing they did to the movie but,i saw this in a preview of the film at my local rental store
3,nick nolte was great as the tortured and very menacing man,nick lamas is a great actor but i do n't really care
3,i have seen better films in the past 20 years,i think the best of this is the last
3,on the whole it was an excellent film and one that i would watch if only for the,on that level it 's just a shame that this film is not even available on dvd
3,you can only hope that you 'll never see a movie where a movie can get you interested in,you could probably tell the director of the movie had to take a lot of money and money
3,nothing else but the acting is so awful,nothing really bad happens to the characters
3,the film is a very good one,the plot of two of the most important
3,yet it 's just as bad a film,yet there 's a scene with a giant spider
3,basically this film is a very good,basically this is an excellent film
3,yes the ending is so bad it really makes me angry,yes there 's a lot more of a good plot
3,trying it to be funny in the way of making the jokes is not a joke but a laugh,trying for a while in the film is n't as funny as the original but it 's not as good
3,on the plus side the actors are good,on the other end i thought i would enjoy
3,her performance was not as bad as the,her performance is a bit too long
3,when you do watch it it 'll make the audience think,when you 're in the military and you 're looking for a
3,the plot was weak and the acting was n't bad,the movie is not as good as its predecessor
3,later the movie starts to drag downhill,later the movie settles in the middle of
3,otherwise i was n't bored enough with the movie,otherwise i think it is a film that deserves a
3,fondness to the cast and crew in the future,fondness the film 's title for what you 've heard
3,there are no real people that make this movie to a t,there is a little girl 's character in this movie who is the
3,it is a great movie to see,it is a very good movie
3,learn the truth is that it is the same,learn how to live up to a few years and
3,i would say that the plot of the movie has a lot of potential and the acting is pretty awful,i have to wonder if this film was meant to be a parody of any of the others that came from
3,there 's no reason to watch this movie,there was a lot of action and suspense
3,with the exception that this is a good movie and the actors were n't very likable the plot line was pretty bad and there was,with this movie the first time you see it is a film which has been put into the theaters of the late 70 's
3,from what he says and he has to leave the house for the first day he does n't seem too concerned to do so,from the beginning you know the movie is n't bad but it just seems to be trying to be something that is not worth it
3,the plot is about a young girl who moves,the story was very good and very believable
3,freeman and his two friends are in love and the same can be the,freeman 's performance here in this film is the best thing about it
3,i do n't understand why this film was made but that,i do not know what to expect from this film
3,she 's a little shy but the story is n't,she has a boyfriend who wants to kill him
3,i saw it on the shelf and i was amazed when it,i think it is a great family movie and it shows
3,in addition the acting is excellent as well as a,in the end the story does n't make sense
3,this movie has a certain degree of suspense and tension,this is a movie that you will never see again
3,the film is also full of the usual cliches and clichs,the movie has an allstar performance and i can think of many
3,c'mon what was the point of that,c'mon the film was n't bad but it
3,obviously the film is a bit too much to bear but it 's a good movie,obviously the movie 's budget was to give a little extra time and it would be difficult
3,jody and her friend get the money,jody 's character has to be the most
3,the story is simple in the first place and has some,the story is a little convoluted but it does n't
3,but this was not a great movie,but the movie is so bad
3,the film 's premise is the same,the plot is pretty lame but the actors
3,any one who has a copy in his own can appreciate his work,any one who does n't like movies will love this show as they will
3,i saw a screener release of this film and it,i was expecting an epic film but was not
3,how many times can you do it,how does this movie have a theatrical release
3,so why do people do that with the movie in the end,so what i was expecting of this movie was that i had a
3,i saw the movie at least ten times,i was really expecting a bit too bad but
3,i have seen many people who are n't familiar with me,i think this is one hell that i do n't like
3,in my opinion this movie is the perfect example of the classic genre film of the late eighties,in a movie i do n't know what to say about it but i do think that the film
3,do n't waste time on the film,do n't let that fool you
3,as i said this was a movie that i,as a fan this movie is so funny
3,the film 's story has a very simple story,the movie was shot on the very first day in
3,i was expecting this movie to be a good film but there was no way that i 'd get to see it,i have no doubt the writer of a movie would be able to create a better film but that 's a little more
3,has a few funny scenes that are very well done,has it been the only film that i have watched that
3,together they make this show a bit too funny but it 's just a lot better in,together with the first two thirds the series is a bit different from today 's standards
3,whereas i think the plot is pretty weak there is not a single character who is likable enough to keep it,whereas the acting is bad the acting the plot the special effects are just bad for a low school production
3,evil breed was an absolute disaster,evil dead ii is one film that
3,regardless of the fact it does nothing wrong i think the director,regardless i am very disappointed with how the movie was done
3,this movie should be seen with a capital,this time around and the fact that the director
3,i am surprised to see the imdb review for the dvd in the uk,i 've heard the name of it and i have seen a good film with
3,it 's just an amazing movie,it has a lot more to do
3,otherwise i would like to know if they,otherwise it was not that bad either
3,in fact it 's a little too much to bear,in the meantime of all the people in the theater and
3,it 's a great piece for a film,it 's a very good show and i will
3,also starring a young edna raye and the young billie barrymore,also a lot of the action scenes are very well executed
3,some people are just plain confused,some of it is the first one
3,if you want a real good movie you 'll love them too but that does n't mean it should be that they do,if it was n't for it 's bad production value it would have to rank at least 3 stars in its entirety
3,i was n't disappointed when the movie turned out to be a complete rip down of,i 've seen a lot of movies and it is a good movie to see
3,i was n't expecting it to be like that and i would,i would love to see it again on dvd or vhs
3,it 's a good movie but not a good movie,it would have been better to have a more accurate film
3,lucia 's daughter has the power,lucia and her brother are the two
3,this film is an insult for all who do so,this is not a bad movie it 's good
3,there are some very funny jokes but they do n't make much sense,there is a scene in the film that was a bit long but i
3,why did n't they just use the same old tricks for the same movie as much,why did n't the filmmakers have a clue about how it was in this movie
3,when the first half is announced the two are the same and the same person has the same problem,when a movie is set to be a film of a film the movie is just an excuse to get
3,if you 're going for a fun movie i urge you do n't miss it and you will see a little better than,if i can give it an accurate rating of zero stars because i have to lower it to ten for this review
3,but it 's a little too long,but this is n't a very bad one
3,broadcast with some of the most impressive characters of the time,broadcast viewings for all the good old fashioned fun of a good
3,this is just a movie where the story does n't,this is a good movie but it is n't
3,it is an amazing film for everyone involved,it has to do with the other films that
3,it seems that he 's a man who ca n't seem too human but the real,it 's a great movie that will leave you with a good feeling of reality
3,i have never seen a movie that is so bad that it 's funny,i would have given them a chance if they had been more of them
3,we see it 's a good deal in it 's entirety,we all know that we can be more than that
3,the plot is about a woman that is in love with her daughter and the two of the girls have to go to the city and find,the film is a bit long and the end result was quite well done and it is the only film that i enjoyed the very few
3,through a few years of our lives i still do,through a lot and the other half is a little more
3,in my book the director 's editor was the producer of the original book,in this film the main protagonist and the son are in the film
3,i would n't want to give it away but i do n't want a few minutes to walk away,i think that the reason why it 's not that bad was because i did not like it and i
3,even the usually reliable henriksen is pretty good,even the most notable fan of this film could
3,firode 's film has a very unique feel of the characters,firode has created one of the best of his films
3,maybe it would get a bit less interesting if,maybe that will be too difficult to comprehend
3,did anyone know how much they wanted to be in the movie,did anyone else notice the fact that he was n't a werewolf
3,arthur 's father who is a man of the cloth is not only a young and beautiful boy but also a woman and a woman,arthur lowe is perfect in a thankless role as the head of a man in a hospital where he is not going to be the same
3,i 've heard some of my other comments about how this movie really sucks and i have,i would n't say that the acting is good but the acting and writing is great
3,the movie was shot in a small budget so we can see,the acting and the acting is excellent and a great cast
3,in the beginning of the film she realizes that there is an enemy in a brothel that is not,in addition to that this film could n't be further from being so much better than the original
3,not to forget the name of the movie was n't so bad it made me want to,not only that but the film is a bit of the first and far more interesting
3,i think that this would be one of many years of my personal favorites,i was really looking for the first installment in my collection i 've heard the
3,he had a great idea of what is going on with his wife 's family,he is a great writer but i do not think that this is a real problem
3,willem defoe plays his usual self absorbed wife who 's in his own right,willem dafoe does n't really act as a bad guy but as always
3,it is one of those movies,it was a little slow but it
3,in the book he was given a chance to play,in fact it is a bit boring and boring
3,now this is an interesting movie,now the movie is about a woman
3,neither of these actors had ever been on the screen before,neither do they really have to do the film for the most
3,rated pg but i can say that it,rated r rating pg13 points imdb 1
3,it 's not a great show but rather it 's the,it was n't a movie that i did n't enjoy
3,the film is a complete waste of time,the movie has many faults and the plot is
3,and there were a lot more interesting moments in this film,and it 's a shame it 's not available in a dvd
3,shortly after the first film was released a decade later the movie began to get interesting,shortly before this film was released the film became a big hit in the uk
3,i have to agree with the other posters on here,i 've been watching this show since i saw it and
3,if you like the movie this movie will probably entertain you,if i was so stupid that i could see the movie would
3,this movie is one of my favorites and it is so bad that even mst3k could n't make,this is not a movie that will appeal to everyone 's hearts or anyone who enjoys it
3,unfortunately for the people who wrote the story i was very excited,unfortunately the film 's biggest flaw is that there is a plot and
3,so i did n't think that any of the characters was really any of the characters,so the idea is simple and the characters are believable the story is simple and there were
3,well it 's a movie about love between the two main actors and it 's a shame that such great actors such a shame,well the film is a bit slow but there is a scene where the woman who plays the girl has a bit of a nervous
3,some have commented on the negative side of the film and the movie itself has,some people have commented on this but the film itself is a little weak
3,the movie is a complete mess of an actress 's,the movie is about the same thing about it
3,the film has a great cast and its a very good movie that i have seen in years to enjoy,the film was shot on one location in mexico which is also a big departure from a movie called 'the battleship
3,i 've seen a lot and have been able,i was n't even a big fat bastard fan of
3,of course it 's all very well done,of course there 's a certain twist that you
3,i 've seen a few other films with the name and this one is n't that good but they 're really good for it and i do n't know how they,i think that this movie is not a good movie but i think that the film is so awful that i just cannot believe i have ever watched this movie
3,no wonder they do not have to get a bigger and bigger star in the,no one has ever done so much as this one 's just plain boring
3,samir and maris are not so much as the ones,samir and her friend are the two starcrossed men
3,however it does not seem to have a clear,however the movie has a lot of action
3,i do not know how this film got a 10,i think it 's a shame that i do like a
3,finally he 's just getting his head stuck and has a very funny monologue on his face that he has to deal about in the world and his love for him,finally it has a good cast but they are wasted in such an awful film that it does n't have enough laughs to make it stand out and is just a little
3,interesting to see a movie like this and that is what happened when you saw the first movie,interesting to say the least but i did n't really get to see the film in the same way
3,if it does not have to make a sequel i 'd give it 2 out 10,if there had been a decent story or two the characters would 've killed the movie if
3,we see him trying to find a way of dealing the way to get him,we are supposed for the most depressing characters to appear as we get to know many
3,there is also something in the mix to keep the tension,there 's a reason why this movie is a classic
3,considering the budget was low this was not only the greatest movie but it is,considering that the first time they tried to make this movie it failed miserably
3,the first time you see the movie is about a young woman trying to make,the film 's plot is so thin and the story is just a bunch
3,i was expecting a lot more,i have n't seen the first two
3,yes i 've heard the title says the story was n't as good but then it was so bad it,yes they do n't make the same mistake and that 's why i love it but it was n't
3,all the actors in it were very good,all i can think is that this movie should
3,being a fan of the original series it was refreshing and fun to watch,being one of those films i have n't heard that has a great soundtrack i
3,he was a great writer and a great movie maker who could be a genius,he has a great role as the head of an oil dealer who is a bit
3,there are a few moments where the characters are just too much to,there is a great cast of characters and the story moves along
3,the acting was ok and that 's not the case,the movie is about a girl named carly played by her
3,son of the mask is a film that should have been released,son is a pretty good movie but the actors do a good enough
3,well the acting is bad the story is boring and there 's some really stupid stuff that is actually funny in a,well worth watching the first time and if i did see that i would n't watch it i 'd be surprised
3,and that 's about the extent that,and what is up with that
3,in the book the story line is a bit over it,in this film it 's a bit of an oddity that the
3,he 's a great actor but i do have a feeling that he was just,he has a lot to work with here but that would have been nice
3,supernatural thriller is a film about a young boy named seita whose mother 's daughter is murdered and killed by a mysterious accident which turns them around and is constantly,supernatural and the beast is an enjoyable film and one that has all three of the characters being welldeveloped and believable at it 's core of their own lives
3,he does a pretty good job of keeping it going,he is a great actor and i do not have to
3,but i do n't think i 'll ever watch this movie,but there is a lot of things going for her
3,if you want to know a little about the story the movie is n't for everyone,if the film had been released theatrically in theaters i 'd rather watch a few of these
3,there was a little to say the story and was n't,there is a reason why the movie works so well
3,i would say the same thing as the first movie,i am sure that if i had to watch it again
3,the movie 's biggest flaw is that the movie is so dull that the,the film has a few good moments but they never seem too real
3,i would like for that reason alone the film has,i was surprised that they did it so much
3,please note the plot of this film the movie,please do n't be fooled by my friends
3,janet stirling plays the mother of her own,janet blaine is the best thing here
3,other things that make this film work are,other actors have done better than this
3,there 's the odd fact that the film is a bit too long,there are also some really good things to say the least i think the
3,the plot has a good deal of twists and turns and it 's just not that interesting,the first one was a great idea for a good thriller but this one is n't
3,the acting is good the story is well written with a lot of good action,the acting is n't as bad as some other recent movies i saw but it was
3,reissued on the cheap and very very bad movie channels and the fact that i was n't really,reissued as a comedy it is a very enjoyable show and it is definitely worth the time
3,i have to say that the film,i 've been looking forward enough
3,fats who is a man and a woman in the film industry has no qualms about her past,fats is a real hero with whom he 's in it for the rest of the tribeca
3,inevitably it was very difficult to find a movie that i could n't identify,inevitably they were the ones who had been hired to make this movie
3,trapped at a local restaurant in chicago is a film that is worth watching if you have,trapped in the dark and dark the world has to live forever to survive in peace
3,i am not saying this is a film,i would like for this movie but the first
3,wow the plot was a little confusing but i did get the distinct impression it was n't,wow this is the kind of film where people would be ashamed for a decent movie
3,she also has a daughter who does a good deal to,she is an amazing actress and the acting was good
3,even the usually dependable actors in the movie are n't able,even with some good gore scenes and a very good soundtrack and
3,what makes this film a classic is the fact its,what the hell is the point of this movie
3,and if you are into the whole history and want to see a,and then there 's a scene of the guy in a bathtub
3,not only is this a very good movie but it 's a great movie for all,not only do we see the film but i also found myself laughing at it
3,from the first moment i got bored i was shocked,from the opening scene to the end i felt that the
3,unless you are looking for something to watch on a sunday afternoon this is n't the,unless you have read the book you have no idea what 's going to happen
3,not a very bad one as the first half of this movie is very disappointing,not only was it bad but the acting was pretty bad the script is pretty poor
3,putting it bluntly like you are a real fan and have to,putting aside the script the film is a bit of fun
3,cult movie is not a film for people who are looking,cult movies are often a little more enjoyable than this
3,had this not done it again it might have turned out a little too interesting and a little too slow in parts,had it not had for the two leads of the two leads in this film i would n't have given a 10 to
3,but this is an excellent film and should have won awards,but it just is not a film for the whole family and
3,it 's just a fun little flick to watch and i would recommend it,it is a very difficult movie to watch but it 's still not the best
3,and there is a lot of action and suspense,and the ending is a little ambiguous to me
3,meanwhile there is the odd and unexpected fact that this is a good,meanwhile the police find a way to save it from the police
3,but this is one of my favorite horror films of that time period in my view,but that was enough so that i was looking for a bit to the end
3,grandma 's father who was born and had no idea who he was or why she was,grandma is a good guy a woman in a rubber coat a lot of her friends
3,at first micheal 's character is a bit dim but he makes the most of it,at one point i was thinking about the fact that he had to have a few words
3,the film does n't really have a plot and it is n't even about the characters,the film has the same kind of feel it 's done in a very good way
3,javier bardem is also excellent as usual,javier bardem gives his most memorable performance as
3,sends the story to life and the ending of a good one and then,sends me back to my home i will never watch the series again
3,i 've read the book that the book is not a faithful,i think the director is a very sensitive and capable person
3,based on the classic comic strip story a young couple of years old boys who find their way home,based in fact the film is based upon a true book but it is not a film that is so
3,for me i do n't think so much of it is the same way that they do,for example a scene where a man in the middle of a bar gets killed by a car
3,you have to see the movie for yourselves,you will probably be laughing at it and it
3,but the fact that the script is so bad i ca all believe in,but it 's also the same old man who 's the bad guy
3,the film is about the rise to the death of a woman who has been living in her home home in the past,the plot was interesting the characters were likable and believable and the story line was great and the characters were likable and i was
3,thats a little more and i would n't have been a bit more if the plot had a good,thats what i was looking forward for when i saw the preview i thought it was very good
3,absolutely nothing about this film is the worst acting you 're likely for,absolutely nothing happens and i ca n't believe they have to remake this travesty
3,but i would love to know why the film makers have to be so stupid,but there is a lot in that movie to the plot and the ending makes it
3,one of the best movies ever created and,one of my favorite movies of alltime
3,as a result a lot is the poorer,as for this one i'm a big big admirer
3,you have a lot of good things going for it,you have to give it credit but it does
3,i am a fan of the original and i have,i would recommend seeing this if you have n't
3,personal and emotional license has been done,personal instinct is a great movie
3,ok this is not your typical columbo flick,ok i know it 's not a horror movie
3,although there 's some very good gore scenes and the whole thing is a little slow moving to me it seems a little,although it is not the only film that does n't have a lot to offer a story it is n't the best
3,mind you i have seen the movie and i have n't seen a movie that has made me cry,mind spoilers spoilers ahead of the film i thought the movie is a little bit too slow but the plot
3,so it 's the same year,so the story and story are just
3,of all his films this one just was n't as bad,of this being a good horror movie this film is a must
3,the only thing missing is the fact that it has been a long time,the story is about a group of teenagers who are planning for a weekend trip
3,nobody can deny the fact that the film is n't so bad it 's good,nobody else is able for a moment to get a job of the truth and the
3,that is what the movie is like,that is why the movie is not a
3,none of these movies are really funny,none is a good idea for a movie
3,that 's not saying a lot,that 's the main reason why i
3,it is the most boring movie i 've ever played,it 's a pity because it has been the first to
3,apart this film is an insult for the,apart this movie is a good example
3,the only reason i'm glad to see the movie,the script is n't bad at least in some ways
3,this was an excellent episode of the twilight 13,this is one that has been made for a few
3,okay the movie is pretty boring to follow but it is still,okay the story was a bit thin and did make sense
3,unfortunately the film was not very interesting at times,unfortunately i did n't really understand why this show is
3,with all i can say about the film is i think the film is a bit too dark,with the exception of a great cast the characters and story were all pretty well done in this movie
3,the film is an interesting piece of,the film is an absolute mustsee
3,donnie canutt is great and he does n't seem very funny,donnie yen 's character is one of the most important character in
3,unlike the others this one is n't even worth a second look,unlike most films this has to have the power of the doubt and
3,it 's a movie that has some funny bits but it does,it 's the only film that i can recommend you see
3,i saw this when i was in the cinema and was amazed,i would like to know what i like about this film
3,she does n't even want the girl to be in the movie because,she was not only in the film but in all her acting
3,thank you for allowing me for a refund and not,thank god it 's a little over a decade
3,if the script of the movie sounds like it was made for an hour i would have had a good laugh,if you want to see some really bad movie that has some of my favourites and some decent action sequences
3,i was a bit reluctant to see the movie but the acting was horrible the characters were flat and not,i have no idea why this movie was rated pg13 but it was the best one in my library
3,both are great and i love the show it is a great show for all the great,both the characters are so realistic it seems the whole thing is set in real time
3,yeah this movie is a total rip together,yeah it 's a great little story but i
3,after watching the movie i could n't help wondering if this was a good idea or not it was a movie that i,after seeing the movie and seeing it on tv i was really impressed at its ineptitude and it had so much promise
3,its a movie for kids and kids who want to be entertained but if you 're looking,its not the best movie that you can see but it 's one of his best
3,gus van peebles is a very talented actor and he 's great in the title,gus is very funny and is not only one of the funniest actors but a great
3,2054 was n't a film in the box office and it does n't even,2054 and the new york skyline of the film was a big hit
3,no wonder i was watching this movie i could n't help but feel,no wonder he is not given the credit of his own life
3,men are not as good or as the bad guys,men who are n't so much more human and are n't
3,the plot is not even that funny and it 's hard for you to believe,the film is n't a good film but it is a very enjoyable film
3,you will be surprised to find that it is not an oscar winning film,you can see the film is n't the greatest movie ever made and certainly it
3,the film is very much the same although it is very clear that,the acting is n't bad the plot is n't a great one
3,the first half of a movie like this one was a waste for the film which is about as funny,the script is n't bad it has the worst acting i 've ever seen the camera shots are terrible
3,but this movie is n't really good,but i ca n't help thinking that he
3,what was up here with a little girl 's eyes,what makes this show so good are the performances
3,all the way through the movie there are no surprises,all in all it 's the only thing i did n't
3,when the film is over to a young audience member of the film the film,when it 's revealed he is a great person for this type of film
3,so why did we care so much about what it is that we get to see it,so why not a good example of the kind of movie in a long time of a movie
3,one of the worst movies ever,one thing i did n't like about
3,sorry i am not one to say that this movie is bad,sorry but the plot line is so ridiculous that you 'll be able
3,i was hoping for a real treat but i could n't,i do not think i 've ever been to have seen such
3,this is a film that should be enjoyed to all schools,this is not just another film it 's the same
3,and if you 're looking for a good thriller you will enjoy it,and it 's not funny to see a woman who is n't as attractive
3,at first i thought that there were some interesting elements but i would not have given the film a lower score,at a time in a life where a group is the best of the bunch they become corrupted and the men are
3,the film has some good action sequences but it 's so predictable and badly directed it makes it a little tedious,the plot is so thin that it 's almost painful and the plot has been written by a man who does n't
3,walter pidgeon plays his role as the main villain,walter matthau plays the father and is very likable as
3,in the end the film does a nice job with it 's message,in my opinion this is one of brynner 's best roles in this movie
3,btw i did get the idea that they were going,btw i think the movie is a good one
3,i think i could n't be wrong about,i was n't expecting this to happen
3,there was some interesting character development that was well developed to me but it could not be developed,there is a reason for the lack in life of the young woman that the girl who is supposed
3,i would have given up the film to get,i was n't sure about it until then
3,i would like this film but it is n't as bad,i was so surprised by the way i was able
3,entwined in the film 's best film of its kind and a great performance by the two leads it,entwined with the other actors in the film the only good thing is that it was n't bad
3,and then the scene in which the camera is in the car with the camera,and if i were to rate the film as 1 i would give the film as
3,antonioni 's direction is so good that i have to,antonioni 's film is a film for the ages
3,performance is the only reason why the,performance is a very good choice
3,the story is a little bit slow to follow but i found it to be one that is not worth the investment of the dvd,the story is very similar in a way to make it a good movie and i have to give a positive comment on the ending
3,since i have a lot more of a budget than i did i would n't even watch this movie and if you are,since i was in a coma when this film premiered i could n't wait until a movie to be released on dvd
3,a lot happens to me but i 've never seen any other film in a million years,a film that has been a success for me and i would n't be able to watch the
3,also the ending is so lame that you 'll never see anything,also the acting was horrible and the plot was very weak
3,there is n't a dull one,there 's also a lot of action
3,crow is an amazing film and the acting by everyone,crow a film with the same name as the one with
3,the film 's climax is also marred with very little dialogue in the final,the story is simple to the extreme but the story is very simple
3,in the end there was a lot of,in fact he is a great actor
3,and the scene in the bar with his son is hilarious and i laughed at,and that 's about it for all the people who like to see it
3,this is the most disturbing of the lot,this is a great film for those interested in
3,i think i would give it another star but it was n't worth,i am not a big believer in the plot of the movie
3,the first is the most beautiful music ever sung,the only redeeming feature that i can think about was
3,the film is a complete mess from the opening shot of a couple to a shot of an,the first part of a movie is n't really the same as the one with the characters
3,i have seen it in the us and i have to admit that i 've seen,i do n't know why this film is not available on dvd in the us
3,i was n't impressed by the story line or the character development but this movie is,i was hoping the movie would get out on a loop and i would n't
3,obviously the movie had a lot in common with the old man and it had the same theme,obviously the film makers had a lot of potential and wanted some cash for a good story that could
3,the film is an adaptation of a,the film is a complete failure
3,last year i saw the movie,last and then the film begins as
3,how about the first time we were n't subjected to it being in the middle,how about the plot to make it a little less entertaining and the characters are just
3,people who like this movie are n't very good,people are talking about the story but the acting of
3,the film is a little bit of the spoof,the first one is very good in its original but
3,i saw that movie in the theater and was shocked at the quality,i have seen the first movie so far i have n't seen it but
3,charlotte 's performance is a bit overdone but it really is n't a good movie and the acting is horrible in,charlotte rampling is excellent in this movie and she 's just a good girl in the movie she looks good
3,hey this is the first film that i saw i had n't even watched the,hey that 's right the first movie was so horrible i wanted a refund
3,beyond all the characters the story is very predictable and,beyond that it is a complete failure to watch
3,what 's worse is that the director,what a wonderful idea it is
3,at one point a group gets shot in the head in a car and it 's almost like they 've spent a couple of hours trying to make the audience,at first sight he is a jerk but a good boy who is not afraid to be a hero is a good thing that makes him a good actor
3,it was a good movie with a great story but i could not help but enjoy it more than ever i will always watch,it was a very nice movie and i think that it was one that i watched as the first film i was watching
3,the only reason why i rated this movie 1 star instead is 1 0 rating zero for the film,the only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack that was made on the cover and a number of
3,the only problem is this is n't the worst film i 've ever had a displeasure in the history of cinema but this movie is,the plot line is not so bad it 's a joke and the script does n't seem to have a shred on it either
3,it was so bad that the director was so embarrassed and,it 's not even the good of the bad guys
3,i do n't even know how much i loved him but it,i do not know where it will take me to this
3,now i have seen it again and i can still feel my iq for,now it was a movie that was n't as funny as the first
3,the film is a little slow moving but not a very good film and it 's too bad,the film has a certain creepiness which is the first of the many movies that i 've had to
3,anyone who is willing to see this movie is probably the only reason i should be ashamed to see this film,anyone else is a fan of the first movie and even though there was some pretty decent special effects to speak the
3,last year i watched one of those movies,last and only a brief glimpse at the world
3,ok let 's make it clear about this,ok i 'll admit i was not expecting to
3,if it had any good intentions it would have been a decent movie,if you have read the novel you might find this movie very disappointing
3,wells 's direction is a little shaky,wells 's movie is an entertaining one
3,aside the film does n't really matter,aside this is one film that i have
3,i think it 's a shame it is n't as bad as i 'd,i think it 's one of the worst movie to come from tv
3,as an american director myself i could n't understand,as the movie continues its plot moves forwards
3,i think you have to see this movie,i have never had any idea what to expect
3,overall this movie does n't have a single word,overall the film was quite a bit of fun to
3,i was really impressed and i have n't,i was really surprised that i did
3,the plot is a complete bore but the acting is so bad that they actually become comical,the film is not very much in color and the acting in the first half was just bad
3,an excellent actor and a fine actor and a fine actress,an example of this was the ending which is very disappointing
3,a lot is left unanswered to be made but the story of this film is very interesting in,a few people have commented on this film as well because their parents are the same people
3,stray dog is one film of my childhood and it 's one big disappointment,stray dog is not an action film as it is a bit more action than
3,yeah it did not have to be the worst of all,yeah this is the worst i 've yet to watch
3,apart the movie 's a great deal of money,apart of the two characters in the movie it seemed
3,this is a very very bad movie and the worst part of it was that it took me a couple,this is the best thing about the movie i think it 's the best movie of the 90 years
3,he does not make much money and he does not know what to do,he does it with the help from his fellow colleagues to get the big truck
3,a movie about a man trying to make a living and his friends,a good movie about a group of young kids trying their way out a
3,ho vinci mayer and a host were a good choice to watch,ho ho na hai is a movie that has a profound message about
3,anna sten was very convincing and her acting as well as her eventual and professional performance,anna paquin plays the role as she 's in a movie with a strong performance
3,the plot is very simple for the film but it does,the acting was good the story is great the direction is perfect
3,i do n't know if this was intentional and not that bad but at,i saw a screening on the video cover which was a great movie
3,in a scene where we see the young woman being shot,in the end this one was n't a bad one
3,viggo mortensen plays a character who seems to get out of control and eventually becomes a big,viggo kaufman directed the film as the most decorated movie i have ever seen in him
3,although i do n't want my children as they 're not so funny in this movie it is n't the same,although this is a very good movie i think that the director of the movie should not be able to find it
3,yes there was no real explanation for it,yes you guessed it a bit but i think
3,the movie starts off ok but it is not,the movie is not for kids who have no knowledge
3,several of the supporting cast are excellent particularly in their,several people who think it 's a good film
3,in the movie the viewer was left thinking,in the end there is an ending which is
3,there is also a good scene where the girl 's dad goes down a ladder of a road and gets stabbed,there really was n't a good idea in this mess but the fact is that it 's just a bunch
3,i have to admit to all my comments,i saw this at the boston film festival in
3,he does n't want to make a big deal but is just a,he does n't get the point of the story it is n't
3,the acting ranges between the characters and the story,the movie 's main drawback was the fact that it
3,i think it 's a very good movie,i do n't care about the fact it 's
3,my only regret was the fact that the director was in the right place,my favorite character is the father played the game as his own mother
3,i am glad i did not go to see the movie,i was so bored and surprised by how awful i could be
3,the only way the film would work if it had been in a good movie is that the film never fails to deliver,the acting is so awful that it 's almost impossible for any actress to make it into a movie or a character study of
3,i 've seen worse films and this one has to go to hell,i think that the movie does make it very difficult for us to get
3,it 's a very bad film in the sense of a story,it also shows how the world can come together in a good and
3,basically a group in this film are all going to be a bunch of idiots on a camping island,basically there are some good points in the plot but they never do it in a very believable way
3,then the film goes on and on and on,then the movie switches gears from the very first minute
3,if the film is a comedy or a comedy or a serious drama,if this is supposed to make a film a little more entertaining
3,fortunately it 's not a bad movie,fortunately the story itself was a bit weak
3,after a long time of the film 's success i found myself wondering where was the director 's intent,after all the story about a young man who has a heart attack to be sacrificed for murder and the
3,the story of a boy is a little bit complicated in,the acting is so bad that it 's so bad
3,imo it 's a little slow paced,imo this is a must see
3,get the right to go to see it,get to see it in one scene
3,in my opinion this was a wonderful show,in addition to this film i thought a movie
3,this movie was a very enjoyable one and i hope it gets a lot more attention,this film is a masterpiece in every respect and in all honesty it deserves a wider release
3,at the end you 're not even sure if it was a good movie or a bad one,at one time i saw a preview screening of a film on the cover and thought this was a
3,all in the family in this movie are the people that should have been proud,all the women in the movie are a bunch of people from an old house
3,widmark 's film does n't work as well as,widmark was a wonderful actor in this movie
3,it was not a movie that could have gone on,it was a great movie and i recommend you to watch
3,another reviewer mentioned that the plot was n't that good either and the ending is,another thing that really annoyed the film was when the plot twists rolled in
3,spoiler spoilers alert there is a lot to like about the plot and it 's just a shame that they did,spoiler ahead there 's a twist about how they go and get the idea to kill each other 's love
3,i'm not going by that but i did enjoy a,i'm not a fan of the first two films
3,the acting is so good that you can almost smell her head at the,the first half of a film of this film is not that bad
3,but the story is a bit too slow,but it 's just so damn good
3,the plot is a bit of a,the story is a bit weak
3,much like a movie that is a bit more interesting than the original one i did n't know what,much like a lot like the other films of the same kind with the same exact same story
3,for those who are a little bit interested with a little bit and,for the rest of the time it 's not even bad enough
3,so i can understand a movie with the subtitles that make a bad movie,so if you 're looking for a film about the evils between two characters that
3,but it was so bad that the director and director decided to make a buck,but then again i would have been a little more confused to watch it
3,pay off the bills for this turkey,pay off for the dvd and dvd version
3,i was surprised by the way he was portrayed but the way,i was very surprised to find this one in a library
3,episode 3 is a very boring movie,episode of this is the same old story
3,acting is not bad and the plot just does not work at all and you get to see the main actors of the movie who are,acting is ok but the story is n't too bad at least in the end it 's not even funny enough to keep you watching
3,i think that i 've seen the film alot of,i do n't know how much i liked it
3,and it was the first film i saw i,and it was the worst of the worst
3,for those who are n't familiar enough with the story of the film i highly suggest the director to get the story,for instance the two of us are a young girl and the mother of an old flame and her sister is in her
3,i would not recommend that this is a great movie to view in an instant,i think that the film 's creator was a little more than an extra to the
3,would this film be made in a different way than the,would n't be a lot like the film 's own
3,it was a great movie to watch and i was really amazed to learn i would have seen it on,it 's not even bad enough for the family and the rest of the movie are just plain boring
3,that 's all there really is,that was the only thing that made
3,my friends and i rented this movie for the video,my friend told my friends to watch this movie
3,but this one is n't that funny,but this is not a good movie but
3,what a pity he was in this film,what 's with the girls on their way
3,this is one of those shows that is n't even remotely interesting as the story,this film is the epitome of what 's right and what a movie is
3,but the film is not for everyone,but there 's something about this that i
3,she 's the kind of guy who would make her character believable,she does n't get a chance to develop it with the slightest and
3,that 's why this film is so bad it makes me laugh,that 's how you 'd be able a film that 's so bad
3,her mother is also a bit of the toughest girl,her performance as a woman is also very good as in
3,to make this a little more interesting i do think that it is a very,to make this film worse the film does not have that much to say
3,i was so disappointed when this film was released,i am so upset that this is the only movie
3,those who love the first movie is the same as the one that is the,those of us looking for a good film are advised to check this film
3,i was n't sure whether this was a joke,i was n't impressed by the movie and it would
3,there are many moments that are very effective and the actors and director seem very talented as the actors who,there 's a lot to be said about this film that i did have to admit to the title
3,every episode is a classic and the characters in particular are also,every time i watch it i feel sorry for the guy
3,however as it stands it 's very simple,however this film is so awful it hurts
3,this is a great movie for those who enjoy movies with a message,this film was so bad that i actually thought it was going to take
3,in the first movie the characters were so believable,in my opinion it is a great movie
3,the story is a bit slow but the script,the script for this movie is a joke
3,if the script could have been a bit better the film would probably have been a much better experience for me,if i were n't so much younger and had the same problem with this movie i 'd never been so annoyed and
3,and that is n't exactly the only thing,and the film is a total bore
3,then the camera pans out and then the next thing we know that the director must see it,then the movie switches into a very dark and disturbing ending and the viewer never loses interest
3,belle is the perfect man who gets her own way,belle does n't even want the girl 's boyfriend and she
3,there was some great music and a very haunting score,there was a lot to like about the show
3,when he was on the scene the film was shot,when a film is made to entertain people it will be
3,for the first hour in which it is revealed how a movie is set in the first place we get the idea,for some reason i was not sure whether to laugh a couple times or the other half of this movie or just have
3,at least in my book the director has,at first the plot seems very familiar
3,mask of a geisha a very different genre of action and a,mask 's story of two of us is a real classic
3,the only way this movie was going were the scenes of the,the film is a great snapshot in the culture of war
3,by that i mean there are a few redeeming quality and i 'll say it again,by a time in my life the film was not about a young boy 's life
3,also the music was good too,also i found the film very entertaining
3,instead it makes you think the story of the film is the most important part of the movie,instead he was given a choice by a fellow producer and an actress who was a bit of a
3,erm that is a great thing to,erm i do recommend this one
3,zombi 2 was released on the cheap channel 's saturday june,zombi 3 is the only good movie of all time
3,the script has a couple of twists and turns that is so bad you ca n't help wondering,the movie 's biggest flaw is the casting by peter cushing and the rest of his cast
3,the film also does not have that much of anything resembling it and is a very poor movie,the film also has a great deal of atmosphere and atmosphere that is so effective that it 's difficult
3,ok so i guess i have to say that the,ok so the acting in this is very weak
3,wow you know that 's the whole idea of the film,wow this is what i thought was going on in my mouth
3,the story line is about a man who has been living in the past and his,the film is a bit too slow and the pacing was n't even that great
3,it 's a shame that the movie did n't have that kind as a good movie,it 's a great movie to watch with the kids but it 's not as good as
3,another thing is i was wrong about it when the movie was released,another thing i noticed above that i thought that the film was a total
3,this is an excellent film about two people who,this movie is not even worth a rental
3,well i do n't think i will,well i do n't have to worry about
3,when the first scene is a bit of a drama the film is set up in a way that the viewer can relate to and then the audience,when the story takes place in the middle of nowhere there is a scene that makes the movie a bit of what i would call the audience
3,goodnight is a movie that you will,goodnight is a very good movie
3,let us start by the fact that the story is not very original,let us get back together to get our hands on this turkey
3,the only reason i could n't give it a zero was because i could see that some parts are really funny in,the plot was a bit confusing and the plot line is so predictable i could n't even think about any one
3,you know what you 're missing in this movie but it 's a little too long for a,you do n't really want to have to have the same feeling as in the original version
3,it is very good to see the actors perform,it has a good plot line but it does have
3,i am so glad i did and i did n't watch the whole movie but i,i do remember a good deal but i did n't think so was the story
3,and what a great idea this is,and the whole thing is just too long
3,now we 're left to decide if we do n't really know about the plot or the characters that we are told to believe in,now i was a little skeptical and the film really was a little slow but i did not feel the film could n't even have done
3,but there 's nothing more that i ca n't describe,but i have to admit i was n't expecting a whole
3,there is n't much to the story in the first place so i suppose it 's,there was no need for it to be shown and there are some funny scenes
3,one thing that makes the movie is the fact the director is in fact trying so hard for her,one of the worst things i 've ever seen was the first time i heard about the movie
3,strangely the movie was a lot like the original,strangely it 's a shame because they are all too
3,i'm glad i got this movie on the big trail,i'm glad i did but it was not the first
3,a few of the other reviewers have written here,a very interesting movie about a young boy who has
3,yesterday i thought the movie had the same effect on me as i had been a fan of,yesterday i have seen this movie a few years and i have to say i did it
3,i saw it a few years ago and thought the film was very funny but i,i would love to have a copy that i could have chosen in a theater
3,but i did n't really like him in anything but the fact that the,but the plot and the story just make you want to watch it
3,this is just the same as you 've seen in other movies,this is a movie you 'll see as well as the first time
3,parallels with the original film are the same as the first one and the same as the one with the exception of,parallels to the story in this film are not even mentioned at all it 's a movie with a good ending
3,however there was some great acting,however it is the most powerful film
3,handsome young man with a penchant of disability is an important character and has,handsome little boy who has been a doe for a few months now
3,he is a man who loves a lot of the other,he is not a bad guy but a good guy
3,i would have been happy to have this on a shelf,i 've been a teenager to see this movie since i saw
3,and the ending is a bit abrupt,and it is not as simple as the
3,you can tell that this is an excellent film but it 's just not enough of that and it 's really not even worth buying for anyone who wants something,you will have an alibi and you 're not going to get into this story of a man and you have to go out of my way with this one as
3,if the film was not for the music the actors and the,if you 've ever seen this movie do yourself an favor
3,ironic how much more would i say,ironic to see him play his part with
3,please please if your idea about how to obtain an entire episode of the first film you 'll find a good copy,please please let it know that there is no point about the movie and the plot is just a bit boring too and
3,while it may sound interesting it might have some good laughs and a good cast,while it does n't have the feel to it it is still a really enjoyable movie
3,where 's my heart skipped in the,where do these guys get from
3,dustin hoffman is great here but he plays,dustin hoffman is great in this movie
3,poorer than a movie like the godfather,poorer luck is what this movie is about
3,he also had no trouble finding the killer in the first movie,he 's also the perfect villain and the rest does not seem convincing
3,in short this is a movie that should be viewed to be believed for the end of your life,in fact there 's a lot more to say in this film than most films like this do
3,the plot is a complete mess of the movie 's own and,the only redeeming value of it is its lack of realism
3,in my case it 's one of the most boring,in fact it was an insult for a film
3,the movie is a bit slow for a long time,the story is so weak and the characters are so stupid
3,after the first hour it becomes clear why the film was so poorly written,after watching this film the first half of its film is a little bit of
3,all i saw on was a very bad movie and not funny,all in all this is one of the best films i have seen
3,young men have the strength and innocence of an ordinary and wealthy young man,young man has to be the best person in the world and he 's not
3,it 's an interesting and compelling story of the life of the great hulk hogan,it is a very interesting film and i recommend it to anyone that does not appreciate
3,i would like to give it a 0 out there because of the acting,i was expecting a bit of the movie and i liked this one
3,time travel is a very entertaining and very entertaining action picture and it is a film that you 'll enjoy,time travel is not one that i can remember but the first time i saw it i was a fan of
3,the movie is a mess of the original,the acting ranges from decent to excellent
3,evil breed is a great example,evil and the snowman is just as
3,they all had their own personality and that 's what you would expect from the movie,they all seemed like an afterthought and they were n't really all that impressed either they did
3,two of the best actors in this movie,two of them were killed and murdered
3,anybody in this world would have had a better chance if i could have been,anybody that thinks this is the worst thing on film should watch this movie
3,so i am a big big fan of horror,so much time was spent in the plot
3,i saw that in a movie with a few exceptions of the time it had been in the theatres and i thought,i 've heard that they had done it but they never made any of these movies and that was a shame
3,i saw this film at the waterfront international film,i would not recommend this movie to anyone
3,the first time he is in the film is the most important scene he can remember,the acting is n't bad although the actors are not good at any level either
3,thumbs off for those with little knowledge that this film is a real stinker,thumbs up for a little bit of a stretch to watch the movie as the
3,either way this is the worst movie i 've watched in the last 15 years,either i just did not care about any of the characters or the plot
3,i think they 're trying to make the point of,i was n't expecting much to see the movie
3,they all are in a good place,they 're not just that bad but they
3,definitely this is n't a good film,definitely one of my favorite movies but it
3,then it takes a little too seriously to be funny or even interesting at the same turn,then we have a bunch of men running around a city dressed as a bunch and lots and
3,if the movie had made it to the first movie it would have been a lot more fun but the director,if you have n't heard of it before you should have the chance on watching a movie with that much
3,the film is a total waste,the story is not so bad and
3,high rating for this film is the fact it is one of the most original movie ive ever seen and it was one of the first films i would watch for any consideration,high rating for the first half of this film was the fact that the film makers had the audacity for their craft to create a good movie that 's just not very good
3,i was expecting it was a bad movie but it was very entertaining,i saw the movie and the movie was a bit of boring
3,the first is a good film,the story is a little weak
3,one of the best comedies i have ever seen,one of my favorites has been the worst movie ever
3,no one else is good in this film,no i do n't know what this film is
3,this one was a waste in a nutshell,this is a film that i think of the
3,this is an excellent film with a,this is the worst movie ever
3,the film has a couple good points and some interesting twists,the only reason to see the movie is the acting by everyone
3,would have been an interesting experience,would you like to know that a
3,i am a huge fan of the original movie and,i 've seen many bad movies in my life
3,o'toole has a great deal to be a,o'toole was a very good character actor
3,yes i was n't impressed by the film,yes the film had a good story but the
3,well the acting was good and i was surprised,well this is the worst of all movies
3,lois chiles is a revelation in a way that is never explained in a film,lois moore and the rest is pretty decent as a villain of the genre
3,great movie for all the good reasons,great performances from a cast with a very
3,incidentally this film has been released on video for sale in the,incidentally this show should have gone down to a different level
3,nelson 's character and the plot development,nelson is not a great director
3,i'm a fan and i am amazed how bad this movie is i just have to say that i,i'm surprised that it was so bad and the only thing i wanted to see were the previews
3,i am a fan of the genre of films,i would have been surprised to see how it got
3,she also has a soft spot for her,she 's not even funny at all
3,in my view the film 's main focus was to have it all in the form,in my opinion it would have had some good scenes and some decent acting from everyone
3,however there are several moments of brilliance to give up the story and a few scenes of the film,however the film is not so much a drama as a film that you do not want to watch it
3,since then we 're not so much more than that but we have to be careful about this one and it does n't matter,since it was made in 1979 i was surprised by this show and i think it 's a great film and i hope you never
3,surprisingly the film is a little bit of a bore because,surprisingly enough it did n't have that great special fx
3,it 's an amazing film and it was nominated,it is a very simple and compelling film
3,sanders 's character has no depth or depth,sanders 's character is the only one in the
3,despite the fact this story is a lot of fun,despite the presence of a young actor who plays the most
3,since i have n't seen a more recent film i have to admit that i was not disappointed with it,since i have been able to locate this film by the way i have a lot of experience i have to
3,the script by neil simon who is n't a bad guy,the movie is just a waste story on the runofthemill
3,if the viewer was n't laughing at the end then i was n't,if you 're a fan like me i 'd definitely advise you
3,the first half of the film is about a woman named seita and her father who have to go,the film is about two people living on each day together and each other in a different way
3,rent the dvd of his play and get his hands on the jacket,rent this to find a good movie for a rainy afternoon of your day
3,i was n't a big movie buff when this movie came about,i would not recommend it to anybody with a severe sense of humor
3,then there are some very very good songs,then the story is told that it could n't
3,he also has a lot to live for,he plays the role of a very rich father
3,this film was so horrible that i was shocked at how bad it was,this movie is just so funny and so stupid that i just do n't think
3,nonetheless i was very surprised that the film was so poorly edited,nonetheless i found this film to be quite entertaining but i would n't
3,first of all the acting is horrible,first we are talking to the director and
3,it is n't the best movie of the series but it certainly stands out from all the hype that this is currently based upon on a,it is a movie about a young boy 's life as he tries desperately to find a way for his family to be his father
3,it 's just that the characters were believable and i found it refreshing to see a film that would have been,it 's a shame that the director did n't seem very comfortable and the film was not even remotely funny
3,lots to tell a tale from the first movie,lots of action and some pretty funny bits
3,assassin who is a very human human,assassin of death is a film that has
3,oh and i 've seen a lot,oh yeah i 've seen this movie a
3,i would n't have seen this movie in the least,i would have rated this film a 1 but this movie
3,spoilers spoilers the movie 's main theme is,spoilers ahead the acting is pretty awful
3,and it 's so funny it was almost laughable at times,and there 's a reason why the show is still on tv
3,the only problem i have with the film is that it has the worst acting,the film 's title is a complete failure that does n't really make sense
3,thankfully it 's not the same movie with the same,thankfully this is a movie that is so bad
3,i think this is the first of many films that i have seen the original and i think that was a shame because,i was really excited about the movie and the way it was shot i could n't wait to get to the theater
3,i'm a bit prejudiced of the film because i'm glad the movie,i'm sure they were going to get rid of the story
3,the plot and character development of the first episode was very good,the movie was so bad it made it hard to sit through and
3,it 's a shame that the movie is so bad that it,it has a lot of action scenes and plenty of twists
3,however i was n't really disappointed by the film,however i did not like this movie because of the
3,when the story was made i thought this was going to get old and then i got bored,when the movie ends and we learn the mystery and tension and the viewer is left wanting to know
3,mr hyde has to have an ego,mr bean is just as funny as the
3,the movie also stars robert ryan as dr the son of a wealthy banker,the acting was ok and the story line was very intriguing but the story line
3,this was the first movie i saw with,this movie has a very low rating
3,it is not a bad horror movie,it has a very nice twist ending which
3,it is not a good movie but it is very good,it was a very nice movie to make fun of as well
3,what i liked was that i wanted,what is the deal in trying
3,if you do not believe that you 're going for a movie that is not worth,if it did it was the same for all the other actorsactresses in this one
3,donald moffat 's character is a real charmer,donald pleasance is the best in the picture he
3,what the film has a great cast is that it is a film that is not just,what i did n't like about it was a bit of a lot of the movie
3,jean gabin is a great actor but i do not think that the,jean negulesco is a very strong actor with a very good accent
3,for me i think i would give this movie a higher vote,for instance the movie was released in a time where the film was
3,i would like this to be a good film but i do,i think that this one should have been a good movie
3,at times it seems the film is a mess in the style of the film 's success,at one point he 's the hero and he says he has a fight at an army
3,overall this movie is a total bore,overall i give this an 8 out 10
3,scott baio was the only good character in it,scott baio has been on a mission to save his
3,and then there is the plot,and i did not see a lot
3,when she returns a little she is sent to a mental hospital by the police as if they were n't going to go on the run,when i saw the preview i thought that this was an interesting film i had seen it several times before and it seemed that the film was
3,the acting of this movie is horrible,the film also contains some very funny gags
3,the film was a lot more fun,the film is a total mess of the
3,her character is also very likable,her character is a very complex character
3,this is a very good movie but not a bad movie,this movie has a very bad script and it is a waste
3,the film is a total mess of a,the plot and dialogue is all right
3,jekyll 's performance is also a good thing,jekyll 's character is so stupid it 's untrue
3,so why was it so much more,so what is the deal with these kids
3,it 's a pity that the filmmakers never thought that,it 's the worst show i have ever seen
3,but it is the story of the life that is being,but it just seemed too contrived for a pg film
3,only one person could not identify,only one word of advice is the
3,basically this is a bad attempt to be a serious,basically it is a movie that should be seen
3,it 's just the same old time in the same way as this one,it 's the only good thing that i have ever said about this film and
3,spoofing it is a very funny movie that should be shown,spoofing it for the most part it was n't bad
3,haruhi snaps and is so funny and so fun that it 's hard enough for,haruhi rogers is a good choice as an actress in this type of movie
3,here it 's an endless parade of events and the story is very simple,here are two of the main players who are not a real person in a
3,he has a very difficult task of getting to the bottom of the mystery,he does n't even have to be the one to kill her but he ca
3,there are some scenes where he tries to show that she is a,there are a few scenes that do n't come off as well
3,seeing a film that was n't as good as the original is a,seeing a man of the past was a real pleasure to watch
3,as for this movie i would have liked it,as the movie unfolds the plot develops more
3,despite that the movie is a good example of a very bad movie that is very entertaining and has great,despite the shortcomings that it did n't have a strong cast it 's a film worth renting on dvd
3,the movie is a good thriller with a lot more plot,the story is pretty weak and the acting is horrible as far
3,his character was n't the same actor,his wife and daughter are both attractive and
3,it is a great performance by the actor who plays a young,it would be a nice idea to have a better movie
3,the story line is so bad that it 's laughable enough so that i could spend more time eliminating the characters or at least a bit,the first half hour and so it 's a pretty good movie but that 's not enough that this film did n't do a whole lot for
3,moreover it 's not a film that is,moreover it does have a great cast
3,maybe the movie is about a family and their problems in life are n't explored,maybe i just have to see the worst movies on the big screen if not for
3,there is a lot going on in the world but the plot is so simple and,there is a little bit of nudity and some nudity and a lot of nudity
3,in fact i think that 's a shame because it has to have been a big success,in short this movie has a very bad story line and an awful script to boot
3,i have never heard a word spoken about that character so it 's all a little contrived but i do have to agree with me at imdb about how he was able to make a movie,i was hoping for a great movie to make you think about the first thing we did to the end but it seemed a little contrived and not really funny and there 's no plot
3,they have the right to tell the truth about what is going,they do a fine work with the material of a film
3,imagined to be one that should have gone away from the first one,imagined is the film 's best asset in that it is a little bit
3,tabloid tv series shows some of the same problems as the first movie,tabloid idol 's character is so annoying that it 's hard to believe it
3,the only redeeming feature that i can think of is that the movie is,the movie is not a great movie but it has some nice points
3,i think the reason this movie works is to make the film work on the whole,i would n't say this is a good film but it is not bad enough
3,the film has been cut to a point where the film has a certain amount of suspense and it is a bit jarring at the,the plot is pretty basic the actors who seem like it 's not going to be the ones that have been trying too much
3,this film was not only the finest movie but it had no purpose,this is not a film for everyone but for people who do n't know
3,the acting was n't that bad but the characters were so lame and unbelievable i,the only way i was able was to watch the movie to see it
3,you 'll find this in a very interesting film,you 'll be able for a movie that does n't
3,the film is very very slow paced and it 's not as good either,the story is n't that great and the actors are all pretty bad
3,sylvester stallone does the best he can get the job of his role,sylvester stallone is a great comedian who has done so many times
3,i was hoping to see more of his work but,i think that 's what this movie has done
3,at first it seems like a bad movie but,at first it is a very good movie
3,i do have a soft spot on,i was expecting this to happen
3,it is the kind of movie that is n't a bad,it has a good cast and a very strong cast
3,saw that movie at my local video shop i was,saw that there was no need to be made
3,its not just a bunch of people,its a great piece of work
3,the acting is good and the script is a good one,the script is not a very clever movie and the acting is
3,to be honest i would not want to spoil this film,to the devil and the whale is not that bad
3,this film was not even close to,this is a pretty bad film
3,as for all the technical flaws of a movie like the one i can say this the one that,as it is that the plot was very good i was n't sure who it 's trying for
3,whatever it 's a great movie to make your friends laugh at the movie,whatever the point of it 's predecessor and of course there is a good cast
3,the film was made to entertain,the script for this movie was so
3,i think the film is one that will never be made,i was surprised by the lack and credence of this movie in
3,i 've never seen this film but i did,i was really bored and wanted to see this movie
3,uncomfortable with the fact of the matter that it 's a film that you will never want your parents to see,uncomfortable to say the best way to describe a movie like the title is a very funny one and that does n't
3,mary astor plays the role of the daughter and daughter who is not only in one room a little bit,mary and albert are the only ones on the outside of their respective and the film 's eventual attempts to escape
3,none of the characters and the film just drags,none of these actors could act so easily
3,we know that there is a real killer who is n't going back to the past,we are left with a feeling of a love triangle that has been told to the extent
3,some of the scenes of the show are very funny,some of the scenes are a bit corny but the overall
3,in fact the entire movie is a mess,in the end the movie has some good moments
3,studio executives should give credit to the writers for giving the best performance in this flick that they 've ever been given,studio ghibli has made the film debut and is now regarded in the film 's best selling of the worst films ever made
3,but there was so many things going on in this movie that i actually felt like watching it,but the film is so bad and that i was surprised that the entire movie ended up as a
3,if you can find a good movie about this movie it will be a,if you can watch it you will enjoy that it is a movie
3,i was a little confused when i saw this movie,i do n't know where it 's heading and why but
3,should n't they be all the smartest,should have been the last scene in which
3,as a child of mine i was very surprised at how this man was going through the trauma,as i said it 's not that good or interesting either but i think the director was trying to
3,as a result a lot of the scenes are shot and the camera is very slow,as a result of the movie 's reputation it 's still a great deal to look at
3,nothing is done properly and it 's a shame that,nothing is done properly and you have the impression
3,there was a scene where a group of people are sitting there in a,there really is n't a lot more in this movie to be seen
3,chris farley was a bit more convincing than usual but his character does n't really work,chris benoit plays his usual self and he is very funny as an actor who has a
3,so what is that about that the movie is just too boring and,so the movie is about a bunch that has a different story
3,this movie was so bad it was funny,this is one film you should not be tempted
3,there is an odd amount to the story and,there were two things i did n't understand
3,he 's a real jerk for all of his classmates,he also has some of his most interesting and unique roles
3,by a chance he was in the military of the army and he did n't know how he got the job to get a hold of his head for the big boss,by the end of this film the film was over a little longer than it actually was but that did n't make it interesting enough to justify the overall impact of this film
3,dan is a man with a beard,dan aykroyd does a good job as a
3,whoever thought that the film was a good idea is n't necessarily it,whoever decided that the director was going through a whole lot more time to
3,of this the director is not afraid of,of course it does not come out
3,screenwriters of this movie should have been fired,screenwriters like myself who think that the real world
3,tears and fury are not what you,tears and ears are the norm
3,naturally there is a scene in which a man 's mother and daughter are trapped in a car,naturally a few years later he is a man who is trying to get a job of his own
3,this movie is a masterpiece of art,this is a very bad movie which is
3,this is the first movie i have watched with,this is one hell of an awful film
3,i was n't really impressed but in my view of this show,i saw this movie on a friday night with my girlfriend
3,actually it 's a good movie for the whole time,actually if you 've seen the first film this would be
3,somerset mchugh as an actor and the supporting cast was good too but i do n't think that the acting was bad,somerset is just an average guy trying to find a killer but the other kids are still a bit of a wimp in
3,if there 's ever an attempt to inject something that is not the worst movie of all,if this is the first time i saw it i can remember it being a classic
3,most people think it was a great idea to make another good film that was made,most of the acting is bad and the story just seems to be about a little girl
3,his character is a complete buffoon,his performance was pretty bad and that
3,bill murray 's character is a joke,bill nighy plays a young woman with the
3,the plot of the movie involves three people in the same apartment building,the only redeeming feature of this movie is that there were a lot to
3,dressed in black it is a beautiful movie for the whole generation it,dressed in black and yellow as a film is a real treat
3,i was n't even born in a high school and was a teenager and i was really disappointed with this one i was just appalled by the story line,i have seen this film a dozen dozen times and every time i have seen the film i can only hope to learn that it has n't aged
3,it 's also a film that i,it 's not all that bad
3,a film that has been released on dvd for several generations in the,a good cast of characters that i have seen over the years
3,i would say the only reason i give this movie 10 out,i do n't know why this movie was not released theatrically
3,prey is a story where you have to see a,prey was the worst movie i have ever seen
3,in fact i was not sure what it was all just about and the whole thing was shot,in a film with such great acting the acting is very good and so is the acting
3,we have a very interesting character in the,we have a group with a bunch
3,instead it is just an insult,instead it 's a rather boring mess
3,she has to be a bit of one of those things,she has the talent in making her a good character and she
3,the movie has a very interesting message but not enough to keep your interest,the story of the kelly gang' which is based around a book by charles dickens
3,however as a matter of view i have to admit it is a great experience to,however this time he is able for the most important role he has to play
3,the story is a little weak at times but you get to see how a lot like this film is made in the movie,the plot of the film is a simple mess and one of the most important characters is the story that the characters and the actors
3,well the movie is very good,well i am not the only person
3,the only thing that i can say about is a total lack,the story line was pretty good the characters were very believable i would
3,another scene that involves an accident of the woman that 's a bit over in a crowded room is a little jarring to the,another thing that bothered my enjoyment of this movie was to make a few more dollars and make a movie about the subject
3,the script was written and written,the film was a complete waste of
3,his performance is a little too stiff,his performance was not very strong
3,the movie is about two guys who go into a haunted house with the help of one of their friends and the two friends,the film was a lot of other stuff like i was expecting something more of the sort of thing that i wanted to be able
3,every one has to deal on the same level of the,every time the characters were talking i was left speechless
3,the plot is not as bad as the original but not as bad as,the only reason this movie gets a 110 is because they were n't
3,the film was shot with a digital lens that made me want to vomit,the story is simple and the acting is so good i can see this is
3,you 'll get some enjoyment out when it comes to movies like this,you can watch that one and i think it 's a great idea for
4,this one has a definite lack of talent in the end,this is n't a movie about a man who is trying to
4,it 's about as bad a whopping as it gets,it 's not a movie for people who love movies that
4,i was n't expecting a great plot and was surprised,i had to shut up in the first 5 minutes which
4,ethereal and exciting and not too much of anything,ethereal and witty this one is a must see for
4,nobody in town has ever met one character since the first film,nobody in it has ever had any sense what to do
4,unlike other lowbudget movies the script is full of clichs and the characters just do not fit,unlike any other disney cartoon i have seen and many of those movies that make you want to
4,the story is told through flashbacks with an interesting cast,the story is simple and not very original but a great
4,and for some reason they do not seem the only good one in that one and the,and the plot was n't really bad as we have a story that i found funny
4,there 's one scene where the two lovebirds are wearing guns and the camera is so fake that we actually see some of its victims as it was made in,there are some truly stunning moments in the film and i think that is that the characters in the film are all real and the actors are great too
4,i had not seen it in a theater until recently,i saw this as part one to my knowledge of this
4,both are a little over here,both of those scenes is just as
4,this is the kind who made a few pictures of people who think he 'd like to do the same to their children,this movie is really about a bunch of people who go on a trip to the pacific to find out about the future being
4,it was not an updating of the whole lot of good films but it was still pretty entertaining,it is a bit too simple and a tad slow but i really liked it so much that the
4,may i say this is a really great,may i get this movie on video
4,what is this supposed to say,what the hell is this film about
4,what 's even funnier is how the director managed to inject some real life into the characters,what is most striking is why the filmmakers have chosen to make these kinds of movies
4,i ca n't see the actors as bad,i saw this when the film came out before
4,bottom line a very enjoyable movie that really deserves your attention and i,bottom line this is one of the worst films of all times
4,a lot is about to be done and the film has to offer the goods that we do we are,a man who is so old fashioned and a man that i want it to be a real world
4,one thing i did n't like about this game apart from the acting,one thing that was missing the point in this movie was how the producers
4,this film had me in the theater,this is a very bad film
4,i saw the movie for the second and second week,i 've never been a fan so i was looking into
4,i saw the original bambi at the toronto film fest last night,i do n't believe i had even heard of this film at a
4,ming and the bandit is a film about a young man who kills his younger siblings and a woman who comes to a mental institution,ming ming does a decent turn as a tough guy and he is quite likable and believable as the villain in this film too
4,the acting by the two leads was very good,the first time i saw this movie i loved it
4,it 's a shame that this film got out of print for a,it 's not a very good idea to put into the story
4,but that is why this is the best of the movie,but the whole thing was so terrible so i do not even
4,this is the story for which the two protagonists are so good,this time it is a comedy it was supposed to appeal
4,if there 's nothing more in that movie about the plot then how can you take your time to watch it,if you can get that out of your mind you may like it you 'll want you to see it on its
4,this film is very interesting and very entertaining and is very watchable for its time,this movie is really about a young man and the son who decide to leave it
4,rex ingram is so funny as a person,rex ingram was just awful in it
4,it 's not a great horror film but it really is a good movie to watch,it was n't bad it was good fun and i was pleasantly impressed by it
4,the first half of this movie is a real treat to me and this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen,the only other film in which this was made for me was when the story was being told from a technical perspective in what would
4,as a result though it is an insult to the intelligence for that matter because i 've just seen some of the scenes that take them into,as soon as the plot kicks into the film the characters seem more human than most of their films and there is n't really a point
4,angelina jolie does a decent job as the wife and i,angelina jolie and michael jayston should be ashamed of this
4,actually the only person on tv was getting his kicks down and it was very very sad,actually this is a pretty bad movie i ca all really say that it has absolutely no redeeming
4,and i have to admit i ca n't remember that movie with,and that would be the best reason to watch this crap
4,the main character has the worst possible of any of the four main characters as he 's in the book,the ending of this movie will probably leave you wanting to be a part in a new movie but it will
4,that 's all it 's worth,that would be a very big mistake
4,watch for the first 15 minutes,watch it if you do n't know
4,all in to the first 5 min,all this is a major flaw
4,where are the good guys going,where did they get those from
4,but then again the whole thing was so bad it is good,but he does n't get a sense that he is no actor
4,one of the things i did not like about him was the presence of the father he seemed to play,one could argue that most of the actors had their own voices but no they were not used to convey some
4,an hour and fifteen seconds of pure tedium it 's just too silly at times to,an excellent cast led from the leads who were the real star of the film
4,although the movie is good and in parts it is not bad,although the movie could not really have had a story of this sort
4,thus is the movie that has nothing new but a little more for it to be made in the us or even,thus we have a great ensemble of actors but this film is not in the same ballpark as you would think
4,i ca only see that many of the movies i 've mentioned this far from the others,i ca only assume he 's a fan of hers but this one takes more of his character
4,and i have n't had the pleasure on this film before,and i really wanted to see it because it was so bad
4,it takes all the elements and it is quite a surprise to see,it 's hard for anyone who is not familiar with the movie
4,and this is what makes this movie so unique to me that i am so impressed with the plot line you feel for you,and the acting and editing is so good that you ca ca n't believe that someone else could do something that 's the least interesting
4,it was the most expensive of the,it 's not all a movie
4,the plot is pretty stupid and the acting is really all over the place as,the script has to rely on the ridiculous plot lines to develop an atmosphere
4,all the actors did a very good in this movie,all in all it 's the best film i ever seen
4,but that 's what the movie is like,but i guess we have an awful plot that
4,the film also features a lot of plot twists and the usual clichs,the film is not for all tastes but also in one way or so
4,and the acting by all concerned,and he seems to be a coward
4,james coburn 's performance is perfect the character of the young,james earl jones' the most successful character in the film
4,after his girlfriend and the husband of the two daughters decide to spend their money the weekend,after a while it 's clear that the real actors was just reading this off cue
4,it is the best one i 've ever seen in a horror picture and it makes you feel,it is n't even a story about how they were all and how they were all in the family
4,and the movie did n't really start as such,and the ending i will just love it
4,her character is so sweet that you could feel her pain towards her,her friend is a beautiful woman who is a man who wants revenge and
4,they are the best to be in the movie,they 're pretty lame but the acting is pretty decent
4,the film is very long and very choppy but it makes you wonder how that got to work,the movie has a good mix between it and the story is pretty good but the acting was terrible
4,after the sunset he is arrested by the government after having witnessed him for a month,after the opening battle scenes we witness the various sides of the ship and how this movie
4,just in the end a very funny film that you 'll never have seen before in,just because the main character is a woman is not a very bad idea about the movie
4,i saw this movie in my local theater and had never forgotten it about 22 years ago,i have read several comments on imdb that say that this has a great cast of actors
4,movie mavens should not miss this one,movie mavens to recognize who they are doing
4,because i like the way the film is so funny and the music sounds so great,because i'm afraid that the movie was released in a time that i thought it was the
4,several people seem to be enjoying the film a lot,several of the actors are great and the actors are good
4,however this film was not only the worst,however the whole plot is just boring
4,it is a very well made documentary,it 's a very good film with many
4,i 've always been one that makes me cry and have the opportunity to watch something with a fresh face,i have to agree with the previous comment here that i have n't laughed a few times and will always be
4,i have n't seen any movie like it and it seems like something similar to the one in the book is one,i do not know what to call a film like this but it certainly is good in it 's purest form
4,this is one film that i 'd love to watch and to laugh out loud,this movie is the worst horror movie i have had the misfortune of watching
4,i do n't want to talk on the ending and i,i had to give it a 1 out of 10
4,there 's so many plot twists that you ca ca n't even get to the plot to figure,there is a certain amount of time to develop in the storyline with the character and story
4,he has n't yet learned about the world and his love of the man,he was also a lot of fun to see but that 's not saying it
4,i saw this movie at a sneak preview screening as,i 've never seen such a complete waste together
4,the movie starts on an interesting journey from a somewhat bleak view that it has its share and is very effective and very touching,the only good points are the ones with the main character 's mother and the fact she was the only person who was the main
4,we follow the two leads with the story of the boy and their relationship between them as they grow up and take up residence,we do get a few more glimpses of what we get when we watch him and we feel the pain of his death
4,mitchum 's performance is so wooden that he is the only redeeming,mitchum 's role here is very funny but that 's it
4,if you do n't think you 're going to see this movie you 're not missing anything but i think you should have seen it before,if you do n't have the right choice of seeing a movie that should be a classic it is highly recommend it to all ages it 's
4,that was a bit too much for it,that does however be the case with most of
4,while this is n't what it is and is a true classic,while the story is rather interesting it seems that the screenwriters had decided
4,paying for some kind to pay attention to the story for a few minutes or so,paying attention and then when he meets his wife we find out the truth about the death
4,there is some very cool and interesting parts in that one but it,there are many things where you do have to say the director
4,also the only funny thing was the fact it had a little more depth but,also the only one of this is the one which is the real star
4,being a great fan that 's the only person who,being his first two films he is a genius
4,in fact they have a nice body,in fact if that 's what we 're
4,it was not so bad that it 's even worse,it is an example of a truly wonderful and hilarious film
4,the only redeeming feature of it is its title,the characters in general are very interesting and believable
4,but the film is also really a,but the movie does n't work
4,a bit later we discover a character from the past and the two,a good story line with a great actor and a fine ensemble
4,peter o'toole played by a young anthony hopkins is a welcome touch in the film which leads to a fine and interesting performance by anthony perkins who,peter falk played the part of the main character in a very short and interesting film which has always had some redeeming features for both actors
4,this is by far one best movie,this is a pretty funny movie that was
4,there is the whole film about the same person in the same,there is n't a whole lot to like about this movie
4,the first thing we know is the acting of the characters and the actors,the story involves a group of people led to believe that the only two people
4,one of the most original films ever made in a million years and it has,one of those movies i really enjoyed and it was one of my favorites
4,all the women of the neighborhood are very funny especially as they do with their children,all i could think is that this film is a real movie of the kind they would
4,in one scene she goes on a rampage as she 's walking on her,in a nutshell you ca n't help noticing the similarities of these movies
4,one night when the movie is over we can only see it for the sake of,one of his biggest disappointments and his movies are very different from the other films
4,les enfants del toro is a very talented actor,les niro and his men are all fine
4,and that is one of its many weaknesses to show it 's not that great it 's not an allout,and when her character does n't seem to get to her acting her she is pretty much a woman
4,much for this movie a character study is introduced very well and it makes it hard as well,much of the movie revolves on the main plot but it is not as bad or bad at the
4,filmed by the cinematographer steven lumet with an almost nonexistent script he seems unable the production values were low for a feature length film,filmed with the intention that they would be on the right hand to see it in the theaters it 's still very good for the
4,i was surprised at what a bad guy it was,i do not think he 's just a bad actor as
4,i love the character but in fact it is a bit too difficult to,i could n't take it anymore but i did enjoy a good idea
4,american graffiti has a great performance and a strong cast which is always good to see and that includes the great barbara stanwyck as,american graffiti had to come from an excellent filmmaker and it could have done a lot more than it 's a perfect tribute
4,the whole thing looks ridiculous and does n't have much to offer but the way it 's,the only reason i did not give the movie a 1 are because of the plot
4,as a matter of fact the director could have taken him out of,as soon i saw this film i was stunned at first time
4,so i watched this film and it was so bad,so it 's no surprise to have this film
4,the music is pretty damn great to the movie,the story was that great and the acting was ok
4,different to that i 've never seen,different strokes from the original play
4,example the movie as it could be said and done on the big screen,example it 's a pretty funny and entertaining story about a guy named satan
4,blackadder 's attempt was good but he just was not,blackadder is a great fighter and a womanizer who is not
4,dan 's friends who get him into their bedroom and they are trying to save the,dan akroyd is a talented actor of the type and his performance is also good
4,the story of the movie is so bad that its good and i thought the story was good enough to entertain,the only thing that keeps me watching was the fact that the film just does a better job explaining why
4,the only reason it got a 1 is because it never happened,the main idea in a nutshell about the first movie to the big
4,one could n't have been more wrong of the,one of my favorite movies of all time
4,in fact she is more or less like a barbie and even though she appears she is not as convincing as her,in the original a movie called it this is the first that was made in 1972 but they do just that
4,having been a fan of a few of,having seen his work i was able
4,seven out is an hour and thirty,seven out of ten stars is worth watching
4,and there 's even a great deal,and the whole idea of this
4,so what we 're told is a pretty simple story of a man discovering a young,so much is put on the dvd cover i saw it on the big screen
4,but the film has a lot of good stuff too,but i was n't expecting to see him play the part
4,it is the sort of movie where it seems to make absolutely nothing,it is a movie about how people are in the same situation
4,with all i can think of is this a movie about the evils and feelings of the war that occurred during the war era,with the exception of the last fifteen mins you 're not sure what it is a lot of things are going on but then why
4,yes she says and he 's the one,yes it 's a nice little film
4,this film has a certain charm and it does a great performance,this movie just makes it worse than it should but it does nothing
4,blockbuster for the rest of us the,blockbuster was a low quality movie
4,i do not understand why they chose him to create a film about the war,i would recommend this movie if it is to the point of buying it
4,few films i liked the most because they are n't so bad and that they can be just a little more enjoyable than this movie,few people can relate to the fact the director attended her or her family because that is how it 's about her son in law
4,it also has a lot of action and action scenes,it 's a shame why it is so funny
4,not to say the story line was interesting but also very interesting and very realistic,not to mention that the entire production of this movie is just plain stupid
4,i have watched it three or five years after my childhood and that is why i watched,i would not go for this movie but it 's really a bad film to me
4,it 's all about the acting but the,it 's not really a bad remake
4,shah rukh was excellent but still it,shah rukh is one fine movie
4,the story is a great mix,the only way that we can get
4,john carpenter 's music score is a marvel above the rest of the film but it,john ritter does an excellent performance as the villain in which he gets on screen
4,if this is supposed like this you do n't expect it,if this is a bad film it does have something to do
4,i do n't care if these people are supposed to have the rights to their future that this movie can be made,i was expecting a movie from a lot less but i was just not a good fan and i just felt bad for
4,if you 're interested with the story of a young girl named luchino and she is n't the same person you,if i could n't get to see this movie i would have been more impressed with my friends at least
4,a lot like this movie is an,a little later in his career
4,these scenes were n't enough to save,these are not all you want
4,the acting is ok the script has,the plot is not very interesting
4,followed by some scenes which are the most annoying i 've seen in the past few minutes,followed as such the plot is the worst i all have ever seen and far too many of
4,i ca all about how snipe 's character and his motivations,i 've never heard such an interesting and thoughtprovoking portrayal
4,at the end he is a young man with whom we learn from the mistakes that he learned in the end when he was the son,at least we 're still able to identify to the screen but as the movie progresses we 're told to leave the viewer for some confusion as
4,i had no idea that this was going nowhere,i do have a fondness on how they 're going
4,part of a lot of movies like the others of this series,part of me giggle and cheered so fast that i just could n't
4,the only positive thing about the film is the fact it was supposed to be a comedy,the ending was too obvious and the story line was too preachy for a sequel to this one
4,he 's supposed as though that was one thing to make it a bit of a joke,he 's just not in the same mode when he has a chance to kill people
4,his character is so much better than he appears in every character 's character and it just does the job he has to overcome,his character was just stupid the only one who was so irritating in the first two parts was the one who had a bad time
4,the ending is the most memorable one of the movie,the only thing i found interesting about this production are what
4,the acting and script are absolutely fantastic and i love the way you look,the story of the movie is simple and it is n't very clear
4,initially the film is shot beautifully on tv as they interact to the most important thing in the universe,initially i would rather watch my instincts as a viewer than the last person who wrote this book
4,it is the fact that he 's so annoying to the point of being so ridiculously funny that it 's hard enough,it is n't a bad movie but it really gets me interested in the story so i 'll give it the lowest possible
4,well you might find the movie more enjoyable as i would suggest to watch a couple of times when i 've been waiting for an old movie to come out,well it 's so sad and sad it is a real shame that this movie did a lot of things but that is a problem with this movie because if you
4,in my opinion the best part of the film was the scene where the two boys are running over the grass,in fact it is a film that has a lot more to offer than the other one has it is
4,there is only a little nudity or nudity to make it good and it has the potential to,there is no story the characters and the relationships between the characters is really flat and predictable
4,i have been wanting to give to a friend with my,i do recommend the book for the movie to read
4,but the film 's direction is very very good too,but i still ca ca n't get my money out of
4,things go awry with the main characters,things like this are not in this film
4,unless the actors in the film wanted they should be allowed into a movie and it was very good,unless you do not have the option to be able at the end of the day this film is a
4,as usual as it was a complete waste over 200 hours,as far has been concerned this movie had a great deal of
4,in fact it is n't as powerful and as exciting,in short though they 're good actors as their characters are
4,demon and the vampire slayer also was a really awesome movie,demon and aliens do n't do this for a very long time
4,i ca n't help feel that i have a fondness with the film because i,i would give this a zero out 10 and that 's what i think
4,very well done but not very good,very funny and a great movie
4,crawford 's role was very good,crawford 's performance is the most powerful
4,gary cooper plays an undercover officer but the film does a fine job of keeping his,gary oldman looks suitably bored in this movie as is his role as the villain
4,a couple of scenes in the movie were funny to me,a couple of times when i think the show was n't really
4,october la bam is n't a film it does n't look as funny as its predecessors and it certainly is a bit of a letdown,october 11 1992 there were some wonderful songs and i have not heard them since i was in a film that 's a great combination of
4,he just does n't come into a good idea to do anything interesting or interesting,he had a knack it was because it was the best thing to show the whole
4,i have to assume the director did n't have,i was n't expecting much from this movie
4,derek jacobi is excellent as a man who gets to see this guy and a young woman in a bar,derek is not a great villain to play the part as a character he does not show his true love for
4,but this film really made the movie worthwhile,but i really liked the first two
4,both were good at this but there is a scene where the hero of the family tries not only as a child but rather a psychological outcast that makes us feel as if,both have a similar role to play the characters who are in this film or they should have had a bigger time frame which would make one of the most interesting characters
4,i have read several of the comments,i really ca all be wrong
4,if you want a good action movie do something better,if it were n't for the fact that you just had
4,not to mention the movie is a comedy,not for those who have read about the age
4,need for a few laughs to be made in the first place,need not apply to this film as one has a few more rewrites
4,contrary to that film 's a film with a plot twist that 's not as good as the original but still is the most disappointing thing i 've read in this film,contrary to that one of the most important parts in the movie is the part where the mother 's grandmother and sister have no trouble finding the woman who has lost his mind
4,there 's an obvious lack of explanation of the situation,there would be a lot better on the subject
4,heck this is not the case,heck if i had to pick the
4,my favourite characters are a bunch who is not just a bunch of friends,my first question is who would ever say that in the book there was no
4,this is one of her more accessible roles but this,this movie had to be one the biggest disappointments
4,his portrayal of the world is not so much different as in that era that the film is based entirely on a true story,his only character is that he 's not only an everyman but also a mentally unstable man that wants her to get a life
4,have they done so much since the late '80s,have i even heard a good word at this
4,when it comes it is the best movie that i have ever seen and i have n't seen one more movies by a man who has ever,when that 's the only way a movie can be seen and the only film that can make it to the theaters is the best one
4,on my list this is a good film and it 's a good show,on the flip the movie is just so much fun and the music that it
4,this is by far one of his more famous movies and that is saying something,this movie is not to be missed is the same old time we 're used as
4,in my opinion it is the only thing,in this case they are quite funny
4,perhaps it may have made a difference between it but it 's also a little weak and the overall feeling of the film has,perhaps this movie will make you wonder who will really die and if you have already watched the movie you will get more
4,without the action the film could n't have ended without the ending left a little bit to be desired and it may seem odd but if,without spoiling it for anyone who has watched any of the other movie and i can assure you why you should not watch this movie
4,this is a movie that never lets go rewarded,this is a great movie about a group of men
4,this is the kind of movie that you would have trouble finding,this is a film that you have the rare experience of
4,the story follows a group in the town in the south of arkansas with a new york city,the story itself revolves on two young lovers trying for a different experience and a group of students from
4,why do they call in this movie,why could the film be so successful so
4,this is a movie that is full,this is one of my favorites
4,he has the ability to play the part,he 's the best part in it
4,woeful movie about how to go into the house,woeful plot that is so unbelievable you wo ca only
4,my wife who watched a movie and did it,my only problem however are these types of scenes
4,you can tell it was a good idea but,you 'll feel very sorry for the guy
4,belafonte has a very small role in a good role as the,belafonte also stars in this film as well as joe mantegna
4,as for a bit of the movie 's overall effect of a,as a film it is a very beautiful and wonderful movie
4,it is a movie that i think was one of my favorites,it 's a pretty good movie i do not have anything against the
4,okay the story is interesting enough,okay it 's like an extended version
4,however the acting was n't really bad but it was n't enough to convince us,however this is one movie that should have been avoided at the box office
4,the only good one was when they had been on a flight,the story line was a little too thin for my taste
4,how can a movie that can have so many,how does the director make the first movie
4,why does this show have to rank on the bottom 100 for this year,why did they put it in this movie but the director chose to give it
4,the acting and directing are excellent and is the film that sets to perfection,the ending and the way it 's done is amazing and i recommend it to
4,the acting is bad the plot is stupid and the dialogue seems,the film is an utter waste of time money and money
4,their chemistry with each character is believable and it has been done in the same way over again over and through with,their lives were to get out of control and get rid of the family from which they live for their lives
4,its a good film and should be seen again,its like all of the actors did a better acting
4,despite having an extremely boring script in their performances of the,despite the acting by the actors the plot was terrible
4,i saw it in the last years of the,i 've never seen a more beautiful woman
4,every single member of the audience is laughing hysterically at the lack of time for his work of work,every time they move around the camera they see something like the wind which makes you feel like they could
4,after that it 's hard to imagine it would be a good idea for a movie,after watching i am convinced i 'd heard of it and have to admit the acting was
4,the plot is simple the dialogue was pretty weak the acting was awful but the acting was decent for me,the only problem with this film was that we all agreed that they were going to win a competition
4,who was the murderer for him,who 's responsible for her actions
4,beginning with her mom and daughter,beginning the story of a woman in
4,probably the worst i have seen in ages,probably the most interesting aspect of this movie is
4,first off it is a very weak and dull film,first i 'd like to see this film again
4,there are a few moments of this movie that are funny and i will say that the acting was ok but the story is weak to say the very few times during,there 's a great cast the characterisations and a plot of two men who have been living in their country and having to endure their dreams to overcome their own life
4,i was not impressed with this movie,i do have the problem with the way
4,i thought this was really a bad movie which was really boring but was n't that good either,i could never understand that so many people who are n't even interested are very well entertained
4,my favorite is the one where i have seen a lot,my recommendation and see my share of friends and myself in order
4,be sure to stay with the original as the,be it a comedy or a funny movie
4,i could tell my wife was n't that good,i have never seen any of the other characters being
4,the story itself was good enough but the acting,the script by george ford was a joke
4,she also does n't show the whole thing that her husband has,she is a wonderful actress as she 's a real charmer
4,i had never heard about a movie where i found it so much fun to watch,i did like the character development and his character but he has a small role
4,godzilla is a movie that you would see again,godzilla ii starts out with the evil man of a
4,however the acting and character development is so far off that you just ca n't help feeling like you 're supposed to laugh at every scene,however i do n't have much more to complain on except this is probably the best film that i have ever watched the film has a lot
4,that would have been if they had had made it to the beginning the film,that 's a little bit too hard to make and the story was interesting
4,i could n't care more how it went to get this film,i do hope it goes straight out on video and the next disc
4,if the movie is just a cheap excuse of a film or even an action picture it will undoubtedly satisfy some viewers who want the audience with more attention,if you think the film will appeal to all audiences of the 80 another and are interested in seeing the film this is definitely one to find out
4,give you all the money to take care at your life,give a good summary of the plot in the movie
4,well he does n't have to be the smartest of this man,well you have got to watch it to the next scene
4,i am a movie fan and that is,i do n't know where to begin
4,even the special features for this show are not the best,even with the poor script and directing the whole movie has nothing
4,because of how this is a comedy it 's a film that will give it a wider appeal to those,because i have never been the kind to go see the movie it 's not worth a look at
4,in this film the only possible character is the killer who 's responsible for the killings of his father,in this film it is not a matter as many as it is it 's a real good time capsule
4,soon after the war the bombing takes for granted but then the police finally become the last survivor who happens and is determined,soon i got to watch the movie which has some very good points in it that were so very difficult to follow
4,i have watched all of the episodes with the following two,i really hope that it would help if this was the second
4,every time a story was revealed i just needed to watch another movie and this one certainly has a great,every aspect of it makes you want to get out with the characters and to make it more fun
4,where is it even going to the,where is that in the first
4,if this was the best they could in making me watch it i would have been right,if you are going to watch any other columbo film the first one that takes us away is
4,dialogue is pretty lame but that is the case,dialogue has a plot of the movie that you do
4,it 's not as good as the,it 's not a bad idea
4,if you like bad acting bad writing and bad acting this one will be much better you have to see it,if it would not be that way i could say this and all the rest of her life i was looking for
4,the movie is also very good for,the characters are all well played
4,some scenes are just a little awkward,some may complain with the director or producer
4,this is a wonderful film that is the most fun of all its genre the adventures,this is an extremely funny movie that will leave much to be enjoyed and appreciated
4,jaguar mehta 's version on both counts as the best thing,jaguar khanna as a detective who is n't the hero
4,in some ways it makes this a fun film and if i ever find one movie i have seen i must be a little bit too thrilled i can say the first one is that funny a bit,in the end if you are going to watch a movie with good acting it 's worth the rent if you are not an atheist fan but as a whole it 's not as bad as you might find
4,but for some reason i still do not know who,but in my mind this film was really good
4,basinger looks absolutely ravishing as the villain who plays a character who is supposed at the,basinger 's character is not just a young girl a girl and a young one
4,i saw the movie on the video box and the reviews on how to describe,i do have some of the comments written by people on here who do
4,a few years after that i have seen all of them on the internet today and i still,a few years later she is the girl in the hospital in the beginning of the film
4,the only real drawback was the ending which left me wanting to read all of the comments because i was,the only good thing about the whole movie was the scene where the girls were trying for a baby
4,it 's not a great action film or a great drama but for a laugh it 's not even as good,it may sound like a big step down from the tv series but the story is more of a drama than a
4,thus if it were on cable television for free i would give the show a,thus in the film we do n't get a problem or a plot line
4,i could n't care more about anything about the movie whatsoever but that,i am in the minority and i will probably say to you
4,in fact it is n't even worth mentioning if you 're a fan,in any case you can see the film coming from another perspective
4,the film is also a documentary about,the film has no real plot
4,i do wish they had the courage that,i ca all imagine the whole film
4,the first thing you noticed that you can take it from me if i,the only real gripe is the lack it a story to the story
4,the characters in this are the very real events of this world,the script is n't great the story is just plain silly
4,the movie is really good for the first two reasons,the plot is n't very interesting although at least the plot
4,ironically it 's like a bad movie from the late 1960s,ironically there was a few good actors to go around
4,in fact the only reason to watch it is,in my opinion this is a great movie
4,the story is about a group trying so desperately to get a,the acting is awful but they are not terrible at all
4,i ca n't wait to see the next two episodes of the series on dvd,i am not a fan of this type of movie but this has no real life
4,but when the plot twists and turns it 's clear there is some great action,but the best part about a movie is that it 's a good thing
4,salvaging all other films of his own he will not disappoint the fans of the film,salvaging the first episode you will enjoy this one it 's just a fun game
4,i ca least recommend it to anybody who has ever,i think it is a movie that 's funny
4,this movie was made in 1990 when,this film was just as bad
4,codirector john cromwell directs an interesting thriller but it never gets to deliver any of the thrills of the book and there was some very,codirector william s burroughs and cinematographer paul r strayer do a good deal of exploring the events of the story of both of them
4,on the positive side the cinematography is good and some scenes,on the other hand it 's like a bad movie
4,i do n't know why anyone would like this movie,i ca to decipher whether that is just me a good
4,though the acting is very good there are some flaws from other films but that 's only the tip,though i think that the ending is a bit too long it is n't the kind of film where all
4,the acting is terrible but the whole cast is a bit over the top but still pretty damn good with this,the acting is so good the dialogue is bad and it 's not really worth mentioning the fact that it 's a
4,in fact in the end the movie is pretty awful even with the poor acting,in the end they are all so much fun to watch that you get to admire
4,undoubtedly the only person that thinks of him being able is a person who 's only on a mission to,undoubtedly the finest film of the year has made me laugh and i'm a big fan of ms allen
4,also if you really love this genre you ca,also there is some pretty creepy action sequences
4,later she 's the son who wants to help her find her way home,later there 's a couple of random moments but not as much as you might
4,however i did n't really care about what she was saying and that it was n't a complete loss,however the plot is n't very original or complex either to the plot or any of the twists or plot
4,this makes an appearance with this film and it 's a shame,this film had been released several years into the film and was considered
4,i have just seen it i do n't understand,i do not mean that i like it
4,mighty 'donnell has a bit of fun as the character he plays in the film,mighty is a man that was a little more popular than he ever got
4,it was just another bad bad move,it 's the same film as the original
4,uma kristofferson plays the hero a washedup reporter who lives his life in the united kingdom,uma farrow has a really funny cameo and plays a character that really is n't there for
4,the story is pretty decent but the ending was a bit too predictable,the movie is set up with the usual bad guy bad dude that makes
4,for one thing the main characters were actually quite engaging and,for anyone else the show does n't really have to
4,one has to wonder how the makers could have made another film out of a better film of the same title but this one was much less than entertaining and the story line was pretty awful the directing is poor the story is boring and uninteresting,one of my friends said i saw this movie for 2 hours and i was stunned at the sheer silliness it took to the extreme and in that sense i would not say that this movie is n't the worst movie i 've ever watched
4,however the film does n't work in my opinion,however i ca only think about this film as well
4,it 's hard on my nails so i guess what you,it was funny to hear people saying something like that
4,seth brundle is the only saving graces in the flick,seth macfarlane is a genius who could n't have been more
4,do you want to kill a child from the very time and place in,do n't be deceived by the comments on this page of a film
4,as an example it 's so incredibly bad that i can,as the main attraction is the characters are very realistic
4,i just have the feeling of watching a tv show that i had not seen so much of a tv show as,i had to sit through it in order of the first two to give it a try and i am afraid
4,he has never acted the entire film,he makes up the whole cast
4,this is a movie which would have been great,this movie could 've made a great movie
4,the plot and character work is so poor as in that of some people who are trying to make it to something meaningful,the first thing that struck me was that the movie seemed to be trying too hard at times but failed to deliver the scares
4,to be honest if i had never watched this movie a bunch would have been in,to give it a shot this is what you 're looking to see and hear
4,after reading the comment on what was a great movie for the first time on turner 's character,after a long time i was still laughing at how bad this was going a good way at the
4,the ending is an insult the rest is pretty bad and,the only other good thing about me was the music
4,the film is a classic film which features a cast of,the characters were all likable and the cast was excellent
4,then the main female character is played with a little more care and it shows her life,then you have the characters that are supposed to die and you ca all like them to have
4,this is by far the worst movie ever made,this is what the producers wanted to do in this
4,i saw this movie yesterday on a big night and i was,i have seen several other movies that are made for tv
4,the characters in this movie were absolutely ridiculous and i just could n't care more,the film 's plot was n't interesting enough to save this 'movie' but i was really
4,the director has no idea how to direct this movie to write,the story is so weak and unbelievable that you can actually laugh out
4,there are also some very interesting elements of it which include the fact they are,there 's something good about it and the ending and it 's quite good
4,this is a very good story,this film really has a very bad
4,however when the world is threatened to become materialistic by the way the characters are treated to the film 's success we,however i am a fan so i am delighted to say it was n't a good movie just a few things
4,if not the best ever but it is still quite good,if you 've read this you might like this but you may
4,it has an ensemble cast who should not have a clue of their careers,it has many funny moments and an amusing finale that was n't too well done
4,worse is the fact that some of,worse the worst in movie making
4,felix 's father has a son a woman and a father,felix is as good as ever to appear in a movie but
4,do n't be fooled by his earlier films,do not rent this film if anyone
4,i had been searching for his life of this movie for a few days now in his late teens,i ca n't understand this movie and that i will not forget it but i ca ca to recapture it
4,i had to rewind the dvd in order to see what they wanted and to be in the film,i saw the trailer for this film on the tv ads and saw it as a tv miniseries
4,so this is probably the best movie i have had the pleasure to sit back and watch,so we have one film to be seen with two different people in a lot of situations that
4,one could almost get out of a movie and this was a good film,one could not possibly compare the plot to the characters from the book and the
4,the acting is very good although there are plenty better actors than the actors,the story of the man who has to be the father 's son is the
4,it was n't really that bad after two of my favourites,it 's like one of the most stupid ones you might ever
4,the first thing that struck me though were they were trying at least it tried,the only saving grace in the entire movie is that it is a good movie about
4,the plot is very simple but you can not tell whether you really hate or die and are too aware of it,the only problem i had between the two leads was the fact we were supposed to be a bit uneasy and not even
4,it is as well written and directed and i think the best parts,it is n't a great movie but is one of the best
4,she has the strength of a good actress that i could identify with,she gets involved with the young man 's wife and they are given a
4,watch the original and you 'll agree,watch it again for yourself or just enjoy
4,there is no attempt at humor the,there 's a reason for that
4,i would suggest it for you to sit through the first one but if it is n't long before you give a toss to someone you have seen you will,i do n't mind but the fact that he was not in the book was a very interesting move from his mother and not too much to be questioned
4,cary grant plays a tough guy in the police car in san francisco who is a man,cary grant plays captain john anderton a former american cop from the united east in london
4,simply put the film is just one of the best and i think,simply because his wife was killed but then he got to bed
4,probably the best part was during the second season,probably the most enjoyable aspect of the film was its
4,it 's like the movie 's creators wanted us to believe that,it 's all in the same place as the old lady
4,confidence is a major word that 's why the movie has a certain,confidence and death are just too bad to be true to us
4,there 's not a lot to recommend this movie,there is a good balance between the two movies
4,each time one of the kids gets shot out on their own they are attacked into their homes,each time this happens to be on screen and that is the only movie that is even remotely successful
4,but as far as i'm sceptical it was an extremely well shot and very good show but was a bit of an insult for the intelligence and it was very disappointing in the end,but for those who love horror movies with a bit of fun in it this movie was a must see for anyone who wants something to enjoy in films and not a horror film or
4,ron moody is a fine actor but this movie is so bad,ron perlman is a good choice for a character who is an actor
4,the acting is superb especially the characters and their motivations,the plot of the movie is n't really good and i
4,ken is a true person and this is where the film begins but,ken russell has proved that he does n't have a good role
4,i saw this movie for the third time last week at a test screening in london in a small town in the uk,i think the director and writer of the film were trying to make the film realistic enough to create some of the worst acting
4,and then the guy who killed the woman in the beginning was killed by the giant shark which was,and then there is some weird looking scenes in which some women are murdered off from a tree
4,but this is the most interesting film i have watched,but the best is that it has an air force and
4,i had just wasted my time watching this movie,i was impressed with this film on the other hand
4,yeah we know that the real star of this movie,yeah i'm sorry but the acting the script everything
4,with a cast of characters in all its cast and crew members,with it being a comedy it 's not all that bad
4,a few scenes the dialog is pretty funny too and if,a group that just happens that a nuclear holocaust awaits
4,this is a good movie and not just for the great graphics,this is a movie that deserves to watch over 30 years ago
4,we all know that the man and his friend is going to take away from the experience because they have never,we were shown in the us when our freedoms in the united states of our culture in a new age
4,i just saw the movie on a dvd of this movie,i 've seen many films but i ca all imagine them
4,the ending is so ridiculous that i am just glad she did i could n't even,the acting for this movie is so low i have to say that there 's a very
4,my dad and myself were the main character at the local video,my advice you will be pleasantly rewarded by watching this series
4,stupid movie for all the wrong reasons and,stupid and ridiculous at the same turn
4,rich people who have the audacity in mind and have no idea where it is in,rich and dumber this is not a comedy to me a horror film but that 's a
4,on another note the characters are so stupid they do n't make you care,on a positive side i do n't think we can be asked that the actors
4,lew ayres as the lead character is just another actor who is not given the credit it does,lew rains plays an extremely well suited and complex portrayal of the president who loves to be able and
4,there 's also some really good fight scenes between shue himself and his girl,there are many films to tell the tales to be the most important and most
4,the plot is n't too bad as far way out of focus from those,the plot was ok but the direction was pretty good too i guess
4,it is a very well made movie,it 's not really the funniest comedy i
4,the acting is good with all the leads but i ca n't help to feel the same way,the story of the characters are also the same characters that are introduced in different ways to show the
4,oh and why would i ever want to spend a week watching this movie again,oh yes the scene in the beginning with the boy being shot in the bed was
4,the story is simple but in my humble view the director must have felt it to be a real drama and it is quite a great ending,the movie is very similar to the first and the director seems not to have the connections to the book 's characters which they use for the first
4,meryl march 's performance was perfect for a low budget film,meryl welles 's performance in the film is a joy to behold
4,that 's not the only way to describe this film,that 's the way i would expect to see a decent
4,it 's a pity that it never,it 's not as good either
4,the film is n't even that bad it was actually quite good,the only reason i rented this for me to rent was because i
4,it was a little confusing that at some points i was n't convinced that this was an original and good movie but it 's too long,it 's not a bad movie to make sure that it might get better and you get something you can do at an actual hour
4,he 's a little confused as he tries too much,he is a very good actress who should 've been a
4,i ca n't believe my ears is so much that the film would be much less entertaining to see,i just love the scene where the guy has a gun in a bar and his mother is talking about
4,cagney has some good moments in the film,cagney plays detective who investigates a mysterious murder attempt
4,this movie had a really bad plot bad writing and bad filming,this movie has to start on dvd and dvd is on ebay
4,and i have not watched it in a long good laugh,and it 's just that the plot has little or no direction
4,needless of being the most interesting and funny movie you 'd see in,needless enough money to stop making a movie like that that is
4,the story was not too good but i think the story is so original,the only thing that kept me in the theater were the fight scenes
4,and the best is to see them again,and of course the whole world is a little
4,some of them were so poor they could,some of them are not so much
4,the acting was awful as was why the movie could have made a better movie if not to see a few scenes and scenes that should not have been edited,the movie is also filled with stereotypes of violence in every respect a lot the audience is subjected to the characters and characters are all very well developed and the overall
4,yet there 's some nice little action scenes involving a nice guy on top of,yet this is a great movie in my estimation a perfect film to see
4,that is not what i 'd call a masterpiece,that was enough for me it was not even made
4,a film is a big success,a little more fun and more exciting
4,otherwise i found this film extremely intriguing and i was not disappointed to see it coming out of the theater,otherwise what the movie lacks is a complete sense of the supernatural and the story is n't all that good
4,the script and direction are flawless,the ending is a tad too long
4,i'm not quite surprised to say that this is a classic of a movie,i'm a diehard fan of movies and action movies but not at least one thing
4,if your in a good mood to be touched and you think then you have to be a movie to,if there were one i have to agree with you do n't go to this movie expecting a film
4,most of his movies have never gone beyond,most of the movie is about the relationship that
4,every aspect of this film is wonderful,every single person gets involved with his own
4,all the actors who play the movie in their careers also,all that aside this was a pretty low budget flick
4,but this is not only a film of a film about the power system,but the film is a total failure to sit well on the imdb
4,while it may have to make the audience believe that they were n't in real danger there were n't any good ideas of this movie,while this time capsule is in the same vein as a big budgeted movie this certainly is not one that can possibly hold up as one
4,i do n't even think that the film is a classic,i have not seen it in years because i think it would
4,this is another of the more entertaining films i 've ever seen and i do n't have,this is n't exactly a bad comedy though it 's not as good or original either
4,i think the whole movie is an utter waste of time and,i think that i would love this film to be done
4,walt is n't one of his best friends,walt and hardy are n't in the movie
4,but this is one great movie with very good story excellent acting and a brilliant performance from all the characters,but the story is that of a family and not a very ordinary one which makes it difficult for us to
4,if you like movies do n't bother watching it,if you do watch this film for free at its
4,at one i did n't want to see anything i,at least there 's a good deal to enjoy
4,there 's no excuse for this one,there are two great actors in the film
4,the only reason i watched it a second time i missed it on the sundance channel,the only good thing that can be called about is the lack of any conceivable reason to
4,it has been in the theaters since,it is not only the film about two
4,this is my first reaction to a movie in which an asian,this is one of those movies that you will never know
4,this is a great film that should be required to be remembered for the,this film is just an exercise into the genre and its a must
4,from this point of view i must conclude that this is the worst of this kind of film as a whole,from this point on that is a nice idea to put up some of those cheap and tacky films that make you
4,or maybe i can say i'm in the minority for two days but i do admire the,or did i mention the fact that there were too few people to die or died
4,giddy that he could n't find the truth to him so he has,giddy and insecure is a much more entertaining film than i expected
4,brat is a pretty poor film that i 've seen since,brat is the most interesting film in a long period
4,in fact it is an insult to the intelligence that the film is,in this episode the main characters are the most powerful people ever
4,he and a great white lady who were trying to get him,he does n't even know what to do with her life
4,the acting by some unknown character actors is just,the characters in the movie seemed rather unrealistic
4,i would like to see a lot more of them,i think that 's a problem with this movie
4,he was an excellent actor and i could n't even imagine what he was trying to do to show us what the movie could,he was so convincing that in the end he was not even in that scene and in my eyes he was not menacing
4,it is a great movie that shows promise for you,it has a great cast and a good plot
4,in many ways this movie is a little slow in places but it gets to the very end with the ending,in the first film the main problem is it 's a complete loss that one of them is n't able by the
4,center of our lungs is very good at this one,center stage is an excellent documentary by the director and a
4,it 's one of the most pointless films ever,it is a movie that deserves a much better title
4,before long we have to learn of what to believe,before this film is released and we see the young man
4,with a supposed script automobiles that are supposed to show you this film is not a complete waste of my money,with its unique and powerful portrayal by the time it 's in the history of cinema you know you 've never seen
4,if you 're a fan of his work then this is what i do n't like,if i had to make the film of the english version it was not that bad at
4,today is a movie that is not funny,today the film is a total waste
4,i ca only say that there 's,i would have liked it more
4,most actors are very different from real madrid,most of them seemed to be the same person
4,watching the trailer i had the feeling of sitting down and watched the movie,watching the story is a big mistake in my book because of that
4,colleen 's life is a real treat with what she was looking for but the film is really a bit of a stretch to,colleen moore is a woman who 's trying to find something important in her life and what is the purpose of the mother
4,i 've never been in the united states since,i was really excited i was n't disappointed
4,tarzan in all a movie has the right ingredients,tarzan and his men try very well and in a
4,it 's the best thing in the entire series,it was so much better than the last one and
4,that was to not only attract the world,that 's why the film is so bad and
4,for those who are fans and have the ability to sit through this film the rest,for example when the film opens i was just looking forward to it i was n't really
4,however a great film like this is a waste of time,however they do a pretty good job with the script and the
4,as usual it 's just as great as the other two,as i said the story was so predictable that i had a
4,i have to write a review on this,i think that this movie would have been more
4,they were also a lot better,they were also made for movies so
4,it 's hard on the eyes and the two leading ladies are both extremely funny and likable and their acting,it is not for everyone but if your still watching it you can get away in the same way that
4,matthew lillard is a real jerk as the movie 's token hero and the plot is very predictable,matthew modine is excellent but i 've never had to wait for him for it for him for this
4,if you are an adult you 're not looking for any of the best disney horror films you 'll ever see,if you are looking for a good adventure movie about a killer that kills a group at a bar near a bar
4,this is not only your average hollywood blockbuster or a horror movie but also because i ca all imagine that the writers,this is a very poor and boring film about the same kind as one of the main characters of the book
4,while this film was made on video with a digital budget of 10 or 8 minutes and a short film in the beginning a group could be forgiven by the end of any movie,while this show 's main focus on the other episodes at the time in which these people seem to take the audience into the lives of the characters that i am sure there are some
4,the main characters are so incredibly boring that it 's impossible to root for them all,the film is a mess of the sort to be seen in a movie theater
4,at least the writers and director did n't try to convince them he was just the same person as the movie,at one point a group of men have an automatic conversation with their captors and they are trying to find the perfect
4,double draw was a bad and pointless flick,double crosses is an excellent film that shows that
4,the acting was awful the plot was poor the dialog made sense even to be so bad,the story is set up to create interesting tension but it never develops the plot and the characters
4,the ending is pretty much all of the sudden twists and the plot twist but at,the story line was quite original and had a lot of good twists and turns
4,i would like to mention that a lot in,i think the movie could have been better
4,some movies have that kind of humour to them all with a different tone,some of the other reviews say that i have n't seen a movie so many
4,finally we have a great and engaging,finally they have an interesting story
4,but the whole film has a few redeeming moments,but if the script was n't bad enough you ca
4,this film is a great movie worth,this film is not for everyone
4,expect a great story to see,expect a good movie about a family
4,in the end of this film he becomes an,in many ways a film that should stick
4,what really makes the film enjoyable though the fact that the film is a very good film is it is not just a film of the nature of a film,what really surprised us most was the way the scene in the first quarter of the movie shows the man walking around the train and the main characters and the car
4,anyway this film has some great action sequences as well as some great fight and a,anyway the movie was not a big budget success but it was a great movie
4,but this is all for naught i really liked it,but the movie still makes you feel the urge
4,the first was the fact the actors were,the only good part was the acting
4,a group in a film class who are in,a must see film for everyone to see
4,all of them are in a bad match,all in all it 's not the worst comedy
4,but he does n't have any of the flair and his character was too weak to make it,but the problem was i had the privilege to view this movie as a joke because it 's so
4,you will get the idea that it 's not for your collection of people who are willing,you could tell this was an early stage production or a movie but it was not
4,it 's about a bunch of people trying a journey to save their souls but the other,it 's a shame that so bad that the producers decided this story was n't bad
4,but that 's what you should see after the show is over and you 'll still find yourself,but if you really want an example for this genre it 's still one of my favourites
4,this movie is one of my absolute favorites,this could be as a good film that is
4,of course there are several scenes in which the movie is about as,of all time movies this one is definitely a winner of mine
4,the director and director have to get out of the room,the film is filled up with a story which is told in
4,the film makes a couple and is n't afraid to get involved in the plot,the film was about a teenager 's life in a small apartment where a young and
4,it is just so funny and it makes it even more memorable,it 's as if she is enjoying a bad movie about a girl
4,i think it was supposed to appeal to those who enjoy this kind about,i would have seen the two stooges in the theater in this movie
4,a lot of people here have called this crap,a real treat for the director as this one has
4,very well done and a good film that is a must,very good acting great story and a really catchy cast
4,this was a very well done movie,this is a really great movie
4,the plot twists are somewhat thin,the only reason i even gave the
4,having just seen it for the second week it is one to,having said all these things you should definitely not be surprised
4,take the best of this kind and you will not have any problem,take a peek into a new wave of horror movies where the characters are
4,4 the story of this man,4 the only real character in the
4,finally you know the plot of this movie and you can tell it is supposed,finally the movie gets too close and it gets better with it 's characters
4,it was a waste of time and talent,it is the best of our times and that
4,there is no need to cram it into the plot or plot to develop the storyline,there is an attempt by the director for making the point of a story to a man
4,finally the film opens and goes to the final battle between the two men,finally i thought that there was a good idea that this film would be a
4,i have to admit that i'm ashamed to say that,i have not seen him in a much less
4,it takes a long time to get into this movie,it is difficult to pinpoint the plot and the settings
4,in fact the whole thing is shot in a cheap tacky looking plastic bag which makes the film look very cheap and amateurish,in fact it 's a pity because it 's not only because its plot has more to it with its flaws because it 's
4,they 're just not good but this film does n't,they are the only thing that makes their presence believable or
4,this is my personal favorite i do n't want my,this is a great movie for the long time
4,it was also one more enjoyable film,it is an interesting story that explores a
4,is she a bad movie in itself,is the film more powerful than it is
4,after seeing the original episode as part 2 i can understand why,after an hour of the story i thought i would give it an
4,melanie griffith is great in this film as she was and i think the director,melanie griffith as her mother who plays the role was a treat to watch
4,and in the end he finds a way out the old guy and his girlfriend,and of course there 's no denying that this is a real good movie
4,so why was n't it released on dvd,so in that sense that you 're not your
4,its a very funny story for anyone to,its almost a parody on the part
4,mason is a master but not as a film as an actor or he,mason makes a brief and seemingly brief cameo appearance and a good cast
4,he is very good at it and this is a very realistic,he 's the one who wants to be in this case
4,i am not really looking for words for this movie,i love to watch more movies than these films but in
4,the first one was like a bad movie,the story is about a young girl and his
4,oh yes he also said he 's a real estate,oh yea i do n't like the other films that have
4,her acting is a bit dodgy and she gets more attention than she does chew out of,her performance was great and i felt the movie was a very real and wonderful film
4,the film is a real treat for the film 's fans but this one 's a must see,the movie follows a group of people in a small village who had just begun to find their fathers
4,for example a young woman in the movie was very attractive but it never happened,for anyone who is a fan this has a good idea and a great story for
4,it 's not only boring but rather boring,it 's a shame because there was no need
4,i think this was a very enjoyable movie,i saw this at the tribeca cinema theater
4,that is why he 's not really trying to make any sense,that 's because it has a few good parts but i do agree
4,eventually a bunch that is left stranded in the middle of the woods and,eventually the movie ends with the two sisters sitting in an upstairs building
4,they have been done so well,they are not at the center to
4,there is absolutely nothing good and funny at the end,there is nothing really bad or special about the acting and
4,heartbreak 's death is a real treat to see in,heartbreak is one film that you can laugh at
4,even in the case the characters are all too complex and stupid the film 's a little weak,even with the poor acting by peter o'toole and his wooden voice he makes the most of his career
4,the story begins with a group of people arriving in the woods and then suddenly the story starts,the script is so stupid that even a small kid who thinks he was the good one and does
4,ll witch is good as the sheriff who is the perfect person to be seen,ll witch 's life is the first in the grips i 've ever seen
4,is not the main point of a film like the,is he trying too much to save his soul
4,an excellent cast and a fantastic performance by the entire crew,an american movie that was so bad you could not get a
4,i ca n't stand a good review of this film,i 've been waiting for an oscar of this film for
4,we are all a bit concerned about a series of events in the beginning,we are left with this movie with the ending of a good book
4,this movie also shows how the world and the people in the world know it 's a good thing to make money,this movie could have been much better but then we got an idea of the real world of our society and its consequences
4,it 's almost impossible to say how the movie 's end result was n't as horrible as the final fantasy,it is a little different to the film because that the characters are very different than other ones i have found
4,well worth it to be a cult film,well it has a few redeeming features but it
4,it 's really really hard for me to imagine anyone involved in watching an,it was a bit of a letdown but it was the first episode
4,its like watching a movie that makes a great film out better,its a real story of three boys who have to deal with issues
4,i had heard the word of music and i did not like it but it was still enjoyable it 's a fun film it is a,i would n't watch this as a comedy if i could find a copy that had just been edited and edited out with a soundtrack
4,film has a strong sense that there are some,film was shot on location in new zealand
4,i really do n't think this movie had ever been released on dvd,i ca n't think of any more of the series and only one of
4,the story involves a group of friends who are planning to go out to a small island to get out of a car accident,the characters are just plain stupid and are so flat you 'll wonder if the actors are not even the only ones on the screen
4,this is one of those movies i have to see for all,this is probably one thing i found in my video library
4,he did n't know what to do with the character at all and he was completely superfluous,he is not a movie that 's not so funny that it will not reach your disbelief but
4,the only person who seems to really like it is how to make a movie for the viewer,the story takes itself very slow and is so dull it 's so obvious it 's not funny
4,sometimes the movie is n't really the action film but in the end i have always thought this is worth sitting back and wonder if anyone has ever thought about,sometimes the music is a little jarring for the whole movie but also in the film 's opening credits and the ending that is just as great and memorable
4,to me the film was filmed in the style as a child and it really had me,to me this has to be the least convincing and enjoyable film i had ever watched
4,it could have had an undertone to the movie but it,it 's a shame as being a great horror movie
4,with a little effort it is a good example of the budget,with these two guys who would n't have survived their fate they would
4,i could forgive myself for not having done something better,i do n't think that it was ever so good for
4,i ca n't help but think it is one that 's not just a funny movie,i love this show and i do n't want a good movie to get so much fun
4,i did feel that the whole cast is excellent,i was expecting a real thriller when this show was
4,both were a very talented and very talented young woman,both have some kind and the characters in this movie come
4,this is one to see in this regard,this is a film of all ages
4,sometimes the movie is more and more entertaining but it does n't matter at the,sometimes the movie was a bit of what went on in the first movie
4,the film was very good though,the acting was terrible the directing was
4,even more of the movie you 've seen it 's been a long way since it was written by the same guy in the first film,even if it was in its place on the video nasty list of its own merits would have made this a classic if i could have known
4,conclusion this is a real treat,conclusion the only reason i watched it
4,the only thing that could be good is the fact she has the same clothes as her,the whole idea of how could someone in the audience just say hey the bad guys
4,this is an interesting show and it will definitely have no interest,this movie does not work because of how the director should have left
4,add up and go see the movie,add a sense of fun the first two
4,take the other for a ride on the road the only good one can be found in this film and that 's why they have,take my advice and rent this film it 's a complete waste of your life or do not even think of renting this film
4,i have not seen it yet but i was,i was lucky enough to stumble across that
4,forget what to do with this movie and of course,forget all these people and make them look like
4,the movie begins with the first one being released as a,the film has a very dark feel to my nostrils
4,imagine a young girl being bitten,imagine my surprise in this film
4,too bad he was never shown in the movie again,too bad the movie has no redeeming qualities in this case
4,listed in the us is in this film a movie about a young woman who is attracted to her mother at that point in time,listed as an american classic i have to admit that i am the first to comment on what was a better and good film for myself
4,i would say this movie was a waste of money i wasted it on the tape for it,i did not find it funny and did not quite convince anyone to like the ending of the film
4,watching this movie i was n't impressed by the fact being in such a situation,watching the movie you would n't have to be a fan for movies to have an
4,sarah michelle gellar is good as mary and the rest of the cast are all good,sarah michelle gellar is great as she 's just not a bad guy she is pretty good
4,and of a young girl who plays her straight role in the movies in which she is,and i do n't know the exact reasons why the film never took me so long
4,the story revolves on the characters of each other in the world,the first was that we see the whole story as a joke and
4,it was n't really that interesting but it has the feel it is supposed as though we really need an,it is a real classic and it 's very easy to watch a movie with such a great cast
4,i do not know this movie was made in the first few weeks of the film,i have to admit it was my favorite disney movie of all the batman movies but the
4,director john boorman is very good,director john boorman and his cinematographer william
4,could anyone not enjoy this movie just as the film,could have been a better movie in the hands
4,actually i do n't care whether this movie makes me want something so different from it,actually the fact that a film that could have been more entertaining is the result but the
4,i thought the movie should n't be,i just do n't know how it got
4,in all my other comments and reviews to describe here that you,in my opinion this film really should of gotten released theatrically
4,meanwhile the young girl is forced to leave the home for a week in the middle of a night before the girl can recover her father,meanwhile she falls asleep and when one is killed by the guy 's friend and then she becomes pregnant and angry that she 's dead
4,another thing that makes this movie great is the music to,another thing that is the most obvious are the songs
4,i do n't want too but i,i ca all about this movie
4,if you want to see something good like this movie and not just watch this movie,if this movie were released in the first place the best way to explain it beforehand is
4,some viewers might find the humor as a spoof but if it is to give,some say he should not be as good as the one in this film
4,this is a very bad film,this film is also a complete failure
4,despite a very low budget the actors are good and this is probably the worst movie in the history,despite the title of the movie the movie was based at a very good book with a very catchy story
4,think of a film about a woman,think that they are the same people who
4,i could n't help but notice this in order to make a good film,i ca n't believe the average film watcher would find the book to have a
4,this is the first to ever have a script credited a young couple who try and get into the house of a small island,this is one of many movies where i do not recommend it because it takes the movie too far too hard to be a good
4,after the first couple of scenes the viewer sees what they are trying and they make one another of them,after hearing about this movie you do n't have to be a movie fan to like the film because there is
4,the acting was horrible and most of the actors are n't,the first thing is the good stuff in this film
4,i was surprised by her presence for the performance of the little girl,i really do agree with those who commented that the film does not make
4,a group of friends have a conversation together to save themselves and spend their lives at,a lot happens and the movie is very funny but this is an awful movie
4,melvin 's performance is the highlight of the film,melvin 's performance was a bit over the edge when
4,a few things are not going wrong,a good example of how a film can
4,he and his friends do n't make up for all,he also was in trouble with the new age
4,of all time this should n't have been,of this time period is the same
4,they 're just not good either,they are all for one thing
4,timon and pumbaa are at a party at the end of the movie,timon ford who is in his early career in this film is a very
4,she does not have a good script and does not seem like the filmmakers of the novel either as she 's credited for being in the picture,she 's a talented actor here she is very convincing as the villain who is trying too much to be too serious and to be sexy to be
4,after seeing the whole thing and seeing it i had only,after the death it starts to feel sorry for her
4,i ca only assume it was meant to,i just watched a couple months ago
4,he also wrote the script for that it,he is an idiot and an actor
4,one is the fact that it 's been done by someone who has to pay,one thing that bothered the movie to me are the characters and the story
4,boyd 's character in the novel was played as a caricature of the main character,boyd plays a character who just does not seem to have much to work with except
4,at one particular point the movie is a long string,at one moment we see the face that is going on
4,it is a little bit farfetched to follow and,it 's a good film to be loved
4,antonioni 's work of course is not a major hit but it 's,antonioni 's work is quite short with only one of those films
4,it 's not a great movie or a good one,it was n't really that great at the time but i
4,the movie follows the standard of a typical hollywood,the acting as for this is really bad
4,he does n't care if they are or he,he did not take her to this movie
4,most of this movie is a spoof which is very interesting for its genre,most of all the story is so contrived that you wo n't care
4,overall the movie is a good watch,overall it seems a little too long for
4,it is a film like this and the fact that it 's in a word of its language,it is a film that is full to wallow the viewer with laughter and is n't so much fun
4,this movie is a perfect 10 minutes,this episode is definitely worth viewing
4,the whole thing is a dream but as,the film is a little too long
4,it is not funny and i have to admit it was just a poor substitute for the worst horror movie ever made,it is an attempt of comedy to bring us all into a very dark future which has an extremely dark feel
4,so the story is n't too bad not even the acting,so the film starts to lose momentum and the film does n't
4,the only good thing was the casting of a bunch of people called,the acting and script are so bad that it 's almost embarrassing
4,then he finds himself on the island in,then the story begins to drag downhill
4,i do not believe that the writer made an appearance of,i had high hopes of the end of the movie
4,the story of the movie is a series of bizarre events and some very interesting scenes,the story is set around a high tech university building called the same name on the other
4,but even for a film made on an actual budget the acting by all,but the problem is that he does not get to make the film
4,i do hope that she 's more interested on his work on the show,i did n't like this film either as i did it really like the movie
4,on the whole the movie is a very boring one,on this film they are just so incredibly bad
4,orange ra has a cameo in this movie but he has a very different side,orange is a classic and i think it 's a great idea of the movie
4,it 's a pity that the film is so mindnumbingly bad that it was actually pretty,it 's like it 's just another movie with a different plot and more characters
4,i have seen it several years ago and it is so good and funny to see,i am a big admirer of james spader in particular but i 've never seen his wife
4,i did n't know that the movie was based on a book,i think the best way for me to see this is the acting
4,she is not a good actor,she looks great too bad a character
4,i have to admit that i had not missed the point of this movie,i think that there 's a lot of good old actors who do it for
4,saw it in the theater in the middle at the video store so that it is worth it,saw it as a comedy and as a whole the acting by robert montgomery was pretty good but this
4,it was a shame that this film was not on for its first release,it 's a pretty good film in a nutshell as it has been given to
4,elvira is just another film to get the point across,elvira 's performance is just as good with its understated portrayal
4,it 's almost an hour and fifteen minutes long and nothing has the slightest hint that the viewer will ever,it 's a very enjoyable movie and one of those movies that can be seen by all the time
4,ok this movie is a classic,ok first of all the ending
4,gwyneth streep is good actress she is excellent in this film she 's a woman,gwyneth paltrow was excellent as usual to the point where she was not really playing her
4,this is a classic movie and the most beautiful,this movie is not to say the least
4,that was what i was watching on screen and i just wanted to see her as an actress in my estimation the acting,that 's a lot of the movie 's humor and it was all pretty stupid with the exception of the two leads
4,and in the end that you are being chased by the guy you are n't really laughing at the sight you 'll see that there,and the ending is a joke with a lot more plot holes than we 're supposed or just a few examples of a movie
4,night of death is the most boring and ridiculous thriller i ever seen i ca all like,night was another very good movie to show you a movie you have always been interested in the
4,the film is a very good movie,the actors are all very good the plot
4,not a bad movie but it is n't enough,not all of them are really well developed
4,the story line of the film is that,the movie is n't a complete waste
4,anyone who likes to watch this movie or have a taste to say it 's not worth seeing it and you will,anyone who sees the movie will agree that it is the worst film ever put in the face of the film
4,it is n't a very good movie but it 's good to watch,it 's really about the way these people do n't react to the world
4,priyadarshan 's films are the worst movies i 've ever had the displeasure to see and this film is n't a bad one at least not as bad as a big pile of trash,priyadarshan is the only one who gets up with some of their best work at the end in the next two of the scenes where a bunch of people go on a rampage
4,ronald reagan is as always a good actor for the,ronald colman and william katt play their parts perfectly
4,it is a shame that such a talented director could n't have a good,it 's just a bad bad movie with bad acting and bad dialogue
4,these people are the stars of the show,these are what 's wrong here i would have
4,the story is quite good and the plot of the movie is so real that one finds its own life,the script of course had a bit of potential with many of the scenes which made the first 5 minutes of
4,she meets a few of his friends and the kids are,she gets a hold of her own but never comes
4,like so much in the book and the movie is an all time,like a lot of this movies i found the film very interesting
4,i do not know how the movie ends,i do like the fact he 's so good
4,in my humble opinion it is a great,in the end i 'll give credit
4,as the movie goes on and on i have to say it was n't as,as a result i would recommend this film because it features a lot more
4,but that makes it a very enjoyable,but the story is so ridiculous
4,going to watch this film was like having a great day of my day motorcycles and my parents said i love it and it 's worth the,going on i have to say i have never been such dumber and yet as i have read the book the plot summary was so awful
4,he does not make a movie he 's,he is not a very good director
4,these scenes include the famous music of the film and the very very,these are movies of note in the past few months as well
4,this movie is the perfect example,this movie is just so good
4,these scenes were so poorly choreographed that you would n't have to,these are some of the most interesting things you could imagine
4,many of it 's faults come together to create a film,many of them are just too good for the part
4,to be fair it is n't that bad,to me this is a movie that will give
4,she 's not a bad actress or a woman,she and her two coworkers travel to new york because
4,for a film like this that it 's based on a book written by stephen dorff who was involved in,for a good film noir and an excellent film noir movie is about the difficulty with the human race
4,i have to admit that i can appreciate all of it from the,i would give this a 1 but it 's not that bad
4,honestly i'm glad i did n't have to pay off a rental or just,honestly i ca least recommend it to anyone who enjoys a bad movie
4,it had its moments i thought this film would be a,it was like it had been produced by a committee
4,this was one of her best films,this is a film from the 50 of
4,add is the film that the director has created a complete mess,add to the dvd a very good movie and you 'd think if
4,he is a great comedian and should be remembered for the,he is given to a very small and insignificant group
4,many of the actors who have been in the cast is excellent and the characters are,many of these movies that the director should not have made to watch the first
4,movie has a lot of bad acting the,movie starts as a very good movie
4,just when he arrives the movie begins to be a big surprise and i think the movie will go on for the eternity and then i do hope that this sequel will end,just as you are supposed to be a fan like john woo the film is n't as bad as a cheap soap but it 's a great fun for the time period and will
4,the film is set on the us and this,the acting of this movie is pretty good
4,aside the fact of the movie is that there are so many things to be made with such a ridiculous script,aside the book of caleb 's book is not as well known as the original novel which is also a bit misleading
4,yup i do understand the fact that this flick is made by a director who really does n't,yup i know i know a lot of people and my friends who want my money back
4,the acting is so bad it makes it hard to watch if you take a look out for that,the movie also features a very talented and very talented actor and he played a pretty bad character
4,i thought it might actually be a classic,i saw this film when this masterpiece came out
4,another reviewer said that it 's like nothing is being flogged,another thing i loved was that the acting from everyone involved was
4,this film does n't deserve much credit to those who do,this movie did not make me laugh like a fish
4,and in this one it is as a movie about how the people in china and the overpopulation of,and the final battle in which the movie has all the makings is all you need to know
4,never mind the good or bad or the bad acting which,never have you heard of him as a human actor
4,from the opening shot a bunch member to a young girl to find her father,from this point on you realize that the two guys were murdered in a crash of
4,this is what makes it so great,this is a film for people who do
4,upon arrival they were all a bunch of idiots in their town to make a movie about how they were going to be done,upon arriving there are several people who get shot on the floor and they fall to the ground and shoot the dead girl
4,nigeria 's life and his love for,nigeria was a real good guy
4,so much time was spent on a story like a movie that had no depth at any time,so if you have n't played ff7 for decades to see it do n't buy this movie
4,silence a character and a woman try to rescue herself a woman from a different culture,silence of the dark moon is a good horror flick and an amazing film by its director
4,the ending makes the film so good that i actually found,the first half of this movie has something to say
4,she is the most attractive character she could possibly ever get,she is n't so good and has a little more of it
4,did they really need to do it,did we need a good script to make
4,but this was a terrible movie,but the problem with the movie is
4,as a result it 's not a good family movie,as a fan of the classic horror flicks i thought it
4,there was n't a scene where a couple of them go to,there are several things in the movie you will not forget
4,from the get to know you 're going to enjoy watching a bad horror movie,from the opening shot in which the movie was cut up in the end this is
4,the only redeeming quality of this movie was the ending,the film is about a young boy named benjamin who has
4,his brother and daughter are a bit shy at the end and the final scenes where they end happily together to get out,his wife is a man whose life is n't as powerful or complex and she 's always been treated for his life
4,she was in the movie in the theater she was a real,she also has a very attractive young woman named meg houston
4,yes he 's a good actor and a great supporting cast,yes i 've seen him in better movies like him and the
4,we have a lot of problems that could have been good but i would n't even go to this movie expecting it to end the same way as the one with that stupid and needlessly pointless looking dude in,we are all here the only way to survive the death of her daughter is to be shown as a person who will be loved so she can be treated by her son and then to take care
4,my first thought after watching it is that it was a movie which should be,my friends and i had my son laughed at it from beginning to time
4,this movie does have a very nice plot with plenty to offer and is really good,this is one hell where we 've lost all respect to the people who had to wait
4,there are no real characters at all and there are some flaws from these characters,there 's some real suspense but not nearly all the suspense is just dull
4,there is a scene in the film which is a scene where a film of its ilk in the beginning where a,there 's the whole story about how a woman was murdered in which it is a big part of her life
4,i do recommend this to anyone with great talent on film making,i would rather have been privy to the story of this film than
4,perhaps there were some things that happen in the story,perhaps because i am so much more interested in this film
4,she has an interesting voice but that,she is not in this movie
4,he was the only actor who seemed very funny and had a lot in common to the other guy playing,he has to get some help by his mother in that he was the only one with a gift to him
4,i think this is a real bad film because i think the,i was n't disappointed and this movie had no appeal whatsoever
4,when his friend dies and is diagnosed with an attempted pregnancy she realizes he 'll get to get into that,when the movie ends i found myself wanting to have my own family who have never seen this movie
4,heck we do not know who the killer or who is and what,heck the movie is so bad that i just do not care
4,it is a film that has some of the strangest parts of any movie of,it 's so stupid it 's impossible not to fall asleep in this situation
4,it 's also a pretty accurate film in,it takes a while on its own
4,here he 's a bit too much,here 's a movie you will enjoy as
4,having watched this movie a few times i did n't think that much,having not read the story i had n't heard that this film was in
4,i was not expecting a serious movie,i saw this movie on showtime
4,though the film is obviously set in los craven 's brazil in the same locations as the film it is a very enjoyable film from a master to its fullest which is a bit long and the scenes between the actors are pretty well done,though his film is n't perfect enough to be a great movie it is the fact i am aware of his performance in the movie 's history and this movie made him feel a little like a saint and was n't trying to make a sequel
4,however there 's a fair amount of action in the movie too and,however after the war and murder it comes back on the screen
4,so you are left with little to,so why was he so stupid
4,well the story line was great,well this is one that i do
4,it makes me wonder how i have seen it i can not believe that this would n't be my favorite show ever but this show had a great,it 's not that i do not like the acting i think they are in bad taste but there 's some very good lines from the movie
4,for fans of the early eighties or early 1960s and even those that are fond to find the story line this movie may be worth seeing but it is more than a decade long,for all of the flaws of the game the characters are very believable to a young man even the youngest of the children 's parents who are a bit more interesting and the adults are
4,sweet and witty is an excellent film,sweet and smart the acting is superb and
4,then the whole thing just does n't work,then there are those movies that you can enjoy
4,this is probably one the worst films ever,this is one movie that i do not wish
4,but then i watched another episode of the pilot which was pretty good and it was good for a few episodes that i would watch,but the director does not even get any of the actors either that he deserves a big break in his performance as the villain
4,the cast and actresses are also excellent,the ending was as predictable but it 's
4,the story is based on an autobiography of a woman named lorenzo,the movie is very dark and the plot itself is interesting
4,so the movie begins with a bunch of people fighting in a strange fashion that is supposed to represent one 's head and it,so they should have taken this part of his character in it 's own way and instead it was completely unbelievable and annoying
4,i think there is something better to do than this,i would like the two to explain how they came from
4,guess i was watching a comedy at the time i was in my childhood and i am fascinated with the jokes and jokes,guess i am not a big movie fan but i would be watching something that is so stupid that i did not even care
4,ok so this movie could n't even be called an excellent movie it failed a,ok i did n't think it would be as good as i 'd expected
4,please if this movie ever went anywhere then the first time we watched it i did,please not waste your time and energy to this piece of crap like this to make the
4,judging by the title of this review i'm a big big fan of his films,judging from the story for the movie this could have had an emotional twist with the
4,to say this movie was a waste,to the director and his audience it would
4,the movie is just about a group of friends who are trying too old to escape and have to find their home house and,the plot is not so much complex as we are led to care for or empathise with the plot in terms of setting
4,the film 's biggest problem is the ending,the movie opens with an early flashback of the
4,2 a group of friends and a young lady on their way with the same man in the woods,2 the film starts out with an incredibly bizarre prologue in which the protagonist 's death attempts at an abandoned
4,master of horror is a film that makes a tremendous impression,master arthur smith does an excellent job as a reporter
4,he is the main villain who will be the hero of the film,he 's a good actor but he 's just too damn old for a
4,his first film and his last feature movie the last days,his acting is so good that i almost fell asleep
4,actually it was not very much the first time i saw that it was made by some of the characters,actually there are the many things that i do consider to be the only redeeming point to this movie
4,how on earth did i find this,how could anyone make a film that had
4,the cast were good especially william hurt who plays a small role and the role of,the first scene was a bit jarring but overall it was a pretty enjoyable film
4,a little rough but with little to do,a very entertaining scene in this movie with a
4,and it does not work as a thriller,and the movie was shot with a digital cameras
4,the film opens in the beginning of the second chapter of that film and i did n't want to give it away,the plot is a lot of people have already commented this movie was made around it and that 's how it turned to
4,all that said was that the movie was really good,all these people are supposed for what they are and their
4,um the acting was bad the story,um this film is a mess
4,what was the point of this film anyway it 's the worst thing i 've,what the hell was this movie trying to get out of with the book
4,however as an aside the movie is rather boring and the story is just about as bad,however the film is a bit over and it seems to be just an excuse for that
4,but when a film that could have been made in the us this one has it all,but that makes them so bad it 's so funny that you laugh at some of the funny
4,to make matters even worse the second half of the film is just the same guy who played him and,to sum it up this is a pretty bad movie that was just awful and the acting was horrible
4,he has to make a movie that does not do anything,he has the most difficult task of being a woman to come
4,it 's so bad that it makes you,it is a simple look at life
4,the story is told by the director of all the events,the plot is really a joke like the original film
4,okay i 'll be honest if this film was n't released in the united kingdom,okay the acting is horrible and i did n't understand what to do with these characters
4,it 's one thing that makes this movie more enjoyable,it was the only good acting in the movie that is
4,this movie could have had a good director and some decent direction,this is an example of how bad this film actually was and it
4,he 's the best friend on the show,he has a good body and looks great at
4,but even the characters are so onedimensional,but when i see the movie at the
4,a very interesting story of a woman who was abducted in an accident with her husband and,a few weeks later we can only hope that the next film has a new twist
4,originally i saw this film on hbo,originally there was a little romance and an
4,buddy has a few lines that were a bit weak,buddy lowe is an underrated actor who plays his role in
4,i am not sure which to believe that this film is supposed a parody of the genre in,i have n't seen the original version but this one has the same title a similar premise
4,in fact it shows you how to get into the lives,in fact a lot happens the movie is n't that funny and
4,well i can remember the fact that i had not,well this movie could have been a lot worse
4,the acting was so bad the writing could have been better and the actors,the film was shot in black and white and i liked the scenery
4,yeah yeah i'm not sure what it meant to show,yeah i know nothing about it and i'm thankful it did
4,apparently the director decided whether it wanted or could,apparently all the movie 's budget was spent
4,non of the action scenes were filmed during the movie,non of what he is doing in this film and the
4,of course when they finally arrive in a car it 's revealed there is a new car chase,of all the films i 've seen the director is very obviously a very poor person who thinks this
4,that was to have a plot outline about the,that 's what he is getting away with
4,except this is the first of the many things that makes this movie an interesting and interesting piece of filmmaking that has not only been made by some people,except the time period the script has the potential of a good idea that it could be a little bit of an insult to the filmmakers in this case but
4,according to the film this was a tv movie but it would be the movie 's worst screenplay and poor script in that regard on film,according to the imdb guide of the movie the director was n't going to go and write his own story but he also made the mistake of
4,it is also very sad that a,it 's not even that bad
4,he 's very interesting in its own movie as usual and in this film i would rate it an 810 if he did n't have the right moves in the eye of an audience member,he has been in the army and in the past lately the film is going to take place in a different time period of the future but he has the talent of a great actor
4,i think it 's not the worst thing i 've seen i 've heard about this man,i would like to see more of his work but if it 's true to his name it
4,but then again there are people in this movie who are not a little different,but the problem is the story and the way they are all together with a bunch
4,this is the story a very simple story is told by the director to make the viewers care for them,this is a very beautiful story that has some nice moments with a good deal and lots but not a complete
4,but for example he was n't so much on the film as it was a little bit more,but when it 's done the show falls flat and the viewer does n't even remember that
4,what do you get when you get a hold of the,what a waste for it 's cast of the actors
4,jackie chan was also in good form as well,jackie chan 's movies were good but i 've seen
4,here we are told about what he has to do,here you go with the film the first one
4,junior high is a good film for the most,junior barbeau who is a star is the star of
4,also the music in the movie does so much and the movie itself really feels like a dream sequence where the director of,also there is the usual american cop who is very obviously in the military for his two cents in his early days
4,this movie does n't need any of the actors who could have been a bad actor like the girl who played her character in films like,this movie is one that should n't have been called a movie for anybody who knows and care about what the people who love it
4,underwood does n't even come close he makes a mistake,underwood is a good actor but he has the best role
4,it has the power to be a,it 's not a horror movie
4,she 's supposed as she did in the film,she was n't that great she was also miscast
4,the only reason i did not give this movie 2 out of 1 stars is because of,the acting sucks so bad i was so bored that you could forgive anyone 's interest
4,we are not given an option but the way the camera pans off the floor is n't just bad acting,we have a young man who is a teenager and a young boy and a loving man in prison who is
4,phantom and ted is the one that made it even more enjoyable to me in it 's own right the way the movie progresses,phantom of the zombies is a very fun film and a bit of the cult classic genre of horror subgenre a good horror flick
4,he is now a very wealthy actor in the movies of this,he 's a bit hard to come from a good movie
4,that was a shame to see him in the first one,that was one of the funniest movies of the 90 year 2000
4,think of it if there were n't one person who was in the same frame,think that i would like to go on to make a movie like it
4,the plot is pretty much nonexistent,the story was a bit too melodramatic
4,stage 's of a film noir and that film was a success,stage productions from hollywood studios will never tire of a movie
4,it has to get better the more the more experienced and the more out of focus,it 's just a shame that the producers do n't seem to try to make more sense
4,in fact i would like to mention more of the other side of my life that i can forgive and be entertained by,in the end i felt sorry for the actors as i would have expected if it was n't just a little too implausible and
4,harrelson had a small part as a woman to the end and there are a dozen things that make me,harrelson and his cohorts are the best of the bunch of supporting characters who have been killed or not
4,the movie 's title character suggests that there 's no other way to,the acting is terrible the direction was horrible the story was terrible
4,he had also taken on one side,he 's not a good man
4,then after watching another movie i just felt i wanted to see the worst movie ever made,then he meets a mysterious girl who has the ability to get the money and the money
4,the plot line is quite basic it tries to make you believe this is a movie,the movie is about finding a girl that wants to kill anyone and everyone 's
4,in fact it is not a good story either as in all of the other columbo films that,in this movie we get a real story of life of young people who have to cope
4,nurse helen takes a liking to the devil and the woman who does not even care because she 's not even the father,nurse ruth is a pretty woman and her husband and uncle are still a tad of a loser who is an adult
4,unfortunately it 's also very difficult because it 's a big deal,unfortunately there are other examples and then some of the actors are n't
4,i would recommend this movie to anyone who is a dedicated fan and,i think that the movie was made in english during that period
4,the acting is horrible and the movie is n't as,the script for this film was very very bad
4,so what if that 's a bit,so you 'll have to see what 's
4,finding this the real world of the world was never shown in this series,finding the right man to be accepted to be the one that has the best
4,the movie is just an excuse for a great director to get involved,the main reason the show is so good was the acting was just horrible
4,the script is a bit choppy the acting,the music is so nice for that
4,chris kattan has a small cameo as a cop who,chris benoit plays the role of a great writer
4,she also seems more interesting and less than her usual,she 's a nice guy not a bad guy
4,rent if you have not seen this movie,rent it instead of buying the dvd
4,he has a knack of making a movie about people who love their art,he is a master but it 's just not his work that makes this stand
4,i would say the whole idea that a woman from the book is a little more complicated is how he should be in such a situation,i do not have a problem and i have a problem against the other films i have seen but in my eyes i cannot say the same
4,it does get the point across to the action and suspense,it was really good to see how some of the songs was
4,perhaps the filmmakers would want them as a film,perhaps the worst movie in a long time
4,she 's a real estate agent with a heart of heart,she has a good performance and it is also great to know
4,who are these people and why did they do n't make that movie to make it,who ever made the film should have been allowed by the director to be as successful as
4,as a result it 's almost impossible not for the fact of it 's message,as the film opens in the film the characters are revealed with little depth and the
4,as a matter of fact one of our favorites is not a good one,as the movie goes along she becomes a very sexy girl who is supposed for
4,a young woman 's death was not her fault,a lot of the dialogue was pretty awful
4,he 's an excellent actor but no acting,he was a big part and was so funny
4,i do n't think i laughed even when the credits rolled,i was expecting a good movie to watch but not the movie
4,on the other hand i 've read this comment about the film so i do n't know whether it,on the plus end the story is a mess and the characters are all equally underdeveloped and unsympathetic
4,a very poor film from the late eighties,a lot of people have done this film so
4,unlike other hitchcock films these days i can not recall the last time i viewed the first,unlike many of us that had come in our lives i was n't impressed at all
4,and i have not a bad idea of who has to,and it is a lot of fun to watch it
4,seven years later this is an excellent film and i do n't regret a good film,seven years ago in 1995 the movie became a lot more serious but in the second of
4,it was an excellent movie but that was a little bit too much to ask for and there 's also very little action,it has been done better for me as i said that this is a very good film and i highly recommend the film and
4,you can read some good scripts,you have to see that one thing
4,its very easy to determine who he really is,its also quite simple as it does n't have the
4,but you have seen it as a young man 's struggle to overcome his feelings,but even that could have made a lot more interesting to sit and watch or watch
4,i have read several comments about this movie that is a true story,i have to go to the local library to give up a copy of
4,in fact he was quite the kind that went and saw this movie because i think,in this movie he does n't seem to be very convincing in the first place
4,i would recommend it to all,i would have liked this movie as
4,this is not a bad movie for,this is n't a good movie
4,finally if that 's what you expect the first time,finally the film begins to fall apart on the second half
4,this movie is a classic example for what is not so one of those movies,this is one of those movies that i do n't think ever seen again
4,he 's a great director who had a,he 's very smart and very believable
4,despite this the movie also has a lot to like,despite the flaws of the script the film manages to make
4,i was very impressed with the plot and characters and the,i saw the trailer from it and was expecting that
4,hogg is a good example for this film,hogg 's only reason why the movie is being
4,after watching one season i could almost understand why a movie is not going anywhere it 's,after a lot while flipping around the room on screen you get to hear about it
4,we all have a very high standard of movies,we are not allowed to believe that the only thing
4,aman is the only girl he does,aman is a very good actor
4,here we have an excellent example of how far it can go,here the camera pans off to a point and it is very slow
4,the plot twists and the characters were completely different and had the same basic story that the movie does you wo n't have to,the movie is a bit short but very fun and very funny because of the cast which includes all the characters in it
4,a few minutes ago i got this movie on,a bit more credit is given to detail
4,more than anything i found this movie enjoyable and funny and the characters and actresses were good enough,more than a few episodes of this genre are not worth watching as a great tv series that does
4,this is a pretty lousy attempt at an independent film,this movie is n't about the human condition because it could
4,this is a very good action movie with excellent stunts by the great cast,this episode was so bad i was just stunned at how bad it was the
4,he had a huge part in the story line and he would make his life more difficult to follow,he 's an intelligent young man who does n't get a chance on the job of finding a new way
4,imperative to the world 's population of its own,imperative the movie is a little too boring
4,they are the perfect group of thieves who is able at being a,they did n't even try to hide the movie as a comedy
4,no one else could have done a better movie,no other actor could have made such crap
4,the acting could come out but at least he is given a few laughs while,the story was that of a young girl who lives in a tiny apartment
4,first off the acting in this movie is terrible and that 's what you 'd be,first of all the movie was a little boring and the ending was too abrupt
4,never once did it have a very bad movie,never really got off the ground of the story and
4,as soon a mystery of a relationship between two men as they could get the money to have the,as with most of its contemporaries i was expecting to know what the actors were trying to do
4,this is not one of those movies where i would like it so much that the movie was shot at one time or two in,this is another example to me that i ca n't understand why anyone would want this to make an attempt to watch a film
4,when i was in my youth when i was growing my dad is a little stiff,when the director of a classic show comes to a medium this one was a great one
4,thank you for providing a movie for those who enjoy a movie that shows how a movie could be and should be done so,thank god that the other reviews here have said that i think the filmmakers did not want to make an accurate statement about the real
4,the film is so bad that when the bad guy is going in and the other guy runs the hero he 's not really funny,the first thing they made was that there was no suspense no suspense at all in this film and it did n't really fit into
4,appearances are good and the movie 's direction is very good and well done although it 's somewhat dated,appearances have been given to the camera for posterity but the director was unable to achieve an interest
4,that 's not the only way to,that part was a bit odd
4,this is a story of a woman,this is one of my favorites
4,it just does show a great deal of,it is a pity to see it
4,this is just a poor excuse for an excuse to make,this is the most powerful portrayal i have ever heard
4,not one of his better movies but that is about the only redeeming factor in the film because,not a bad attempt at a spoof of the first but still it is a great show
4,watch it and you 'll be bored,watch it you wo n't get bored with
4,most people do have problems with their lives and their relationship but the way their relationship develops between them and their problems which are always interesting to watch in,most of the cast are very young and i could n't help but think that it was a mistake they are in many ways much better that way
4,to get into a car wreck and get on their way,to be fair it just is not a comedy movie
4,the whole cast crew is so wooden that you do n't,the plot of the book does not go smoothly astray
4,some people do have that kind that i think of a few other good,some of those elements of the film have been added to the movie
4,end of days this is one big disappointment movie,end spoilers you should never go watch this movie it
4,coke is a beautiful romantic comedy about a man who is driven,coke is an amazing film and it is not a comedy
4,he has a very funny character,he plays a young kid that kills
4,amanda bynes is very good as her character,amanda bynes was excellent as well and the movie
4,cotter is a very good movie,cotter is one to look at the
4,these scenes of both were pretty bad,these are all good films for me
4,the acting is poor and the plot does not help you make it a bad movie,the story is a little weak but the characters are very likable with each character
4,this is a really great movie with a,this film had nothing whatsoever to do
4,when all this fails i am very glad that,when i say there was some good gore
4,other than the fact it was so bad you could only get it done by some other person,other times you 'll get to the end that 's a real accomplishment for a filmmaker and i can
4,maybe you can go in for a great movie with a good cast,maybe the filmmakers forgot to hire the audience to suspend their own conclusions to
4,there are some funny moments but the story is n't so long,there are some really funny parts in this movie and that 's pretty
4,scrapped of course a great deal of money,scrapped is a movie of a sort
4,but that is all i can say about that,but then we get to the end of this film
4,davis' film was so bad it looked great at the time but,davis' only reason to be is to get a better movie
4,nor do there anyone else in this film actually made one iota,nor is there a reason for why this is the best
4,when the characters were introduced their characters to this movie were just too silly to realize,when this film was made and it was one of the few great scenes of the film
4,the film is about a woman who lives with a young man in a rural neighborhood,the characters have all sorts of personalities that would seem to be real and that 's why
4,titles are not so much in sync with a story of a young woman,titles like 'the green show' is one the best animated films of the last decade
4,on the other hand i think the problem with most movies like that is a total mockery in it 's depiction and is actually quite,on an interview with the other commentators and some of my personal favorites i thought that it would be a good movie to watch
4,i really do think the movie was a bit different than the others so it is a bit too long and the acting is so bad that i do n't think it was made into an oscar for the,i did n't care for the character of henry and who was n't in this but there was a lot more than that but the ending of the movie was so stupid that i really did n't care
4,what a waste for this film and for that i mean it,what 's more it is not as bad as the first
4,to sum up this film has the feel that made the first one more so,to be frank he did and the character of the lead character was just too much
4,like a bad man 's dream i can relate the story to the original text that it could have been,like many people who actually think that this movie is the first of many years for the genre it 's a
4,this is one of the best films i saw,this movie is an exercise in the world of movies
4,better luck to go see the original or watch it,better to be watched if you can get away from a
4,the acting is poor although some scenes are pretty well done but not for,the only reason this movie works is because of it 's bad direction
4,the script by neil gaiman was pretty lame,the plot line was great and the acting is
4,in fact the only reason i watched it was because,in this movie she plays a very good part
4,this was a very disappointing attempt by a film with a lot of the jokes from the earlier work,this is one movie that i would watch over and read if that 's a great combination of the two
4,douglass was an intelligent woman who had her heart,douglass 's direction is a delight to behold
4,in the end it makes us hate that more than one or two of you,in the end it seems almost like the film would have had more drama
4,the only thing missing was the performance of chris sarandon and that was a shame because he was so cute,the story is so thin that it is impossible to follow on a story and it does have a lot of
4,on the other side it 's the kind that people who want to get,on the other side of my mind i was looking in this movie
4,if you 're looking for a good horror movie this one was really bad but then i saw this one,if you 're looking to see a movie that 's actually interesting in the first place then that is the only
4,i love how they are going for the best of their endeavors but the film is very funny and has a couple,i do not want it to end as the worst movie that i 've seen and the worst thing for me
4,and for those of us who are just looking for something different to those who would appreciate,and the film is about a young woman trying to cope her mother and her father
4,however for those who like this movie like watching the movie i can,however the movie is too weak to be considered an action film
4,it 's a movie that is just awful,it had more depth than the movie could and
4,he 's the most annoying person in this movie,he then decides he needs to do some more and
4,and that 's how we get in our eyes,and this is one of the few movies
4,as a result of a good movie that has been seen and praised,as soon as a war occurs she goes to a hospital to rescue a
4,unfortunately they are so good they were both funny,unfortunately this movie had been shot by the other people
4,soon i was a bit reluctant to find it 's own but it seems to be a lot of,soon after this one goes to show the world how he can take his mother away from prison
4,clearly the movie is about how the characters react and interact each other and so many others are completely wrong as they say,clearly if that was n't bad enough there is some kind that really happens in the movie so it 's almost unbelievable to sit
4,it is n't as though they 're being a good example to be an american movie that has,it is a bit of like this film and it will make the viewer laugh and cry
4,the only good acting job is john ritter who delivers the best performance of the film and he 's one of them he is the only,the characters are well written the story a good and funny take on comedy and the music to the film that plays the young generation
4,i had never read about this piece of work since renting it and have only one thing to do,i just got sucked into this movie as i had n't seen a movie so that i do n't see
4,david schwimmer is also the best actor in the movie,david bradley is good but the rest of us did n't
4,when this film came out i had to get to it and was very disappointed,when the movie is over and you have a good director 's dream you get that
4,so many of these films are so bad it 's good,so we have to have been there in the world around him
4,i have watched a few of her movies i think i 've seen all others as well,i do n't think that the first film had a chance to do it but the two are
4,for some reason i just did not like the movie,for fans of the classic films of the 30s or the
4,escape to paris is a story about a group,escape to me is a fun horror movie
4,this movie has some great acting and i would n't have it been better spent seeing the movie as a child 's play or if it would be on the imdb a day for a rental,this movie just does n't have much to it but it is one that could 've been a lot worse and would have been a good movie instead of an hour and forty minute short
4,while the movie is a bit slow in the beginning it drags and drags at the end and the end,while it 's not an easy movie to watch and a great one at that it 's a must
4,i was not surprised at how bad it was,i am sorry but i really hate them and will
4,every aspect is so easy to understand the world of today 's culture,every time we hear him yell at the girl he has been stabbed off
4,i was in my old junior at the time to see the movie and i do n't,i had n't read any of the other reviews and did n't expect it to come
4,i think this movie was one big disappointment,i was shocked that the film had the advantage
4,i was n't impressed by the ending at the very least because they seemed so forced and tacked on,i had never thought of the film but after seeing a few of them they could n't seem a complete
4,dave was in the past for a couple weeks and the next morning he 's forced to take,dave and his friends are all over and they can get them to see and hear people
4,ok it has that kind from me as is probably in my,ok we get to see this film for a first time
4,i have no choice in saying it but i have to admit that this movie was just a waste of time but it is worth a watch,i had not heard about it beforehand because i have heard it was n't that bad but it was the worst movie that this movie was released
4,while there were no other characters the whole time i was left laughing with laughter and the acting seemed to be just a bit bit overdone to watch and a little irritating,while i thought the idea was quite promising and had the potential of being one of my favourite horror films and the last few years of 'the adventures in the valley there was
4,the only good points are two the film is,the ending of the movie is quite abrupt
4,they are obviously a lot of fun to look forward to,they even make the film to be a good one
4,he is a young man named krishna and his daughter,he 's been done with great sensitivity and flair
4,however i can not say how i think about this,however it is n't the best of the bunch
4,plus it is the worst of the series,plus it 's not a typical movie at all
4,i do n't know why but i 'll give it three out 10,i was surprised that the director chose to take me so much to read
4,but as soon you know you 're going a bad film you ca would,but this is the first time you see a woman dressed in black
4,the only reason for watching it,the film seems very interesting to me
4,i do not really understand why so many americans find this offensive,i do n't think that the only thing good in any one of
4,i had read the book and had seen the original film a few months ago,i did n't feel that the story needed any more than it did with the book
4,the story of the characters is based so on the same themes that we do n't know or care about the characters that you have,the characters all do their best to be a little likable when they do n't even appear to be in there as a whole
4,a great performance from a director called a great actor,a couple hundred yearolds on the run get a hold up
4,the whole thing is a dream,the main character is the one who
4,i 've never seen a film so bad storywise,i am a little jaded about this movie
4,he 's just a guy with a chip a tail,he is a very talented character in the book
4,it 's not just about the story it just is,it 's all the more effective to this point
4,the film 's plot takes more than just some twists and turns to make you feel like the story is going to be as entertaining as we get and that 's,the acting was pretty good and the plot was good to the point where you would think there was an element of reality but the plot was n't much better
4,aside the best part of the film is that they are not able to be very interesting and are just not worth bothering in and,aside from that it was really great fun that 's what it would be and i have no idea why it 's a movie
4,tom berenger and his gang of friends are all in the same frame as the one who is a master of,tom 's character and his wife are just a bit more believable as each person in this film is likable
4,well the acting was n't good and i was expecting that i would have done much better,well this is a very well made movie that was released on video and i hope to watch
4,there are also many interesting scenes,there must be some people who are
4,however a true story about one person,however i was n't quite impressed i did
4,no doubt the director is n't a filmmaker,no one could tell him how to act and
4,in this movie i would say that this was a low budget,in the end i found this to have more interesting information than a
4,you 'd be more concerned about that if,you have been warned of the story
4,rent it you will never regret anything that is,rent it if you have nothing else watch
4,a lot more interesting than many of the other comments i 've,a movie from the past decade is the first and so
4,note of the title says that the movie 's biggest strength is to be a very good one and should,note he has the talent of his own self which he is the very best actor in the history
4,however it was so bad that he could even have pulled,however it is n't even the case of that film
4,and in the process a young lady has not done well to make a living,and then the story is about how things turn out so quickly and then abruptly become
4,probably because the film is a satire of how a film can get,probably the only reason i did n't give the movie a 1 was the
4,all of these people did a very convincing,all of the actors seem very real
4,that 's how bad this show was i would n't bother to go,that 's a good thing because he is so much more entertaining
4,i am a huge fan and the only thing good i found this was the lack in some of you,i had to watch it to see if it was a bad movie or a bad attempt at humor and some
4,that 's not to be expected,that was a lot less than i
4,the movie just makes a lot more sense and i 've seen this in a very bad sense,the cast is very good especially from the late isaac blore as if you 're from an early age
4,she was the only character who was remotely believable and is,she 's not exactly the best woman at a nightclub
4,the only person i can think of was one of them who had a good career but he was not even so good at his role of a man who knew nothing of,the only one who gets involved with the mob is his son alex and they are trying to steal the missing ones from the old man the dead bodies his own daughter
4,his work is a complete waste,his character is one big fat liar
4,i do n't really think that in the,i ca n't wait to view that
4,i am a huge admirer and this film is so underrated for fans but it is definitely more than a little disappointing,i was really excited to find out that it was going to be on a par as in the first place in my
4,this is a film that is a great example,this movie had me guessing the story of the characters
4,best movie you have ever seen in an asian film,best of his career in my book was the last kiss
4,highlight the acting which was not the worst thing in the movie but i would n't want to waste any,highlight the movie and you 'll find it hard to watch and it 's also fun to laugh at
4,for those who like a bit of romance or humor the humor is quite dry,for the film i am a big fan of movies that take a while for the
4,this is another story which is supposed as a psychological,this was just another bad mistake in the movie
4,movies do not have a great deal to them but,movies such classics as the ones that were popular
4,when we watch a lot and it is a good example of the kind of film,when this is the worst movie he ever made the camera pans out and does so
4,then he meets with a friend who turns into an idiot,then again maybe there is a difference between these three men and
4,first let your life go you 're all about you being an idiot,first of all the film is just bad with the annoying dialog coming down
4,bauer 's son 's character is the,bauer is the only real highlight
4,however the real problem with this is the plot,however they have to be at his worst
4,as a result we have a few moments of the movie,as a director myself the movie was shot in the seventies
4,i 've never had a chance to watch the show again because there is so little else,i could n't stop thinking about this movie i had to stop and watch it again
4,this is the best of the series,this movie had a great cast with a
4,definitely a must for for those who love this genre,definitely one thing i would consider that i could have done
4,by the time all the characters in this,by any means is a good movie
4,but if you are looking for something like a comedy you are missing some of it,but the fact that a story can never be told is one thing to make a movie
4,this is the worst film of all time but this is a bad movie it,this movie is a complete mess on many levels but it 's just not
4,still the movie has an interesting premise and is n't bad,still this story has a much needed meaning in it that i
4,even after the first 20 minutes or so i was n't able,even though they are so much more than their usual action movies they
4,amanda peet is excellent as the mother and son and mother,amanda bynes has no idea where to go with her or not
4,i 've never heard of anyone who sees this,i do not remember that being a movie
4,paul haggis 's films are very easy,paul rudd stars in these episodes
4,opposing of a plot is the fact i liked the movie,opposing reality is about love and the beast of the city is
4,plot points are left unexplained the viewer is n't going for a gripping ending the climax is so obvious,plot wise it 's an example to be a little more of a parody of a tv series
4,all the things that i liked the most,all the actors seemed to have had a fun
4,had a hard earned role in the movie but i would n't be surprised by this movie if i could only have,had he just been given a chance at all the talent he got on the phone he wanted to kill him
4,this is the type of comedy that was made by john carpenter,this movie was made and it was probably a little too heavy for
4,in addition to the success i have to say,in a nutshell this was the worst movie ever
4,why did a good book like that,why did he do such a thing
4,i have a few problems with this show,i was n't even sure what to feel after
4,i do not think that 's the only reason i did n't,i was not aware of the way this movie did end
4,on some level they seem to be too long with some of the other things a little bit of violence,on the other part if you have ever read anything else it is a very simple and touching movie
4,also there would not be a scene in which the,also there are two things that make it worse
4,the script is not the best,the actors were so bad that there
4,maybe it did not make sense,maybe this show was the only one
4,if a man is an object of the city and the man he knows that he could be a good choice for this film he has to,if only the film itself was a little more entertaining but alas it was not so much in the acting department as it could have had
4,true to my life i was really,true it 's not all good
4,but i guess i did not feel as,but that 's just not my kind
4,i ca only have enjoyed watching more of the other two films in my life,i have seen several people and i have to say this movie was n't even nominated
4,it was an entertaining movie to see,it was an insult to my intelligence and
4,her character is a caricature for the part of the audience and she 's a good person,her acting style is great the actress who plays the girl is quite good but she does not
4,each character is played and i do hope you 'll,each episode was a little different to any other
4,in fact all these years i was hoping for more movies like the one to choose which i did,in my opinion i could have done better by the time i saw him in the role of jesus
4,it is very rare to find a movie that,it really gets me right in with it
4,the first thing that really got me was that it was supposed to,the movie is based on an actual classic novel by christopher lee
4,indeed i can honestly feel for the characters for their lives,indeed he 's not the worst of this group and this is
4,who is a man who enjoys the life for those who hate all the others,who would think a little girl would be a lesbian in this world but this is
4,the acting and direction are excellent although i 've seen some really awful,the film is based on the events that go on with it
4,in fact one can only be thankful for a couple and a half to be found in the middle,in the end it 's a bit like the first time i saw it the second time i saw the
4,let 's get this straight from the first scene,let us get a few lines on the film
4,yet for the majority of us i would not have bothered watching that the two guys would get in and be more,yet i do feel that this story was so contrived and poorly made that it was impossible to watch the film
4,this movie is so bad that it 's hard not for it to make this,this may be the worst movie i have seen i would like to see
4,the acting was good but the direction was just so awful,the movie itself was very entertaining i was so very excited to
4,if you are looking to get the wrong movie that the movie offers you,if you love action and adventure movies this will be much more enjoyable
4,if the writers were n't making a sequel to it i would definitely want to give it a chance,if this was the best they could for a young boy in the film he 's very funny
4,all i can say about the acting this,all of it is done very well
4,it 's about a young woman in an old apartment and she is not the typical teenage,it 's a shame that this movie never got released on video and it 's one of those
4,i do not think the filmmakers could have made one 's own films,i really do n't understand why they were n't trying too much
4,however i did n't want to see a good film,however it was a big disappointment on its terms which kept
4,oh dear oh god that 's really cool,oh yeah yeah there 's a lot of things
4,gus van dyke is perfect as a woman and the only character of a person,gus 's direction is the best i 've had ever encountered on a television film in
4,it is just that the director never gets out to get the,it would be interesting to have to give it more thought
4,you 'd think that this would be a good movie for kids,you ca n't possibly tell how bad i was but i have watched
4,but he does n't seem like a character,but it still holds up very close
4,despite their obvious problems i 've been a little uneasy to admit that i found a lot of this kind about what it was and who is responsible,despite their flaws and the script by the way it is a bit too talky to get across the screen it was n't the first one to make up
4,the movie is about a family man called nadja the mother a young and younger boy named amir,the movie has the power it feels like it 's a real life story about a family that is
4,news park is an excellent film,news reports were never shown in real
4,i would n't have given up watching any of the previous seasons,i was looking through this movie and was expecting something more like it
4,the first half of the film takes an intriguing turn in which we 're dealing with the characters and,the cast includes richard conte john cusack george romero and the lovely patricia clarkson as the young stud
4,maybe a very small budget must have a low quality and a lot of money and some of my friends would like something else,maybe it is that the filmmakers have their work to make up a few films that are supposed to be a little over the top
4,i 've never seen a movie where these characters have such depth that,i did n't really care much at some level of my own
4,an hour and fifteen year later the film is,an interesting movie in itself as a movie
4,this is a wonderful film and i love it for the fact that it made me want me to say that the best part of this film has a lot to say,this is one of a few films that i have seen with a very bad reputation as an actor and not in this particular role although it has been a little too much
4,its a great story and an intriguing one at that is the most unexpected ending,its about a man who thinks of his father as a kind murderer but instead his
4,just remember the movie that was made in the past of the late 60s the movie follows two young people who get to love,just remember it was a film that seemed more like an extended documentary than a documentary about the lives of a new group
4,will smith make the best he has on the whole,will anyone who has actually heard of the plot of this
4,the only person i remember was the guy who was playing the character of the first time around,the ending is just as bad as the rest of them which just makes you think you do yourself
4,a couple months later the girl who has the,a group and their crew have been killed
4,the acting was bad especially the two leads they play very badly on the screen the movie is pretty good but in the very first half it,the story of the two sons who live in a small apartment in the countryside of the country where they were told is so much fun
4,although the film 's plot had the potential needed to be said,although the film lacks of suspense it lacks the usual elements that most
4,he 's so much better than he is,he has just a few seconds of screen presence
4,i ca do n't even have a good review,i just saw this movie in the early 1950 another
4,the story involves a man who falls in his element with a strange man and then is rescued by a powerful figure who has a secret and he gets lost in a murder mystery,the movie is set in england in a very distant location of london and the music was fantastic in the music but it is quite beautiful and it is nice to hear her speak from
4,on the whole it 's a pretty good movie,on this one the actors and actresses were not professionals
4,the music is very bad too but the acting the script and the special effects,the acting is very bad and i did n't expect much in a movie to have
4,when she was in a coma i knew i was in for a real story,when a man dies and she does n't have her blood cut he is able and
4,or if he does what we do in our hero you know that this is a movie for anyone,or the most exciting moment in this whole movie was when they were trying desperately hard to escape
4,from the moment it turns out to have a real meaning at a moment where a film is supposed to get interesting the viewer finds themselves as the viewer are asked,from the opening sequence of the film when we are watching the movie you 'll be a little confused to know that it is a great film it is the best thing
4,and this was one of those rare shows that was so bad i could n't see,and it does n't help that there 's not a lot of action in this
4,while this movie was n't good the acting was just awful and the writing is awful at being horrible in fact it 's the funniest of the movie that is,while it is somewhat difficult and so easy to understand to be fair i felt it was a pretty good movie to view a movie like i 'd say
4,please not only watch this series and it 's a complete waste of time and money on all,please do n't take this movie seriously and watch it on a shelf with all my friends and i
4,that 's because of the fact that this was the best movie ever,that 's just not what you can call this a good thriller it 's
4,no doubt it is a film to watch and will,no one in the cast is a good actor
4,but for all the good parts and the good guy he is not bad,but then we have to wait to get a better start to see the sequel
4,generally this story is just a rehash,generally for this movie the acting was awful
4,it 's just too bad and boring to be a classic,it 's an interesting story but is not a bad one
4,i had never heard anyone was watching a,i ca n't think of worse films
4,also the film is a bit of hard to digest because the movie,also a lot more action and more action than in this one
4,i ca all about what the film was trying to say and i ca just congratulate myself with the rest the people and most other christians on the show are just plain stupid and,i saw this movie at sundance a week ago and it is the worst movie ever filmed and it 's a pity that the filmmakers did n't even manage to make something interesting
4,then there are those in the audience,then we see him in bed
4,mastroianni 's character who makes it all his own,mastroianni has been in his prime for years
4,same with the original the story of a girl,same movie is about some great action sequences
4,the only reason i have seen this series of people who have to see it to is the last one and the,the film also is a very interesting piece of work that should be shown with a larger collection of likeminded audiences
4,the only saving grace for me were in the trailer the fact it was a made for comedy movie,the story itself was so bad it could hardly have been made in any way shape or form at some
4,but the script by richard david and the cast has a great time when it 's made for a very good story,but even if the movie has such a strong cast i 'd probably have to endure it with a friend who did an
4,seven feet tall and nine minutes later you have to,seven years later this one has to be seen
4,amusingly the film is a good example of a really bad film,amusingly i think that they were in a better place for each of
4,sure he 's got it as good as a film and as an actor he is so good that you wonder but even his performance,sure the first two were not exactly bad but it 's a lot better than the first and is definitely not a good thing
4,the first half of these episodes are so bad they 're even fun to,the movie is set in a futuristic setting which is not very original
4,how can they possibly have been so desperate by this movie,how could we get so much into the film business
4,but the film is a bit slow in parts and does not help matters,but this movie is about a young girl who is sent from a mental institution
4,oh yea i have heard more how many movies have done with a few hundred bucks of varying budget and so,oh how the hell is that so funny you ca only to say the acting is bad the story sucks
4,it could have done better with more of the same but it 's the fact we never find it anywhere in,it 's just that it could have been a bit more original or perhaps more of an exploration in history
4,it 's as if the director of photography is trying something more as a metaphor for a film but in the final analysis it does n't matter what,it 's so predictable it could have done it justice if the film was made to give us a real insight into the personalities of the characters
4,so many questions about it are answered the fact that the entire story is an unbelievable attempt to cash in at the end,so if you really want to watch a movie where the viewer is treated with a lot of gore the acting is great you
4,the only thing missing was the lack name and a little of it,the whole thing is just a bunch or movie like a movie that was
4,despite the poor acting and direction,despite its downfalls the film is still
4,when i saw this movie i was a little bit harsh in the theater i was going out of business with this film,when we finally get on it and see it i thought the movie was quite good in that way and not really in my
4,i thought he was in a very bad shape,i do n't think that you are watching a movie
4,the first film was good i was n't expecting it to happen,the only redeeming feature is the presence of the young actress
4,it is n't just a movie or a comedy but a documentary and a funny one,it has to be the worst movie i can think of since seeing it i think it
4,but the rest is just not good,but even though i 've heard that the
4,i saw this movie yesterday and thought this could have come as a comedy,i was a teenager in the late 1980 's and early 1980 like the first
4,dr the oldest son of the sheik is,dr seuss 's score is a classic
4,to those of all ages that they 're not to look like that it 's a very bad idea,to my surprise this is a very funny episode with little twists or surprises so i ca only say that
4,if you 're not a fan of the comics and you 'll want to see one of them do something else you will,if they 're going for a different movie to make an interesting movie that would be a waste of time or something
4,i was n't expecting a much more indepth movie,i am a big burt wood fan or a b
4,the movie is full of action and action packed action,the story is a bit complicated and the director is trying
4,she is as the ultimate gift for,she 's a real estate actress
4,there seems so much time devoted with the movie in the end,there seems to be a lot of issues and there are so many
4,what 's the deal in the first place for the next couple of minutes or so,what we have here is a poor movie that tries to cash in on its predecessor
4,what the filmmakers think of is that it was a movie with such a,what i got was the story about some of its most powerful ideas
4,i was hoping this could be a,i do n't mind the movie
4,in this movie he gives a great amount as an actor who is a fine fighter,in addition to the movie it 's one of many and the movies that i saw
4,ricco and his friend of three musketeers have a new life as an engineer for them,ricco is the most irritating movie i have ever watched so far that it is not a
4,but even so the whole film is so predictable as to make one,but this is a movie that i can watch over a weekend
4,every single actor has a cameo role that is to come,every time i watch the whole thing and i can tell some
4,he just seemed like a director,he is so convincing in the role
4,what the heck is this movie about in,what a treat to see the movie
4,not so one for the first time in life,not to mention the acting the bad script the plot
4,it is a movie that i do n't know,it 's not just a simple love affair between men
4,it is a film about a young young woman who is,it 's like a cross between the first and last
4,the plot in the movie is simple and not too complicated,the plot and story are pretty bad but it 's very funny
4,however this is n't the kind we have,however that being a bit too bad i was
4,well i am the only person who can appreciate it,well i do n't know how the producers managed this movie
4,with the exception of an excellent score that includes some of the worst films ever made and is the worst of all the,with that said this movie could n't have done more wrong because it 's too stupid or the way it was made
4,the first 15 minutes are a little more than a little too long for the drama,the film is based entirely on the first movie and is actually an homage of sorts
4,i think that 's what it is and the director really wanted a sequel,i did n't like that it has a lot more than an hour running time
4,this is a very entertaining film,this movie is a classic and i
4,it 's just one more of them,it 's like a play to a movie
4,the film has been set about a year ago and i,the story is simple and the action keeps you entertained
4,also the soundtrack is very nice,also there are lots more action sequences
4,from the moment the movie starts i can feel it,from the very young man that is the main character i
4,you know i was not going for the most,you could n't see the actors of course
4,if you 're looking for a film that makes you care about the plot this movie,if you like movies this is for you and will always enjoy seeing this one
4,this film is so awful that it makes me laugh at the stupidity of the word,this film also made me think of the first thing that could have been great
4,timothy trotta is a wonderful director and writer,timothy dalton is not very much a good villain
4,the film is set on a remote barge and we find out that the movie is set by the,the plot was simple but all told it needed to take more to the story and the characters
4,they are the only ones to really give a,they are the same as the other ones
4,connery plays a woman in a small brooklyn building where he is given,connery plays the part with an intensity and is a great actor
4,david lynch is the best of the lot,david bradley 's first film on the contrary of
4,plus the cast members have some real talent as the film,plus this movie is a good example of how all of these
4,whilst it is not an entirely original movie it has no real story,whilst he 's in the army and then is a big fat guy
4,a movie where nothing is a little scary and is more entertaining than this,a group of scientists who live together on a spaceship are stranded at night in
4,luckily this is a real stinker,luckily for me i have to say
4,the plot involves two children and two young children,the film is n't even bad to watch
4,first the movie was boring and did,first it was a good movie
4,phoebe is an independent film star,phoebe and her brother 's wife are
4,in the end it is a real waste of time and money but there 's plenty of fun,in one scene the girl takes her clothes on and says that he wants a new life
4,that 's when the movie starts to roll on,that was a huge mistake of this movie
4,she also plays a young woman who is in her own and has n't seen her,she is a fine actor and i can tell you that this movie was made up of
4,that was n't the only way why,that 's a good thing but i found
4,with a cast that would never have been the perfect guy' for a role in the series as well they would still have a little too,with that i did and even though the original was not that bad as an adult i can still recommend this to the little kids
4,i was surprised and entertained at the number of people involved in it but it is very difficult to understand that these women are all very good friends and if we want an accurate lifestyle they,i ca n't really give anything away but a good movie nonetheless is very good with excellent acting from the actors and it has a lot more going of it than in the first one
4,this is one example why the show 's title is so much fun when all of the characters in this film,this movie is not funny and not a real movie and definitely the worst movie i 've seen in years
4,this is a film for all ages,this movie is one of the most important
4,so do the people who make movies of these films with the same characters as their characters in films like serpico and jurassic africa with their deepest rules,so when she is going through the film she is the only thing the guy in the room who was willing by her and she has to be at
4,the plot and story are interesting enough as to the outcome of this movie,the film is about a young woman who marries her husband and is sent down
4,or when this movie did n't work,or perhaps i will be disappointed
4,part of it be that there are so bad in this,part of me was the little kid and the girl
4,she 's not a woman and she does a,she does n't do much in the movie
4,from the beginning the movie does n't seem to have any relevance to either,from start to finish this is a pretty entertaining movie worth seeing the first 30
4,michael keaton is a real actor not a real good guy although he does not have a,michael is as good looking and cool and it 's all he did for the role
4,simple enough that i 've never heard that before i did n't have anything,simple characters but all it needs for them to be a good story
4,i could n't believe the director 's name attached the film to a new level and i have to say it did not,i would highly recommend that a great deal of people watch this film and you wo n't be disappointed to find out
4,and in fact there is no real explanation to that in the movie,and that is not to have enough to be a big disappointment
4,cartman is also very likable in this film,cartman gets the money to spend a good amount
4,my guess this is an example to a film about a serial killer a serial killer killer with a beard and a,my friend was a good looking boy but was a great deal and a little too late for his own good
4,do we like this so much,do not watch it it 's a
4,it has to have a lot to work out from the rest of my classmates i am not even trying to explain why the whole,it 's a very good movie and it is a shame the bbc version of it was n't so much better known and better
4,compelled me to say it is an insult to the great actors and not just the beautiful but sincere and the,compelled in the film industry that he has to make a new series to play with him and his parents
4,let the viewer see what 's going for a man like maude eburne,let me tell you how bad this movie truly is i think the movie
4,this is a truly great family film and i do n't know how,this is probably the worst piece of cinematic crap in cinematic memory
4,to me this is one of the most underrated movies i saw this year,to be sure there are plenty of great actors including anthony hopkins who has done
4,the story involves a girl who lives in a small apartment,the director and the actors are very well done though
4,insights to love him and his wife,insights is not a bad film
4,keira knightly was good as the mother,keira knightly plays his father well and it
4,i think it was the best movie that made it in years a day,i have to say that i was very impressed with this and i was really
4,no one was able to act,no wonder this movie is n't a
4,what you have here one is the worst of all,what 's it with a man who loves all sorts and
4,it has a story that will leave you guessing to tears in your eyes and not just by the inconvenience of those who love them and are,it is a pity that there is no justification to see what the producers were looking forward to the original movie but it never does improve
4,the only redeeming feature in this movie is the soundtrack and the fact it 's an action film,the main reason why i rented was one of many of those years of a good chunk of it
4,it 's so bad so laughable that it 's difficult for a film like this,it 's like watching a train wreck with a car full of holes and no one
4,then in this movie i found her role,then the movie starts to end happily
4,definitely a movie for those interested in history and it is n't,definitely because of the acting and the script there was no story
4,the characters get better the more the characters and characters seem more real,the story of the famous american navy in the west during a storm and
4,in the book the writer tries too much to add depth to the movie without any regard to the other characters,in the first of two films this one is really about a man who gets an idea of his own life and
4,in one scene the woman says that she 's a whore and she is on fire but it 's a very important thing that she has,in the end i thought it had potential but it was a disappointment because all of them were just so funny and so damn cute and funny
4,but the film is full of clichs and some really good dialogs,but there are so many reasons why this is the perfect vehicle for
4,like all films the script was so lame it hurts me,like many other countries from my generation i 've seen the whole
4,unless the film does not know the facts of a movie like one and,unless you have n't read the book i 'd suggest you read this
4,however the movie is just boring,however if there 's an abundance to
4,they were in fact the most disgusting,they make this movie very interesting
4,having said anything positive about this movie i will just say that i loved the film,having a child and a girl on a trip she is not afraid to let the world
4,but i was n't impressed with the movie,but what we get is a film that never
4,it is a very enjoyable movie and the acting was great as well as,it 's just a good movie with no plot and really good acting
4,however it 's also very hard not for the actors who are n't convincing at all and it 's obvious they were supposed to have a good,however in the end she has been treated as if it 's been a long time and she is able to do something with her character
4,pranks and the occasional flashes of gore,pranks have a lot of action
4,unfortunately for me that was one thing to describe this movie to those who like the book because we do not know how,unfortunately the film 's failure is the result of the lack that a story could really be made in the first place
4,she does n't need to take a drink to make her laugh,she is an accomplished woman that is trying to survive the murder
4,yvonne is just a girl with a bad temper,yvonne is a beautiful actress who is very convincing as
4,maybe a few days ago she was born in a car crash or the house where it had,maybe it would be nice for the kids who were n't to die for this stupid crap
4,michael dudikoff was a perfect director,michael pare is excellent as the cop
4,in short it is the worst movie i 've ever seen,in a few words that 's not saying i was not
4,ford is an interesting actor and is so much in love with her and so,ford was also good at playing the role of a lifetime of the time
4,also the way the plot unfolds are n't a lot like that of the book with this is n't a surprise,also when a young boy 's mother died and was told to make it a real life in the first place the
4,it was a little bit overdone and was n't much of,it 's like a bunch of idiots trying at school
4,this movie could have been good but nothing else it was n't a film,this is the first of several sequels that i have to deal with
4,however if you 're going for this kind of humor i guess you should,however as a kid i 've only seen a few of the others
4,yeah it 's a bit corny and silly but if you like the kind i ca n't help but feel that it is,yeah it is the worst film ever made on my mind and it 's just that bad taste for it 's own
4,she 's a fine actress and her portrayal,she was very sexy in her life
4,but the film does not offer a lot of good things on stage and to put it all together i 'd say if you have an extra,but i think this is a very interesting film that is very difficult to do with that kind of film or is n't a bad movie
4,wolf and the whale is an interesting and entertaining comedy about a young woman who moves across an isolated mansion to find her,wolf was an old and very boring movie with only the names but it was very much like a typical movie like pulp fiction
4,damon is also funny when a man who is in his position has a secret to the head when his mother dies,damon was a little more than a little stiff at first but he seemed to be enjoying a pretty fun film
4,this is a movie for the viewer,this is a film that will never be
4,if you have the right frame of humor i would suggest this movie for all but the bad guys,if you 're looking for an edgy film with an engaging story and an excellent cast a great story line
4,and the plot is ridiculous the acting horrible and the plot is a joke at times,and when you do n't see any of that it is n't enough and i would rather
4,scarlett is also a strong character and she is a good actor and is not a great dancer but she,scarlett and her brother 's sister and their friends are the ones they meet and the movie is told
4,some of these elements are pretty bad but there are some very enjoyable,some people seem a good idea and this movie is no exception
4,the only good thing is the performances of patrick mcgoohan,the ending and the way it 's done is amazing and
4,in other words it is an excellent movie that will,in this one the acting was pretty good too
4,this is not the type of film you 'd have seen on the,this film was so bad it could not have been any worse
4,i think i have read a book of the book,i have not seen the original play of jane christie 's
4,they 're trying the same way the first act ended,they 've been living in the past of nowhere from the
4,eleanor 's direction does n't do anything,eleanor parker was a fine actress
4,can i possibly have a copy that will leave the film theater,can be the only reason i have this movie is because if i
4,the acting of the actors is very good,the movie has a lot going on
4,the director of this story has created something like that for a few,the acting is bad and there are continuity limitations to get through
4,we get a couple scenes of the film with the girls getting the girl on the road and they are pretty well done in their final scene,we 're supposed for a film and they are just not that memorable but it makes for a great experience for a very short time period and for
4,valjean is sent to a remote jail to locate the land of,valjean 's attempt is the most difficult part in my life
4,5 the story is simple and it was,5 the only thing that gets worse
4,the story was really bad and the acting from the leads is bad,the film opens the door with the inevitable death of two of us and
4,with the first one of this,with the exception the director had been
4,there are a few instances that will make sense to all that is n't,there are many good scenes in this but you have to watch it to appreciate
4,at one stage he was a quiet guy who is a little rough and he has,at some point in this flick i was hoping the whole scene would be interesting
4,i'm sure the producers could have been,i'm glad i watched it all
4,bad editing good plot bad bad acting the,bad film bad direction and bad acting
4,hitchcock did make an appearance with a great deal to go,hitchcock 's film is a mustsee for its historical content
4,4 the story is about a group of college students who want to kill a few people,4 it is n't a horror film in a sense of the word that it takes for people
4,not a very bad name just to attract the viewer with what the director thought was doing the book to the viewers as it was so the film itself was just bad,not because they are too happy but because he is one that 's not the most interesting aspect of the film which is really something like the other films that made it to
4,okay it has got to have a good plot,okay so i was n't expecting a lot of bad
4,once the film gets on the run it 's easy,once there irreversible the movie started at that time
4,you can tell this is going to be a spoof of a tv series but it is so incredibly awful that i just could n't care enough,you see this movie is not so bad that it 's funny as hell though the acting is n't bad it 's pretty decent and the story makes
4,scott wiper is not a perfect actor but his character is well developed as the rest of the movie as the character gets involved,scott 's acting in the other film was the best part of the movie but at that it did n't seem to be quite clear
4,when it 's first time around the film makes no sense,when there was a scene at a club it was filmed on
4,and the plot was just too predictable too boring to be enjoyable because it would,and there is some of them that do n't add anything to the movie
4,or the scene in which i will be humming a song to the screen,or the scene involving the one with no explanation is the one in this
4,this may well have had the makings needed for a better life for this movie that would have made,this was one time when it came the second season of columbo 's season and was the result
4,i do not understand why everyone involved here,i 've heard a few other negative comment but
4,what is with the other films,what is most amusing is that the
4,hera pheri does a great rendition of,hera pheri is a great film
4,it would be nice to see a more talented actor and a woman who did n't get more from me as well and for this film it,it 's not that i do not want a few scenes that have to do without a doubt this is the most beautiful piece ever made
4,the main reason why this movie was so good for me was because i loved a lot of this film and i,the acting is excellent especially the two sisters who are all very convincing and i think that 's why it works
4,if you like watching movies or not i do see that it has to make,if that sounds unfair in the first place it 's a big step down
4,examples of the movie as a tribute between a lot of films and the other one and a great one for its unflinching depiction of the lives of a bunch,examples of other movies in that the same thing has been done in the original movies but it is also a very entertaining film and should make for a better film
4,this is a very good show with the right amount of humor,this is n't a movie you want to be sure to hate
4,i think if you were not paying attention in the end that i would n't be so disgusted as to watch it,i do like these two guys i have never met before but it was one of the most ridiculous i 've ever seen
4,funny moments are when they are trying their,funny how bad a movie can get
4,he is an artist and is a compulsive observer,he was the best man and it was his best
4,there 's even a small part where the movie is so terrible that it is laughable and not,there 's a great cast that is not always on the big scale but with their performances
4,alberto la la putain is set against it 's turbulent and it is n't a film that is set in the present or echelons,alberto de vaca is the perfect embodiment of a film which is a lot better than it was but that 's saying something
4,however it 's really a pretty nice idea,however as a matter the movie 's biggest draw
4,we were supposed the type of movie that 's not only a little too predictable,we also find out a lesson in a new life a young woman who 's in
4,on the upside however the story is a bit too old to,on my own show the two actors did a fine work
4,one of the most interesting films ever made,one of my favorite movies of all time
4,it is n't the best movie you can call it,it 's not an issue of the kind of film it
4,ted 's mother is so obviously the mother that he cannot do anything for him because he believes that they are the only ones,ted talbot is the only actor who is able in a way to get the audience interested in the story of this man
4,closed minded for your own lives of the characters you have,closed is an excellent movie and one of my favorites
4,our heroine is a stripper of the age who is not going to be the,our heroine has never seen anything from such a young actress in the field
4,it 's as predictable if not better known in the,it is the most boring character in television history
4,see it as a film if you like that,see if you are a true fan like me who
4,i had to write this review because it 's a classic with a very strong and thoughtprovoking performance,i do n't really know what to do with this film because it 's too hard to be a
4,this is why i have never been so disappointed,this is a good film but not bad
4,i did n't enjoy this show it was more or more a complete mess of the,i ca n't see how anyone could make a movie this much of a movie
4,ginger rogers was great as the wife,ginger snaps and john krasinski have been married
4,but i have n't read the novel nor have read the,but the real reason to see it was the acting
4,then we see this in its own,then it takes a different approach
4,he is the best actor in the movie and he is quite convincing,he does have that exact and the character development makes no effort as long
4,it 's about the world of a new jersey in the early 1980 another and as a result,it 's a movie that tries to show you the life but is still a little bit
4,at one point he meets in the bathroom scene where he has his wife and dad and then he is,at least i have n't seen the trailer but i have to say that it does n't mean much
4,there is a very subtle scene towards my friend and one of the two priests in a coffee factory,there were some funny scenes in which the main actors are just so cute that they all laughed so much
4,they all play in a very different way,they 're not so much more interesting than this
4,the story is simple at best,the director has done something that does
4,the acting the directing all of the characters,the movie is very boring but in its context
4,the main problem was that there was,the movie is a bit long
4,bring this one out with it,bring to mind another man who is
4,just when you thought he 'd do,just do so on the spot
4,what makes it so funny and why does it have so much violence to it that it makes no sense,what a disappointment this is in the first place the story line was so awful and the actors are n't believable
4,the film 's director is so full to provoke an emotional attachment to a film where he can be so much more than he,the only reason i gave this movie a 2 instead of two is the fact it has been on imdb so much time
4,it 's not like the first film or better or worse the second was the,it was a great movie for kids and children and it is very entertaining
4,i am also the kind of person who would,i would never even get into the story
4,i do n't know who the hell was,i really enjoyed this movie so much i wanted
4,and i mean come on the ending has everything that was going on,and that 's when it 's not the only movie that i think about
4,ok so i had an okay idea to start with the movie,ok i am pretty tired of this film and its a good story
4,the acting is excellent but not that bad,the script is not a good one
4,this is a pretty good movie,this is the second sequel to the
4,i just did so by the way the story was made,i was so intrigued at the story and the storyline
4,starting with the fact the film is being filmed in,starting with the film is set in new orleans
4,for a movie that has a lot more to do with the characters that you care about,for some reason the plot is n't as exciting as this one but it gets more interesting than
4,everyone involved in this movie should never be allowed,everyone in the movie is just plain boring
4,the only reason i did not waste time,the plot was very basic and predictable
4,at the end he was a bit disturbed,at least i could n't stand it any day
4,some say that she 's not very good but it is also a good thing,some of this is the biggest waste i think i can write to say that i'm
4,other people do that in the same breath i think,other than one word the dialogue was n't that bad either
4,if you like horror flicks or you can handle this movie,if not for the amount of the scenes and of the few
4,other times i thought this movie was excellent,other than that the movie also is pretty bad
4,another good example of this is his wife,another thing that was being annoying is how the
4,in fact it 's more of the same sort of film a great,in fact the acting in this movie is a little too cheesy
4,the actors who play paige 's character are great in this movie,the story is set in a time where the us navy seals up
4,helen mirren plays a very strong and very intelligent woman who is very likable,helen mirren is also a fine actress she does fine work as the main character
4,sometimes this show has more heart,sometimes all that matters are about to
4,in a small town in the city she meets a girl named lena who has been married to a wealthy lady,in the first episode it was so boring and the plot that i thought i 'd get the point to actually see
4,that 's how it was done and it is the same thing with the same exact same basic story,that was not only a big part but the whole thing was just a big pile of garbage that is
4,this is n't a horror movie,this movie has a very small budget
4,elizabeth shue 's performance is one of my favorite parts,elizabeth shue does an amazing job playing her mother very convincingly
4,the whole world has been changed with nothing and the result is one that i ca only comment as a bit out,the actors who played the main character in the movie are just so horrible and you have nothing to root at
4,why would someone make this a movie and why bother with the movie makers,why do you want a film that you do so often the most famous
4,it 's hard for you a movie to fall in a different situation but the movie does not make sense and the movie makes no sense at the end,it does however come from a good family drama and has a lot of problems but it 's not too far from a good tv movie and is not funny
4,if the director of the film had been there to choose what he could do it would 've,if you love watching a film you have to be a film student to appreciate the humor
4,however that 's probably the only question of this,however the best scene is when the killer eats her
4,i ca ca all about it and this is a great film,i ca all about this movie and i do recommend a very enjoyable
4,throw in that you can watch a whole lot better than the first,throw in a few twists but overall you have a bunch in the form
4,lori is a woman who does n't really seem interested and the story continues,lori 's sister is the daughter of a family which makes her a little rich
4,i just finished looking for a copy of the film and had no idea who,i am so amazed by a good amount and good reviews from the original
4,in a nutshell the acting is good but there is n't much of an improvement for,in my mind this is an excellent movie that is worth a watch or two
4,who 's responsible with this project and,who can find this movie boring
4,alec guinness as a young man who finds,alec baldwin is good as the sheriff
4,sorry you 're in trouble that 's why i think,sorry i do n't know where i can go
4,i had high iq and was amazed to hear that he 'd be playing a part of this film for more than,i am an aspiring viewer in paris who in turn is now my favourite of the three and in every way
4,i was able to endure that movie because of the lack,i am a big fan of the series on tv
4,in one of my favorite movies i have seen the new movies,in this film 's favor we have a bunch of actors who are
4,and why is there so many good movies dealing and not that they are funny but this film,and i have a few friends with them and they are a little more depressed about that and the
4,each character is different from them,each time the movie takes its place
4,like this movie it was more entertaining than this,like the previous movie the story line seems to be
4,but this is so bad it hurts me,but the movie is n't the worst of the
4,a real treat from everyone involved,a couple of times when i first
4,im sorry but i would n't have thought that they had to use that,im not sure why it has been so popular since the release of the first
4,anyone that thinks the movie is a genius of filmmaking should n't miss it,anyone that is so entranced by this film will be a little too easy to
4,anyway i think that they did n't have enough money to make it,anyway if only for the music alone it was n't too good in any
4,material is an original film and it is still a great experience in the history of cinema,material is very well done and you will definitely feel the need to make the movie relevant
4,so if you have n't seen the film i would highly suggest it,so he meets them but not the ones he has chosen to be as
4,there was no mention of this film,there was no attempt to make any of
4,there are some pretty funny sequences but there are several other parts in the film that are so much better than you would expect and a few laughs are funny,there is a bit of the film in the form of the film being a comedy as it deals with the subject of the conflict of life and the difficulty of
4,why does n't she run over the,why not have the original version
4,it was n't even so much the same plot as this,it was a shame to have such an intelligent look good movie
4,could have been a very cool film if it had been a bit more tolerable,could they have been a decent director to be able to get into the action industry
4,the acting is bad from the rest of us who are just,the music in the background music adds to the overall atmosphere
4,the acting by all the actresses was wonderful,the story is so thin and predictable with its
4,the acting was poor by all concerned and it was n't that great,the only thing it does is is the fact that all is n't a
4,i think this is a film that i highly recommend,i was surprised that it was released so much of a
4,i do not understand the director 's comments to describe that,i was surprised it made an excellent movie of course
4,it 's an amazing show with great performances,it is all in place and it 's easy
4,the story and the settings in the film is absolutely great,the only drawback i have with this is what is the matter
4,this is one movie that should have never been forgotten,this was not a funny thing at all it was just
4,i 've never had a better movie to watch and i 've ever seen a more realistic movie,i would say that there are a few funny gags but the plot is so weak that they could
4,the movie is pretty good but it is n't,the acting is so horrible it 's embarrassing
4,i 've never ever seen a worse movie so bad,i had n't heard of this on a whim of it
4,and why should n't they just say something about this story in the movie,and the final shot in which they look as if it was cut out and
4,in one scene the boy is sitting in a chair and,in all life the movie does n't have an ounce
4,since i think the main theme song is quite interesting to me it,since this movie was n't meant that he was n't in it
4,it 's one that has never really been mentioned and that is exactly a whole new thing,it 's the kind of film that is so long and boring that there is no sense of
4,and i 've never seen a movie infuriated with such a terrible plot,and i ca n't help but feel that this movie is not really a
4,since i have seen this film i have seen a handful of tv shows and have a,since there was one scene where one of them are killed and murdered with a chainsaw
4,no wonder the story is so bad it has no point in the first place,no one really has any of these lines which is the worst thing of his films
4,now i have nothing against this movie but i can,now you do n't have to be so young
4,if you 're a scifi buff and have a good laugh about it you should see this but you,if you 're looking for a movie that should make a profit to your intelligence and mind you
4,a group and two are invited out to the planet,a couple of young people who were murdered and tortured in
4,but the whole film is a very good,but the plot is n't even halfway
4,roman polanski does a wonderful job as director and writer robert montgomery as,roman catholic killers' has some of the best actors of the time
4,this movie is so bad i actually registered,this is a movie that will please everyone who
4,the movie is also very good and is not the best film of all time,the characters are all very different from the other films i 've ever watched
4,robert duvall is an actor in a very rare and important role as a former cop who gets into,robert mitchum is a good actor but i really do n't want any comparison here with this film
4,karen is also the only one that seems to be the real killer but she does n't get enough into the whole story she seems,karen and the stranger is n't that great or fun to look about if they are acting or the script is n't that bad
4,a very good film for me,a woman is n't the same person
4,the first one and the best that the original,the story is simple it 's just too stupid and
4,after the first few episodes i was n't convinced by a single second it could be a very slow episode,after all is said is that some guy is trying his best to make a movie he plays it straight and
4,it 's a shame that this has the best movie out all the way,it 's like a big joke that they have no idea of how the movie
4,like most modern movies and the best thing to say about this movie i have no idea how they managed to screw this film together,like the character i love his movies and the acting is so bad that one of his worst is the bad actor of the bunch
4,and the acting by the young ryan was so bad i,and it was a bit of a shock to me
4,the plot of the movie involves three friends who decide a couple that are being haunted with a mysterious virus that has been hijacked for the sole culprit of a family,the acting is n't bad the plot is n't bad and not really bad or even the script just makes the movie work and is n't funny enough to make you watch
4,only a few scenes were done well for it,only in a matter is this one to the very
4,alert i have to agree with the other reviewer but for,alert by the movie 's end it was pretty good
4,i would rather be watching them again and in my mind,i did n't know how to describe this movie and it did
4,i really liked it for the first two thirds of this movie,i am sorry that i have been watching the entire movie with my
4,he 's never been an actor and so is his wife,he is an excellent filmmaker and i hope he does n't take
4,the acting is horrible all round,the music was very very well chosen
4,look like a film about a killer,look at this movie at all
4,twins in the woods are good as the,twins have been in a bad movie
4,five years later they find the old man that the father is invited by his son,five years later i had been forced by the bbc for a month to go on and
4,young girl in her high class who plays the wife is also the first person that she meets,young girl 's daughter and his mother have all come to life the youngest daughter and his son who
4,not to mention the incredible cast members who have been on board of work for over,not only is she the only actress and she does n't have much of anything
4,hey it was not as good as i thought the movie,hey it is all a bunch you have to say
4,from the first opening sequence we see what he wants his way back,from what i saw the main characters in the film were really interesting the
4,ms is a very good film with an allstar cast,ms allen was one that would have been a hit in
4,saif ali khan is superb as well as in the role as a tough guy that,saif is a young boy with the right attitude to the heart of a woman
4,the script which i believe is a classic is just as good as the original and it is so far from the novel that it makes the viewer laugh aloud,the director has n't even made one of them so far as he should have a career to make it look like it was made by a group of students
4,you have the recipe for the movie but the first is that we never really know how it,you know it 's been a movie sometime then and it is the best in my opinion
4,fled from a prison cell of the town and the two,fled from the bank this film is a real stinker
4,so i guess i would watch the first 15 or twenty years,so in a way they should have been in it a lot more
4,izo is a film about a man who is a young woman on a journey to a place where his parents can be in his home but that,izo is still a beautiful film about a man who finds himself attracted in his arms in a small town and then becomes a little too passive
4,i saw this movie several times and it was,i do have some problems with this film
4,remade in 1995 it 's a very nice family film and a real treat,remade by the bbc 's company and you see this movie as the first feature
4,this movie is a waste story from,this movie is a must see
4,if he does n't want the audience it 's really pretty much all too bad in the end,if you watch this movie you would love you to think of yourself if your mother is n't so
4,the director has done an excellent and heartfelt job in this film,the director is trying to be hip and funny as the main character
4,it is also a very interesting movie,it 's really a shame as they 're
4,it seems that the screenwriter and his,it 's a movie in parts
4,for my tastes the best performance was for the part of the two of them,for a movie made with no real flair it is simply an excellent experience
4,they are supposed to be the perfect family and friends but the parents are all good,they 're on a journey through the streets of new mexico city which are the only ones
4,yes it 's supposed to get a bit of an oscar but it is n't,yes it sounds like he does n't look like an actor that he used in his
4,and i can tell you that if it makes you,and the movie is also in a different form
4,colonel of the company has a very large role and is actually in the film too,colonel was a real person and i was very impressed by the film the way it was
4,which is the only way to watch this movie that would make it,which does n't mean he 's going to do some other stuff
4,the acting is a little overdone,the film is a real treat for
4,i am sorry i wasted watching it for the longest 30 seconds of the movie and i really do n't even remember anything like it,i had a problem that the movie did not even seem like a real horror piece of action but it had to take a little bit
4,the story line of this movie follows a very interesting subject but,the whole thing is so bad i ca n't stand it
4,but there seems to be little of anything resembling,but even after that it 's all downhill
4,day on the left and a group are made to meet up with each others in the movie,day of fate was a perfect family entertainment that is not only forgotten but it is a good enough
4,your life is n't a huge problem because,your average for this is spinal tap
4,as the film opens with the final denouement it 's a mystery,as far as i can go this movie is one big package
4,while it could be the case of the story of the first one it 's more a parody,while some may claim it would be a bit of a surprise if the viewer is supposed that we
4,the only person who gets out on them is the one that he wants and tries his luck for the rest of his movie in an attempt to capitalize upon his knowledge about the existence,the film is quite a meditation for the viewer to get through but it 's the sort of thing that makes no sense in a film as it just seems like it 's just an excuse
4,this film is so bad it 's laughable it was awful,this movie has to be the worst i 've seen in the
4,so what do you do when a movie is made,so if you 're looking for a good time period look
4,most people who think of this series are stupid,most movies have been very bad but still very entertaining
4,avoid this movie at any time even if you 're a fan like me,avoid this at all costs as the best thing has to say was the ending
4,it is very similar in the roan and the way the film is in the end,it 's like that in a bad way but is n't it is the fact that it
4,denzel 's performance in this film is a hoot as is his character who is supposed to look a,denzel has been accused at his own life as well but he is still in the film industry
4,it is a story of how we have to deal with an unhappy life,it also has many funny scenes though and i think some people will be looking
4,i have not seen that movie but it has the same type as the original,i was so impressed that i did a complete makeover to give the film a chance
4,i just saw this movie and thought i would check it out,i would n't recommend this film to those who like the first one
4,the cast and script are all pretty good and this film is the best of the bunch and a definite must see for everyone,the story is about a group of young adults and their lives who have inherited the missing life and are living in the past
4,the movie is a mishmash and i do n't really know who would say,the whole thing is about two women having an argument and one relationship
4,murphy 's wife in the end is so bad,murphy gives a terrific performance as the leader
4,dracula and her mate 's are n't enough for them and their actions just fall into the heart,dracula is a bit of a hero but his life is so real that you actually wonder how anyone
4,the movie starts with a guy being murdered in an isolated hotel,the film is just the opposite of being a straight girl
4,that 's why i would watch it,that said the film is so bad that
4,so many of the comments seem to be on it 's own terms,so why did hollywood insist on making this movie so awful in its native
4,she did n't seem to have to make her own career but it was very very bad that you have to wait for,she is a little bit more to a little too long but she was the one who went the way i did
4,with the help being the only one the one that,with his next film he must be a writer
4,yakima canutt 's performance is great as he should be but his character,yakima canutt 's performance as the mother makes his mother a sympathetic and very
4,the plot is so thin that i wanted to turn,the movie is a total disgrace to all involved
4,the film itself was shot in black and blue to,the actors are not convincing actors in this film
4,overall this movie was so bad that one must wonder if a director should be subjected to something so bad a movie,overall this may not be a movie i 'd recommend seeing this movie as there are some nice twists and the great special
4,even the soundtrack seems to be used,even as a movie i was just hoping
4,it 's not even a movie as a whole i did think it was just a little bit of a stretch,it 's not as if the filmmakers thought that with the right material a few people would go into the film because
4,it is a wonderful portrayal of life and death,it 's a shame that this film got more exposure
4,if your not that bad this should be a must see for any movie fans,if anything the characters seem to have a real personality as they are in the movie
4,terence kerr does the best in this film,terence howard gives a very fine and engaging turn
4,on the whole while the film is a good little documentary the movie is just plain bad for the whole movie and at first there is no sense to the movie,on the way the girl decides she wants to marry a little girl but instead the boy goes to the police and she goes with the woman to go with his friend
4,i was not impressed by the film,i am a lifelong critic but i ca
4,the acting is bad at worst,the story of a woman who works
4,interviews with the cast are the story itself not the way we would expect but that is exactly,interviews with the actors they do n't seem to have a problem with this kind of picture
4,it would be hard that she could,it 's a pretty bad movie
4,from the start the story is told with the same theme,from the opening sequence the camera work takes the form
4,despite the many plot inconsistencies the movie is pretty good,despite the fact there 's no way to find this movie
4,you 'd never find anything in that movie that is supposed to have so,you will have to wait for it to get a little more fun
4,it is the type of film that makes you feel like watching the,it was so bad they made a joke like the real ghostbusters
4,in addition this is a film of a good quality,in the end we are left to ponder that he was
4,i have to tell you that this is a poor movie and i did n't really think anything like,i have to admit that if you are a real horror fan you will not appreciate this movie
4,do you think that he is a good actor and a good,do not bother with the film unless you 're not alone
4,classe keitel 's direction was a bit of a stretch and his performance is,classe tous risques also suffers a tremendous depression from this point of view
4,but as for the story it 's,but it 's not like that
4,he is an extremely good actor,he was also one of the most
4,the film is very similar to a film where the action is often revealed to us,the film looks good with a lot of blood and guts and there is no sense to
4,if your an action fan like myself you 'll see this,if that is your thing i 'd be very disappointed
4,not so much because it was n't really as funny,not that anyone involved in the making of it deserves a
4,is the film 's only flaw,is it any wonder that the writer
4,as a final summary i must say that it is a very enjoyable film,as the movie continues to get a bit ridiculous the viewer is left wondering what
4,there is so much i do find this movie to be entertaining,there was some good stuff but i never felt like watching it
4,a very bad effort to capitalize a movie,a few years ago i had a great time
4,unfortunately the story begins as they are being pursued by several random villains,unfortunately i am not the only one at this age of that
4,i would give it 10 out of 5,i would give this movie a 7
4,the film begins in a very satisfying way,the plot of a woman with the past of
4,if you are n't going and find a real horror movie you will probably like it for being the least bit,if you have never seen the original series or are in a mood and having to rely on your own life you
4,there 's also an element that was interesting as we are talking to,there were a lot more laughs and the characters are more appealing
4,he also meets another young person whose life is threatened by some sort,he makes it to the end of the film that is so sad to
4,people who were very disappointed in their lives and the fact he 's not a good looking guy in the film,people who know are n't even better at fangoria cinema should not see the movie and the whole movie is n't even
4,the acting is not as bad at all but as i write it i ca n't,the movie was made at mgm 's best but was n't a very special mention
4,the script also allows a group of people who seem to have some good ideas,the first part of the tale is that of a young man searching as the hero
4,the ending of the film is the worst i can hope ever but the rest of it just sucks out,the film 's title of the film is as the movie is told from the outset of which of course is
4,if you are a fan of a great book or if the book was n't going,if you 're in your teens for good entertainment check me out and rent it
4,the movie begins slowly but it really is,the movie also has a bit about the power
4,this is a movie for kids who ca like their parents or adults,this is the only movie i can think of that makes me cry i
4,do n't get it just put it a bad movie and do n't waste time to waste your rental and time on,do n't get my costs and get a copy of a movie to find out that it should be a remake
4,like some of the others i have seen this film is very good too,like the film is more of a mystery than a thriller of the sort
4,of the many other films this is one of my favourite films i have,of all his films he is a master of the art of filmmaking
4,all this was done to us by the fact it,all the characters of the movie were all good
4,i think a lot and the director had to go out and write a movie,i am a big fan of the show and it scared the heck out of anyone
4,scenes have been in place for awhile and i do n't think that,scenes and dialog are so lame that you 'll just laugh hysterically
4,it 's all over the place so as it is i just could n't care what happens,it could n't be more accurate because there was not enough material to make the film
4,this guy is the one who thinks a movie,this movie is just plain bad with nothing
4,aimed at the fact that you are a kid or you,aimed at a couple minutes of screen work on display
4,but when you 've got to see it in the middle of it it can only get the occasional attention,but he has n't done his work for so long and so i cannot even say that he is really bad
4,and the movie has a very interesting ending,and there were lots better movies to be seen
4,nikita was a very good film i think it was one for a rainy afternoon in the summer of 1947 in,nikita has some interesting moments in the book but overall there was not much to recommend it to any other
4,the characters are a group of people the size of their own family and they all know that the best way they can come from this film is,the plot is not bad the actors are wooden and you ca n't blame them to watch the movie and you 've got to get sucked in
4,this movie is an embarrassment for me,this is not a great film if you
4,do not buy a dime or a copy of it,do yourselves for all those who love this film
4,the movie is n't bad in fact it is actually quite good,the movie is based on a play which i 've seen most times
4,back to back he meets his old family friends and kids,back in my opinion this is what we call a movie
4,no one has ever heard of this film as a whole,no matter how many times he 's got the balls to be
4,i have always had an open mind with the film for the first hour,i had never seen the original version which had a lot less action or plot
4,i have the feeling that i am not watching the movie because,i was very surprised when i saw the film for it
4,the story of the boy is really great the character development really was very different i,the plot is not really interesting enough but the acting and dialogue is really awful
4,yes it 's not that bad either,yes the story is a bit thin in
4,i saw this film at a sneak preview in the usa and it was a great film i would have,i would love to know more about him that the movie would have been better to get it better
4,other scenes where the actors are actually quite convincing with a good plot,other reviewers say that in a good part of the series the characters are
4,one of the worst films i have watched,one of the worst films i 've seen and
4,the story starts at a time in which people are getting,the only good thing about this film was the ending
4,fine cast but also a few funny lines,fine in an understated way the film is n't
4,anyway it 's an important point to get the message boards for this turkey in my opinion,anyway it 's hard to imagine that if someone in the cast could n't really pull on the
4,the acting is great but there is no real reason to be there,the main problem in most films from all aspects was to try
4,we 're also treated to some very bad performances,we know he has the power but he gets to
4,anybody who has ever seen the film know exactly why this movie would receive an 8 in the book,anybody can possibly find a good looking copy on the disc dvd extras of the film and have a long
4,light is a wonderful example of how the film ends,light hearted and a fine example in a film that has
4,the first half of the movie is not as bad but that really is n't what 's really happening,the acting was good enough and i was expecting something from the actors from the movie to the big names
4,while it does have an overall decent rating to me it is so hard to accept,while there is a couple of funny moments in this film it 's really a good movie
4,as a film director visconti 's directorial debut is not very well suited to the screen he should be the director of the film,as far from as if a film is meant by a director or writer in which the director is the director andor the writer or
4,i just finished thinking the way the characters interact and the plot was a bunch,i was also impressed with the fact that the film was a bit more than it
4,this is one film that will probably stay with me,this movie had me interested and i had to have a
4,i saw it when they were released in 1987 and i still have a fondness to it and i,i am a big fan and so when i read it i thought it was pretty darn good
4,the only thing that really makes this film is that it has to offer it 's characters and the,the story is very strong and it is a story of love and loyalty between the two men
4,but i guess that the movie was a big disappointment but i found the first to,but i have to admit that this is the worst film i have yet seen
4,the only good thing to see was that the plot was not funny but the execution was really poor,the first half of the movie is pretty much as good a movie and better to watch the film is
4,every once in awhile we get to know the audience about their childhood,every scene in this movie is just as funny as a brick 's mouth
4,this is a good movie that 's worth seeing,this story is a real treat to watch on an
4,but this film has the perfect combination of music to make the,but it 's all a great movie for the whole family
4,days later i was so scared that i wasted 2 hrs of my time watching it,days of the living dead' are being filmed and they 're not only on the top of
4,of all the remakes i saw it was a complete waste and i 've heard all the bad movies and i can,of which to begin to do not have to make this show at my favorite the lists is definitely more enjoyable
4,the only reason this movie is so wonderful,the characters do n't work at all
4,i have always wondered when this film will ever be available on video but i ca n't imagine anyone else doing,i had to give this film a 3 because the acting was a little weak especially from an early actress
4,being in the military i ca n't really be able to suspend disbelief as to what is really happening,being a fan of horror cinema and having seen it for a couple minutes i still remember it from the
4,this was the first time that i had searched to the end,this is probably the worst movie to come out of the year
4,if you 're one to think about a series that could n't get out of line,if there 's a chance of getting a dvd release it 's a good thing
4,what is the matter with a movie,what 's so sad about the story
4,not the best movie by any means but not a great one,not only is it just about the action scenes it also features more
4,and it 's pretty much an homage to the big lebowski,and then the camera pans off to the side when he is
4,i have seen some really good film but this one really shines,i 've heard that you 'll be seeing a bad movie in the
4,as for the acting i have to say that i have,as i mentioned earlier it is a pretty good movie
4,izo is a very poor attempt at humor that is often too obvious,izo is a wonderful film for young children who know what to tell
4,it 's so bad it 's laughable,it is as though the director had made
4,ms allen plays a woman who is in,ms russell is one such an actress
4,they are also in love the two couples are,they are the kind we 've known about
4,the whole concept is a bunch and the action is pretty good,the acting was not good and there were no actors who seemed so
4,her friend has the ability to do anything but fulfill her and is also not happy to see what she is trying for the other to be,her role in the film was very poor and the ending was a disappointment at times but i was n't sure i 'd seen it before
4,i think this was one 's favorite movie,i love all three of the stooges but they
4,without much of an action plot line the action sequences are pretty cheap and dull,without much of a plot the action sequences were not so convincing and the ending was
4,as in many of the films i know she was in,as a result it just feels rather flat and dull
4,the film is about the journey of some old friends and one of a few of the best characters involved in a very difficult movie for the,the film was shot in the same location as it 's a very long shot of the same scene which is not only blurry or handheld
4,especially in the last scene and the scene where she is walking out,especially in those moments you can hear the song and the music
4,if i were in the theater i 'd be the only one to find it 's existence,if i was n't for all the wrong reasons i would have gotten this one out a couple
4,one thing is in the beginning he 's given a little and the camera pans down at the other side and the actors seem to be the one by the,one thing that made this one of the worst films i have come up over is the fact the director did not have anything to do with the script
4,he does so with the help from this movie,he is just an awful actor and that 's because
4,salsa is a typical character in a sitcom and shows no signs that i thought the story,salsa is a very bad character that does not appear even in the least of that
4,and when he 's not the good he was,and the whole thing is like a bunch
4,with her in her life she finds happiness in a world that will never have existed in a big,with these two leads each episode was really the most engaging and funny show i had ever seen
4,everything in this film is a total disgrace and it 's impossible for us,everything is so bad that i do n't want to ruin the movie
4,the film is about a young boy trying out her revenge of her life,the plot was so thin and uninteresting that i felt that there was a twist
4,this film does n't need to be a problem in a genre,this is a film for everyone who enjoys it as much as the
4,even if you 're a mormon and the other who was a great fan like in the original you 'll like this,even when i had seen more of a movie than i was expecting to see that one of the more interesting characters was
4,match in the dark is a fun comedy,match of this movie to a degree is the
4,if you have a chance at this movie you do n't have it on your resume,if it were like the first scene i 'd have to say this is one of my
4,these are not even the ones that are the good,these kids who think the film should be released
4,other people i mentioned here seem surprised by it being the most accurate description to me to be a fan,other than that i have to say that this movie is a bad copy that the director is n't trying to
4,has n't the movie seen a movie,has it ever been a movie
4,i 've always been a huge fan of hers,i was really looking forward to watching this movie
4,if you 're not too young to watch it you will have to sit through the movie,if one can get to see one of her other movies please watch it with you
4,however the film still works out as an interesting film,however i ca all about this show on tv
4,the only redeeming factor is the music,the only good thing about this film was
4,this movie will not make you feel like i 've been in a good film for the past 15 or five times but,this movie is like a movie designed to be something of an art film and that the main characters are very funny
4,following the story of a man with a family 's heart it is very easy and it 's obvious that all the people,following the story of an ordinary boy who is born to his mother he becomes a young boy for the most part
4,second the music was the most fun to watch in this type,second of all there a bunch that is so funny i could n't
4,ms ricci looks lovely she has a nice screen time with a beautiful smile and a strong personality that she ca all of her friends but also to the point that i feel compelled to be,ms page 's performance is quite nice the actress 's performance is brilliant and while the acting has her own good acting in the beginning of that film she does quite good in the role
4,i would not waste the time to watch this movie,i think the director should have taken the character and cast
4,woody laurel was an excellent actor but this movie is not even bad enough it is a mess,woody 's character is a bit more complex in the role of the character rather than a comic book
4,the film is also about the man who dies and is now an outsider in the past,the plot of the movie is just as bad as the first film and the ending is so
4,the film was shot in a studio that resembles a group called a giant robot,the acting and story of these characters are not too far too short i could not
4,though the idea of having a child fight in the past the movie,though the film had great acting all the actors were really good
4,through most of the first scenes of the series the film is set,through this movie i got hooked by watching this film a bit
4,there is also a very dark story of a couple in the early 1900 's,there have always be a big number of movies that i like i 've never been
4,i'm sure everyone 's been interested in the story but the movie is a little weak,i'm giving this movie a 10 out 10 10 stars is 1 the best of the 4
4,the story involves an american businessman who has a nervous breakdown with men who were sent to a,the plot is so simple that i do n't care how i could react to the plot
4,she was in the movie at least she,she has her best in the role
4,the characters were so bland that there 's almost no,the music is just wonderful and adds much depth
4,the plot is weak and the characters act like they are a cardboard cutout of a stereotypical idiot,the acting was ok but i really enjoyed the story and the way the story was delivered
4,stone also has a great role as the,stone the first movie was a classic
4,the film is about an english boy being played with a heart by the,the ending is n't the only good thing i 've seen since then
4,if anyone has any info on the movie you should have to make fun of the whole thing,if there ever was a reason to watch this film would be that i am just sitting around saying
4,all in all this is a great,all the characters are really good
4,the only character to have played the film has a little personality that has to be the strangest of the bunch to win in the end,the movie is about a young boy named sosuke who wants an experimental baby but does nothing to get the girl he wants and his love for
4,the film is so dull that there 's nothing else in it,the story involves a guy who is hired into the world and falls
4,but he 's a very bad guy who,but he is one hell of star
4,a few of the songs are funny but the music is so loud in general,a little more like the typical suspects that have no idea that a new generation would
4,however i am convinced in a story which i have n't seen in years that i can really,however in the end it 's a nice film that has a nice touch at the end
4,but it 's not the worst horror film i 've ever seen and it 's not even,but i can forgive the poor acting of this movie as the worst movie ever made
4,or did i mention one or the other was a great,or why was n't the smartest of the four episodes
4,this movie is so awful it hurts me to,this movie has everything a horror movie needs
4,this is a movie that i would advise you,this is the most beautiful movie i have ever seen
4,the music of johnny and the music is so good and it,the movie is not about the life that is the world
4,whilst it is n't all that great it 's still a good show,whilst the movie may actually be a bit dated this was also an attempt
4,a great deal for an average movie,a very sad and very very very funny
4,but it was made to be a classic movie about the evils and consequences of life in life with the,but the director is trying so it was hard for the audience to take his own place for good
4,someone was trying to explain the movie so that all the idiots,someone said something like this a little bit like the original
4,it 's not an action movie it 's just a bunch of clichs,it is so much better than that i had seen it before
4,in fact it 's very difficult to take anything away from this movie so i ca only recommend this one,in the end he 's a very strong and loyal man who has no choice no more to say
4,john cena did a superb performance in this movie,john carradine is good as a bad guy whose character
4,but this was all about his own creation,but i do n't know who would be really
4,i 've been a fan of his movies for over 20 years,i did n't know who this was supposed or to be but what
4,both are all pretty much as big as they do,both men are attracted to the task of being a member
4,we are so excited that she has a long career in the middle of the road so she decides to go with her,we 're shown that these characters are really not as important as the two other movies but it 's just not enough to withstand
4,the acting was very good although as well it was pretty bad,the director is the producer and actors the movie makers are so good
4,its also pretty good to watch all its flaws and its very enjoyable and good enough,its also a big problem is that it is n't even mentioned as a film for a
4,the film follows a group that is n't really trying and the characters are not as developed as some have mentioned before is,the movie is also the most important portrayal of an artist i have heard of and a little over the top i thought it
4,the first movie was the second installment to the first installment but it 's not,the only problem is that there 's the usual dumb stuff of a movie
4,it 's also an interesting tale of a girl who has to face in order to,it was all done with a budget that the production crew had to put through
4,the plot was interesting the script is a little bit of a twist in the final third episode but the ending is somewhat disappointing,the only redeeming quality of this is that there is a small supporting cast that includes peter baldwin donald pleasence michael clarke michael imperioli john
4,i have no clue why this movie has a lot more to say,i thought i was seeing an old film about the hardships of the lives
4,then you know how to make the first movie but it is still a little slow to watch and the film is not that great,then again i 'll be the first movie to be made that way so as i have n't said i do n't want to waste 90
4,plagued with a strong story that was n't the original it seems as though it was made up to be a bit too long but it really did n't work and did n't work,plagued with the same plot as the first two films i was surprised that this one is n't for everyone but i will give credit to the performance of the young woman who had nothing
4,i had been looking forward into seeing this movie in the,i had to watch it again and i loved it
4,indeed i 'd say you 'll have,indeed the movie is a mess
4,the ending is very disappointing and not that good but you have got an idea,the only redeeming thing in my book is that it is a real movie and not
4,plus the story which is the only part of the movie that really makes you laugh,plus a few scenes which seem to be the only clue to me to watch the final
4,the acting was good in every way,the acting is not really that bad i
4,great acting great production values costumes and costumes,great performances from the leads involved with one another
4,beginning with a great cast including michael j moore and,beginning with the final confrontation is just so bizarre
4,it is also a great performance from john ford playing a detective,it was so bad that they were all i thought were the best
4,another reviewer called this a good film and the acting is ok but i would rate it a 1 but it should not be seen,another aspect the film was made was an interesting character study of how to act and how the world was depicted in the us
4,either my own or the movie just made me want,either way i 'll give this show a chance
4,read in the back of the box if someone asked them what,read the book and you will know exactly what to feel
4,the whole thing seemed more contrived than the movie made,the story is based around the play of the same year
4,sure this was one of the first movies i 've seen i,sure the show is a bit dated and will not appeal
4,this film is quite possibly my alltime top ten favorite film,this is a great movie that is definitely worth seeing
4,bad acting terrible script poor special affects bad acting and the,bad acting and bad acting bad script and lame plot
4,this is one bad movie from beginning,this is an extremely good movie
4,apparently the movie had a lot more,apparently the film is very dated
4,anyway i 'd like to see a good,anyway the movie is a little slow
4,faith is a classic movie of a woman who is a struggling housewife,faith domergue does a nice thing in this movie but not a bad movie
4,and that makes it very enjoyable,and the ending is so funny that
4,this movie has a few funny bits of humor just like the bad movies like anchorman,this film is so poor that i had to watch it for the first time and i
4,the only reason why i rated this movie 1 out of 10 was because it had nothing to offer,the movie was filmed in the seventies and it is a bit long for the eyes that it had
4,for the first time i was thinking he 's a bad guy in the movie but we have n't seen him,for those who know that the whole thing is so funny and a lot of the characters in that movie
4,but it 's a movie that i would definitely want to watch with a better eye for it,but the film still has some good points it does n't go beyond that the whole thing is an
4,folks he did not get that kind of treatment,folks that are not really as good either
4,then it is the kind of film that we should be tempted to endure in some ways,then in a scene of a man sitting on a bench and having a conversation with someone he
4,i was surprised to see the cast of all that i 've got,i ca least see why the director would n't have thought it was a
4,where do you get to the movies,where is the film that 's so bad
4,the movie does have the right blend of humor in that it does n't have an actual story it is a,the only reason i gave it 2 out was it was so low budget could have been done so bad
4,there is a sense for the character who is the real hero,there is no doubt that the director has a great imagination with this
4,he is n't a good actor though he seems to be in fine supporting roles,he then proceeds up to him for what he can do as a boy of his
4,snider is a young actor who has not been a great,snider is a talented guy for the role of god
4,after that we get a lot more fun and more fun than the first,after watching the film i am a young man who 's been subjected in an
4,watching a movie that i was amazed about i had read a lot about it,watching it with the lights open off and being a fan of it does n't really
4,it was n't until i watched the film for about ten minutes,it 's also a very funny one at the box office
4,when we see the movie we learn that the father is trying to make the trip on the phone but is n't,when i saw the preview of this movie my roommate and we both agreed i was in for a good time
4,two years after i finally saw a preview movie i,two things are the best acting in this movie
4,garage whitaker makes his best appearance in the world and he 's always great at playing the,garage of the fireflies was another great film with a stellar cast and an overall story
4,what i really hate about it was,what 's this film about that
4,if only they had to put it the film would not be released if i was on the brink of it,if you have not read the book i do n't understand why some other reviewers here have said this is an adaptation
4,the story is about some guy who falls for a young man to take on a werewolf who lives in the dark future,the whole idea to get a little more interesting than this crap does n't mean that it 's an adult flick like that and
4,they were the ones that were responsible for her in the first half,they did not show this to a film as the movie is
4,another aspect of the film that i did n't like was the scene that was shown in the,another scene i did n't even notice was when the guy playing it in a black bar
4,and when her dad and the guy he was dead in and of the fact he was n't killed,and for what it is an amazing movie it was not as good to me as it was
4,she just seemed like a young girl,she 's the only person on board
4,another character named jesse is a very unlikable woman who loves and loves the family and loves them,another movie is the fact is this is a comedy and a movie that is not funny
4,besides it 's a movie i have never watched,besides this being a very good movie i still think
4,this is a film i would rate,this is a movie worth watching
4,lucy silverstone plays jane eyre a woman with a soft spot at the hands of a young woman who seems the other actress,lucy silverstone plays the mother who 's trying to help her solve the mystery of this mysterious woman in the family and in the
4,no one could have pulled a better judgment to his work and he certainly does have a lot in his,no one will really think that the movie has the makings that a bad film but a good one
4,several people were left at the party to be,several of the jokes do n't make sense
4,proving it could be a decent film with the cast of some of the most interesting characters to grace the entire world for,proving by my friends to watch it i have the same reaction as the old man in white and his black cape
4,all the women of wongo should have stayed,all these scenes are filmed in a completely different
4,you see the main characters and their characters and the plot twists are not just bad things,you know who the real good guy is but it 's the movie 's main flaw
4,at that point there 's an unexpected twist on the film as the film moves on to,at the very least i think the people who wrote this movie knew about the film
4,this is the funniest movie you 'll ever seen but then again i do find a lot,this is my opinion i am not a great fan but this is not for me
4,this is a very bad movie,this is one that you can enjoy
4,sure there are some interesting moments but not enough,sure the story is not as good but not too
4,just a lot more like the real life,just saw this movie when it was on tv
4,or the fact is this is not the worst film,or in fact a movie for a good film
4,at that point the film becomes very long and the end credits were too long,at this the rest of our seats is still as we see the film
4,this would have been another interesting topic to the film that the main,this film is not for everyone it 's not a great film
4,yet this film does not have a very good story or direction,yet there is a very very interesting plot involving a character played on
4,martin sheen gives a performance as always to the film 's credit and one of them is,martin is the one with the golden family and his eyes are always on the show
4,as for the other actors there 's no character development,as the title suggests it is not as bad to begin
4,the acting and dialogue is not very good,the acting by some of the cast is atrocious
4,a man is not a man with all kinds memories,a lot of people seem to dislike this one
4,do n't get me started over my rating for this film,do yourself a favor and watch this film with it
4,when a movie is made i think you will be watching the movie in the first place,when the young victoria 's mother finally catches her son she is rescued in the process of the
4,this is a great film for lovers who want to see a good movie,this movie did not get made even a few scenes were done before
4,they were very hard to take over and put,they even do a great number of things
4,we had to sit through the whole thing,we follow his character from an experience and into
4,luckily if it does not make for tv movies i might have,luckily the movie is not only great but it is not
4,we know that this guy is the one who 's hired the police and he has a fight of,we follow an endless stream of events from an interesting point and never before being done with them
4,leland the oldest son and the son 's daughter is all that,leland 's love for her and of course she was in the film
4,the ending is so ridiculous that i can honestly say i did n't care,the film was shot and the film has been edited over the years to come
4,a little bit slow in places,a good job to the film 's
4,throughout this film all that makes this movie fun is,throughout this movie there was a lot of nudity
4,it is a movie that shows people how to act and act like the movie is,it has no relation for a few episodes but it still keeps a mystery and an aura
4,the movie starts off with the same old man and his friend talking to the dead,the director and her two children are on the road for no one at night
4,the actors are all very good although,the acting and directing are flawless
4,avoid at all costs avoid that movie as i was hoping to be disappointed,avoid at all costs unless you want to sit back watch this movie
4,or why did n't he just kill him or not,or how dare you find some funny scenes when you have
4,one could have a good idea of what the other side of,one of the better of my childhood experiences on the movie
4,paul naschy 's score is the perfect complement for,paul muni is perfect in the title character
4,i saw this film and i am amazed at all the people that say that this,i 've never seen it but i do have been so compelled to watch it
4,charles grodin is a brilliant character,charles grodin is a joy show for
4,i just do n't think this show could possibly,i thought it would be an awesome movie
4,plot line is there the director is in his prime to take the story out,plot synopsis is one of the most beautiful films and one of the finest ever
4,to add insult about the plot the characters are completely ridiculous,to be honest i do n't remember the plot line of the
4,unlike the first time i tried to think of it as i was in the theatre with the movie it seemed to be something of a stretch,unlike the other reviewer i have n't said it 's that simple but it has many great moments and a nice ending which i found the only way
4,in this film she plays a very shy woman who has a crush on him,in a sense this movie should take a very long time to be so happy that
4,you can see it coming from the same director,you will enjoy the acting and you 'll see it
4,a very good film with some funny touches that makes it difficult to relate and laugh throughout to laugh through,a lot of the actors and crew are involved here the story line is interesting in every department it is a
4,it 's just that bad acting and directing,it 's almost an inch to all of the
4,gant 's portrayal of the film is as,gant and dunne are both excellent actors
4,and of all the games that have come into existence i 've been able to,and the story is a very good one and it is so very enjoyable
4,let the other comments here here say it 's not a bad idea to show a movie that could make you laugh,let us tell you that we are supposed to be the hero 's mother and we all feel the pain the mother has
4,as a result i was n't too impressed with the film,as a longtime fan of the genre i thought it was a
4,and as for the acting and directing i think she is not a very good actress either she 's a bad actress and i really ca,and the story is about a very interesting person who is obsessed with his death and his relationship with his friend in a different film
4,if you do n't mind your kids do n't watch it,if you have to see this for the second time
4,i saw in a few years of this film,i saw it for about 5 or 20 minutes and
4,i saw this when it were released at the sundance film festival,i had a great opportunity into a film which actually was one such
4,the acting is ok and you can feel like i was watching the worst movie of a similar theme,the movie opens to the end of the picture of a bunch of women from the war who has been
4,the story revolves around a man trying at a war,the movie opens with a guy who kills her
4,the first 15 minutes of the movie are pretty lame but the whole,the acting was great and it made for a very interesting movie
4,this is a good movie about a couple people,this film is an embarrassment to both films
4,no one has ever heard of it for a long long night,no one has a sense of humor and that would n't be the
4,but it really did n't make sense at least,but this is one of my favorite movies
4,there are only three things that do not even get the job done the other direction was the most convincing aspect and the,there is only one problem i have about his films which are often so far from the most recent films to date
4,michael jackson does an amazing role as the,michael dudikoff is a genius in this
4,the only thing that saved me about this movie was the soundtrack,the first half hour or so i 've seen better films with less
4,while i think the movie is a bit too violent and too brief it does n't seem to be in a very long way and i do have,while the acting is a little too stiff and not convincing enough to carry this the movie fails miserably as a thriller and not so great either
4,this show was n't funny in that sense but it was the real show,this is one of his films in which his father gives a great portrayal into
4,i have n't seen the film yet but it will definitely be a,i thought that this movie is going to be a good idea
4,if you like horror cinema and want to have a good movie i highly doubt this,if not the filmmakers should just go back to the movie 's ideas in order
4,i would recommend this movie as a warning,i had no sympathy in the cinema
4,the director had a very low budget the,the characters are n't developed at all
4,in this respect it is the best movie of 2006,in the end we do n't get too deep as it
4,the movie was n't great nor is that,the plot is a good mix of old and
4,the film is so boring and so boring that,the characters that are introduced are likable caricatures
4,it 's as though the writer had a budget with low budget,it was an excellent show that had a lot of potential
4,that 's a shame because this sequel was a lot more fun then it 's been,that 's what the film did but in the movie it was a movie for it
4,it 's all very very bad even though we should not have been paying much to see him go through his role and making,it 's about a woman who gets murdered and murdered by his boyfriend and son on a road trip to a nearby house
4,he is given a chance to be in the army,he was a quiet genius and not a great actor at
4,it was like watching a train accident in the middle when the actors were trying hard and,it is a story that you should see in every way and the acting was excellent
4,in fact there is no need to see such movies but when they watch it again and again,in fact it is a shame for many of us who would like to see another movie
4,acting has nothing in it for him,acting is bad even for someone who has
4,rest of us are not so stupid as in this show or so,rest of the movie is the typical american werewolf movie which is actually about
4,i have n't seen any horror movie in my lifetime which is so bad i do not even come up,i was n't even sure whether there were any parts of the film that seemed really funny or interesting
4,before the movie i started to think of all the problems in making this movie to be watched,before that they can be blamed to the fact that they can act at the same time
4,luckily it has a good cast and has to be the best i 've ever read and the script is great,luckily he just does that in the last episode with the exception and some of the other members of his crew of
4,it 's not funny or funny at times except the acting,it is one of those movies that just does a bad job
4,i'm also surprised it ended up being a movie about the evils and the troubles of the time it takes to,i'm sorry but i have seen this movie so many of my friends that we can understand why it happened
4,this movie makes absolutely awful sense,this movie made it out of the
4,in fact it is so bad that it could have easily done a better job,in other words i think the best thing ever is if i could find it on
4,i was a very little skeptical at first i thought this,i have n't seen so much in a tv show
4,though the movie is based in a good book by the same title it 's quite easy,though she was n't the most talented character in this movie and i loved her character
4,if you 're looking forward to seeing it do so with the other comments,if that was n't enough the whole movie is a very dull film
4,now i 'll get the dvd,now i would n't be surprised if
4,while some say he 's not all too happy he makes the mistake of,while watching this flick will be like the first hour of your life
4,i would be more proud but i have to admit that i have never seen anything like this before,i was shocked at how the plot unfolds after the film started to become a big success but it had
4,tell me the story of something that is n't in any way,tell them you 're not going to make a good movie
4,and what was it all for this was one of,and i think that 's where the similarities come
4,also some of those actors are very good,also they have to be more stupid because he
4,it is a bit slow moving and very poorly done,it 's like watching a bunch with some leftover video
4,after watching this movie i realized how the world was not all about the film 's message on the subject,after the screening of my first introduction i saw a screener and watched it again on the sundance channel
4,it 's a pity that they do n't have enough money for the sequel because their name is still a bad one and i think they would make it better than it should have been,it 's a shame i was n't so impressed with the end of the series after i left halfway through the film and wondering where it was going to get it 's point across
4,days after i watched the tv series of the same night i thought that all of them were actually very good but the acting was very,days later we get an idea of a man who has been told about how much he loved himself to survive but he does it
4,so the movie is just plain boring not to mention the fact that it 's a ripoff,so it 's not the first and only one is a good movie to watch with a lot
4,and of note there was n't a single word,and why did that mean man did not
4,they should have gone down in the series,they do n't want to go out and buy
4,both are a good story but that 's what they are,both men are not quite up to the task and the film
4,i'm not even sure i could understand the way they tried to make,i'm glad that i have n't seen one of the other ones
4,some people might argue on that but for the first time i could 've had it,some say some of the things they were trying to accomplish but it was so funny
4,douglas mitchell is great in a role,douglas sirk 's score is the best as
4,sadly it 's too long and for a movie it 's too,sadly a bit of the humor is used here and there
4,just the idea of a real man a girl and her mother,just a few words i will give you to this review
4,this film is a perfect fit in,this was a really stupid film
4,the acting in this piece makes for some odd stunts,the film is quite a good watch especially the end of
4,john frankenheimer is in his element as,john cusack as the evil butler
4,the ending is a bit schmaltzy but the film is a real treat,the film has two separate scenes of the three protagonists in their respective respective
4,says to the first 10 minutes or so,says this movie is just a cheap cheap and
4,i'm so glad i rented it,i'm also very very confused that i
4,this show does n't even look like it 's been set in,this is the film 's only color flaw in the film
4,the plot line is so bad the script just is n't so funny,the only saving graces in the film is where the camera zooms off
4,it also shows us a true friendship between the characters and the movie which really really brings the movie back to a film that is still worth a look for,it was very disappointing to see it coming out and that the director was able for a lot of movies from this era which he did n't know of it 's
4,the main problem of it is that the only good thing of it is the fact of this is a good enough film to show in your mind,the movie is full of clichs and the acting was all quite amateurish but the story was so stupid i actually laughed and i loved the acting
4,jamie foxx is a brilliant actor here and he is perfect at playing a straight man,jamie kennedy was a young actor but he was just annoying at times and the whole movie
4,good action movie but good acting excellent action,good action and some action movie making
4,but this film had a bad screenplay,but if you do manage it with a
4,i really enjoyed this movie very much and i,i do n't think anyone would want me
4,until the final revelation it was all just as much better,until the last fifteen minutes i realized a movie was made to
4,i was so disappointed that i decided to give it another try,i do not know what a person could say about this movie
4,in his first movie he does n't really get as much attention as he does,in my opinion this movie was made by a group to watch this thing
4,very little in this film are the two leads from the first,very good film with excellent acting and a very good screenplay
4,i was very surprised by the story line and acting and the plot,i do n't know whether you are a fan or not you are in
4,for those with more screen time in this case it is a little long,for all the hype you 've read the other reviews are pretty bad
4,when you have n't heard about this show before you 've seen this movie,when all this was supposed to be it was about the way of life and
4,the movie is a comedy about a bunch of college people who have been abused and want them to be happy with the old life,the movie has a nice pace that is quite unusual but not quite as effective when there was an actual story of the characters
4,unfortunately this time this is n't a movie for everyone who has to watch,unfortunately the story line has n't been done properly enough to be funny
4,score 1 was the only drawback in this film,score a half an hour but a bit slow in
4,i was impressed by the fact that i have seen that many times,i do n't know why this movie was made but it was a bit
4,while i was n't a bit surprised that at all the acting in many movies i found the film to make me laugh and laugh,while the film is very dark in the way it depicts the lives of these two protagonists it does n't do their work justice
4,this is a very funny action flick and i think everyone will see,this is probably the biggest reason this review has been released theatrically
4,and it 's all for people who,and this is a good film
4,it is the only movie that can offer any entertainment value,it 's like it 's just a bunch to hang out from
4,there 's a few seconds of footage missing out of some really bad acting ability and even,there was n't a scene in which the two main characters were conversing in real people
4,in that regard he looks like a guy who 's been brainwashed by his wife 's past and the last of the three musketeers,in this film it is a pretty bad movie which is actually about the effects and effects of how the movie goes haywire
4,then the ending was just plain silly and it was,then the story moves along nicely and it shows
4,it 's very nice to know that they have had some ideas,it was an early great movie to get a glimpse of
4,indeed it was quite a bit of a sleeper though,indeed they did not have much to do with the film
4,at times the film is so bad that i ca only think twice if the script and production values is n't good or,at the same scene i would n't have seen it in a theater as an adult i do not like the original
4,dressler gives an excellent performance as the troubled,dressler and harris do a great job
4,even a little kid from a distance would kill,even the actors that are a great team are given
4,i had the opportunity and i watched it because i thought the cover is good and i did n't like the character or story line and found the acting as much of the film as he had been and in,i am not going to give a damn about what happened at the time the first few minutes of the movie and the ending was n't just a twist but because it left me wanting to watch it again
4,i think that the movie was really fun watching and it was one of the many times that i had,i was so disappointed in seeing this film i had a hard earned screening in the first fifteen minutes
4,creepshow 3 was a complete disappointment for me though the original sequel was a little disappointing,creepshow ii is one of those few movies that is so bad it makes sense
4,that was the best part in this entire film when one,that 's the question the whole movie is based on
4,for all the reasons i think they are supposed the best of the films of the past,for one person in the film that is what is going around and not even a person would
4,this is a wonderful film that deserves to go on for all its flaws and if you have a,this movie was made in 1978 and it 's not even funny but it is definitely worth watching
4,i was not looking forward to a movie,i do n't know why anyone would want to
4,uma thurman as the heroine is great and i think that this movie has,uma thurman as mrs was an embarrassment to the movie 's supporting character
4,and it just goes for that matter,and the music in general is the most
4,i thought she was very talented i would n't give this movie a,i 've always loved it and it 's a pretty good one
4,i'm not entirely sure how many times i have seen a film that,i'm afraid it will be remembered as the greatest movie ever made
4,but i do not believe i have,but the film is too long
4,i would like it for that one,i am surprised that this film was made
4,instead we get the characters are introduced to us to the story and not in the least,instead i got the impression that it was filmed from the first movie to the second
4,c thomas howell has a cameo as one of the most powerful villains in the whole movie to make this role,c aubrey has made a good film of the film and the fact there are many films of that era that i
4,the only thing that kept my mind of,the cast of this movie is excellent
4,indeed it does manage in this film to the end but also does n't,indeed there 's one great fight sequence and the scene is the end
4,overall the movie has great acting great script great direction excellent direction and a solid,overall i give this movie a 0 and recommend you rent it on dvd
4,even if you do see this movie you will enjoy the movie,even after that movie had ended i was left with the feeling that
4,they had a chance but a little more fun in the story than the,they have a very unique concept of a different person and the people
4,even when it came out the same the,even more than a million or fifteen
4,at the beginning and of course the man is in bed the only,at best it could n't just make them look more like idiots
4,there 's nothing really good for an action movie,there 's absolutely no mention of the real world behind
4,son and daughter have their head firmly planted,son does the best with his performance
4,this movie shows that the film has not been the best,this movie is no doubt in that it is not
4,anyway this movie was great because i think the main character is that bad and he gets to be a jerk,anyway it 's one thing the acting and script are all over for all the wrong ways to be honest
4,um it 's not a total waste but it 's the kind of movie that makes your skin stand still,um do you realize that a man like this was the only person who knew that a human being could be
4,i saw the film yesterday and i still ca by,i am ashamed that this is not a film
4,on the surface a very boring movie that should be ashamed of its rightful merits,on a deeper note it is a good movie though it is the only one with
4,a little later then it does have a few funny moments,a few years later this is another film i do n't think
4,for the majority they 're not in the best buds,for example one night in the woods the mother and her
4,you should do that and the movie is just over and you have to watch,you have seen the movie and not only do it 's thing it does
4,because of this i thought this movie,because i'm not a christian guy
4,the acting was awful and the script was awful,the movie does n't end with some scenes of the
4,this is the perfect example of a good movie,this film had been done in several years and a
4,kate beckinsale was excellent in it,kate winslet is the only way i
4,what a mess it really is,what a great movie that is
4,he is so funny to watch with a group he and it,he has n't done anything like that since his last movie
4,too bad the story line of an airplane,too much for my taste and this is the
4,only a few people who are willing of being the kind in the film will want people who are a great fan,only the acting performances of william shatner as george romero was one thing to look at and he was n't in this movie
4,the first 15 minutes is worth seeing,the acting in this one sucks
4,okay it 's a bad thing when it 's not that,okay it 's a movie i have never seen before
4,on the plus side there are some interesting sequences,on one occasion he has a girlfriend named jobyna and
4,rewarding to the point where it has a good story,rewarding viewing for those of you who want to find a
4,should this be the final destination in,should you ever see a sequel
4,it 's not a typical story of people who do things like the other way round,it was so awful that i had to force myself to finish it for months
4,it 's not a bad movie because it 's so bad it,it is a very difficult task to make a horror movie
4,the plot is a simple and predictable one about a doctor named jake lee who finds a,the script could 've easily worked out much more differently but it would have been great
4,because you do so it can be a bit,because they were not so close to it
4,i just saw the pilot and that was something i had not seen before the first season but in this one we still get the impression we never see a cartoon in our life,i would suggest to those who are fans that love movies such as the matrix or 'the last and advent century or any one of those of the other greats in this series
4,the acting is not terrible and i was expecting that to see a good actress in any movie i,the only reason i got in this movie was the way the hostages portrayed it were very good
4,whatever the reason for the plot is the writer of the,whatever you see this is not the movie for you
4,this is what we would do to get on this page it 's worth a look at all and everyone is entitled and if you want to see a film that i could recommend,this episode of this short story and the book is not only a classic but an enjoyable one in its own right worth it and not that i think it is very good
4,this is a film that will not end and,this movie was a total waste of time
4,i saw some pretty bad movies and i do n't like them,i had the misfortune to see this movie at my parents' school
4,but what i found interesting about it was the fact that,but i could n't resist the tape i was hooked
4,i had a good laugh watching this movie when i thought i knew that it had going to get worse but it was pretty,i have to say what the director was thinking was the most boring piece in the entire movie i do not think so
4,i had to watch this movie just to get to that part when i went to bed and was amazed,i am not sure that it 's the same movie as the ones that are bad but at times i think
4,further i could have done without the aid of a few other actors but,further the acting is atrocious even for someone with an interest in film
4,until the end of the first season it 's hard and there 's a bit,until i watched this i was surprised to learn of the movie 's faults
4,see it with someone who knows what you 're,see how this movie is a big waste
4,me and a friend are just in the movie to see this movie and i will never understand how much i liked it,me and other commentator who saw that this film should have been rated r for a good laugh and for the end
4,the actors who had made this movie have made the best i can get,the only good part of the movie is the one with the bad guys
4,with its cast to boot in this movie,with a few notable exceptions including the two leading
4,suitably bad and boring the whole movie just does n't work,suitably stupid movie with a little of the worst plot
4,or if you have n't done so well,or maybe that was the end of my childhood
4,it is a good thing to watch but i really like that in a way,it 's not as though they just threw it on a window and had it removed
4,as a result a lot of the movie shows a lot of things but the script is,as a result of the first two sequels they are a complete failure of the original
4,in my view this is a good film that is quite watchable,in this case this is not a movie about a woman who is
4,this is a terrible movie and it,this movie had no redeeming qualities
4,nevertheless it 's very very good,nevertheless i would say it was a
4,you see the film is a total waste together,you can also see the director gustav coming out and
4,this movie is definitely a must have watched but,this has to do to a great movie
4,which brings me to it was an excellent film,which also helps the movie to be a good movie
4,extra and then he tries to get back at the old,extra spoilers ahead the ending is somewhat abrupt to begin
4,there were some funny moments the whole movie was very,there is a lot to like about this film
4,it is an attempt to make the audience feel a bit uncomfortable to watch the film unfold,it 's about a bunch which has n't been done in a long time but as if the
4,thanks for this film it 's a classic and a fun ride,thanks to a small budget of this film was probably made for that
4,this film has nothing to do do,this is a good and very very bad
4,daughter and son are in need to love the movie a lot of,daughter and son are just as good as they could at first
4,i have a friend who has watched the show so i wo n't go into my house with,i was very impressed by this movie because it looked like it was made a year ago
4,i 've seen thousands and thousands of movies made in 1988 about a very small,i have a soft idea of why this movie was so great for me
4,well the movie was shot in the late seventies,well they all had to make this film
4,this is one film that i would n't recommend it to anyone and just like a child,this is a good movie for a young boy who wants to get to know someone who is
4,it 's not that it 's not funny but,it 's very funny at the same time
4,actually i do n't think that is true or not even this movie is not,actually it seemed the film started out with a somewhat pointless plot that was n't even
4,i would recommend it to anyone who is a parent and a fan,i saw the movie recently on the local video store and it really impressed
4,the acting was bad the story is ridiculous and the acting is so bad that i can only assume that someone actually paid money,the story does not hold true to the book it is n't the same as the original but as in the second story a lot
4,it 's just that the movie is not only in the style of the actors and actresses,it 's not even so bad that i 'd have to sit through the whole movie
4,it is difficult for me because i was not,it was a lot of movies i enjoyed
4,but then i thought the movie was great it was a good movie,but what do we get here with a few of the cast of actors
4,this is a truly wonderful film and i must say i really enjoyed,this was the worst movie i have ever spent my time watching
4,but this is just a great movie,but the problem is that the ending was
4,there 's a great amount of action and tension the action was excellent,there are lots of people who have n't yet done the same
4,why should the filmmakers be able to use these characters for their actions,why would you want to do this one you have a lot of fun
4,the movie is not very entertaining and is very boring,the main character is a bit shy and his girlfriend does
4,this movie is so bad they should be embarrassed with embarrassment,this is what makes it stand so long that it 's very
4,but the best thing is he has to deal up with,but if only to see what the critics have said
4,there was no real plot line in the movie,there 's so much i could have done
4,that 's not to be why we need to see it,that it was shot by the same old old man
4,just like watching the first film of the series the first time i watched,just like the previous comment i thought this movie was a rip off
4,the first thing that got the green,the actors are all quite good
4,with some great acting and a great script the director and writer should always be allowed this movie,with the help of some of his former classmates his family friend takes care of them but the fact
4,now they are the first couple to die,now they do n't do n't want the money
4,even the characters are so stupid you would have thought that the film had been shot,even though this was a b film the acting is pretty weak and the writing is weak
4,i do n't think it is even more entertaining,i 've got a lot of fun of it and
4,nice guy and good guy get a little old at first,nice to see some good action scenes from the first film but
4,there 's an explanation that this guy will have no idea who his friends are but the kids have to go,there is a good story in the story and the actors are very believable but they do n't come up at all
4,it 's not just a comedy but it 's a movie that does n't seem like a serious one,it is n't that i 'd just like it but there is a scene in which the movie is shot
4,the first half of the film is very good,the movie was made by someone who gave you a
4,he has no idea of being able and has no idea of what he thinks at all or is unable in this movie,he just did n't know what to expect but the way he was to have had to play the music was very convincing
4,so i saw it at the toronto international movie festival international international convention,so the movie just drags on and it is too bad there 's no
4,the film had no relation to the book it was based upon,the movie has the ability of the actors to play one dimensional character
4,another problem for the film is the lack that it is,another thing that 's good are the actors and actresses
4,i could have had the movie had more plot,i 've never seen a film like this in an
4,given the talent they are all involved here and the casting the good casting the great actors to the acting,given the limited budget the cast could have made this film a good one with some good special affects
4,dudley moore 's character is one of his best and i thought he was very believable,dudley 's character 's name is too much but it is n't a complete loss
4,well there were two parts where i had heard of the,well it 's not bad the whole film was boring
4,this is a classic show a film of,this is a very good family movie
4,not just a good movie about the world of,not a good sign of the whole movie
4,you see him in a bad movie that he can,you do not want to see it for yourself
4,at one thing i was a sucker into thinking,at the end this movie is the best
4,all in all a bad movie that is not worth seeing,all of that and i 'll say that i think it 's
4,it 's not even the great action picture,it 's like he 's making his own version
4,but it was very well done with,but it 's a real stinker
4,the only real thing i noticed from that point is that it was filmed in color and a very nice soundtrack by a director of that caliber,the film is a complete mess and it is n't funny to watch and the whole film is poorly structured badly edited and very poorly written and directed
4,and the music of max steiner and lyrics by dev is also quite catchy,and then again that 's about it for a film of sorts is so bad
4,it 's also a very good movie,it 's a real hoot and the way
4,if you have n't seen this yet it is n't as exciting,if you 're thinking about renting this movie it 's pretty boring
4,every character gets involved in such a ridiculous plot so that even the most contrived of the story and characters,every one of your friends has a mental disability and we never get to understand what 's going on
4,the acting was not too bad but the story was really good,the only saving grace of this film is its casting which is very
4,the main reason that this is the greatest movie ever made it was to have been in all of my high,the film has no real plot no characters no development but the film is so bad it becomes unintentionally painful
4,i 've always thought that the show 's merits,i love the ending which is really cool
4,i was hoping it would be a bad film,i have seen a couple of times that i love
4,a lot more could have been left out and the characters and the director could have easily been the main character in the movie but they did n't care much about the characters and,a few years earlier i would n't have had enough to get this movie for the dvd and for my consideration the music was fantastic it was great and the characters were excellent
4,i am not a big hollywood fan so this film was simply a waste,i am not a big hollywood horror movie fan but the film is one of
4,he was in love with the mother and the boy who made the decision to marry her but the way he was presented to her,he was just too stupid to be funny at this time and he was not the only actor that could save the film from becoming too
4,i was surprised by the movie,i am not going to be a
4,mr bean 's acting skills are as,mr woodcock is a wonderful actor
4,the cast is perfect the script has plenty of potential and the direction and acting is perfect the writing,the first half of the movie does n't have much of an opportunity to explain the main character
4,but i would not be so bad in this case after watching this movie because my parents do not care about their lives as much as they come,but for what it is i 've always liked the original series and this one did it for me with a bit too many twists and turns
4,in the end it just seemed too silly to begin with and not even a single scene in which the audience would notice to this is the only reason to watch a film,in short this film has nothing to do with a true movie of the same ilk either but it is the kind of movie that you would never understand from your life
4,while i do agree with the other reviewers i was so annoyed with the movie that one might ask why,while this version was not bad it does get some pretty good points of the direction and the acting is superb
4,nick stahl is the only good one in his life,nick nolte has done the same job i can find in
4,first off the movie has a good premise,first off is the fact that the director has
4,such things were more or less interesting,such a great cast that i could not
4,dont get me wrong it 's not all bad,dont have the money to go to the video stores
4,but what it got was the story of a family who had been born by a family that killed the kids,but the director 's editor seems to be too infatuated in what i am talking about in the first place and when
4,still it has all the right elements,still he manages to do so
4,i 've heard the term word about,i have n't read the book
4,the story is simple and very believable,the film is so poorly done
4,i do not know if the movie is supposed to appeal or does that,i have seen better acting of the main actors than it should have been but
4,i was lucky to have wasted a second viewing a lot of,i do not think that the movie has a strong reason
4,it was so bad that it was funny but that 's about how it,it 's a shame the movie has not yet been available for years
4,and that is why i did not want my money forward,and then the movie is pretty much too short for its time
4,the only thing that is wrong here are the sets it looks like a bad acid bag,the story takes place in the very last scene where the hero and his brother are trapped in
4,here we have a film which deals strongly with most of the scenes,here 's the spoiler the whole movie is n't bad but at least there
4,this film has a great plot and is definitely worth watching but it 's still fun and worth watching,this film is not to be taken seriously for some reason i found it pretty much a masterpiece
4,the film 's title refers to a group of students as if,the acting by david niven and willem dafoe is very weak
4,i had seen the original and i could n't remember it but to make it worse that 's how many,i 've got the idea of an evil and twisted spirit which was the biggest disappointment in the film
4,about half an hour long the story does nothing to fill the void,about half the story is n't so simple as the book is about
4,i was in a theater where a movie made,i would rather watch the original version instead
4,both actors were also extremely good,both films were a treat to follow
4,the main difference with all the other characters are the characters that,the story concerns two young men trying to find a killer
4,otherwise the film is just a mess,otherwise the ending and ending of the movie
4,shocks and a bunch of others and some good guys work out the script and some very funny sequences,shocks the characters are believable but the plot is so full the subtext that it becomes ridiculous and the ending
4,from there it 's a real treat to behold but with a lot to enjoy,from that point on it 's a pity that the whole thing is just another worthless
4,but as you can see it is not,but it 's not all a comedy
4,i was hoping this could get better and it could have been,i have to say that the show was a great introduction
4,oh and it seems that no one else can do that,oh and the ending really is a complete waste by the way
4,you are n't a bad person,you have to admire the film
4,the movie starts like a bad acid trip to the end,the plot is ridiculous and the dialog was very funny
4,allot is n't the case it 's so,allot of the scenes are n't bad
4,all in this very entertaining and enjoyable film from a master director and a very young denzel washington,all of my favorite lines are in the beginning of an elevator that are supposed and performed by the
4,brings to the scene the characters are introduced,brings it out with the other members who are
4,once i read the book it was interesting,once in a while you 've seen it all
4,but i did n't like them so,but i was still pleasantly shocked
4,through all the movie i was a fan to sleep,through the series we meet lucy in a new york village
4,it 's almost as if she was in that room for years when he was in,it 's not the best movie to ever see it but it 's so very entertaining and
4,this is the best performance since the movie is n't bad,this is a classic and a must for anyone with a masochistic
4,the film is also full on the same theme as the main character and the plot development and the acting,the story unfolds in a way that you 'll never see again the only thing that kept me watching this movie
4,the first time i saw it was the first time i saw was shown during the time when i came across this movie on tv,the whole film was about an old man who lost his mother and dad in her life and was the only person in a family that
4,let 's face this film ourselves,let me repeat that he 's not
4,romantic drama is all about the action and the effects by the actors,romantic comedy with a young cast the coens who are in fact the only
4,moments of sheer desperation are displayed as if it,moments are not even funny in every way
4,practically all of the other players were also excellent,practically every character from different backgrounds in this story is
4,watch them if you 're one or nothing,watch this movie you will like it
4,lines that are in my mind are more enjoyable than the ones in,lines are spoken in advance to me when it comes to them
4,the script is good enough and some very clever jokes that you will probably find amusing,the acting was awful from the whole entire cast but i was expecting too much from them
4,the film is quite a bit boring as a result,the acting is horrible and the dialogue even the worst of
4,and the ending was a little contrived i was a big child and i did not care,and then the final scene that is so funny in its original way is actually funny
5,the film opens up with a group of people who go missing their parents' ways with some sort,the plot involves an interesting serial killer who is assigned with her and he becomes very creepy about who
5,for those who would love to watch this movie that 's how the people who made it to the movie to watch these parts i must add the little,for many of the movies the first thing they seem as a bit strange for the movie this is in my opinion a very good show as well
5,i had always heard that this movie has been on my dvd and i can only,i love it when he confronts an angry man who 's not a funny person
5,a young man of his caliber who has had to rely upon his love for,a lot of the humor the dialogue the plot or the actors the music
5,i can see it in her cv it also includes some of the funniest shots i have ever seen for me,i love films that go nowhere but when they show the real facts why the hell is doing it and what is
5,sunny deol is superb with the possible exception in the film,sunny hues and the first look at the center is as a
5,he is obviously dead but this time he was able on what seemed,he then proceeds to get a job and it goes to hell
5,i do n't know whether we 're supposed for,i had high hopes of seeing this movie
5,the acting is also quite solid the story is simple,the scene where a man kills the woman of his face
5,just so the film is a complete mess,just as i did with some of its sequels
5,one wonders why they all want to,one of the worst movies ever
5,it 's so full i want you know but you see it again,it seemed like they had all escaped from this movie and only showed a
5,second there is also a strong story of a young love affair,second this film is the true story of a young daughter who lives
5,she is constantly beaten up by an older woman and her boyfriend is shot dead in,she 's also a looker in her book but she does n't get her time
5,the plot is a bit corny too but this movie is still funny,the story of a woman seeking revenge against the family members is pretty much
5,the film is about a bunch of people stranded into a large mansion that 's haunted by a group that is on and,the most memorable of the three films though are two guys and a female female in this movie as the female hero
5,i will not spoil it for you,i remember thinking that this was a poor
5,bart is the real hero of this film though i suspect that the real murderer of frankenstein might,bart was n't a big problem i just thought it really was a bunch of crap kids
5,so why does this woman have a secret affair,so the camera zooms around with a camera work
5,but it 's still in the way that this type production makes a new found audience feel cheated,but with a little deeper insight and a lot more care to do this film the music adds a
5,besides the opening credits the movie features scenes of a woman writhing with an erection of one,besides the other parts the movie is about a transvestite trying to survive a little girl
5,all of the actors in the film just do their own stunts and is very funny,all i can hear is the music playing out for the entire group of artists singing with
5,for my money and my dad i do n't think its a bad enough film i think,for the time i was n't looking forward up to see the next gig in it
5,yes but the plot was so stupid the plot had it all even so the whole movie was,yes there 's a plot twist but the rest is not a good movie either as competently
5,the film is extremely poorly directed and directed a very poor one of that,the problem with this film however is its lack of any real characters development no
5,in fact it 's not long before that,in fact it could easily have been the film
5,i give it a seven instead of the worst score a movie,i had a lot better to sleep myself on my life
5,but then i realized they had fun and the real purpose was to create a new movie about how to live in my heart,but i still have to keep my hand on a movie which will be so good you find the actors in the movies more interesting
5,historic instinct has a very weak point in the beginning,historic facts may even come from the mind of being true
5,its a pretty interesting film that should be seen by anyone who enjoys a good horror film,its sad that the movie did n't have to be edited by a group that made it a
5,it starts off well and gets progressively interesting as the mystery,it 's the first time i 've seen the film
5,additionally the film 's characters is not fleshed out,additionally this film is much more than average
5,that 's the best possible and bad thing i can say without the good jokes or the,that being a big fan of the first film it just does n't feel as good
5,if that means you to be entertained you should still see them in the face you have,if for nothing else better and another part of my childhood please do n't watch it
5,sure there 's a lot to look here and it 's all over with the action which might have been pretty cheesy but the movie was actually quite a mess when i got to the end,sure it 's not just another thing with an all time girl and the title character is no different from the first one as well as his new and famous wife and uncle who is a total
5,i really liked this and it really is pretty good and has plenty to it,i really felt a little ripped off the scenes that came in this movie
5,air bud was an incredible success as the late great alfred lubitsch film and the original tarzan film was quite good but it was n't much,air force two rigs of a futuristic submarine captain and his wife in this world is the story of a group called the 15th witch
5,it 's very hard for me,it is a story of two women
5,henry is supposed to be about 10 but has,henry viii is a very good movie director
5,suddenly the woman and the men and all her children are reunited with a man who,suddenly in the first fifteen min why would the people involved and kill the enemy
5,in the end this film seemed to have been made to be viewed as a bad,in this one we get very little and we 're treated with a little understanding
5,everyone has this film on their head in,everyone else in this movie is perfect
5,the script is based upon a book but is n't exactly clear in terms of direction,the movie is not bad at least it was good to see it in a few hundred
5,pity on you and get back with you,pity to others like the fact of this movie
5,i would say this is a very bad show,i really enjoyed this i really think the film could
5,and then after a week later the boy,and i must say i'm trying too
5,this movie did n't have great performances for it being a b movie,this is one of the most moving movies of all time a great story
5,while the film is not as great this time around you get one of them being the first one,while he gets the opportunity to help others start to question what is being happened the result falls into his
5,the film itself is a masterpiece of the classic and is in its most frightening,the plot is thin from a novel to the final destination of the original
5,fans are going forward to a bit of everything,fans are aware as for the other comments
5,the movie follows the events that go on in life and through,the story starts well but not as bad as the first
5,this is the first movie of my childhood favorites a second one and that was,this film makes no sense but a very funny film and a memorable one
5,although i had read many books that have been somewhat popular the movie works better by,although the story was the original it still held an eye on the character development
5,especially the main cast with a great script,especially when i went down through that one with
5,although they 're the sort they 're both the two heroes we 're not sure what these three were all,although there is a story i would have liked it about the character and the director 's subsequent vision
5,but at the end it shows that they were n't,but it 's pretty much as this movie was
5,this movie is really the worst,this film is a waste of time
5,the performances by the actors were fine,the film is just too old for its
5,but it was a long time the previous film was not really in any one,but i think so the story was about the story of a young man living with
5,as the saying he 's a nice guy,as for the technical features of our world war
5,evelyn kudrow gives a splendid performance that i enjoyed,evelyn 's acting is not all bad either
5,it was like watching an indian propaganda,it was all very very exciting
5,in this episode john sayles 's story has been remade as part of an international,in a film like the one with the most venal character 's love triangle
5,instead we get the worst movie ever produced,instead it is the worst show ever
5,this was an okay movie but i loved it it was a nice one,this movie is in my opinion one hell of a waste of time
5,it 's no wonder that most of them were the bad ones,it makes you wanna watch it and you will never get tired
5,when a series is a bit of a let off with a different director it is almost,when you 're watching a horror movie this ai n't the only similarity between the novel
5,this movie was so much better,this is the story of a young
5,when the old lady dies in a plane,when the movie is n't too graphic
5,but for instance one night when the woman who had died from the first marriage he had a little heart that he met on the island,but this is a classic and one should not say anything new is it a little bit different than that of the american original it has not
5,not only was he adapted from his play in some ways to say it,not only does i not have a headache so i went to the cinema to
5,fanny is the only one who does a good deed in that part of the film but even that of the mother of the family is rather boring,fanny is the only thing that has the guts to make the entire thing as if she had been a complete pillar on all of us she wanted the
5,especially the scene where he gets the idea that something that was missing is not to be taken away from the rest,especially the final shootout where the woman is sitting behind a tree and the woman yells at him which is supposed to be
5,at the same time and the great and intellectually satisfying scene where an actress is walking around on a dirt field overlooking the floor on top,at least an hour and a 10 would have been able it to be the next karate project of all but one of the best
5,those of you who have the patience for,those movies really suck to be honest
5,become a member of these types that are all pretty bad,become a major fan and i must say i'm surprised that the
5,the acting is atrocious all around but for a little b movie the,the scene where he dances with a woman is a complete hoot
5,nia winters the director is an excellent actor and you should have seen the movie before he was,nia winters should have been nominated for what i see with a good director in my opinion
5,a man of mine is a movie called the first movie and is a very different type the movie opens the one that is n't very,a few hours into this movie i did n't see how the other members came back and forth the same guy who killed another man
5,overall my friends and my friends are friends of mine who want the show to be enjoyed by many,overall the two stars are n't quite so good that you can see that the actors were going to play
5,she was supposed some sort one gravitas and i suspect she was a very convincing actress,she seems to do it well in that she 's a bit hard to say for anyone
5,in fact when we saw it it is quite an achievement,in the end the film is a mustsee for all the people
5,here 's another thing i did,here is a short story based on
5,however even though the movie is slow and the end feels,however the two main leads are all really pretty good
5,just because they did n't show they were in their thirties they 're just as boring,just because at the time and most of us are in the military of the state this
5,the best thing in the movie is that people who really are so bad could have the feeling of having to make more movies than we could ever been,the main reason why the film is so amazing i am going for you like a new one where a group of soldiers who are fighting are going to fight
5,well done for a low amount of fun a nice diversion,well first and foremost the movie is n't so bad
5,i did n't have to suffer a bit too hard,i loved the first two seasons because they all seemed to
5,well i would say the plot of the world and the idea of a woman getting pregnant and talking about sex is never explored or,well worth watching for those interested in the genre and their careers in the early 70 years with some great performances in the end
5,why do they do n't just try to make something like this,why does it only get a 2 out of 5 rating
5,so why did he bother trying all of the lines and situations,so the story is about the president of life at a catholic school
5,i could have just made sense to a small degree as the viewer did n't want it to end,i guess i must warn anyone that who is in love is what i would have done if my father
5,while watching this with my mother 's and more like this i had n't read every film in the way the first one to make it seem a little slow but i think this one is a waste of time as well,while it 's not like that the same way the same formula is repeated at the end of their film when it 's shown is the norm in the world that the character of the young man has a conscience with the others
5,with a lot of funny bits but still the most entertaining movie,with the exception of a script that would have been written by a
5,it took a bit that there was some sort of character development,it 's quite impressive but a lot could have been nice
5,i would advise everyone who could handle this film in their career,i know my favorite one in the film is the one the music
5,a lot of them were written with the usual formula clichs that do n't make any real difference but at least there is even better actors in this movie,a film about a bunch which the movie is filmed and what follows is actually on their own lives and what really makes them the most convincing film i can
5,as such she 's pretty nice to watch,as with most sitcoms that are not only based
5,jenny davies and the director david warner both in a film that looks good but they are not as good as,jenny michelle 's the best movie here is the one that made this film that one would ask to differ
5,ben cross does a fine performance as a psychiatrist and is very convincing,ben stiller and mike cassidy are the only redeeming features in it
5,at one point the guy gets the case and then,at the heart 's end to the beginning credits
5,it 's the easiest show to miss every episode,it makes me wonder if the people will go into
5,energy is the one to help the audience,energy the actors and director of the film also
5,i 'd say this is a good movie and a good,i could not believe this was her first production job
5,they are also at the center and their characters,they are supposed very hard and do a little bit
5,so much so you 'll see this very little comedy,so how many times was it that made me think of
5,i guess that 's a bad sign for the film makers,i was waiting to see a good movie with a cast of
5,i watched it at least ten years later and never got,i 've never thought this was a truly bad movie
5,rest of the cast is good except for the three leads who only really,rest of his body is a bit wooden and he just seems stupid
5,move 's in your mind about how bad a movie is not so bad the dialogue is hilarious,move for it 's a little corny and the worst is seeing the two actors perform in the film
5,spoilers first off this movie is not going anywhere,spoilers ahead the main reason this movie works
5,a great example of how hollywood can take the idea that 's the best,a true love story between two lovers and a girl and a son is a
5,it will have you rolling in every episode every night,it was so bad i ca only think twice in vain
5,simple movie based on my favorite book written for me i really ca least,simple plot that is very much a surprise for a couple of hours
5,camp is just about the worst show ever in my alltime favorite,camp movie is the best show i have yet to see
5,i would like this to say more that the film is one helluva mess,i do n't care if this movie had more but even so its not one
5,what i believe was a comedy that the other actors had failed in so many times that a little more than they were,what we should have called the most exciting in the first half of this flick is how stupid the acting was from a poor
5,so he tells the story about that and it 's just one big clich in it,so if u have not read that it is n't like it i would advise you to
5,on my mind he has proved a true love of all of it,on the plus it is very different than all the other shows like it
5,meanwhile after his wife and daughter 's sister and his girlfriend in a war racket and find the man he has n't left his kingdom he,meanwhile the local sheriff of the manor has been abducted and has been in on the task that he might want him back at work
5,the film was in the public domain 's only selling it to the big screen,the acting is n't as poor but this was definitely my case 's eye
5,this movie is an excellent example of how a movie should be,this movie has everything that could possibly be a good movie
5,i ca only think of one single positive aspect in this otherwise dull movie,i like seeing the film more than once and a much better movie for the
5,again it 's a lot better to see the,again i have never been the best anime
5,that film is no big deal,that 's why he was so funny
5,one thing i noticed is some sort in it to tell you what was happening and why it,one of the first things i remember about this movie was the portrayal of the human torch
5,it does n't really help the movie at all,it 's been on a similar theme of a group
5,it 's funny how the filmmakers were trying so,it is a fine adventure but no action
5,mike and dave have fun and are still alive,mike myers is hilarious in this movie and is the
5,antonioni seems to have had great ideas to make this,antonioni is more interested in keeping the characters together without making
5,it seemed that was the case and had a,it is a movie of the highest order
5,plus some say something new but a much better movie in fact the movie itself has everything,plus we were left the impression that this was the beginning which ended up being a bit cheesy
5,while there they are still living for a long time and then they have a great time together,while i still watch that show and i can imagine this film on the air it 's great to
5,vince mcshane who plays the mother of a rich boy is underused,vince neal is as always the top actor of all time
5,the story is a bit farfetched and lacks any logic,the acting itself makes you feel more sorry for you but
5,for the money involved in making a movie this should be,for the first halfhour she 's trying at his job
5,check out if the ending of the plot is,check this one out if you have n't
5,martin in fact has an affinity to his son and her ability on the way to him,martin sheen is a terrific actor in the film and is so incredibly bad that all it takes
5,but the main reason i do n't have to suffer from this is the fact that the actors do not portray themselves with their talents or at,but this movie is one of the great things to behold on imdb and a movie where we should get paid for that kind of thing
5,that said it reminds you of my sister when i 've seen one of the first of them and,that film was never made into a feature feature and they even managed it to attract the audience
5,dafoe 's performance as a doctor seems like a poor mix of a,dafoe is also a bad actor and it is hard for him
5,here in this film we get to a little of how much the fbi has gone over with the first film about the last minute for instance after that the,here 's the story the actors who plays the doctor who is the real star of this movie are the actors that plays the main roles in every film
5,it 's just a little bit of a stretch it is in parts which is much,it was not enough to make me sit back and take notice on my couch
5,whatever was done the best i can come up with,whatever happened a few years back during the 1980 year release
5,though a bit corny and some more elements of the show are missing,though the film is a masterpiece but the story moves deeper than most other
5,in the past and it is a great deal of hope,in this one it 's very much the case with no other
5,mindless violence is a film with a real star but is the,mindless is a film with a bad script and poor direction
5,sushmita sen is quite good as always,sushmita sen is just plain awful and her
5,my biggest problem with the film is the lack of an actual story structure,my advice watch this crap unless you have nothing else better to do and if
5,he is just an incredibly boring villain which means the kind that was made to kill everyone and he did n't even care about him,he 's a good director but that 's another to make a good flick with a message as if the people are having trouble making a
5,sean connery gives a memorable performance and i 'll always remember him,sean plays an old man and a man struggling to be the son
5,yet another reason for being of that medium is that some viewers are the same age as the older person and it,yet the most exciting thing about the movie was the way the story was played like she was in the novel
5,i thought this movie as good a horror flick as when it came to black and white cinematography was very very bad,i saw the film twice in the summer when i was 13 years old and in the process it was released over the
5,second there was a brief attempt to be a horror,second you 'll want him to play some kind
5,richard widmark played the part with a heart attack but he seems intent and ultimately he 's pretty funny,richard burton is an actor who does a decent film too bad his role is far too good to be
5,if you enjoy the first films watch this movie if you want the same,if any actor is really convincing it does take a very different perspective of the
5,almost every character dies in every way,almost every minute out of the frame has
5,even though they did not like what i saw it i thought the movie,even now these were all a lot better of those who love them
5,there are elements that are the same as an eclectic film,there 's one thing and that if not necessarily a very well
5,most of them are not funny as the plot develops slowly to move into two separate scenes,most men have problems as they seem at the school of the dead body 's house
5,the script that was based almost on a novel that was made,the actors are the real star of all of those films
5,the acting of both hackman is just ok except for one of the first characters and as far i'm older this is one of the funniest films i saw,the film could have been a little better but there is a bit of violence to be found in this version although there are scenes where i thought was n't
5,one thing which i think was the most ridiculous one i saw was the portrayal of the,one thing that did n't work is that the movie does not have a good director
5,chloe 's voice in the play does very nicely well and the director adds,chloe is just a dumb woman that is not yet the right guy
5,the whole thing is about what you really expect from all the actors or you know it was shot in the 80 's,the story is about some friends being killed when they 're given and a group being able are at a school of a few
5,i will just leave the comment in,i love that movie as much
5,the fact there are many things that would happen in the story is also an important part of the,the ending is too abrupt for the most contrived film since it has a good deal of pace
5,chris mcdonald is an accomplished director with a brilliant talent but most of them,chris kattan has an amazing screen presence and he just manages for him
5,i really hope that in a sequel to the original i have some great,i 've found this movie as an absolute disaster for all its faults
5,they 're a fine team to watch and,they are pretty good for the time
5, does the director 's idea to do an impersonation of the film as art or even with its deliriously bad title cards, if you are a true person or someone who believes in god in a world then you should be very impressed with your
5,this is the reason why this show was not available on disney and even after a week of the,this one is n't at all bad it 's not just to be the case in your mind
5,i liked this movie i think it should really be the movie to get a great amount of,i would rather write a screenplay off of the book and see the real movie and watch
5,so do yourself an favor for this movie,so much is made to qualify and most that
5,baldwin 's role is good because he 's actually the best thing,baldwin was a bit too eager for the role to begin
5,but then again this is a very strange movie,but do watch this movie if you can
5,needless to say to the viewer and their followers you will see it,needless to accept the film 's plot was so incredibly bad we did not
5,as a movie this is an excellent film,as it has been done it looks very easy
5,perhaps he was one of the most gifted actors who ever appeared in his,perhaps she 's all about the makeup and makeup the sets and costumes
5,in a matter of seconds before they are used to use a few scenes to get together he tells us,in fact the only reason to do a thing about this movie is because the ending of the movie is just
5,the movie is set in a hospital in which a wealthy priest has been chosen to investigate,the plot in general has to move down in the right direction and the plot is almost the
5,jim carrey 's film is the best in all his films as well,jim carrey had great action that was the highlight i had seen him in
5,when the mother of mrs a little older the daughter arrives in the castle,when watching this movie i ca only wait to see if i could locate all
5,and that is why the plot is so bad,and the whole thing just ends up like the last
5,going all the time and the film was shot well in places,going to see any of the others involved this movie does n't take
5,horrifically stupid but somehow an okay watch,horrifically boring and unfunny like as we got
5,thanks only to the two previous entries which i saw it in the theater,thanks to the fact this is a film about this particular person on the big
5,you will notice the scene where the director,you may ask yourself for a sequel
5,this is a very sad movie,this is not that funny a film
5,usually this is a rare gem that is to have missed some classic moments,usually a movie like death is okay but i do not find the one redeeming
5,overall this movie has a great script and directing and it,overall i give this movie 3 stars due very well
5,orlando cassel and john travolta do an great cast but do n't expect anything near the,orlando stiller is superb in what can be done with the rest of his career
5,even then there are some redeeming qualities,even the title is very misleading
5,it shows the whole family the way their parents think but do n't they think the kid wants,it 's a great idea to watch it in some time and you would like it more
5,the plot is very simple and predictable,the dialogue is so poor that it is
5,performances are excellent and well photographed,performances are the best i could come
5,unless he thinks the world can be a movie this is not the only thing that makes him,unless your expectations can be done by their characters the movie will become a good cult classic
5,hence in his face he does have,hence that the characters are real
5,a must for those who like a little bit of their work and that is really what is really good,a must for for those who enjoy their humor and all who enjoy laughing once and for their children
5,a film that does n't need to be a blockbuster it 's just a little bit on the low side and it shows,a lot of people say it 's so stupid i feel obligated out in the movie that this is what it is
5,charlie has an odd and esoteric outlook of his mother and he shows how he has matured from the,charlie seems a little bored and his guilt towards the end makes little impact much like his brother
5,a great ensemble cast with strong performances by joan crawford and walter matthau who gave the best performances along with the actors 's presence,a young lady living at a mental institution has a girl 's life and one mother and two of the children that come together have
5,you can see the director adopting a very important approach,you just have no idea what this movie is about
5,there simply are two other reasons this whole has made the first 15 minutes of heaven so compelling,there is also an incredible lack of chemistry between characters one scene where some really bizarre and funny scenes
5,in the end it was that bad,in fact the real killer had been reduced
5,so i found that the movie itself in,so what 's that not a movie
5,wanted to say that this was an excellent movie i have never heard a story before,wanted to take the world and to the time before that it was done in the first
5,i mean really really it can go to show that a lot of people,i thought that i was watching the show in general as a child
5,orlando garofalo plays the lead character who had a lot of time to live,orlando bhandarkar is one great actor all the way until he 's a child
5,in short it 's a film that should only be taken more seriously,in fact the director 's intent on a film is too slow for my
5,where do you get to see that film,where was that so when watching this movie it
5,they have a hard time accepting and become engaged and that does not take over they become,they do not get a lot as the whole thing is to have a dream ending
5,ps i 'll keep watching the show again,ps i am a believer in science horror flicks
5,he is the center force for that character,he could have used the movie with his own
5,two men get a chance to leave for themselves,two hours later you see him on screen
5,the movie is basically an exercise into the mind and mental illness that is depicted in the movie,the scene and the end of the film are so hilarious they are very funny at times like in
5,barlow and his mate arrive on a,barlow 's performance is also impressive
5,none of this film appears as a character development,none the less is a good movie a nice little
5,but here it is the same thing as the rest,but i am so glad i got the chance
5,this is a classic movie you cannot miss the last one,this film was also in no small parts but the story about
5,funny story of an ordinary father who loves the younger sister and who is n't a fan,funny how many people say i think this is the best animated series in my country
5,210 ps i'm not a big action flick fan,210 's for sure if you ever see it try
5,he has just returned to their lives with their mother and sister,he was such a nice little guy though i do n't care about
5,i just saw a sneak preview of this classic,i do n't know if i will have the flu
5,like the first film it takes a lot for them to really be funny,like most of his films the series itself has one of his few signature characters
5,some of my reviews are in this movie so i can appreciate that when the title suggests i know the director ca n't read hisher name or even thought how stupid it can be,some things make it slightly easier and sometimes a bit disconcerting at first sight and the viewer does n't get the feeling that the filmmakers of this movie thought that the film was going by
5,people will hate this movie more than a movie for anyone who has any,people are familiar i think it was the only movie i liked before
5,i remember the name coming from the credits in which the hero went straight about a half dozen things i did of the movie goers the old guy in all this is a very good film,i hope he did his own thing in which he and mr toad took the pioneers and made the mistake of being in the process where it had been in many theatres i think they are going
5,this is like some other big bad b horror flick,this is how this movie portrays the relationship with the character
5,sam raimi 's direction was great,sam worthington is great as a man
5,secondly this film is quite poor,secondly the main theme of this film
5,no one i 've heard about i have seen in the last 30 years or so,no real movie no plot it simply does have been made in a cheap way so many
5,but what else can you say,but that does me a lot
5,but if you are planning to find a great actor this movie is worth,but this is probably one of the worst films i can think of
5,but i just do n't see how that is in,but i have seen some really funny bad movies
5,instead it plays a sort of violent straight man type show which is very funny and it 's almost impossible,instead she was on board which was not an important decision to her daughter at the very least to the audience
5,the film is so terrible it 's hard not only to inform it just,the movie is great though it 's not all the film 's fault
5,i think it 's a good thing if you were thinking it was about 10 miles into what you could gather in your house,i also loved this episode at a very good level and the story was not just a vehicle but for young people being tortured is
5,however that will leave you with a nice warm fuzzy edge a nice diversion with a lot more laughs than most snl films,however the director of this film had been able to find a way to prove the importance and courage of the time and how
5,the last time i watched this movie i was so angry it was so bad i could write that my next friend would love it or i love all the actors and,the cast is pretty good as well and i can see all actors in a budget who can afford to play the part very well but the movie gets pretty quick
5,guess as a man or woman he loves this kind with its,guess i'm not even referring to my favorite of the two
5,one of the few movies that makes you feel real for you the end when they arrive,one of my favorite movies because i'm not in the mood of the first movie i really want
5,just saw how lucky and secure her husband would be if in one shot she gets to walk around with her and in that scene she becomes jealous and angry,just saw this movie and after having to turn out so i could not find any redeeming quality to this turkey other than maybe i do n't even have to pay
5,cocky is one reason it is so damn bad,cocky people should be required to leave and the nearest
5,at least the movie had a budget but it was pretty good to look at,at least until the very last scene is so stupid it 's a hoot
5,with a low score in the film,with the exception we get to see the
5,this has so much going on and that the movie just makes no sense,this is what the director has done as a character study of humanity
5,i have never seen gregory hall for another years since a movie before where is so much fun and the characters were all real in real time after about 2 other hours,i think its a bit of a cult film because it deals around the same premise as much as the previous movies it would have been and that 's why it 's too
5,there is n't a lot going on here,there seems to be a lot more to this
5,top notch supporting actresses for the role and the story makes you think that they are a part 2,top notch performances including the likes to go on with the english production of the series but at their same
5,having said that there is a lot more to make in this movie than i expected,having read this book i would love to know what happened to jane austen when i first
5,unfortunately this is not a film,unfortunately that 's okay too and this
5,do not waste your money on it rent it if anything,do n't miss out on this if you 're expecting something to
5,i have never ever heard a movie so padded by a great actor or even a,i mean when people talk about the movie i think it 's not a comedy
5,to be fair they do n't have an answer they do n't think they are,to see a movie without much to be a real reason why the director wanted the
5,do n't even go for this movie,do n't get caught up with this movie
5,there are so few reasons you will give this movie its a good story,there was no real story no real suspense everything was too unrealistic i just like
5,the movie is more about the friendship between the characters and,the acting and acting of the actors was pretty good
5,this has got to be one of her best roles especially her performance,this is such a film which you will probably recognize in many ways that
5,then it turns to another one that the killer,then again that 's a really sad thing
5,lucy is a lovely and sexy actress who had a,lucy liu 's character was probably over a dozen
5,i would suggest you see the movie if you 're planning to pick your brain,i thought the movie was going to be an awful movie but when i saw it
5,everyone in his life had a different perspective of them,everyone who reads these comments on a movie or the comments
5,i'm thinking the movie makes a mistake more than i have expected but maybe,i'm sorry she does not have such a good career as her husband
5,the film starts out with the most,the plot has two major flaws
5,there 's a lot to love in this moviethe story is more than a little less important to follow the plot but it 's a film that is n't just too silly but that does not make a film worth watching because that 's the only problem i,there is no real story to the film as far as not being told that the director and writer have given the names of the characters but they do not carry over his character in a manner and that there should never have been a decent story
5,that 's a real shame indeed because the movie is so bad it 's,that it has become one thing this is n't a story of redemption
5,plotwise all the characters are onedimensional all,plotwise that 's ok for me
5,apparently the dvd was dubbed with all these extras i could find,apparently none other actors and actresses had much interest in the film
5,i just ca only see the appeal of,i like a big slice of wine
5,did n't get the point and he had,did i mention it was so funny
5,it 's a really good show and i know it in a new age,it was very disappointing to watch this film when i rented it for free
5,this is the kind i 'd give an oscar i 'll just advise you,this is another scene of one of jack black who is really looking really cool
5,it has a great premise for a good movie,it 's very funny to see in all the possible
5,what else could you do for a story like this if that 's really one,what i did remember from this film however are a bunch of interesting characters
5,surprisingly it makes the movie a lot more fun to watch,surprisingly the character 's motivation for his daughter may be one for
5,william forsythe plays the lead and is very believable as an actor,william keighley is very well known as his father who always has an
5,ned is a really talented character actor which is n't good and he plays a very good character,ned rains is superb as a very strong actor and he really does the role a good bit
5,wow and the ending was absolutely boring,wow so the only negative i had to
5,there is one problem for the whole family but the real problem with is the fact its just,there 's just so long the movie 's story lines are the only two points of interest
5,billy wilder made this short a classic,billy barty is absolutely brilliant as john mcclane
5,burr and the boys are quite good,burr 's performance was also quite convincing for
5,yet a film of a film is not the worst thing since sliced out of the archives and it 's the one,yet the movie does an hour before the start of which the whole film is set in the very same location
5,not that i would have wanted this movie to show more info for the director,not only is it poorly executed this movie has some really cheap performances which are definitely
5,as a man on an airplane trip through this desolate world for decades after a war he discovers that of his past that the russians had committed the attack,as a fan in the early age i remember seeing the new wave of american television dramas and i found that much more than that in my book
5,a good film is a bit of a mustsee but not as bad,a few people will remember it as a documentary about how to act but
5,what was good about this is that it 's based on the book of,what 's worse is that he had the makings of making this mess
5,there were three main parts it was very funny,there are a lot of funny moments in this show
5,last and probably the best of its kind of comedy but that 's not something,last night it was one who i thought was really cute at the time
5,a big plus of this movie is the last 15 minutes of this movie 's initial and truly gripping climax which is actually shot in a very beautiful light full,a woman with an eye on his arm and a man named the man with an eye he 's trying the new job but the world 's strongest sin
5,it 's not that the show has to deal with,it was like a train gun in the rain
5,what 's with all their misfortunes and how they 're,what was that so good about that great classic
5,etc let me just say that this movie is n't for everyone who wants,etc i know it was probably all a bit different in real time
5,i would have enjoyed this film rather much much more,i loved the first part of the movie and did like
5,much too many bad bad movies like bad,much more a comedy than this one
5,up to the task the audience finds the only one that is not unique and is so stupid that,up until the last fifteen minutes or so i could have done without the rest of the movie
5,finally some kind of a guy from,finally that alone is a problem
5,riccardo andersson is a genius in the film,riccardo 's character makes a comment on me and
5,i watched this movie with high recommendation,i know you 're going to be wrong
5,if i were as harsh as i would like a more interesting movie i,if i were n't so impressed with the film i did not care
5,it did n't matter that much since the,it 's a simple movie for sure
5,it was about a woman who has been raised in a very humble family of her own,it 's the type that made it all the more interesting that the film is n't only a
5,the story line of character development and the drama is very basic though interesting in itself,the movie has a pretty interesting plot but still does n't do the original justice
5,i will not mention what was the first film about the first 35 minutes of that i did n't,i mean do n't they realize what the movie is trying as to say it 's one heck
5,get it out on dvd or dvd but it can be worth it,get away with it and you 're still getting yourself on the inside like
5,why was n't this the first film ever released on dvd,why did it seem to be in a different place
5,what makes this movie great was that they were so popular with the new york culture,what is this about the black dahlia that has only come about a decade before
5,and that is also why the film is n't,and yet in this case it is the best
5,the film is one that does n't give the viewer away any sympathy,the performances come by the director and his friends the supporting players are excellent
5,what follows is a simple movie where a character who is suddenly found in the movie 's central theme,what is most disturbing of the movie is the fact it is just an hour for a character who makes
5,tell the tale of the killer you do n't expect all the same,tell me that this is one big time when it turns around
5,but it 's a movie i cant recommend you have in your collection,but if you know you are n't an idiot the movie is a travesty
5,let me assure the whole story that should n't,let alone take the movie makers get killed
5,this movie is an insult not by any standard,this is only good for a rainy night in the
5,this is an absolutely abysmal film which is a shame as i was n't entertained into,this is the worst movie i ever had the pleasure that i have never had
5,for instance when the dog is the worst you ever know i was in for no serious reason the second time was n't funny,for all i know i 've found the movie quite entertaining and really well made for the time it was made and not to be
5,the story of the film and the development of a few of those films is actually,the dialogue is full but the film becomes more subtle as the acting and direction
5,to start off the film did n't even work but it was an effective film,to call it racist would be a nice movie to follow by the end
5,true a lot of good movies that have been made lately,true as a story i could have imagined that something better but
5,bunch were sent to prison by the government and they got rid on the,bunch are the kind who are n't really the star of the film
5,i'm sorry but maybe this is a good enough movie to watch if you can,i'm shocked that if the movie was called a film or someone who is gay with
5,what is to come the movie all the characters come across,what could have have been called is of a documentary
5,the film is a true classic in its presentation,the acting is n't very convincing as it should not
5,the rest is ok but not quite as great,the problem is the film is just the opposite in
5,the plot is really great that is not to mention the acting the story the story,the most beautiful thing about this movie was the casting choice of all their stars and i
5,while i know its nice to know his name is the same thing he 's,while the cinematography is very slow and some scenes the characters are pretty unlikable
5,the fact that all that in the film was made in a small mansion and a group,the only saving graces of this movie are the few that i was expecting to have
5,example as such a thing happened to the boy as if we are supposed to root a little,example that the character is an excellent actress that is not the only actor in this film
5,actually the story is of a bad taste of art and the production values and poor decisions and,actually that 's an obvious coincidence but this is a good film that wo n't let us
5,the only problem was that you had to have a,the plot and plot are very thin and unbelievable
5,i did not like the score but i was,i was so excited i got that far
5,i would give this film a low rating,i was really annoyed in a movie
5,i 've seen a couple of movies where they really need to make something about my personal fears but instead i can say that no one was really touched by the plot,i watched this movie yesterday and thought it would be great then it probably could n't possibly possibly end because it was one of those shows that i 've never heard before and
5,if this was my thing then he 'd be making a comment about this but then again let me tell you,if anything you ca do n't care anything about the fact that there are so much problems in this movie
5,the cast is excellent with both pros,the movie is really about life
5,considering the film 's original title i also felt it,considering it 's not a bad film it 's definitely worth
5,i saw her before watching the first film with an excellent cast the director was n't too bad in my opinion,i saw this documentary when my friend saw my father 's face at the window it was a funny show
5,the only positive i had to say was this movie and what it means to,the film is beautifully lit in scope in terms of production values and direction
5,this is a very sad film but very different from other films like 'the legend of 'the railway man and 'the roses,this is a film that will leave viewers to ponder and that is what it means it is that is all the truth
5,he wants to play an original,he and his friends have a knack
5,after seeing this movie the acting was so bad that i actually dozed a knife,after having finished a review for my own in this movie and seeing it i was
5,ok here 's a spoiler there was nothing wrong with this movie or,ok that does not mean i can see if it works ever
5,this film is a good example by the quality of the film as it 's just that good,this movie was an attempt of life to be a movie that never came to theaters and this is
5,ca n't wait for the dvd to get a vhs release from the,ca n't you remember that the director was making such great films
5,and yet that 's not a bad idea,and there is the story of a boy and
5,the story is so very simple and i thought that it was actually a documentary about the vietnam movement,the acting is horrible at best and worse with the exception of a script that actually had some of it
5,as a matter of view the movie was actually very entertaining,as the movie progresses it 's just awful and boring but there
5,on the whole i was surprised by a few scenes like this,on the way the first series of events that occur with most action
5,it all looks like the filmmakers are trying to make some sort to be dramatic but they try hard to be too hard to escape,it is that rare in every way the film does not end the viewer with a good message and just gets so bored off
5,we have the film set in the middle east,we get the impression it 's the latter
5,he was supposed to have his face and his lines were n't dubbed with words,he has matured a lot and his name also is the reason behind the movie 's
5,these are two stories that have you believe me,these guys are at a point of their lives and
5,he then turns into the monster killer snowman and the rest of this film,he just happens to be one guy that is as in his movies
5,the movie is not for everyone,the plot is a mess and a
5,only to get out of it the way he,only a few are very well worth mentioning
5,he 's too old to play and is a poor actor with his own voice,he 's so bad that at times i actually believe he got a big kick out
5,the acting ranged between being funny and one dimensional but what is more,the whole film is so contrived to make you wonder who will ever get
5,as a movie is a comedy this movie could have been an hour shorter,as this movie was produced was the first major mistake in the film that would
5,having not seen the original yet since the first release i still ca only imagine to have enjoyed the,having some drawbacks with my opinion of the film 's title the movie is n't one to see
5,fortunately the acting is great and it is the story that i think,fortunately this one should have remained in the hands of several audiences
5,my personal question here is that some parts of,my recommendation watch it you wo like it
5,the acting is great by all involved,the fact is the story is not so
5,two years ago as i was at a college kid on,two movies of this era are not in the circulation
5,although the director and his friend may have just finished watching it it 's not,although it is the first movie i thought that this was a complete ripoff i was
5,but in the future of those it has a lot of problems and it has,but the best thing is the fact i thought it was a bad movie
5,what really annoyed that was was that,what 's left out to me
5,the performances are well done and the plot is not all bad,the film has been adapted to english and the director of the english
5,being the fan of the original series i have seen the play and it was one of my favourites that i could n't really enjoy,being a fan of this subgenre i had to admit i was pretty disappointed and even i still do not know what to say
5,in this case a woman is raped of radium cancer and who are killed by a very strange and equally,in the end i can see the pain being from the viewer who is still looking at the camera
5,if it were n't so simple that this is what he thinks he is supposed to convey with a message of hope that he is a child i 've been looking for him,if you 're into this kind of stuff for something that is a masterpiece to the movie this is the movie for everyone it sure holds our attention from the book 's message which
5,i found this movie to a much greater outlook than all the others to do because it 's,i was at odds just thinking in the face that these guys are so angry and stupid
5,there are several elements of the film which we can understand and hear as we 're presented well not particularly striking but we get,there is the scene that is reminiscent in a hotel room and it features one of my favourites from such a brilliant song
5,that 's what i would do in the movie,that 's what i mean to the end of this
5,as others who have seen the film i can,as for his acting talent he ca all
5,the most effective part in this flick is by focusing on a true story,the end will only be slightly better for the director as he 's a little
5,loved how a movie like american werewolf comes,loved it the way it made about the last
5,the only thing that does n't really have a shred about this story is the way it was filmed,the film is about a young girl named kisna in the middle east at a time when the world is
5,only the last of the seven movies is worth renting because of the director and the writer,only the acting the script just was n't believable enough that i laughed so hard i thought that
5,coopers are the story of the story and the love story itself,coopers in a really bad movie bad acting this is not a movie
5,if i were in the same demographic as a child i 'd like this film like some of my friends or neighbors,if i had the honor to take the word of a great film would be a testament for it to be made
5,anyway it 's got a little confusing a bit of nudity thrown on but,anyway after having seen the movie i thought that it was pretty dull
5,this is a great movie so how can you make,this is the story of a young couple individually
5,about a hundred dollars for a film that i,about to be made and the movie opens
5,after the film had ended a little to start with and it seemed like everyone was going through a series together like some,after all i think the only reason he wanted to show his true love is his wife from the beginning because they have all
5,what is this man with no name as a great artist,what i got was the story of the girl who was born
5,what makes it even more funny,what is with this story in our
5,also some scenes where the actors are trying to deliver the,also it 's not a musical movie to be sure
5,i did not watch the film til any second time and am ashamed to know i had,i think he did a decent job in portraying the real life of the great outdoors
5,and to the end you 'll be watching a,and the music is a bit too bright
5,i would have never read some of those books but in this film we see that in a positive,i hope you never see a remake so soon the one is a great fan of the classic
5,sally 's love interest is n't quite as good and quite charming as those who are involved in the making,sally kellerman is excellent as the mother who 's been the same age she 's been and she was also in
5,but i could definitely see the truth that,but i had a good time watching
5,well the movie is n't as bad as the 1st but still it definitely has a better plot than the other,well it has been a good idea for one of the most interesting and important comments ever that could have made the
5,she is married to him as a woman,she is a bit of fun but she makes
5,it also means that i love that in a big game from,it 's not funny it 's just lame unfunny and stupid
5,pick up the ending that the first time ever put into your heart,pick this movie out but just let it go by any means
5,that 's why i loved the movie,that 's all there is here
5,this is one of the worst films ever so far,this movie is not a thriller with a whole new meaning
5,when it is discovered that these kids were murdered by a ghost killer the monster goes in search for the zombies,when i saw it on a flight i was blown out of the big screen or just another man who has spent
5,i would like this to end in a movie called boogeyman,i 'd recommend this movie because it 's made into a documentary
5,htd was actually very exciting to see so many other actors and actors were not so much unknowns in the story to make their mark,htd is n't that easy to classify in the first place since this was filmed in the aftermath of the seventies and had to get more
5,the acting is bad from the outset to the story,the actors who play the main characters are well known
5,this has got one thing all right a few and,this is the worst movie i saw this day
5,those who are interested in seeing this movie agree with the above comments,those who know are of my opinion can be forgiven for this
5,i mean he was never meant for the best of his career,i mean what a great movie it was and i loved that they
5,he makes sure that he has been shot,he 's a woman the entire time
5,in fact there 's something about this show you 're not really,in fact the action sequences were fairly good in many ways
5,this episode takes place when the series is broadcast again,this movie makes the whole thing look realistic and like a
5,when the man is dying by a friend is sent to the apartment for the night and the camera pulls off his wife,when you 're reading the description and the description read the book that it was going for the viewer was already confused
5,i 'd like you to think that i could watch a film when my gf,i mean we all know but it 's not even your average horror movie
5,timmy is the only actor to the supporting cast of great work at a time when the film,timmy has to contend with a certain guy who has had all over that line of love
5,for good reason though you have an enjoyable time,for me this is a pretty good movie
5,trust of the story with the story and the characters involved the story is a bit too weak for its characters 's flaws and weaknesses,trust him or leave he would have been arrested for a job and so he is asked to leave a man behind some money
5,these things do not seem real though,these two stars of this film seem to
5,the music is awful but the movie is also extremely good,the story unfolds at a snail trying to get a bit more
5,many of them did not make sense while you actually did n't,many of us have n't had a hard day 's story
5,jacey plays the main character in the movie,jacey and her friends have taken the same man
5,you have read the book that is based on a true novel,you might think they may need to get a little more attention from
5,hmmmm the whole production is pretty cool but the film is rather bland the acting is awful the storyline does n't work,hmmmm he 's good enough but the most annoying aspect of the movie aside from that is some more a big fight sequence
5,if you 've already seen it you 'll most likely hate the film if you were,if you want to be patient and even interested in the action watch this movie
5,ok this is not really anything as good or,ok so it can be a nice idea
5,not only is the film incredibly awful but a,not that there is no need to remake
5,his performance is as he gets the best of all his fans,his story is about growing in the world of living with his mother
5,sure but the movie is the most difficult,sure it 's dated the actors have very little
5,thinnes 's wife is very well portrayed by streep,thinnes is great in his role and the film is
5,seeing this movie is like a painting of a young man 's attempt at a rock book but with all of its goodies,seeing this in a theater and how it got my toenails from a different time is just one way to get the feeling that
5,however if anyone could like this film with a better cast and crew for such a great film then it 's more than likely that it might be considered,however there 's no denying for any of the other characters that this film portrays themselves and the audience was too young of the characters in this one
5,he meets a new model with the other side stories and lives,he 's a cop who has a tough time on his life that
5,he 's been trying to be too scary to impress a few,he is able to speak freely he is a real person
5,it 's the same thing over and done,it is just impossible for the audience 's audience
5,it was filmed by my gf who i analyzed from the trailer that a little girl on an interview by herself is killed,it 's about how the young women were used as a backdrop in the name that not the only reason for the big black
5,it 's like we 're supposed as if we should,it 's like watching a real person trying to find the
5,if you 're a horror lover looking like a bad one,if there were any other movies with a single person from it
5,the main reason it had been released was the lack of plot thread,the script makes the book to an interesting and profound note which makes you
5,however this one has the potential to shock and the director has just thrown out the movie,however when the bad dude gets in there trouble and there are n't much more than that
5,technically it is a pretty funny film in many ways but it is still one that is very rare,technically speaking in the way this story is told but in a world of desperation it is more of a
5,no one is just a normal person a very funny human,no matter what this was his most memorable films i enjoyed seeing
5,he 's still an actor and director,he is always in it and he does
5,benoit has a very similar character and his love for each character which makes him a different personality,benoit has created the same kind of role although the character is still good with all the other supporting
5,another character that does n't feel any empathy for having no problem understanding and when the family takes revenge,another story of two families who decide for the murder against their mother and dad their own life
5,they decide that they will leave the island to get up on the night before they get away,they are so obviously influenced and that the result is merely boring as well with no meaning
5,worth watching the movie to realize that a lot of other films came from a,worth a rental to the director the directors have made an agreement which means
5,but for this reason you 'll understand its plot,but here they are in good shape that i had
5,his performance is not his face as a little boy,his daughter with whom she can trust the family
5,at one or another point in this movie i noticed that most of it was so predictable and the editing,at the time the movie seemed to go for several characters but the movie just seemed to drag off
5,i'm glad this made a movie,i'm glad i did n't pay to
5,as well as in my humble opinion this movie does not have to be an insult to the intelligence of either gay culture but rather a conservative study on how many times people have seen such people as,as the two brothers decide that his wife and son have been separated by his own mother he tries and decides to leave their child on his son in fact on a day when he is left
5,unsuccessfully this is my kind the films of our,unsuccessfully this movie had some pretty good lines
5,there 's a reason why that is being used in this,there 's a very big amount going around to keep it from
5,when the movie was supposed to have a little plot about what the,when watching the film the only thing left off is the ending
5,it is n't about the world or the possibilities of being there,it all seems that the director wants all the right reasons to kill
5,there is n't a hint of this,there was nothing to recommend it
5,i mean it is a classic,i did like seeing this movie over
5,plus the plot was just horrible it 's not nearly as bad as some,plus i have an gripe with the ending too much in the end
5,on the whole the film looks like,on that note do n't bother
5,ca n't help but dwell on this film,ca n't the writer or director do a lot
5,someone who loves a film and even some good movies is a mustsee,someone needs to be told and the movie is n't just so bad that
5,and a couple of weeks later we,and then there is the acting
5,i really liked this movie and i am still in awe for it,i was very upset by the movie as i do not want to watch
5,when they reach that point in time they just fall flat while throwing,when the bad guy is finally rescued and beaten by his car
5,i am a big admirer of robert patrick but now the movie is a big disappointment,i do n't think it 's ever seen and it really has nothing to recommend
5,if a movie is a thriller it must take an interest in a movie to watch in the,if it was just a drama about the life and the conflict it 's still worth seeing
5,they have a little personality in their eyes and it is all here,they have to be seen a few days later the next day
5,just because it was so stupid i would certainly recommend this,just do n't expect the usual laughs on your face
5,what the heck is this all all about from what i 've witnessed,what is a complete mess for us is that it has a few flaws
5,but what does it matter next,but this is a film you would
5,the problem is the lack one one,the only interesting aspect of this film is
5,einstein was a perfect replacement for a character i loved most,einstein is a great character actor and a strong story
5,the film is full in scope with the film 's story and the script,the film is full of drama and it is the story and character that you
5,i thought the acting of jeff goldblum was well cast but they did n't give up any,i have seen some great films in her career but this one is not that great
5,i give it 7 out of 5 not for people,i love his films but this is so bad it hurts
5,the plot of the film is one of my favorites,the performances do seem to come under the direction but the
5,the first film was better than this,the actors seem far less comfortable than the
5,a bad plot for kids it is n't that bad,a bunch of kids come across in a bar of water
5,sidenote a big mistake is the fact that,sidenote a few other films are made
5,when the girl is on a train to have sex with his brother then what is the best,when our heroes are threatened to eat the world we end up in a very strange situation
5,though the film is n't good it 's still a very good movie,though if you 're interested and wanted a decent example of character development there
5,i know that this movie is n't,i could see how a movie like this
5,sure this does not come from a book by the same director as the first film,sure there are some bad things but this is definitely one of them i liked
5,i could only say i am a big fan of woody smith but in the meantime i 've watched the whole thing and it just looks a little dated and dull,i do not understand that the director intended this kind of humor to make it more entertaining than i had already read the plot and dialog on it 's entirety but this
5,so i 'd give up on it with my friend on and on and say,so the movie has some interesting elements that seem to come along with a little more
5,without that redeeming quality i have to be honest to a very high rating but imdb wo n't allow to put this comment on my list of 210 movies of this film but on a level it 's a pretty good horror film that keeps you guessing until i finally found,without question the movie 's climax has no connection to any real plot or atmosphere no climax no action no suspense nothing is the same goes for the ending and the climax and the ending credits all do a good ending and it becomes a huge shock to other viewers
5,but the film is n't too bad,but she 's not the least better
5,randolph has a little time against his own and is trying to find a way,randolph scott was one of the great actor in that film who could n't have been
5,i guess that is really a complaint with a film which has no bearing,i saw it when i was 7 and was now mesmerized by it
5,so why do they choose to include the two in such scenes as in this one,so it turns out that there 's a serial killer that is in the vortex
5,cbs has a chance a great show with,cbs was the worst of the three
5,this movie is no doubt a gem but for the first two hours it is more of the,this film will appeal so that in a sense of humor the movie itself is the funniest
5,it had a few points but you could forgive the movie without much,it 's pretty much all too much and there was no plot
5,their best efforts are the characters who,their only weakness about this film
5,so if one are in love why would he make movies with him,so you can go and buy a copy or watch another episode if nothing
5,barring that this movie is full of action sequences and a really bad movie all over,barring his first movie he is really one that could n't have made up for what it
5,money for those who do not care about the culture of these men,money wasted in this was a very short movie and it was probably the
5,the fact is however if i were watching a movie and a very bad thing i do believe,the story involves a bunch of americans living in the middle of the ocean after the death
5,these movies have become so many of these,these two are one of my favourites
5,she is also in a hospital of a,she seems a little stiff at times
5,i just watched the show on dvd and the only way to find out whether one of the,i like the concept of his wife as a lover and then he gives her a little
5,many will not have a clue as to why or why,many scenes seemed more like something of an edgy comedy
5,if you like watching this movie i highly recommend it to anyone,if this is the case then please it is a classic
5,the plot of course is the basic,the story seems to go nowhere
5,the film is more about a series which is the weakest thing in history,the other character in the film was an alcoholic who had a good father and
5,to the first part a young member of her family and the other people are going nuts that they are not at all concerned,to be fair that it goes into a movie with its immense twists and turns and is not entirely devoid of scares to say that
5,sorry to say it was ok but it definitely made the whole thing seem contrived,sorry i did n't even care at a movie when the characters were not so much
5,which brings me to the ending that i could n't bear,which leads us to a happy end from one of america that
5,it is an excellent and heartbreaking film,it does have a few problems with the
5,it 's not that bad but it 's just great enough to make you laugh the whole way through,it 's a film about three groups who want each and most men and women to try and get rid
5,ok so you have seen that one scene from beginning by now,ok it 's not a good movie but there is really nothing in
5,at this point in time the filmmakers just think they 've been dead,at first glance you know what i was talking i mean wow
5,however i was at least mildly able to suspend disbelief a few,however all those moments are still a dream to look for
5,1991 is a bad movie it 's really good,1991 's darkplace is one of spielberg better films
5,but i also like the fact it was shot in new zealand or in the early 90s and was one of those films that seemed a,but all of its problems arise to a very strong level of the events that go around within one person 's struggle with each other
5,this film has nothing resembling plot twists and turns but,this is another movie that has no redeeming quality
5,as for the rest of it you would probably be watching a good family movie,as i recall the way the media handled the script did we know that the movie
5,i think i would like it to be an action movie instead of just attempting humor,i just got out of my chair watching this movie on the telly i 'd rather have
5,with the help of a high school dropout named the doctor the owner and the wife in a room on the outside end of their,with a large budget and a beard in the back yard the next thing we do have a really awful aftertaste of this film
5,he wants some money and it is hard for the girl in prison to try and solve the mystery but he 's out there,he is very beautiful for the role and does it well as well as a few other posters but the problem with this movie is
5,and it really is the same kind of movie that they play with the first film of all,and the scene where he runs a car across a road ledge was one thing to highlight
5,to say that this is an old man made me wonder why there are no good performances in this movie apart from his,to be honest i never heard about it so many times since i saw this movie before i remember seeing the previews
5,and in the end the story is a little predictable,and as a matter when the film reaches the climax the
5,i liked the show because it was the only one who was involved in the making of it,i love this film for being a good movie especially when that was part of the fun
5,in one scene a woman is injured she 's pregnant and the other is the daughter,in this case our sympathy for a man of nature is evident that it 's a love
5,a true story about a troubled mother and her parents who have sex with an elder child and later on in order for revenge,a great example of how a film can be called this crap is like a spoof of a movie that has some elements of the
5,amidst the rest of the movie the whole film descends into melodrama and while the film is n't about the killer 's intentions it just has,amidst the use it was an attempt at an art film to be with movies like this and there was no shortage in his mind
5,caution for the movie in fact there 's some,caution 's it 's just an excellent movie
5,the only one that made this movie good is that it was made by the creators with,the cast is pretty forgettable and it did not bother to have a real star power
5,to say this because it has a number of interesting ideas and a,to say it was a great film is definitely not to be
5,i really wish that a bigger portion can cause you to spend more time subjecting,i love horror movies that were to go and use this kind of movie
5,i'm all so picky it was never released,i'm pretty sure this was intended to be taken
5,von palma was a master filmmaker and he was so proud of his work that by this point he made some of the most awful films to come up with a better script but then so much more,von stroheim 's narration is an entirely believable portrayal of the characters in his family but to us by this end of his career we are never sure what it was all around us all for more
5,it 's so bad to say the best as a tv pilot that we only watch the third,it seems that the director and the editor did not even use them to make a good product
5,paul sorvino the one who really stands out in the character of john anderton the former scientist who helps him out the next time a former doctor named john,paul sorvino seems very good as the father and the little girl is n't as sexy as an older couple i 've been watching and she is one reason that
5,i like this movie very very bad acting that had,i 've no idea who was behind the camera
5,the end result is a great film,the dialogue is so bad it 's funny
5,in a sense the real beauty is it,in a way this was not something for the
5,finally the first time and the third that was about,finally it takes the story to a certain degree
5,yes there are some truly hilarious parts in this film,yes it 's a great film and it shows
5,while the story in the book is also very well done also works very well with all the intrigue it does n't,while it was not as stupid as in many of the other movies it may be worth the rental price of a rental
5,why is n't he a murderer who is n't in any,why should there be any real problems of this movie
5,there are also lots of good films and it 's very enjoyable,there is a very weak twist when you go to this movie all
5,we see some guy from the past he lives as an adult on halloween and who,we have two people in it but a lot more than they have been about
5,if you have not been in a theater during the 1980s there is another point of reference to this,if a new generation 's death is about to be discovered by their respective students all the kids should n't
5,most americans would have the benefit their career as their heroes that are more than just an ordinary two or two,most likely this movie has an extended rating for a story and a 15 in fact is it so well
5,i was a kid and i got bored watching this show,i found the movie hilarious even though it is not only boring
5,this is a real shame that it is one that you want to see if not with all of your children,this movie was about a boy and wife who come upon the house and become cursed of themselves being abducted by a
5,what could have been great was the fact that it was made by someone who wanted to see some really,what if you are going to turn the movie off but you wo n't see this movie a bit
5,haim would have been as good as batman and the king,haim also has a little role as a radio dj
5,this is the best anime ever made,this is one of those movies where every
5,why did n't the family be depicted in any sort with a,why on many of the biggest issues do not make sense
5,in fact the first half of this film feels like a student episode,in fact i would not be surprised if they were not alone
5,he has done a good job in the story and was just about the only good aspect in the sequel,he is actually a little generous when the character calls to go out into a different kind that he meets on
5,this film is also in my opinion,this is an extremely disappointing film
5,the acting is pretty good with the exception of one character who makes the first 15 min of the movie more interesting and also has a,the only redeeming feature in this movie is that they just made the mistake for trying it to make it look like a commercial success
5,mixing it up with a few friends that should be called in the world for a little bit of time,mixing them together and tell them to play the straight guy they do n't seem too aware of their relationship but
5,so to give you the chance of watching this the entire thing could get worse with an annoyingly bad guy that makes a good ass,so it 's about a person who comes in to investigate an ancient country and then disappears from his death bed which has to be the
5,there were some interesting issues to follow and you would n't have had much idea of it,there is something about mary crawford about her and her life but for a rather unknown start she
5,also for example i love the scene of his parents with a girl on a field of water but then just to let him get a horse off his face,also the only person with whom has come close to him is a very funny scene about a man who 's been lying in a chair and is in need of
5,i think we 're supposed to be a little more serious and some viewers have some qualms with,i was watching it in the 80s and i was stunned to see how i got it
5,at the beginning we are expected we will witness a little girl being a little rough in the face when you get to an actual end there are other problems that have nothing to really have you,at the beginning of this movie and the film they really had to be made into some of these scenes that i had had trouble watching for a while because i did n't care about what was going
5,they never really made out this tripe except the two brothers and i had seen one of her last successes and thought she was n't any better,they were all very good actors but i had to be a fan on the movie for me so the script was n't nearly as bad as i
5,but that does n't necessarily mean it has any of the problems,but not a big picture for it 's good cast either
5,all of that should work against the,all that matters and no action
5,could you expect this film as a comedy,could probably have been so much funnier
5,this story was also a vehicle to,this was a pretty good film
5,i am very glad i did not pay my bills to see it just to see the real surprise,i was at one point of this one when it appeared i thought as it was made for a couple
5,the scene where he was in the,the acting and editing are amateurish
5,do n't watch this film expecting to,do n't get the wrong product
5,boy did he do it for free or not,boy is this a bad movie the producers will probably
5,it was n't that bad in the movie theater but if you like a bit,it was really amazing that the filmmakers needed a lot to have a sequel
5,it really is worth seeing with a smile and you might enjoy it but otherwise i'm not a big fan of those that are the ones,it 's a shame because he has never done his best work but this one was the worst of the three which was one night
5,this is n't one of those movies that you ca n't stand to watch,this is my typical dvd of it and it is the last movie i could
5,the film is not as well constructed,the director is an accomplished screenwriter and some
5,this movie is a mess of a film,this movie is full of ridiculous dialogue
5,filmed through a dark filter it works well a little more,filmed in black and white to be quite well crafted
5,there is hardly enough action as good as the first ones,there are some interesting moments and this is an example of a
5,it 's a shame because the director and writer did all that a lot of crap,it has a lot of plot line some holes and the story is so dull that you
5,i think the whole time i was watching it i can be a diehard admirer of either love or hate movies and am interested with him,i do not know how that is going to end spoilers in a film so that the viewer could do a very good job of the movie
5,i ca n't really describe how any of the actors,i think the film was released in the us as the
5,a very enjoyable script by stephen king who is sure to bring the film down too seriously,a few episodes of the tv show are the ones where they 're getting together in the game
5,because he and his crew work for the most part,because it 's also an enjoyable little piece the story of
5,we have to admit that if you 're a fan 's you 'll find the worst movie in the right genre,we also get a glimpse at the film as a couple on the same level as the last film in which our
5,dietrich is perfect she has to do the thing,dietrich 's portrayal of a young woman who has never
5,i have n't actually seen the game since i,i mean that the ending is really awful
5,as the plot unfolds the film switches gears from the start to the end and we all know the,as the movie went the plot had to follow up to its predecessor with great acting and direction
5,i mean c'mon maybe the people who saw this movie hated it,i ca n't wait why anyone would say this movie is n't good
5,but then again it 's not a good film,but there 's a lot more to the story than
5,the plot had a lot less impact than any of the action,the story unfolds in real life and is very well executed
5,explosions are good but the film 's premise of a man falling,explosions from time to place in the movie is not good
5,further after the third story of an american who is found himself there to help a bit,further as well a movie to tell a tale and with such a great cast and the cast
5,i mean the movie was just as bad it,i loved both the plot and story line
5,the whole movie is a complete disaster that seems like it was written just to laugh a little bit but in the hands of some of your expectations it,the film is a mixture between a very long and very short feature but it also shows the very differently that is being made of his early years
5,this was such a stupid movie with a message,this film may not have come up a better deal
5,my wife was out of a mental institution,my vote for this movie is 1
5,from the moment she meets the beautiful elvira who has gone away from her coma after escaping from,from this very beginning of movies i was just watching the movie which was a great idea
5,most people do that and have to,most movies are just plain fun
5,that 's ok but that 's all,that 's just the tip of all that
5,just do not expect the original,just like the good ol' days of
5,the scene of the film is hilarious especially in the opening scene with the one who is playing a concert,the film was released in brazil and it is very short but if you want to see a film that features
5,there is a lot to remember about this movie and it makes the movie interesting to sit alone,there are a few scenes involving the film on some occasions at that point on the show
5,the best the other actors can perform their roles like the,the plot is not exactly the same but rather works
5,this film also contains many of those old and different styles,this film is very much a product which is a bit unsettling
5,because he knows that they 're not so much a fan as a person who is the one responsible for this,because they are in prison in new york with one of the biggest cities in the world the country has been destroyed
5,when that came out you had that movie had,when the first was released a very famous mgm version
5,he is the hero in the game and she has also slept with her in the,he was very effective and this film was quite a treat to watch him through
5,the acting is mediocre and the story line is absolutely ridiculous as are the characters,the problem i was with this movie was the way the movie was shot
5,had you not read a book or beforehand in a movie so you would be left feeling that there is not any,had i not heard that the first hour was an original and i had never heard of it so i would be wrong
5,but the movie is so stupid that you want to puke,but if you are into consideration to seeing people who are in
5,the first segment is n't going down,the plot was quite a mess
5,essentially there really is no good story,essentially it has all the elements thrown together
5,in fact the film has no heart and the other actors are,in fact it 's a bad movie which you cant understand
5,i would say the film 's ending is as interesting and satisfying about it as it gets,i have never seen this film in the theater and it was one reason for me to see
5,it 's not easy not only not this can seem very good and it,it is an absolute must see for all fans of british crime films
5,genet 's film takes a lot,genet as his father turns himself in
5,i can safely say that the film is good with the very young jennifer jones playing a role and the title cards about the movie and the scenes in it the movie also gets into the story,i could have given it a 7 if they had made it cheaper but i guess it was only for the kids who were looking for something that looks like this movie at least had a few moments
5,for example in this movie a camera made me jump to despair and have to sign one of the worst scenes ever,for those that are you and just are n't like me or just watch this movie on the big screen there has to
5,unless you know the plot i believe that was enough,unless i remember correctly i was never bored to watching this
5,unfortunately this movie is quite possibly the most stupid comedy made in hollywood which makes absolutely no sense and it goes beyond,unfortunately the film is one of my personal favourites i ca n't seem too easily wrong either to recount this movie
5,the only positive comment about the movie though is that it is so much fun that,the plot is weak and the plot and dialog are not nearly developed any favours
5,all in this series is just a very long and,all of this but it 's just not fun
5,and the ending was pretty sad for me but the twist about this movie is really good the end of the film,and for everyone else 's it must be a complete waste on film this would seem to be a big budget movie and
5,she does n't know at the beginning and end with,she just does n't have all lines of energy
5,i like this movie as i 've watched it in 50,i ca all see a plot summary to this movie
5,i could only describe this as one of the first films i saw that they are actually better than,i liked the movie and have never read the book since the original and did not want to
5,there 's a reason why they are on tv for being able and this sequel does a better follow,there 's another sequence to introduce the most ardent characters of the bunch to be seen to be believed who
5,cool in places but the plot is awful to say the best,cool story line and acting but the movie is just awful
5,i'm talking about how this movie was produced when you were in a coma,i'm going to get to know what you are getting away from the script and
5,a few months later he was forced and abused by a young woman who had her first audition from him,a wonderful example is how many people really have no idea what it is like to get through a whole slew
5,more of a series of vignettes from one of the many countries that will happen to them,more importantly i found the movie somewhat disappointing and i did just like the movie it was filmed
5,the movie also fails to make any money for me at any point,the film goes from very good to absolutely awful to be seriously poor
5,he is the only character who does not care about,he was also the biggest star in tv history
5,i would 've heard about it the only time anyone ever has a friend on the show will,i have been in a mental institution for several years and never have seen this film reviewed
5,the film deals with racial prejudice in the,the film has little to recommend this
5,the scene where the two men take the bullet on to it 's knees are not a laugh or,the only one who has seen him has a long career at his worst is the young guy
5,on a level of 110 this movie was a complete waste,on every aspect this was a big waste for my time as
5,burt was one time when they wanted to go,burt reynolds also has an accent that i liked as
5,some of the dialogue is actually pretty interesting and i enjoyed this film and it 's really good,some interesting moments the music and the overall feel to it which was also amazing because the director chose
5,in fact i have been a fan since childhood,in this story a guy has to choose between the
5,in the end she is forced to go home and her friend 's problems with his work and some will love to find,in a way you can see this movie with the director who has always managed it to make his point of view
5,stars for example was that i saw this in 1988 at a local station in dc,stars with a young boy a young man a handsome and talented young woman who wants to
5,james earl howe was okay as the new yorker but the movie was n't nearly as bad as some of it 's flaws,james whitmore is brilliant as a menacing scientist who is torn down by his new home and his uncle who helps him find a
5,although the film is rather dark like some of these films it is just plain awful,although this is the true good thing i had to check out the other user reviews i
5,what i really liked was that this was a pretty bad movie that seemed to be made for a reason that i never saw them get their hands and i really did n't,what was the use for this bland mess of a film with two actors who have an inane script and two actors who are the only redeeming feature in the entire film
5,add to the mix that was the director of some classic classics and one of,add is that the movie is a bit too good for a rainy night
5,the most remarkable sequence involves the hero telling the captain about the case which makes his name go,the story of the search is lost by the americans that they 're given in the background
5,a few scenes of the movie have really moved me,a man in trouble is the ultimate problem a child or
5,in the end this film should be an indication of how the film could have been made for the people,in my childhood it 's not like any other movie of the genre is an insult to the masses
5,i just had a good time seeing it and i had,i loved this film i saw some really funny parts
5,while this might not necessarily be a good adaptation of a classic but in all fairness it is n't in the way that the original has fallen in its wayside but it is also very touching indeed and it is definitely worth it for,while the film is clearly a complete attempt to copy the life of a gay man and his sister 's death and some of his own personal work their reactions in his life to the man of the past and present events are present
5,he meets with a group of friends to go along,he then discovers the hidden link of the two inhabitants and
5,it also helps to get the feel of how a movie about the,it 's very sad that a lot of people will watch it
5,it 's so bad its actually hard on the eyes,it 's a wonderful piece for a director to produce one
5,not that some of you know that,not that the movie is bad
5,but it is great art from the perspective that the director made that i did not realize a director who wrote it and then came to the top,but that 's how the ending and the ending come and if that i was n't really going out the window to get out of my car
5,usually a horror film is more realistic than you might expect,usually there are a few things i have seen with similar themes
5,there is a whole lot more to this story,there were also some good actors in this episode so
5,well if you are a fan of the series of,well worth seeking for what is a cult film
5,it 's a nice watch that i have read many of those that i will read but if you do n't watch it you probably wo like this,it 's like a bunch of idiots that the entire crew was just trying to get their money back they wanted to make fun off the phone
5,not that of the other but i believe that the director was an,not that there was a plot line that went beyond all limits
5,anyone who has a particular perspective in history will find this film rather than eyeopening and the other is one that is not,anyone who thinks that the movie was made was based on a philip potter movie should be sued after seeing the film
5,and the scene where dr loomis is,and that 's a bad movie
5,i'm sorry to say that i had been looking at it up until the end the movie did n't even try,i'm a fan and have n't seen an actress by myself until i was too scared to get my hands to see
5,it is an interesting story with a few surprises but you are left wondering what,it was so sad how the producers of the novel ended the movie making
5,i will tell you that as i went to a cinema to see this one it was not,i am not going to get into a game but i was not afraid to sit through it
5,he is a great detective and there is a good,he had some of us but a few changes
5,some of them are so good that even the actors in the movie can make it better just to publish the film,some of it takes in the film but one day they end to a remote and of course some of that is a
5,i found this movie in an absolute chronological category,i loved everything to me and i'm afraid that the
5,this movie has only one or one redeeming part in it that is the last fight scene,this movie is not to be taken as it was n't a horror film it was just a
5,and the scene with the boy is as great as,and this is definitely a movie with the title
5,all three main cast members are all excellent and well acted and acted,all we see is a bunch of girls who are killed at the beach
5,they are just annoying and obnoxious and very unfunny,they are just annoying actors and it is n't even
5,it makes fun of all the great comedy films of the 1940s,it 's been very long run with me and it 's just an
5,how it was in the theater,how could she be a singer
5,the acting was horrendous and the writing wooden,the film is as the story about a mother
5,for those interested over the age this is worth watching but do n't buy into this one the acting the special values the costumes,for a time waster in fact i 've found a way out but i wo only have wasted 87 hours of my life
5,i ca n't even begin watching one,i know i did not know what to
5,i 've never seen this movie at the,i would be wrong to be honest
5,i like the way they go about having conversations with a dog,i can hardly say how many times have these elements of the same
5,the movie itself is a mess but it is not worth watching,the film is shot entirely over the top rope but the action sequences
5,and the most obvious part of his life in this movie,and this is why you want to look at it
5,despite from his usual flaws his own film seems a little hokey,despite a few moments of interest this film was just a total disappointment
5,so you 'll have to wait for the right reasons,so on the upside of this it is a long and
5,the movie is set up without any semblance of tension or romance and does not even fit,the acting is very good although not enough to make up the movie 's overall recommendation
5,the plot was thin but so it was the,the last ten minutes or so are priceless
5,a movie about a true love story makes you think that it is going to happen just in a,a few minutes into this movie you find out that the only thing missing was for the end
5,this story is so predictable that it becomes,this is not a film to watch
5,in fact there was no question whatsoever from,in addition the story is rather boring
5,so i was surprised how this is such a huge,so why is n't one of my favorite scenes
5,plus it gets my heart pumping out by the fact that someone who has lived in such a beautiful world and its a film of any,plus i ca n't stand for days on that same occasion over time i could n't see the plot line so the acting is great
5,and i did not see him walking through the,and i was so engrossed into watching her
5,the only redeeming value to this otherwise good movie was its lack of a story,the scene in which the woman tries to kill and runs away from him and the
5,plus this is probably one of those shows where it takes them so seriously to take,plus the scene where tom and clark are dancing by the train through the air
5,you 'd swear that a character in the book who has a few chuckles and little bit of a mystery,you know it 's supposed to look like a parody but do n't bother me what it really does
5,she meets him again and goes after him,she is a nice actress but she is n't
5,a movie that i do not enjoy watching because it was so bad was n't my life,a must see just for the fact that it contains a strong plot line and a good cast
5,he is clearly a filmmaker who is the real murderer of the world,he 's just as convincing and sympathetic as it needs to be
5,let 's not forget this show that i have gotten to,let 's not forget that there must be some real reason to
5,yours is a must see for me,yours was never released from video with the
5,i have n't seen such trash in my life,i have a suspicion about the way in which a
5,with this film though you will be a bit hesitant but if you have read a summary for,with a few exceptions you might be pleasantly likely to make a good movie to be made
5,they are all for different reasons,they had just released this one on
5,avery 's films that are supposed or b are not for people that do,avery made a great movie but the movie had little to no budget
5,and of what is supposed at all in the film does n't get any better,and for a more mature person who enjoys the film i think it is worth seeing
5,the film is set in a small town with the best,the cast is very well done for some great actors
5,the rest of this movie has no real deal to work out,the whole film could have ended the same way as i did n't
5,the story revolves only on the first of the series that revolves upon some mysterious woman the one,the film was made a little long too often because of the poor performance of patrick stewart
5,but this film was no excuse to put all the pieces together,but for my taste i ca n't imagine that it is supposed to
5,the characters of the four lead characters are absolutely brilliant,the story is good as a whole the dialogue and dialog
5,but i still like the fact it does n't belong in his book and then does this film and we,but if you 're looking to get on your self this movie may just have you on this edge
5,the acting is quite well made,the ending is absolutely horrible but for
5,also if you love kathy burton or have a couple of friends with children than have no talent or do not have the opportunity,also the acting was decent and was well done and well acted and had a story that did n't leave the whole story
5,the special effects were a bit overdone compared today,the scene at the airport house where the little dog
5,the most annoying film is if the movie is a parody,the film was also a great film about a person who is
5,she was n't the good girl,she 's not going to make that
5,how did she find out he was the one boy and,how could you make him believe he just is n't
5,in this movie he gets caught up in an underground murder but he has it with the girl and then falls in jail,in spite i have to admit he did a good and entertaining script about a bunch i love the characters in this film though
5,the last half of these three is a real masterpiece,the movie is not a bad movie and its bad its
5,always i think that this movie is very,always a bit harsh and sometimes disturbing
5,i'm sure the audience could have been on a better relationship with her character and her voice could have ended,i'm thinking it was a low point in the career but she still manages to keep it in suspense
5,on this note the only thing that the movie is good if there was any movie,on the other side the cinematography of the movie may be very nice to watch
5,it does not matter how to describe this a,it 's one thing that did n't do
5,i will be a big problem i did,i love these kind of movies but this is
5,i have watched this episode and i ca all be a,i had no idea what to do of this movie
5,dr magrew has created a monster that kills his,dr watson must have been a big part
5,he just wanted to get out of her,he is also a wonderful film critic of the
5,normally the worst part of this entire escapade was the script,normally when there is an issue in which these are not real
5,it has a lot of heart and soul and even greater elements like the human,it is a movie that really made me forget to have my face corrected
5,benoit and company find themselves on a cross between the black hole and,benoit tells dave that he loves a woman and has a crush
5,with all these people you can probably get a taste on the acting that even with the movie is,with a plot like you did n't like this it could have really been a very good film
5,to begin there were a few instances of the first 20 minutes of my childhood but there will have to be a point in the film that,to say this was a sequel is to bring the whole movie a whole lot more so i have found it to have that i did
5,but when it 's not clear he can make the rounds of his actions and the viewer is not sure if they,but to be honest i have never watched such an awesome horror masterpiece that i cannot wait to get my hands
5,the film starts very smoothly the scene where the killer gets drunk and tries a baby of his dead body,the acting is n't bad the acting was so poor and you would have your own choice of watching this movie
5,there was no point in the film,there was enough of the movie 's plot
5,is this movie supposed on a serious basis,is the reason for doing the film to make
5,this makes a lot better with shamed movies like the exorcist or donnie darko 's 'the manchurian code,this film is more of a comedy than an episode with the exact same plot which did very few
5,after having visited the book for the first year i decided that the movie would probably be better when he had n't been,after that the plot is pretty basic but it 's all about the way it takes care for everything that happens in the town
5,this is not one of the films that you 've got the,this is one film of a lifetime who can appreciate it
5,if we 're not familiar enough the film is not as well as other,if you want to laugh hysterically and laugh out for some decent entertainment
5,she is the one to kill,she looks so real and the movie
5,and it 's a pity that this,and there 's nothing new here
5,our characters are more realistic that 's a fine mix of the two worlds but it 's more like,our heroine is a real human face who looks absolutely stunning and acts in such an obvious way
5,the movie makes sense only is that the film tries,the result comes from a series of bad actors
5,some might not have missed it,some movies just have nothing to offer
5,it 's about a young couple trying to,it is one that is even rarer
5,the performances of their faces make you laugh more and more,the only good thing that i can remember about it
5,it 's so good it is almost comical,it 's a shame that some of these actors
5,this is the worst movie ever made,this is the one who wrote it
5,the story could have ended without a lick to say so i had to see it for the sake,the story line was ok but it was so disjointed that i cannot even begin thinking about that
5,jock is also a very stupid character with a different type view but the most annoying character of the first half of his episode was the one who was murdered and,jock and a girl named mandy bullock are her friends in the bar and the local husband who wants to get her first blood from her school was the daughter
5,what kind has the characters doing in films,what a mistake he had to make it to
5,the script was pretty good the sets and settings were well done,the ending of the movie was totally pointless and is just plain annoying
5,it 's also very well made and that is n't exactly true since the movie is very entertaining,it 's obvious that there 's a lot of nudity but the dialogue and acting are a bit of
5,the film is a complete failure,the scene where the hero says he
5,they go around killing people just before going through the,they 're on a mission because they need money
5,i do n't think he actually did have an incentive,i could barely remember anyone having a copy in a film
5,the fact that the script is a comedy,the film is as real as it is but
5,i was expecting a lot of good actors but unfortunately the movie turned out to have been shot on video in the worst,i had no clue because i wanted to write 10 mins of my life and so would love to watch it again
5,although i ca all not that i have anything against ang lee 's style in this film it is a very enjoyable scene and the film is very well done,although i have n't seen many of the comments i 've read here it looks like i 've been on the bottom of a list and have lost count of a
5,for years after watching this film one day and the next friday a lot of the viewer must suffer at a place in a cinema near a bar of the day and then get back to the fact,for all this criticism may not have been a good review for an entertaining thriller as it is far superior to these others and the two young men do not make the same mistakes as the others
5,while the film 's story does not flow in the context of the book it 's simply not the story of a very moving person in the universe,while a movie on paper is not very very good it 's very long before viewing the first story and the second one is really good with more than
5,the most disturbing part of this episode is the way the characters of the three main protagonists and friends,the film has a very bad ending and the end is quite abrupt yet to save the movie
5,eric and his father lisa played her father role a very beautiful and intelligent young woman from london city in the early thirties who are living,eric clapton 's portrayal of a woman a woman is a nice addition of a woman who gets a good performance in the last act
5,it 's the fact that it has one,it 's not a movie you see
5,ugh if you have n't seen this film you are wrong wrong with the movie,ugh it looks more like an exercise with heaps more of an actor than an adult
5,it had to come at least in my opinion of the world,it does n't even seem that good in the first place
5,a bunch the other actors could 've done better with this,a lot more of a better actor would have made better use
5,throw away a gun that turns out you 're right there 's a pretty nice and exciting view of a good old person,throw me out of the whole movie at the end of our hero and let us take care of him when he 's on
5,i just watched this film in the theater,i could have seen him more but that would
5,the main theme of an abandoned man returning to america to recover from the prison is disclosed but then it turns its head into a film he is forced to deliver,the story is about a woman trying and her mother to become ill but a hypocrite the story begins to spiral out into the real bad with the first half hour of
5,turns out it 's a lot of other movies that i can only mention for the,turns out that he has never learned the word about it to his wife 's
5,christopher walken gives the most memorable line of the movie,christopher pacino has a very small role as the police inspector
5,it 's about as annoying a story as that could go and if you 're not,it shows just about everyone is so dumb and ugly that it is n't funny
5,our hero is a very confused businessman,our main characters are killed by the evil
5,it is a very good thriller,it 's a shame because this is
5,it was the last film to depict some,it should have been a better film
5,they are also able to get to the bottom point and there,they are all about a very funny and very wellwritten drama
5,i would recommend it to all hitchcock fans too much is one to ignore by all,i was a huge fan and was shocked at how bad a movie this was
5,could have made the movie better even the music was bad in comparison,could he just be the only witness and he would have a real sense
5,see it again tonight it 's worth your time,see the movie it 's a better life movie as
5,if you have ever watched an independent movie then you 're going through a lot of work,if you get to hear an accurate view of life to make this film watch it
5,it was a very interesting story and a good example about how people were,it 's one of the most boring movies i 'd ever ever watched
5,i 've seen an average low budget film with a budget of about a few dollars,i remember watching the two interact and each one of them perform a few laughs
5,instead of a scary movie this film proves that they could have done it better than they could,instead we get two stories which were much better so the film ends with a happy ending
5,and if not better it 's just plain,and it was not the last episode
5,if you 're looking for a realistic scary movie with a lot of heart and plenty of gore do,if it is n't for you and will not waste precious 90 minute running time on that subject
5,i have no hope for movies about the film 's politics,i do n't really care for what this film was trying to
5,the movie is not without its moments in this film that will not hold the interest of,the only reason i should watch it because it was probably the worst film ever made
5,my advice to the film makers and producers for giving his opinion that he was a very good writer,my advice watch this movie and then see it and hope they 'll keep it on the condition of this
5,skip this movie and rent it if you were desperate for some cheesy fun movie with all the kids and adults,skip this movie like the plague and you 'll be right off the screen when i could give it a 3 but
5,she is pretty nice and always seems to be an actress who had been in a really good scene where the killer got shot,she gets all her life out from what is supposedly a very interesting relationship so we have to wait it becomes a nice little girl
5,just watch the first one even if you were,just watch them when your friends see it
5,that was because i thought it was the,that makes it all those fun moments
5,and if it is n't a drama its worth a see,and the director has not yet gotten enough credit for the role
5,midway down to earth has an exciting plot which leads me to believe we can do a lot better,midway to begin the last twenty minutes of the film are more of what you want to be
5,big fat liar was just a horrible movie about a group of stupid,big money are a big fan of the film or a movie
5,seeing the film just was n't too funny at all,seeing this movie you will be wondering whats the case but
5,each character can be interesting at one point,each character is something that is not a good
5,i thought this would get worse and worse,i do recommend this version to the last few
5,the plot is based upon actual event that the director had created an esoteric thriller that explores many aspects with a plot that has a meaning but there 's more to be,the action is too long the story is predictable the ending is just awful and stupid and the final twist is absolutely ridiculous but it 's also a very enjoyable movie
5,but then again he plays that character,but he 's still so beautiful
5,the special effects of the films is laughable considering that it was n't so,the result is the same as i 've seen a lot to like
5,the only thing that bothered me was that the plot was interesting,the director did n't even look at the camera that he was just
5,but when he kills a guy he sees as his father was born,but i was very surprised that it was n't available in vhs
5,i 've never seen a character who has anything less than an ordinary little charisma,i love her from a play which is why she has no chemistry to look
5,this movie is an insult to the intelligence,this one is quite an aboveaverage thriller
5,yes the show makes the whole series but all the actors are n't convincing either all they come off as though they are trying to save,yes i am sure it 's not all a bit dated but after the first twenty odd odd scenes the movie does nothing to stop
5,the two stars have some chemistry and some good moments and i would,the whole film does n't have the same plot it is about
5,or does the director actually say to himself that when a producer is killed by a car of a couple of other actors or just,or the guy who owns her in the middle of the movie because i guess it is the worst thing they could come across
5,evenly scripted has never really been seen or seen again since,evenly the film was so stupid to watch it made me want
5,but if they had more to the point which was a whole hour minute,but i do n't want to be generous and not have seen it
5,the main problem is that it does,the movie 's main weakness lies
5,he should try and win the academy awards for his career,he was the only person who knows what he 's doing
5,after a few minutes you feel a sense,after the big success of the title of 'the
5,though the movie is just not a very convincing work it drags with several short scenes,though it has to be seen to believe it was shot in the south west
5,no matter how hard it try to be intelligent it is difficult,no one does n't have an ounce of respect from his character
5,but then they are n't the same as the ones who are watching the movie again because they show how much it tries hard as to to make a good film,but then i saw the movie so fast that i had to stop wondering if it might be a good movie but my wife is just watching a movie today
5,but if you 're not a great movie fan do yourself a big favor,but what it 's like to show the director 's mastery of creativity
5,the story also feels very weak and does not make much sense,the movie is really great the acting is flawless in this movie
5,i was at the premier screening at imdb,i had to leave and was surprised to find
5,at last i found myself rooting maybe in their place after watching this film which does not help it,at once the scene where he tells his friend was a poor and uneducated girl was okay the actor playing
5,at the end of this film i was n't going to change the first time i saw a show so well that the producers of it seemed out of focus,at the beginning of the show where the viewer is in the middle of a movie and i find a show that i felt as if i was watching out for
5,on this second sequel evoking the tension and intelligence and tension of a character 's story,on this show the character is completely uninteresting and pointless in the most awkward manner
5,however it 's not the best of the bunch of films i would put the two out,however for one thing the film takes itself so much of a complete delight to start
5,john carradine played his part very well and i have never seen,john wayne was also the most interesting part of the movie
5,i think it really makes it a much better movie,i 've always loved and enjoyed the film because its fun
5,yet another great film in the long line is made to look like a masterpiece,yet even after he is kidnapped he gets a bad man and becomes a man for
5,moon masterson and a handful of others do a great job of conveying emotion and tenderness in the movie in which they are captured,moon and ice cube make the final voyage to the top of the ocean but unfortunately the story ends up nowhere near enough
5,and then there is something that just does n't,and it 's not hard just the worst
5,so in conclusion that 's an unforgivable feat since the dvd release is not on vhs and that 's why people are not buying the video,so now i can tell them that their careers are not funny but this is the one that i wish it turned out to be
5,very low budget low for the first hour and then they,very good cast excellent acting especially from the 2 leads
5,the movie also makes fun and tries to,the movie also has a nice family
5,my wife is so bored by having to find the answer for,my dad bought some tapes and i thought what would you
5,thanks to the cast in the first film it had the potential to,thanks for the fact that the entire movie is basically a string
5,the only bright point to any of,the acting is n't bad either
5,but he has the ability to have fun with himself,but i think it is unfair to see a film like
5,voodoo has been given a million by eight years but the movie fails as a result of its impact on the viewer,voodoo has been given his opportunity to kill the people responsible for the death of a wealthy heiress of his own and who
5,not that it is the worst movie i have,not surprisingly there must be the other elements
5,not a bad movie but it did give you a great idea for a plot that could possibly get a little too,not only was the romance between the two main characters not interesting it was really good for the characters to follow
5,that was too much of the story and the actors who were playing themselves with the exception seem in a terrible performance,that 's just because of the story is n't that interesting or interesting and the message is not clear in the end that
5,to me this is not going so bad that it 's funny,to me it would be a good thing if the director had the
5,this film also features a plot device that is not only funny and the dialogue is n't much better when it 's not all is very interesting,this is a very good film and one of my favorites of the late 60 's made by the same director and directed by david l l cord
5,spoilers ahead if this is a flaw and the fact that the entire film is based on a true true story one is in a completely unsympathetic and emotionally ridiculous,spoilers ahead the movie is pretty well done but it 's so horribly written that it is not funny and is impossible for everyone to sit down and watch
5,the movie is a very touching film that deserves more attention,the film feels like an unfinished thriller at its time
5,i have not seen a lot more than this,i just saw one of the first movies in my
5,the movie is just about everything that went wrong wrong,the scene with scott and his men running for help is
5,dave 's father decides to teach the professor he has lost out of time and wants the boy who gets,dave brown as the villain and christopher reeve is very beautiful as john cusack although it has no talent
5,or do i care more for the other two protagonists,or maybe they got a movie made and i never saw
5,simple movie is one strange and very bad thing,simple enough not a good movie but very good as
5,ca as much as those have,ca do n't even bother with your
5,and that 's because this is n't a good thing like in the original,and in the final scene a few characters are treated to a little annoying
5,overall this film was extremely disappointing and a waste,overall the movie is enjoyable for those with good reasons
5,it also has a rather disconcerting character,it could have saved the world
5,the script is weak and i thought the story should have been better it,the other actors did the best to make this movie even remotely watchable
5,vampires who live at all in this area will be killed,vampires are pretty ugly looking like they are a killer
5,timon does n't really know about his new family,timon nolte is in the role of a hitman and
5,sammy willis looks perfect but she was in the right place for her performance,sammy flynn as good as it gets is an excellent portrayal a good movie as
5,but if you 're a bad guy,but what the hell is that
5,i loved that the plot in the most of the movie was a simple one at its end,i watched this movie because i liked it so much i was a fan it had very low expectations
5,i liked the character of his character,i am a very generous viewer
5,that i was wrong was a bit odd at me,that is the only thing that makes any movie even the
5,to top it out the cast is uniformly interesting especially downey jr as a detective,to me they 're only in it because of the talent of michael and george they
5,instead it 's a pretty boring movie and one that is poorly written and boring as,instead it 's more like an attempt to make things up to something like nothing
5,animated was the best way for hollywood and i would,animated cinema can not make this kind of garbage
5,the movie is a tribute to reality but not really the type with,the last half hour was not long enough to leave me smiling
5,i could n't see the director 's intent on taking the helm of the original version of the scarlet pimpernel,i guess the director was trying to use the same technique to show some real people in the process with little
5,the unguarded world' and the omen ii,the unguarded man' is a mustsee
5,i will not spoil it by saying i did this,i have not seen a movie that i do
5,also for those of you who enjoy watching films and movies for the people,also the use of the giant whale makes this movie to a point
5,and for those who want to see it to it 's the first one i can say i really liked it more and i,and then back to the good guy to get to the ground of the crime with the girl he is so good with
5,but as it does they think this would suck the crap outta the whole thing but after all you are n't,but you should have fun and this film really is as good as you can really get to know it at all
5,only if you 're a big fan or i would love to know the truth about what is real it just seems to be one sided trip,only the acting skills were decent and the acting by this was also very good but the writing was horrible and worse all through the film
5,countless parts involve the film 's central protagonist and her character,countless scenes were filmed in the us but the dialog is a
5,this is a really good movie,this was a really really good movie
5,detailed in a way that does not make one single smile a joy and anger,detailed images are n't enough and there will never seem like a great moment to establish
5,well done movie with an awesome soundtrack that is so incredibly beautiful,well it was made up of the script was weak and boring and
5,the acting was good with some of my favorite characters and you ca look a lot more of the way through,the film starts off alright a very simple story with a fantastic message behind a theme which is still interesting
5,soon the two girls start attacking their mother while the other kids have left a party,soon the film is almost endless and the climax with the car is so preposterous and so
5,in my estimation the acting was pretty bad,in fact it 's the exact opposite of the
5,however it did n't even have to be so terrible it was n't enough,however the only problem with this film are not the characters they were supposed to
5,in most cases there are the usual cliches from a movie that just,in the original scene we see an old man having a baby
5,for years we find the movie,for instance a group member called in
5,it never made me want more i want,it 's a fun and clever thriller
5,as with those of the others it was very difficult to follow that the filmmakers went back at the time to bring it together,as for others it might not be a masterpiece as i have n't read the novel or do not believe i 'd like to read
5,ellroy 's movie is a documentary about life and life but it has to rank with the best of,ellroy is such a poor actor you can hardly grasp his talent at all for what he is
5,very few movies have ever been released,very well done and beautifully photographed
5,neither does a coherent story that would ruin the plot,neither was the script nor did he make this movie clear
5,it would even try i liked this one but could not find much to save,it 's like a student story about a family member who is a real trooper
5,the scene with the mother is absolutely perfect,the script itself follows one of the worst movies
5,doug stahl plays his usual smarmy self in the first movie he did,doug lowe and his brother were in the midst of the story and the
5,but with all due respect there is no point to it or why so many scenes are so fake,but still there 's no need for this to be shown and for those willing to watch any of these
5,i mean the film is shot in a studio school,i ca n't imagine anyone getting killed in the first place
5,our heroes had their little lives of men and people with a secret,our hero is so stupid and so boring as to act ridiculous
5,if this was the case that would have been more than just another mindless film about a killer,if you want to see some of their movies try to pass and choose to watch it
5,i 've read the reviews before renting it for the story and i am still astounded,i was amazed at how quickly she was the killer in the book of terror
5,if you want something different than do you really need to put up a copy with a special edition,if it had done a parody of the tv show this would 've been a really interesting series
5,both the story and the characters are completely unlikable and the characters do not have any depth,both of those are all good examples of the movie but the way the characters act and how
5,my advice if not a must see,my friend and i saw it on the
5,the story was not to be confused because you did n't get the feeling that the main character,the acting directing and characters are all good but the writing just does for a cheap production
5,evil dead people have an imaginary life so bad it,evil dead of his own but not just that
5,the music does n't seem particularly good the sound is bad and that of gabriel,the movie is about a little less interesting and it is a real mystery
5,oddly enough some of the jokes were hilarious and the jokes was hilarious and funny,oddly there was a very large number of goofs that were n't funny either
5,after several short periods the man in question comes into town and,after all this has a very similar story to the movie
5,this is definitely not one you can be thankful,this is the best story that you could ever have
5,it also is nice to have a film that is so much better,it should have ended and he had the chance of making something different the
5,a film that is more serious than the usual fare made by the creators of hitchcock 's earlier movies and even more in it,a great film for people who like films where the characters look good and do some really interesting things and make you jump out of
5,10 the acting is great the dialog is not funny the music at first makes absolutely no attempt for dramatic relief on which it is used,10 out there but if i can handle the film then you must be a fan to watch this movie and just have to wait for something
5,he plays a very believable and powerful kind man who wants to have his wife in his family and protect his son when there is a problem with them,he gives him a clue regarding the fact that there 's nothing to care about when the man and his young brother decide that they 're in it
5,it 's just amazing how the film ended in such a good way,it 's also a story of the life of a woman who has been
5,everyone who has read any of them will find this movie to be dull but just a little over,everyone just is going around with a smile while waiting to see if there is anything to laugh at the
5,one might wonder where the hell was wrong with it,one can only imagine they took this story out of the
5,horror films are much worse than what you would wish for,horror enthusiasts are usually in love and this film is so bad
5,i 'd also have the opportunity to enjoy this movie as if it is some sort,i have seen a few films in his career like bloodsport but not for him
5,but the acting is n't horrible,but what i loved about the movie
5,when the two men of men have their powers in a man of the opinion it is not as though the story,when i thought i could write some jokes and have just viewed a trailer of this film and then saw it
5,i 'll just start watching my wife 's eyes,i 've seen many horror films on tv or something
5,lane has to play the leading role of someone else as he can handle an,lane had to be the man who made this movie the first time around
5,stealing the money at a time,stealing the film and watch it twice
5,this film is definitely worth watching,this movie is just crap in my
5,overall this is a pretty mediocre tv,overall this is one great thriller
5,what a mistake it is and why it,what are they trying for it for
5,i also prefer and understand the character of mr bean very,i will never find anyone else to watch it again
5,unfortunately the director did not seem too old at the time,unfortunately i think this part could have been made with a different
5,i mean do n't get me started on how the two women fall asleep when they go out in a bar,i have seen a few moments of this film with which i feel like it should be done in the way that
5,as you see what will keep you in the past through this film its almost impossible not to jump out of your seat seat at the cinema,as long as the cast made up this movie like the blair dragons project the producers decided to make a joke of everything but the film ends up
5,the dialogue and directing directing is so strong,the dialogue and lines are not a laugh riot
5,i just want to thank heavens for,i ca n't wait to view
5,the story is pretty funny as we,the whole film does n't work
5,now that i 've seen other movies i have n't seen i would recommend it to anyone,now i will go here with some other reviews by people who 've seen the movie
5,it 's one thing that i feel in,it was a bad movie to do
5,the plot is ridiculous enough and the acting is ok overall,the film was based on a real story and had it all
5,they all share a unique life,they are very cute and they look
5,thanks the cast and crew members,thanks to the lack thereof i am
5,maybe it 's just not the film industry,maybe he should go out to college
5,this is the sort of movie with which a lot are filmed in movies with lots of,this is a great movie for those who want a more serious insight into their lives
5,mo was one very popular movie,mo and pa are not just that
5,personally i prefer this movie to give it a bad point although it has a couple of very funny moments,personally i was not looking forward to see this film because i had never heard of john sayles 's name
5,a big budget movie from start to finish with so much plot twists and over,a lot of fun and a lot of fun with all of these movies
5,this movie is not a bad lot of acting,this movie is so bad i felt sorry bad for
5,it could have been an intriguing series without giving away the final outcome,it is very simple that such an endeavor does n't work as long as
5,the movie is pretty bad the acting is,the two of them are so cute
5,alicia is n't so much a character she 's just about as good as,alicia grable was the highlight and was even more funny at the camera
5,not to say it 's a good show too this bad to suck,not to mention it and the plot and plot of the movie has been
5,the music is very beautiful and the musical,the special effects of this are awesome
5,that one person will be so glad that his beloved english movie is such as to,that was the most painful thing about this film it 's a little bit boring
5,i liked the characters even better they seem in an interesting way and that it all seems,i have had the pleasure of watching it when the story first aired was so awful
5,every time they use the term and,every scene was not very funny
5,prince 's new lover was one of them,prince robertson plays the type role and you can
5,the characters come in with the story and the story development,the script is n't bad the acting is poor the script is
5,the characters are stupid the plot is ridiculous and the characters are lame and just plain stupid and they do n't fit the whole plot very thin,the last scene was a wonderful blend as was when it would have made it into a series of three episodes in the vein and the second feature
5,it will surely be forgotten at any time and the film also feels,it 's not a horror movie it 's not worth your time
5,it 's a good idea but you can never understand it,it is n't funny i think it 's too bad
5,tony hawk an actor in the movie was absolutely stunning as an actor portraying the,tony todd plays the role with an honesty for acting but that 's okay
5,this is one of the most thrilling movies i have seen,this is a must all those kids who can only identify around
5,not even a good old man with a mustache,not that but the film is a mess
5,a must see for all fans of the genre such to watch the show,a few weeks a week has been one of the films that i really liked
5,he has never seen anything quite awhile i would say that it is n't a show,he would be more a part of an american lifestyle and even those involved in the case
5,pare takes care in the other films but,pare is simply superb in every scene
5,director andrew de palma gives the film his usual flair and it 's a pity that he made this turkey for his release,director william l horton who directed many others made this a little more palatable on the screen and had more to offer than most
5,credit for the performance given to the,credit was taken to the studios
5,the best thing about this movie was the lack,the only decent acting performance is his presence
5,others are not much either mentally unstable or angry they,others would not even make him a little suspicious
5,a few months later the hero finds his missing son is attacked by a giant masked maniac wielding his hand with one,a man whose mother has been murdered by another cop is unable his wife to keep the mother from the future
5,with the help the movie is trying to be true to the book it is n't,with a few exceptions the film lacks any surprises what makes it a horror thriller
5,it did n't help that none either,it is not just a story because the
5,dean cain and donald pleasance were great and the plot was interesting you 'd get to see all the movie,dean stockwell plays the type of person who just looks like a normal boy with a heart of mind
5,hearn as the conflicted and insecure and cynical father who refuses to escape from the,hearn 's character of a dead wife is a real delight for a while
5,this is an ensemble piece of filmmaking,this whole film was made by a young
5,there are some pretty gruesome scenes of violence and suspense and that is something that is refreshing to watch,there is plenty of footage in the first 10 seconds of the movie and in this one they have nothing
5,it was n't scary or even funny,it 's also a really good movie
5,trust me on and you do not want your money,trust me i must respectfully say that the rest of the
5,the film 's direction is superb with a good story line,the plot follows a group of teenagers who decide whether their lives
5,while there is a good deal the movie is as good and,while being overly flawed that does n't get to any specific
5,if you 're not a fan you may be wrong,if you 're a fan will not be able as your
5,apparently she 's the only person around that she will be able and will not be able to be associated,apparently they 're not too young but not as good at the quality of their craft as i 've seen
5,whistles are used to create a new and clever way of showing themselves something unique and at times very clever but,whistles and action sequences are used and there 's some action to see if they 'd did to their partners
5,now i am not the same person on film which i feel compelled to review,now after getting this movie out of a collection i just wonder why the other user
5,dunne is the only one who shines in this very unusual role,dunne is not much in a way she could have been in this
5,without a doubt this was the biggest film made for the television series,without the hint that this is only a tv series to be fair there
5,the only thing that kept me watching was that i had no intention to waste in the movie,the plot line is rather lame and does a fairly well developed job by the overall production and direction
5,i do not want to spoil the movie by saying but as i,i had forgotten this movie at the local gay video film festival
5,only the most sincere part of her life has a little less,only one can give it ten stars as it should be
5,too bad it 's not a good movie though you can enjoy this if you want it on,too bad they had to make the original movie to some degree and the movie needed some people
5,however despite his great performance he 's not that good and he was the only highlight for me,however the rest of the cast is not only to blame or to save this film but for the
5,looking for a more good adaptation of the classic classic,looking in the basement is really something like the first but
5,it 's all around that he 's a bit of a jerk,it 's easy for you to understand what 's going so far a
5,saw this film at one of these couples in london where it opened in the late forties and early 1980 another,saw this as soon i was looking out it at my computer and we have to pay a dime of a film
5,mace is played brilliantly liberated and very realistic and is supported by the most sympathetic characters who have always been the same,mace is the third member of the group and it 's difficult to find the killer or at least the hero
5,i would recommend it highly to those of the younger generation or to fans that love,i do wish i would have a friend that would be good to see him
5,but no there 's a difference between the original and,but then again it 's not a horrible film
5,it 's not a great movie it is not very,it 's almost the same thing as the original
5,i can only wonder where the hell 's going on and,i 'd probably rather see the movie on its subject
5,it all adds to the mix of both of those,it 's quite a feat to be at work
5,he 's been a writer since he was already a star or actor,he is supposed as one of the funniest character actors i have seen in
5,her character is a shallow woman who gets together with her husband 's husband and finds herself forced into a new society and learns that,her voice on the stage of the songs is priceless but if anything they can dance and they have never been made to leave
5,it 's got plenty more of a few of the great scenes but ultimately the,it 's the reason i went out and bought that dvd of the movie
5,this is really the worst movie i have seen,this movie is not what you should expect
5,courtesy the cast are great the characters engaging and the script is so wonderful the movie,courtesy of other people on the show would get a clue what they 're doing
5,the other comments of this movie are,the acting and directing is flawless
5,chicken and the devil is a movie that needs help out in the beginning,chicken 's revenge is a masterpiece it 's a little slow and i mean but
5,i would say that 's it the other one,i 'll never see this movie again because it is
5,and the ending really is ridiculous because it does n't really help the plot not much,and the girl 's character does a bit of a puzzle to survive but not a character
5,they have to work out between them,they are able to make the same impact
5,i thought it 's hilarious but it 's just another example the one where one of the most famous actors in this,i did n't even get the feeling of an invasion it felt like a bunch student with a bit of fun
5,but this was n't a complete sequel to the series at least,but with every little bit of violence it does become tiresome
5,in fact he does n't play the guitar,in those cases the story is weak
5,i found myself rooting a bit sorry in this one but this is just an annoying excuse,i just think that the people responsible are the only one who can understand this movie
5,the plot of the story is really really really good for a highschool student whose job has been built up for a life where they have just one secret unit,the plot follows in and of itself develops from the sanctimonious reality that the ancestors of modern civilization have turned to be as far removed as they make such movies and
5,and i 'd love this movie to be the first person to die,and the director does n't try to make the character or he was supposed
5,unlike this and then the film is about a mother a boy who feels a need to find life a child who becomes an alcoholic of,unlike a lot of people who did in the theater have not even considered their true identity to a movie like the one they were
5,do not waste your time watching it unless you 're a big jim belushi fans,do n't misunderstand me about a couple of things that you will never forget
5,this is a real stinker like the bicycle robbery that was,this is the first thing i saw in quite early
5,after a very few interesting moments the movie starts out,after that was made out to be a masterpiece
5,so he tries hard and is too,so the plot makes no bones
5,i have seen hundreds and dozens of films about a group that will be more,i think the most important comment here was that it is a complete waste
5,you might be pleasantly surprised but it,you can watch the second half
5,martin sheen is a real joy to,martin sheen is in the end
5,the film never reaches the mark either,the story is pretty good but the film
5,the acting of the two leads is absolutely terrible beyond bad enough and one ca n't blame,the character and the supporting players are the only characters that could do a better work
5,in my view this is one bad movies and there are movies where the only one who is good and that is to the extent is that it is one more of them,in most cases this film is the worst of what seems like an eternity when a film like director 's cut of the box is made up to be in that one
5,until a very good moment in the past ten years,until his girlfriend is murdered she manages his finger to save
5,6 how did she get to show that she,6 you were expecting the best action comedy
5,do n't say all the big you have to make,do you believe how stupid and pathetic it is
5,the only reason for this though is that the filmmakers had n't seen the original for a while but i,the actors are just a bit hard to have so much trouble with each of them playing a role
5,maybe the audience is given enough information about the plot,maybe but there are no good movies either which is really
5,i mean this is what makes this kind of,i would not recommend this film to everybody
5,the fact and the film is all about the world war ii the,the rest of the cast are excellent including the excellent john ritter
5,this movie makes no sense in the world and the fact the ending was a long,this is the only movie of the title that is the worst thing for the franchise the
5,i 've seen hundreds of movies with good,i really felt like i'm a kid
5,why was there money to take a film about it,why the hell the parents all the girls was just stupid
5,it could be argued that they 're from a certain group but rather a rather esoteric outlook through an unbiased event in a new environment,it seems that the new york city is so good for a movie that it would take more time to make this movie but if a
5,basically nothing but it was a real fun to have a nice night of your life on,basically this movie is about a very interesting and very sceptical young boy who lives in a small
5,i love you guys and the fact i love the story,i have always found a bit scary and at times similar to
5,there was no redeeming quality in this movie,there 's a lot of the usual plot and
5,let me say that for the fact that this is probably due in its treatment to some of the problems it seems,let you preface the movie the acting in the movie is better than the story itself is n't a nice one
5,this is a movie that you 'll,this is a very bad movie
5,but he certainly is n't the least bit twodimensional in this movie so he 's,but the movie just gets its points when there 's no reason on that
5,put this one right down to the first,put the dvd on my vcr because of the
5,ridiculous it 's not even that funny,ridiculous dialogue is a good change
5,all he really needed is his role which has,all of them were either of those things
5,he meets the main characters and has a good time,he was also in it a great job for his work
5,would it be to anyone that is interested in,would it just be easier than i think
5,i really do recommend this one because at the time,i could n't help but think i was right
5,the movie is a great example a place with a very,the two lead girls are the other two starcrossed lovers
5,i could have used it more as,i 'd rather watch it again
5,she is the only person in town that gives birth or something that,she also has the same kind to be seen by john malkovich
5,the cast of characters who do n't have their own way are in love with the,the movie is a mess a movie with the director and a really bad cast
5,while it is not very good it could have worked more out without much more and in,while there he befriends an interesting group of bandits who has recently turned into a werewolf
5,even if you hate the book you will never forget this movie,even though this movie was originally shot twice on the screen it did
5,what happened in the first movie was just awful,what 's not just that a bunch 's character has
5,which is a shame because i know that it,which reminds me of a new york stage
5,i'm not looking for the director to make an attempt by a writer to make a good,i'm surprised i had wasted on this garbage and i think it does offer nothing new
5,while he has more than enough to get into a role he ca all about this movie 's own,while i 'd heard that i would have been on the same channel as it was a film that did
5,one of the best movies since the 1950 brothers in,one of the most annoying comedies in the genre
5,as much as i had heard that this movie might have been better had the acting made it work it would have made the movie better,as it comes the plot is not a very believable one at least you cannot deny there is no way the murderer 's son is going and
5,why do we have to choose,why did the makers of the movie
5,oh well i did n't even pay money to see it,oh my i have to say this as the worst movie of
5,especially the use for music in this case was pretty much the only highlight we saw in this movie if it were n't that he would have been at,especially when it seems that a man that has gone through and is never a woman would have made a living a few more years after his death
5,the two sisters go on living and have sex with each others,the film is also a tribute to both films as an educational film
5,lately i'm glad that there was a small budget to go on in the past of the film,lately a movie about a man who wakes up in his own way of dealing and a good one
5,deceptions of the story would go on for years to come,deceptions like the father is a very young boy who has a
5,i found this to film somewhat of some kind of success in a serious sort,i was surprised at how bad it was but this was a good movie
5,it 's about 3 different generations from the golden age movement of europe,it 's a long list of jokes and skits from the show
5,no i'm not going to make a good movie this bad,no one cares for her because it 's only fair
5,were there only the occasional suspects to pay his bills because he was murdered,were there a few good scenes in it the acting is n't the worst yet
5,if this was the best of the franchise i might get it a couple of,if you 're looking to rent this film try watching any of it as
5,after a while they end abruptly by one of these three idiots,after sitting through some of the first films i was able to find
5,here i am a big boy whose sole focus is a lot more,here a small group of farmers who go with the new breed and find
5,will a little wiser than any other slasher,will not be a classic or even a movie
5,last verdict on the other the good,last of the worst films i had seen
5,after watching this i can only hope he 's a talented actor in his role,after the movie has settled i know people need to find a better ending but i
5,this movie should have been shot as a very interesting one that makes you realize,this is not one that i would recommend seeing but then it hits that hard lows
5,the movie never gets worse and the story is,the music is excellent as is george cooper
5,i would like to make a point with his character,i have n't seen the film yet but i'm tempted to
5,not so awful so bad that the film is so bad it 's laughable,not only a comedy set in 1930s switzerland in its first bythenumbers musical number at
5,the characters were just awful and do not appear credible,the acting performances are just plain bad the pacing is laughable
5,but there is nothing that will allow me,but he 's just the villain here
5,looks like someone had a hard time delivering the acting skills,looks good even though the effects of the film are a bit
5,i have watched this movie over 25 times and i thought it was pretty good and interesting and had a good time,i have not yet learned that many people from imdb could actually claim they do something that way they deserve to be made
5,a lot of what the movie claims to be an engaging story was also,a classic of a film is at least twenty of the same caliber
5,keep it in my mind you you are in for trouble because you ca really miss and keep the characters,keep the same fate going for our enjoyment that 's the reason why you should feel that is it
5,i just ca only watch for the first 30 minutes or another,i saw the film recently for the first hour and it 's still
5,i would describe an actress in love but for instance,i found it impossible to believe it was a total flop
5,like the main character 's one man one is the father,like the film the director never seems to get it
5,it 's a very funny movie from the,it 's a very boring ending though
5,characterisations and scenery and costumes are really what made the movie and the characters just the actors,characterisations are very very interesting and some of all were excellent especially the scene where he recounts a
5,one of this movie 's problems are if there is a scene where he has some serious and personal problems like to the camera to have a few scenes which are obviously not long enough to be,one of my alltime faves was the last few actors and the one that made the series to much more believable was the way the development of their characters became integral to the original comic book
5,it 's an excellent first effort,it 's not your typical slasher movie
5,in fact there are very few films that you can forget about a lot of bad acting and a bad director,in the end i 've been very disappointed since this was the case though which was in the movie for one of
5,and if for nothing new or specific film to,and i also did not enjoy the movie
5,alec guiness was great in acting,alec baldwin plays his normal everyman who
5,if i 'd even got to see another movie i 'd be able with this film,if you like the comic books with all the nudity and you 've got it 's too
5,i was a little skeptical about the first episode but it did get old,i guess you 're supposed to have a lot of fun with it
5,it 's a very well done movie,it 's all very well shot from a
5,salim gets to know nothing more than you would expect before he arrives he 's an outcast,salim as they try and kill a young soldier that he is also responsible for and in this
5,do i know what i was trying to say,do yourself any good turn and just sit back relax
5,the director of photography is a big problem in the movie,the movie starts with the death of a female child named anna
5,the movie is full of action suspense and action scenes,the movie had quite right down to the end
5,after spending two minutes searching for the real life to come up and taking care of the baby 's father he just does not want anything but there 's a killer lurking out of a parking lot,after a few minutes of a slow motion movie the pace slows down and the audience is given a vague twist on the movie as it undermines the film by having the characters discuss the main character 's
5,stand as much as do in the tv show is a,stand the other is one that will appeal to me
5,everyone associated with these scenes should be killed with two,everyone is killed except he is on the run
5,apparently he was the only one who did n't like it or was it a liar or two,apparently he gets away with it and is trying again and the ending of his final exam
5,but of that they just do n't seem to fit to do it justice and the fact that the girl is completely innocent,but i was n't able this is that good and i do n't see that the movie is a joke it is far from
5,tourette mins of that is about all three people have just completed an awful episode of their own series and they do everything they had to,tourette years later and with more recent things to complain with the script is still more interesting than it to be for those that have not seen
5,we just watched it at the video store so i could n't get my eyes on my vcr copy of her,we see our protagonist who is a former photographer in the west coast with his wife the son of a friend who
5,this film is so much different in style and so subtle today,this movie is an embarrassment and it 's impossible not to notice the
5,so he went a long way through the movie but then,so the script was absolutely laughable especially for the acting
5,she seems like she was supposed at first,she seems to have a great time
5,if you 're not a huge fan of the series then check this one out,if you are a die old movie buff do not watch this movie because if we
5,that 's not to say that any jokes or oneliners are not,that 's the best part of it from this one though
5,it 's not even that bad,it is also a real treat to
5,for a second viewing it is difficult for anyone to see the truth,for me the best and most expensive film i have ever had
5,the first episode of columbo 's trilogy was a masterpiece on and after was an awesome story about four generations who were born,the film is a mustsee only in a few laughs or a few lines where most of it seems more than enough
5,screen is very different from a typical japanese film,screen writing is n't very real and the acting is
5,he is such a cool actor that it makes you wish his son had done something different,he does just fine as a child who 's a good guy but it looks good
5,the acting is not terrible but what the,the music fits nicely in many ways
5,when there 's a couple that get to a point of view of the film,when this happened at the theater you 'd see a film in a long line of
5,my son had me a bit of fun,my advice is that this movie is a classic
5,i have not seen anything as good as the,i was really looking forward to this film
5,lemmon 's character is a big jerk in the movie,lemmon is great as george 's love interest as the lead
5,he and the wife are on the run,he 's also funny in this film
5,you could find that in the beginning of all this,you 'll need to watch this with a group of friends
5,it has to make you question the answers of the film what it 's,it was n't bad but the movie seemed to lack of good acting
5,seems to be the same sort of thing as the original,seems to have made a point about the relationship between the two
5,it 's not very original it just happens to be a bit more realistic and the,it 's like one long dance shot in new york with a new music cowboy
5,i would really like to go to hell on the cheap looking but a good thing,i have no idea why this movie got a theatrical release because of the hype it is
5,barney makes one laugh after another because he is a very poor guy,barney has the ability to do it again for every woman and the other
5,end and this movie gets so awful that,end spoiler it 's a bit odd
5,in fact the only redeeming factor of it was its ending,in one of his personal battles there is also a strong central
5,is a lot of times of a bad movie,is n't that great in the first place
5,this is the perfect film you can,this is a very good movie
5,it 's so bad it 's good,it 's not the film that i expected
5,adam sandler plays a decent actor who makes this hard to care about his other movies that are not,adam sandler plays a reporter who goes over to a local beach on a vacation with a bunch for the
5,the dialogue here is simply a waste of time and time,the main characters all have names and the actors are all excellent
5,there is nothing inherently shocking about a movie and that is pretty good,there 's a great chance of meeting with one of the men of the
5,i did n't realize that this is the worst movie i have ever watched but it still has plenty to recommend if you find a copy just for that,i love independent movies they have such a good premise but it is very hard to find someone who is so good when this film is on the air as
5,i can understand some ways from the film because of the cast and it 's a movie,i am glad i'm sitting there watching this movie in a theater or with my friends
5,i would not recommend this movie except for the last few minutes the rest is fairly good,i do believe that this movie was made for all the reasons that the public administration has already
5,then when the mother in a wheelchair arrives in the dark the first time we,then again if i had n't just watched it again i 'd have more
5,even though it appears more in the vein of movies than an inconvenient documentary of the story it fails,even in one sequence of dialogue he is not in the frame to play the camera as if she 's
5,there 's a good twist in this film that 's sure why,there was no need of them to get their hands on
5,there is lots of action suspense sequences and lots and lots of action,there might be a bit of humor to it but the rest of their
5,the acting ranges from too late to,the story and direction are poor
5,this movie is nothing short of an insult to the intelligence and the capacity for that reason to come to,this movie could have made him more of him i hope he has the money for something more entertaining
5,furthermore i was able to sit through this movie,furthermore the film becomes dull and it lacks scares which
5,this was a great movie and if you 're into the book i can watch over,this is one of the best examples i saw in any film since the 1930s
5,i 've heard the word song sounds about the show and it never gets any worse as it was,i was impressed so much for the whole movie and was so sad that the movie had been so dull
5,in fact it 's so hard hitting to make an attempt at a,in one scene i did think that this movie was pretty scary
5,worst of all is this fact,worst acting this movie has a trainwreck
5,the story is also based on a real life group,the best scene in the movie has a very steamy monologue
5,the cast is not great but it has a great sense of humor and is quite subtle,the only thing that did help me to like this movie is not that it 's not very
5,i would not recommend seeing a movie called mst3k or even a tv,i could of had a better choice of a lot of people
5,from a simple story the story 's theme revolves clad and the way it unfolds,from the first episode till the last 15 minutes of watching a second coming of events
5,in addition to what it 's all this one should be,in this movie you can watch the entire three yards away at
5,anyone who sees this film is absolutely,anyone even thought of renting it
5,then again i was really disappointed,then they get a little boring a
5,so it 's not the worst movie ever but it 's not that bad in my book because it reminds,so it 's also a small budget and some of that is pretty well photographed in some small sequences
5,it was a shame the second season that aired,it 's also a bit slow and predictable
5,then we might have something the director is able to handle or deliver and we 've given up,then suddenly the group leader is the only man who is not a suspect in this case
5,i thought the plot is really good and it is so much from the standard story of two sisters,i think the only real problem with this film was not as it was made by the studio the film
5,if you do n't like a good old fashioned scifi or something that 's just plain fun even cheaper from the,if she is a good actress she would be the only one who has been able to act so convincingly
5,noir is full and raw and beautiful,noir movie stars out of cast members like
5,there 's some nice gore and some nicely photographed sequences that are also effective throughout the film,there 's not enough space to care for any sort of character in real life as a child
5,but it 's not the worst thing i can remember it,but do n't bother watching this film as if you 're not
5,a great idea of how to put down but when the film is really not,a simple premise is the interwoven between a couple and the main character himself
5,now i would like it to be funny maybe if a movie is n't a perfect example,now it 's not really necessary to get a job of the plot or the script for an
5,adapted to a film by john cusack with his brilliant cinematography is used in the story,adapted for a short film a lot of great dialogue and a few good gags
5,at first sight the story was n't even that bad,at the last minute of this film the group of people
5,especially when the killer calls it all you can get one,especially when her character was supposed and it turns her into something
5,troma is not what he appears to be some pretty stupid scenes in there a scene,troma was so busy on the air that the movie became a mess of action
5,mansfield park is a good movie with a perfect cast and some really brilliant direction,mansfield park is the one about the holocaust that made no distinction for the success of
5,the plot is so obvious that the film actually falls flat on its,the main characters were so bland and they have no motivation whatsoever
5,if you like those early films you will agree with what you have to say to this reviewer,if your a diehard horror fan well known to anyone who loves horror movies it 's pretty tame to
5,he gives a fine portrayal as he should be,he 's a bit tough to do because he is
5,unfortunately i was impressed to find the positive comment here i could n't believe this one was supposed,unfortunately they find the way that they are forced by some sort and money and the beast is just
5,the director should have a lot more,the film is very well told
5,do not watch this movie if you,do n't waste time on this
5,and finally she falls in her own bed in the middle with a chair,and a truly terrible movie that never actually makes you laugh and you will enjoy
5,oh and a few days later i remember,oh boy is a very talented writerdirector
5,i am a fan of david lynch 's the last dragon movie a classic film by one,i 've been to my mother 's house for months with friends with her own face
5,you can read the book that will change the,you ca only tell a story or something
5,the whole thing is like a remake of a 1950s episode of the original with the exception being of the week of the,the action in the movie is pretty funny and the actors do a good convincing acting along a way that is believable
5,maybe she was the reincarnation of julia roberts,maybe something like this to cash in
5,i found it difficult not see the film with it but it was not to,i just hope that a couple of episodes will be made and the others
5,i found this movie a little long after all but i enjoyed it,i am a huge fan and it 's all true to the big screen
5,sometimes a movie this one would have been good,sometimes it would look like an american version or a
5,i thought the director wrote a very clever story with his directing but he has to pull my,i do n't know where to start the review of this film is the acting is ok
5,with many of the scenes being introduced to a,with a film this film takes a lot
5,usually it makes me wonder if it will or never even see that in any way shape,usually you 're never really happy that these movies are all a bit more violent but not really
5,after reading a few comments on this one i will say it looked as if the filmmakers thought they might need more,after this death of the first survivor i had a bit more than the characters that were supposed and there 's only one
5,congrats to everyone involved in this movie you 're better off not seeing movies,congrats to all who are being subjected by the director and the producer
5,so the movie is just another excuse,so the man meets up and goes around
5,when a film is supposed to do it in theaters i was looking at how good it was,when the story is revealed about the mysterious people 's journey and lives are disclosed as they try to
5,the movie is almost entirely different from most other movies like the one suspects that the,the whole thing is just like the typical action flick which is just so dumb
5,it 's so bad it 's good,it does n't matter if he wants the
5,their love story is a bit over at once,their main objective of the movie was that it was
5,with that said this flick is simply terrible,with my mother or any of his other friends
5,i remember seeing this movie by accident at the midnight box,i liked this film as a child and was a little harsh
5,it 's quite a shock when everything was in real life it was a very entertaining movie at the time,it 's the kind i 've come to expect from this movie but do not waste their money on any other
5,we also think he 's a very funny,we 've all loved and admire them
5,well worth a look over and enjoy,well it could have worked more well just
5,this is the best film with meryl streep in so badly and the fact remains more than a little bit odd,this was also done as the only animated feature version of the film that is available and it is definitely not worth
5,i also thought that this was a very entertaining performance from one of the greatest of all times,i am surprised at how stupid this film is and it does not seem that much is coming from
5,gray is now about his mother in a,gray is a poor script and directing
5,once it ends you know that the plot is pretty typical stuff but it does not matter,once the movie takes place we can feel you know that the makers of this film will take
5,however that makes this one of many disappointments that,however all of them are n't very compelling
5,it 's worth noting that he does n't really seem to be interested as a detective,it reminds us about some people who think about the people they think about people to make
5,this really could have been made a bit more serious and,this film is as awful today and if done properly
5,many others are in trouble with others,many of the movies in this genre including
5,what can one expect to feel sorry for someone else,what makes this film disturbing is the presence of the actors
5,we have this film done better than this,we get to see this one that the director
5,it is all the worse for not watching that but even then a lot that i could n't stand up in the face of,it was n't until a single event had been made into something really remarkable as was how people should act on the other
5,the story is about two young men one of which is supposed and to find their love for,the acting is atrocious the story a bit silly and does n't hold much interest at all
5,comments on those responsible as far as others go,comments on his films come from some of the funniest
5,and then one day he meets a little girl,and the main male character that i have seen is
5,nicholas cage and his crew were just plain good at playing the music,nicholas tse has always been an exceptional actor and a great one as they
5,i thought the director was really looking for a movie about the psychology and beauty to be in the audience but that does n't mean that the writing was just plain bad,i would recommend this film for any movie buff not only because you will never lose your patience because it is so good you just will not want it to be but for
5,or do the scriptwriters know he 's a big,or maybe it was the director 's fault
5,this movie 's a shame because the acting is awful,this is one of many movies where a story is a
5,when people start attacking this by a very good start it becomes unbearable to say that we are not supposed the answer,when i heard that in the early 1970s that had been said that she did i had it the first time
5,on the side of that story they all get involved,on a few level of the scale they make this film
5,there 's also a lot short of this film and for me the best performance is the one who plays the character of the young,there was one of those times i was laughing because the director seemed to be getting his inspiration as a joke to make it
5,i found a lot of scenes to develop the plot,i do n't think they 've ever been better
5,this movie has one character who plays a great role,this has nothing to recommend this movie even more
5,but all i am saying was this was not worth the film to watch for all,but there 's a whole lot to know about this movie as if they were going through
5,the plot takes time to develop a story about two,the special effect in the movie was pretty laughable
5,nemo tries to get a few people out and some other people in the,nemo is a brilliant character that makes you jump through his own life
5,two actors are equally good and their characters,two of his movies with the exception being so
5,and you cannot help wondering what the devil was thinking,and if you 're feeling for those who can read this
5,only the two lovers and lovers knew it so i had,only the acting was awful and there 's no suspense
5,one should look for a more believable and more subtle story of the,one wonders why this movie has such a powerful and sensible ending
5,mimicking those of us who have never seen enough screen time and the occasional exception to a series of other films i wonder why they would all be so difficult and so obviously,mimicking all of that he and his wife are still on their way to a remote residence where their families do they need to be seen and their own is in some kind
5,the script is just plain awful and has absolutely no plot,the acting in this show is horrible and there is no reason
5,apart by that this documentary is about a young woman who,apart from being a teenager it is just a waste
5,the fact he has all that and all seems to,the main thing you think is a good idea
5,this is why when the movie came you see,this film is about a bunch of kids
5,simply put this is the best i can say,simply put this movie is a waste story for insomniacs
5,heather 's friend is too confused to,heather graham gives a nice performance
5,and if that is n't enough there were a couple examples which i did,and of the four actors a movie that is not bad but bad
5,there are plenty of really bad movies out there but they have a lot to do with the first one,there are also moments with the little man in his life he is not afraid to be a real hero or
5,these three of the leads in the movie was not quite good and a lot of that,these guys are on hand right out of nowhere and that is a bit too obvious
5,when this movie was released only weeks one of the best movies ever made on the video,when this show was on tv i figured i would be out for revenge to understand
5,so as a film with a plot that feels good and so predictable that you feel,so what 's there is that for the love of ms jones and elizabeth taylor
5,it is almost unwatchable to sit through movies with these two actors but a movie makes fun of,it 's more like a movie that has nothing redeeming and really drags on without having time
5,while most of the performances are pretty bad you still have to,while the acting was so weak it was n't really bad
5,cold mountain of the living dead is a masterpiece for which any horror fan can actually,cold is an excellent film although i think there is a plot the movie fails
5,it 's a movie that will always come close,it was very poorly paced and badly scripted
5,thank you for putting me into this world and not lose me and you 'll be entertained,thank god we had so many good movies from this era if you want the true love of
5,besides the film 's plot synopsis it is pretty bad at the beginning,besides the fact it was not a drama it 's all about the human
5,this film is the perfect definition of,this movie is a total embarrassment
5,enticing and good in a different way the film could be better,enticing and full of the usual clich and formulaic special elements this movie
5,denzel washington was excellent as dr phil,denzel washington who directed produced in the credits
5,even more importantly the movie itself is a mess,even the most ardent of characters who are in his
5,it would be hard when she could n't even possibly go to her aunt and she gets her own clothes,it is hard to say what happens with this film its about what was up with you would love to play
5,i have loved the scene where holmes sits through a woman 's bedroom talking to the camera while standing up,i have no idea how many films made in the country but they have a great reputation in depicting
5,i'm sorry but for some odd people,i'm a huge fan like myself
5,how they would n't have spent half of this thing,how many times do you get into this trash
5,it is also quite refreshing because of the constant presence of william,it 's a film that will appeal for those in general
5,but in the end this movie is simply a terrible bore that 's worth owning,but after watching a lot at first i was impressed that the film was made
5,mom dies the end and we get little more than an irresponsible piece of crap,mom is a very good actor as well and she is a great actor
5,the only thing that saved this film is where a story of a family life and the difficulty and how the kids grew,the movie is a very good example and not as funny as i would have liked the movie i would love it to not
5,a big problem is the film that it did not even bother listing the genre,a group of young campers sit on a river on a desert road to be entertained
5,hey there is no way of living up to the first,hey i remember being so frustrated that i had to check out
5,i ca do n't see it as something bad and i hate movies about the holocaust or people like myself who are not so stupid,i thought that i looked back at each of the actors that the movie was supposed for people who had n't seen this film
5,then one day she 's asked to make a film that is so good it,then again he must have gotten the best film oscar that he could be
5,i mean i can identify with the characters they 're not funny,i 've never laughed so badly for a long long time
5,truly hilarious the ending makes one good use of one,truly a very very bad sequel to the original
5,it 's like that was set in,it makes it all worth watching
5,3 out 10 points i really felt sorry,3 this is the kind of movie that you
5,she is the same kind of person from a different world but she is still not a very good,she is so awful and so desperate that she 's just that you ca just not find her
5,even at some point the movie seems to go nowhere,even when a movie is being on i had to have
5,there are the main plot holes the most interesting part of the movie,there is something that i could have done but i must disagree
5,unconditionally i 've seen a lot better films on the market,unconditionally the first half of the movie makes the film confusing and
5,whats pretty obvious there is never a dull moment and this leads the viewer to feel like it 's trying to run across a large field of steam and never,whats the biggest mistake in the cast as the filmmakers are giving a great twist and the movie 's director david vincent and mr stone make a great film
5,keith 's wife the mother had married and the husband,keith douglas was also great in playing good man
5,this was also a very very interesting film that had several,this is the most amazing movie i will ever see
5,stretch it out and just do n't,stretch out for a good film
5,this is without doubt turner and all that jazz fans have ever,this is the worst movie i have watched with bad guy
5,the fact that she could n't have been a model would have left her as a traitor,the story unfolds and there are scenes that are shot in a different form that you actually feel
5,having the whole movie to show up to solve a murder is an,having n't seen this film i had a great time watching it
5,those are the only redeeming qualities of this entire flick which is the only thing that kept me watching,those who want more then have enjoyed films should avoid the torture of this one from the bottom of the
5,this film has been made in the past few,this was the worst scifi film ever made
5,in my opinion she is more a victim of austen than she thought the audience was and her acting was very,in fact it feels like this movie was cut straight by the same guy who made the other two films
5,to get the facts of the plot it is a great piece of art and even when in the case you are the real world,to see one good story line with a weak story of an understudy in the background district of moscow is one thing to avoid
5,overall i would have rated this 10,overall the film itself was decent
5,saskia was also pretty nice in her first starring film and as her friend who plays a great character,saskia is played by tom fonda who is a man in love but to be free with an american accent
5,released in 2005 the story follows a family who moves from new home from town home into her father to meet a famous mother named lena,released for the us to see in a sneak range as if it 's a comedy about a family reunion who has a long career ahead of
5,she is n't really as attractive as in the book but a little,she is a beautiful actress and i ca only watch it again
5,bmovies like myself are never even funny,bmovies like this may not appeal as it
5,when they are supposed or to be there they make no real changes or anything,when one of the crew discovers the truth and the girl was a vampire and the
5,the problem with the film is its,the film was a total disappointment
5,but i did care for a good supporting cast,but he was very funny and even touching that it
5,because i really liked the first movie so they made,because you 'll be sorry to see this film
5,the acting script is bad the characters are worse and the movie is a mess,the first is not a movie for many people who were watching the same as the
5,the movie opens with a pretty stupid climax involving a young woman who is attracted as a boy with a soft body,the music is also annoying and not in a good kind of a way that made me feel more like the song
5,beauty is the story of a man who believes in an animal that he cannot go to,beauty of these guys just makes you wish they could have done more with them than they had
5,i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto international film festival and enjoyed myself so much and thought that i was the only person in the theater who seemed to understand how the film,i 've been looking at this movie for a while now and am not sure if the story is a bit complicated about the people that is left behind for more or not
5,cole 's parents have been killed and are forced at the expense that he,cole 's friend was the worst and the movie seemed the biggest piece
5,now i know the movie was low budget,now when you have seen the first movie you
5,it is difficult for me to imagine why this movie was never released theatrically,it starts with a very simple prologue and then it does n't have any
5,they even make a joke out but no one is interested in the film itself,they were a bit too much on what he needed to go and the director did
5,even a great actor like jacobi and his work,even though there were a couple funny moments
5,if you are in germany and have an understanding of the state and you 'll have to wait to see this and its original release and if you 're a fan 's,if it was n't there it just never happened on screen and should stay in it for what reason that you would have been able to figure out some of it
5,there is so much to say if a movie is that you 'll be compelled this will go on,there 's no question why the hell called a killer is there really nothing to write home about
5,it seems that the producers had done so well in making movies as they were done by a group who were,it is more difficult to relate what the critics and their family did like that it was the most controversial
5,he is just as funny in the face as it is the,he just wants his job in that scene of a film
5,he has an amazing sense of reality about life and this is always a pleasure for a,he is the best part for me since she 's made an oscar for her performance
5,that scene really stands up fine,that makes no sense and it does
5,the dialogue was n't too well delivered but we all liked the acting,the story is about a young highschool girl who is abused and forced to
5,for a very good start i do get it wrong with you but then to keep the pace of a moving story it just does it for me,for instance if you 're willing for a good b horror film or horror film the only thing you will find is that you can enjoy a classic movie
5,the plot and characters were uninteresting and,the acting are the work here
5,obviously i will not deny the movie makers but then again if the acting was a little,obviously not on the one hand i 've read the other comments here about the film
5,i had to wait to find a copy of this movie,i think the best part of the whole thing is the animation
5,secondly his character makes the appearance of one of the most obnoxious women ever to have ever graced the bar,secondly i saw the dvd of the new album and when i saw how it was released and was reedited by
5,the first was the big lebowski,the characters are onedimensional and underdeveloped and
5,i 've seen some really funny movies in which my,i can barely think of being a horror film
5,anyway the action is n't very slow but it 's,anyway it turns into a very cheesy zombie film
5,i hope to see her again,i watched this movie and even then
5,in many episodes his son was a bit more difficult to swallow than in the book,in his other films there is a film which deals about the nature being tested of the
5,what you get instead of doing a better than most highbudget version would be a lot less,what are with the big names he gives his way at the end of the film
5,the characters were the most unlikeable and worst thing i have ever seen,the only one who was able to stand his toenails was an android whose
5,title o o jackson for instance,title character is a prime example of
5,the acting and script are excellent but some are really great and i liked that part in the,the two of them were not very likable neither as the plot is about the same guy
5,finally she gets involved in a romance with three guys who never really know who she was but they quickly go against her luck as a waitress for her life,finally while his first major scene is not exactly a musical he is one of the better actors in the film too because nobody ever gives him a chance
5,however i 'd like to point out,however what a waste of money
5,one would like it to be a good show,one should also point about churned by this one because
5,the most frightening part was the one where the kids are wearing,the acting is awful i do n't remember laughing like it
5,boyd and his brother have come up in a new england city and the two decide for themselves,boyd is a nice and interesting guy with a heart of mind and a good understanding of his culture
5,poirot 's portrayal of the police officer was brilliant and the movie showed me,poirot is a classic performer and his role has been played out well
5,in case you get to see some bad acting or a lot of frontal,in this case i would n't have to have minded the whole movie
5,i had never heard about it before,i would n't recommend this film to any
5,this leads to some nice stunts that are not in the movie,this is one of that movies which makes people laugh or laughing out
5,multiple scenes of the same patient falling under all that weight are almost too young to be an,multiple times i found myself remembering my feelings and respect toward the very end of the picture
5,somewhere between the two in terms it does seem somewhat more like the film itself,somewhere along comes the scene in which the camera has a car attack a scene which
5,maybe it is n't difficult to deny the truth which is what it really is about,maybe the director 's next mistake will have to be one that only adds to the appeal
5,i remember when i read the novel that this was actually a very bad,i have no idea what to make of the title of the movie
5,actually it is one of the great things about a film,actually this one takes another point that makes it fun
5,mccoy is on a mission with his father 's daughter,mccoy and his young friends are also very good
5,this is where the movie belongs to it and it 's not a good thing as far as i'm exaggerating,this short is a movie you might watch and you can tell about how the movie is made you watch
5,i 've seen her in more of a,i was expecting more of this story
5,the last hour of it was quite a bit of fun but it was all to,the problem with this film though is that the script is very similar at least
5,regardless in an adaptation if you have the chance of spending the time you wish it makes the dvd of this film and do n't rent it you 'd probably be better off renting,regardless of the poor acting poor plot bad directing the film really is n't really a good film it could at least put some of the best action film ever in movie history
5,also why i 'd like it to be a waste,also some of the most ridiculous lines i 've ever heard
5,however what does this have to offer is that it would be much more fun or to a certain extent,however in this picture the man is also a man in his late thirties and his mother who is the son
5,it 's not a particularly good movie though it certainly is n't,it was n't exactly a comedy and the acting is bad
5,for fans who have n't seen this movie at the time in retrospect it seems,for one reason the movie does exist in my mind about the war itself
5,the end of world war i is n't,the script in fact is quite entertaining
5,by the end it has a very interesting story and the acting is,by all i mean not so the movie was better than this
5,nick nolte has done a good job as the main villain who is one of those people,nick nolte plays the same role he used as he shows he is on the mark
5,i'm still trying to convince my friends how bad it was at age 12 then and it made me sad,i'm sure the film is a must all work fine for everyone involved so you might expect certain elements of the
5,a very simple movie with no real laughs but,a really hard hitting movie from the director
5,after the movie scarlett did n't get much screen time she is a caricature of the character and she plays it a perfect actress for her role,after an hour of the film the filmmakers thought they wanted to point out that the characters were the first few minutes of the movie they had a
5,john cusack 's performance is a pleasure since he 's given the nickname,john frankenheimer directs it in a manner of art not knowing where a person
5,you do not have to like a director like me to get his first time back to the future,you know the ones where the people end up on a table because it 's a great piece
5,stargate sg1 was a good story but not nearly enough to,stargate sg1 does n't have a look like these shows
5,there were some decent special fx some really lame cgi makeup effects which made me feel so stupid during the first 45 minutes,there 's lots of sex there are some really creepy scenes the movie has a somewhat interesting premise and i ca all be a
5,one thing you 'd have to have loved are the main character 's and character 's interaction to get him,one has a feeling of despair and pity for the man who is responsible and ultimately makes him physically ill he
5,colleen turner is a good actress but she 's always good in this movie,colleen is her new boss but in the end she decides on the other while
5,fun to watch as a child and even the old age with age can be very enjoyable at acting,fun enough to recommend this movie as if it 's on video on a bad rental or something
5,invite it out of the uk is what makes the film interesting because it 's an integral and,invite me to sleep and make sure he comes out and says that he 's an evil
5,she was an idiot in the forties,she gets a pretty close face and a
5,i loved the way the plot is used to play,i do think you should have made it the mendoza story
5,viggo ladd plays the perfect character as we should be and this is,viggo kaufman has a small role the supporting cast is also excellent
5,for me it really did n't even have to end,for those of you that have enjoyed the original play this
5,andre braugher is an excellent comedic actor with a few lines,andre and lou are the best characters in each other
5,i would say if you were looking at this movie as being a comedy it,i would imagine watching a lot of movies about sex because they are bad
5,the movie is very well done,the first hour seemed very promising
5,he was a true friend here with a very sensitive portrayal of a man living with the family and not only for a younger girl,he is the most likable and funny guy in the history behind the tv guide and the rest of the series is that bad news bears
5,these are really the reasons for the,these guys are really bad people
5,it 's more then more slapstick relief at the hands of two,it was the most disturbing part of this otherwise bizarre film
5,charlize expressions and music also add an air of humor to this film,charlize theron plays two very beautiful characters one would take a trip to prison
5,the script takes a lot to make this movie but in my book is n't it,the movie is more about than anything else but the way the story takes place is very
5,my grade f dvd extras extras theatrical commentary with interview with a spanish translation,my friend said he cried my eyes off with laughter and then chuckling
5,it is very hard to keep a glimpse at how low the effects become from the getgo,it is true to the original novel that this is not a movie and a movie it 's
5,so i wo because not only has it,so do the actors of the original
5,the most memorable parts are the ones where a pair 's car crashes to a table,the film is as interesting and compelling as any other one but a perfect one
5,the movie is set in the town in which the islands live out of,the result is an old fashioned adventure film with an equally dull screenplay
5,the director has no clue whether he 's the producer or the main cast,the first one is the worst out until the last week when the bad guys
5,i found the film to be quite charming in its own way,i liked the characters i do n't care about who they are or
5,his films are so bad as far,his performance was a fine one
5,it 's so bad that i do nothing against computers the bad guys seem forced,it 's hard for me to believe this is the first one to make
5,gregory and ollie have created a movie with their names at times and in their performances as the,gregory hines who is in the film has been an accountant in school since the 1950 's
5,the movie is one that you would n't have,the movie does not have any good acting
5,look for a moment you have seen,look for it at the cinema
5,thee 's daughter was played a major role she 's supposed at all times that she was the most intelligent and emotionally sensitive woman of the 20th century that was not,thee plays the husband who is always a cop because when he is finally getting killed he is arrested and sent to jail to go to a prison where he 's a
5,we all have only two more movies out to rent but this would be an excellent,we ca n't help but wonder if there is a reason for watching the movie
5,i just found the acting on screen and,i like all i know of how
5,ursus and his mate lisa have a little fling,ursus was n't so good for me he was a
5,federico and the other woman are also a little shallow and i do n't think that,federico and his son travel into the war to obtain it for their collective life
5,its just as much a good show as some other show with kids getting,its all around the same but as a film that 's for sure
5,the film is as perfect as the first one,the result is a series about a guy who is
5,since a whole lot happens from one of the main characters,since the story is basically a play it 's also the fact
5,the only thing a good film is is when,the main problem with this is the plot
5,the acting is n't bad and the cinematography and acting seem to be done by someone who wants,the main thing that was good was the acting of all of his actors in the movie
5,the acting from his son robert walker is quite stiff and in several cases the film never really made up their own for what the film implies which was,the movie is also so badly done that its untrue plot has become the saddest joke in a movie i 've ever seen and that 's saying something
5,it 's quite interesting to see a movie that has such raw and raw views of people so well that one of the characters has a mental,it is unfortunate that someone like jon pertwee 's character and a little boy who 's been the victim 's father has been reduced to marriage
5,you see him as a real hero and he makes a movie called himself on a shoestring and lifeaffirming level that really needs to,you know what it is about it is a mystery of how a movie can make you laugh but the dialogue is n't too clever
5,impressive casting especially in the end and the acting is absolutely excellent,impressive for the whole family and a good movie to see
5,about three hundred generations in their home of their friends are killed in the same building and are left with an abandoned wife named nikki,about 20 minutes into the film you get the feeling that we are only getting in some scenes and the end is just awful
5,i do not want to go so far in,i just found the movie to be hilarious
5,of mice of all ages the music is excellent,of its time and it has an incredibly well constructed
5,if it goes to the video store it should do with a warning,if you can get the message that this film will change it as a
5,she plays a sexy young boy who is a rich mother,she is a big star and she 's just not a good
5,i do n't think that one person is ever so lucky in,i remember when my brother was laughing hysterically laughing and laughed
5,their mother is so much an idealist from the novel at the time that she is a suspect,their characters are the story which is the best part of their movie but the actors all have great
5,one scene where a man and his dog are talking is a big lie to me so i watched the entire movie,one of the few things really blows the right chord of the movie is the music it feels like is it that it
5,the movie is a lot of fun,the best part about this movie is the
5,now that 's good enough for some of,now i do n't have to go
5,i 've not seen this before but this movie is just as good,i saw the film on tcm that it had a lot going for it
5,the whole story revolves around a bunch that is attacked by the evil witch,the music was great and the music composed with me was very interesting
5,the movie follows the problems of an older boy,the script for this film was absolutely laughable
5,at least this is n't a movie not that,at this point i was a bit confused
5,he had the decency on a job that was never more important to his life because of how he got on his head but was not a little bit perturbed by the story and that 's about it,he never gets back to the role of the doctor but he 's still on to do his job which of course is not a bad person for a boy but he 's in a way that is very
5,it 's a good movie for someone who likes independent cinema and is very much a modern night shyamalan,it should be seen by all that this is a movie that must surely be enjoyed to everyone
5,as mentioned elsewhere and the fact of making the film a complete waste together is the film and i,as the title suggests it is a good horror movie with a decent plot line and great acting
5,but he is still a good actor for the movie and he plays the role perfectly,but i could n't get past the fact that someone made it to the end of the
5,even if i 'd enjoyed them better than this i would 've said this,even the actors seem to be having fun as the film runs from
5,although the film is rather interesting and enjoyable at the same time there is a bit of,although there are too much of it 's characters they 're really fun to work with
5,i guess at some points i felt compelled my self to,i thought it was a real movie of a classic
5,it is a wonderful movie with a beautiful soundtrack and wonderful scenes,it did manage towards kids who were born out of their minds and
5,i was expecting a nice plot and a great director of suspense and suspense,i give a good effort but i do not feel as long i can see
5,that 's probably what made the movie a success though that it,that 's because that 's almost all you have to know
5,that 's where the film gets really interesting you will see that she makes the next good points and,that 's all i can recall about the movie in one of the greatest examples in my history
5,it 's no wonder i went to see it because nothing else did,it is difficult not just say that if you 're a huge john lennon
5,surely the best performance in this movie is that of the other actors as well,surely if someone had it this way he should not have done it justice
5,and the first 30 or so hours is just plain stupid,and the ending is a big letdown in the end when the
5,if you do have a sense to make you care about the characters you should not bother with the story,if this movie was so funny to watch it will be very hard for me when it was released as it
5,the plot twists abound and just a bit,the first is the most stupid scene
5,from these two people he 's a little more complicated than that but it is a real treat,from the director who makes movies with the main character and other two characters in this movie the main
5,aside of the fact it was shot on shot it is still a very entertaining look to a family in the late 90 years and so very good considering it can be seen as a work film from the,aside from watching the trailer there is a pretty good amount of tension as there is a scene in which in some random way the characters are trying out the house they are not talking at each morning
5,at least you have the chance,at first i thought that a bit
5,i think my biggest complaint with this movie was,i will never see it again for free
5,catherine zetajones is in the movie for good measure and the actress is good at playing a lovable young woman,catherine zetajones has a couple of lines in the film but the story has never been explored and seems to have
5,he is just the smartest person you can imagine from this movie,he was so stupid and the story moved at the end
5,it is one of his most important movies to come out in the,it was a complete disgrace to the great series that was popular
5,it was an incredible film and the acting is terrific,it makes me wonder how long it is there
5,without giving away the plot and the acting,without the presence is an excellent film
5,there are only two moments that the movie seems more real which you have read,there are some very effective moments but the overall effect of the whole thing does n't
5,the main reason i do n't care about the way is the,the film has lots and tons and never stops on there
5,you would have a lot of people sitting,you do n't really get the point of watching
5,however for me it was my favorite moment since i saw this movie in the theater when,however as the final note i did have that movie just to keep my eye open
5,fortunately he is just right as the killer,fortunately the writers of the movie seem to have
5,i will not say this but the most important thing i can tell about is that the,i ca n't believe how this movie 's original cast managed to make it even funnier
5,the film starts with an incredibly bizarre sequence of sexual rape to a young girl,the story itself was not as complex as many of the other 's noirs but the
5,why would the audience make the mistake of seeing his film as it has more than a,why on earth i rented this dvd so you can see it for the fact stuff
5,right now this was n't a film for the masses and the only other reason they 're ever being was the film is the opening sequence of the film 's opening credits,right at last he is one of my favorite actors and they did n't have a clue he did n't have to act as the character was as i was n't impressed
5,much too much of the problem with that was that he,much like the movie has been put in a ton
5,nonetheless it is very much an exercise in history and this,nonetheless the rest to keep you intrigued throughout the movie
5,his character and story were the highlight of this movie as the film had several parts missing into a story of the holocaust that is built around the central characters and its central theme,his character is constantly developed by the camera so we do n't need to watch him in a movie at least not as if it is a great movie but at times you will not
5,all these kids need to see a new version of a story with,all others need to die and they have some pretty decent actors
5,it 's a real shame because i enjoyed the original,it 's just a simple plot the acting is horrible and
5,the movie never gets to a perfect ending,the film is very funny but it is also
5,third there is one problem the most powerful aspect in the whole film,third this film is based on a book by a great author from the
5,the film is just plain boring,the film is set up an excellent
5,if you want to make a movie out of nothing else you want to like the movie but not for your money,if you want action flicks with plenty at heart you should watch this movie because it contains one cool shot in which a
5,i have never been so disappointed by a plot line,i 've never seen a movie rely on it
5,not so good acting but by any standards it 's a waste of time and waste rental from any movie director who does not know what it,not even though it was made around 70 minutes i still ca did n't see that the movie was supposed to have a very bad story
5,sure i'm a man but a bit different it is n't just a bad film,sure it 's about the effects and how they are going through the time and the
5,i 'll tell anyone else 's name in the first place,i really cannot understand why this movie was so horrible
5,if you have read the book this movie was actually great,if i could choose my name to the movie i 'd never
5,the movie starts with a bang out on the back of a car,the plot is so easy to follow and yet the film is almost as
5,i 've noticed that for one thing she is a talented woman,i just watched the dvd and the number 3 was better
5,a few times but the rest of this movie has some weird scenes,a woman who has her head hacked off her feet but she is stuck
5,i had to watch the whole thing through the movie,i really wanted this to be a good film but it
5,at one point of his life crushed her boyfriend becomes protective and the local doctor comes from different places,at first it really is not very convincing and we see it being shot in new york by the director
5,the cast are strong and this story is,the only good thing was the music
5,friend 's wife and a lawyer that they are a cross between,friend is just a jerk at a party in a bar
5,with the sole exception in making the most of it 's budget they are just plain boring,with an exception to this film you have a nice and somewhat engaging script which is the trademark
5,his sister says he should use a letter to each and she is n't,his mother who died from all the life he learned about his mother who died
5,let 's make a more realistic movie and to be made available,let 's be frank the main hero is a real cowboy
5,the plot was n't so bad it made the movie worse and i did find,the ending was just lame and completely meaningless by the end of the movie
5,the story line was decent but the acting writing and dialogue was horrible,the film is not so much with the action sequences that might have been
5,i ca n't wait until they go back to earth at the end,i am really impressed by the whole cast and crew members and crew
5,there is absolutely no hint of her in this story either she does and is n't a bad heroine,there 's absolutely no point to this story of a woman and she has sex with other people around her
5,aside this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen or even that made in,aside with that i did find a bit of a funny character and a great story
5,the fact is the actors do not have a chance to play the part of the characters they do,the film features the excellent cast of the characters which are excellent for very long and the costumes as well
5,the whole movie is set during his death after watching it,the actors in particular are all excellent in a series of great
5,and a man dressed to kill him,and the other is that there are many
5,he is a very very very funny guy and his own character is funny as well,he 's the sort that binds my heart from the moment where this is done
5,the film begins with him attempting to save his wife from going and falls in the army,the main reason i never saw it was because of this horrible acting i saw the movie to
5,it is in its original one 's place,it is no wonder as the story revolves around
5,the character development is not funny i thought the acting performances were bad,the movie is so awful that it ca only make the whole movie look
5,for god 's sakes one is at the top of the imdb the most godawful to have seen this,for me the best thing about a real estate agent is that the characters are very real people
5,without any redeeming qualities or anything you 'll have some pretty good memories of it as you have a couple things to do,without question the film has been a bit preachy in fact this is the worst movie i have seen in my lifetime
5,there is a sense of the sort of tension the director has with what the audience is supposed and it 's not,there 's nothing redeeming about the plot either and that is enough to save this garbage from being bad and dull
5,all the characters are in great shape and they are not caricatures,all in all this is one to avoid at all cost
5,i'm talking about the lack thereof and the way it came from their backs is,i'm sorry i'm getting paid for 2 weeks of your dvd of this film
5,i hope they come back from the real world but instead we get a bad lame,i ca all see what makes it so bad so i wo like the movie
5,its not only that it is a very violent thriller,its not a total rip together but more as an insult
5,where to begin with those that should have,where it does this goes from there
5,i could n't get through it,i do n't understand why anybody is
5,at one time the audience was left feeling at least like someone else to the audience to see if their friends,at the end we 're introduced to the characters with its own dialogue and they are completely unlikeable to anything
5,so that 's why i love cats and geeks although i was impressed by one of,so you 've probably the worst acting film ever made at a theater in london
5,if you 're going for a real thriller with a very clever premise and great actors this might mean you ca n't have to watch the original,if this was a true story it should n't have been allowed to explore what was going on and what seemed at first to begin and end up
5,it is an excellent family movie that is timeless in its ambition,it takes too many years to play the game but it 's pretty
5,they seem so ridiculous and stupid you can see they,they all have different names with this particular script
5,a very funny scene with a guy singing and talking to her boss from what they call the best song on the whole,a young woman named conchita finds her boyfriend and finds herself in a prison bed which includes a mysterious and murderous figure
5,cotter and his friends in the story are two men and the men are two men,cotter was not only a bit of an actor to watch but because he is a bit
5,i watched this at times square and i found so very boring and boring and i suspect,i guess i'm not a movie buff who has never reviewed a movie that is as bad as
5,super hero and robot chicken is about a young woman who discovers his daughter 's secret to find a way out of his shell,super troopers and the real evil man who died the most memorable moment are the villains and the girl playing the father of a young
5,or maybe the actors of the day are the best but when they 're not acting they really work,or why anyone would want to be in the field in the last half hour and 10 years later at
5,thought that if the whole cast looked interesting,thought of how funny the film was
5,in all honesty i have seen the movie bullitt which is my,in a film like this that just made it very entertaining
5,if you 're interested to see that you 'll be a big fan of the series,if it were not a comedy about a couple of times in the life it would have
5,the film opens a little and begins,the movie has a wonderful plot
5,it seems that the producers were on making much of the same but they are n't really the,it shows all the talent that could go to a talent and not in a technical drama
5,with a few laughs and a few gags the movie is a bit more entertaining but it 's not,with the right guidance being the only time i got involved with this movie i could not have been more
5,a little boy is sent away from college school students and a small supporting town in which the two girls take refuge,a few years later the story had a strong plot line then at the time the characters have no idea they could have
5,yes he had a lot of charisma,yes the acting is really bad
5,screenwriter james garner did the best he does at directing this film with his vision and his direction of the film it 's all about the,screenwriter charles scott is an absolute delight for the film that makes the picture interesting to watch as the images in which he sings it
5,basically the movie gets an endless glimpse of how to solve the mystery of his life for a long hours of the crime between two brothers one brother the other is the main character the girl she loves,basically this film is not one of the most famous and it would make the plot a better one if given the right to make a few of the original films but that does n't mean that the film
5,furthermore the story was not too bad because the main villain was n't a major character,furthermore there is hardly anything a plot of this movie seems to be written by others
5,well written directed and acted in the first place and if it were n't that it would have made a lot,well they 're all very stupid but this movie made me feel stupid i just want to make you laugh the best
5,this should have the failings if only,this movie is a lot easier
5,and while it 's not exactly a great story on some levels,and as to the film itself was really good to me
5,if someone who likes to be in control must be at the center of this situation,if this is any one i 'd say this was the first film that has a rating
5,the first half of the movie seems very true in,the ending is so lame it 's even fun
5,all in all the film was boring,all i can say is god bless the
5,nightclubs do n't have much of a plot or,nightclubs from the late 1950 'searly 90 's
5,romantic scenes are very well done a lot of the dialog is superb and there,romantic comedies i had read and seen so much that it is really good
5,abc is also the best of people,abc would probably have more a good career
5,do n't listen to this movie,do not make them clear to me
5,it should have stayed focused more on that man than the film but this one is,it 's difficult for him when he confronts a very troubled man he loves her
5,this was the same idea that brought the series over and found a way of getting into the series but it was not,this is an excellent adventure and i recommend you not be surprised by the beauty when the first day 's film is going off
5,annoying people with no brain could be,annoying dialogue is a big problem
5,he 's not going to play the lead role,he is still a little rough and the film still
5,what can be mentioned if anyone is a guy that knows who that person 's side of and the truth is that they ca,what the producers like the director and his crew do seem so well so good at playing out it 's all that matters
5,heck i would advise this to get a few nominations out of me,heck even one of them that have been better out of this has not
5,having said the best in both cases however are the two men,having seen the trailer on the series i can say that it 's
5,the most ridiculous thing about the movie was the,the acting is very solid and the writing
5,several people in an effort are made very clear and i mean it 's not a total,several films take an active film and it 's the only film that is truly funny
5,you 're not really the same as the plot which should have,you never have a clue who in her mind is there
5,worst of the movie is a very bad rip off of the original,worst of all it seemed less to have been the nepotism and that is
5,what was so stupid was the way the,what was a bit of a surprise
5,trouble after i saw something good these guys come together from the planet with the aid that is in them,trouble is a very bad movie that will leave you feeling depressed when one of his buddies gets shot
5,to all they must see this film and not say in the name of it unless you have seen,to be honest i found this flick a waste of an hour of film it should have been
5,sure it 's about the people that want us to sympathize with the audience,sure i understand that it 's just an old movie with very little violence but
5,pity a lot of people who saw this movie will be surprised that it does not have the decency of it all,pity it 's not a big budget movie and the result does really make many films the big budget movies and the low
5,when in a small town one of their best enemies who come out of the city and the young people come along and unite them to go through the motions,when a woman calls a gun from a child in the midst for her the body of the owner tells her the real story of her life and her own motives
5,for the first time we 're reminded that i had not read it,for a short while at the end we do care about the film 's
5,he 's not a bad guy and a woman is so stupid,he has proved to have become a very popular actress in a movie
5,killed with the wind and the police and his girlfriend they all run up in their path to see the killer,killed in a picturesque setting in the hospital we get a lot more of george washington 's character being able to deal
5,i was n't impressed at all,i think one who ca n't help
5,because she also is the first one to deal with her family she will really think that if,because of how the first movie came out the main premise was still fairly fresh and unique
5,it would have made more sense if the main characters could have been killed by the cops,it 's as if watching a lowbudget soap operas which is just one of the other movies from
5,did he ever have a chance for his mother,did i know it was one that everyone is in
5,the film feels disjointed and slow,the script the actors and especially the
5,then you feel they are going to be,then he comes to be a doctor
5,in fact it 's just plain dull,in a way this film could be considered
5,i am a huge fan of the comic books,i would recommend it to anyone who has n't read
5,i thought i 'd say that with the exception of a bit of a few moments which would have had,i loved it when i thought oh my father is n't the best character 's muck of the film
5,i just love seeing a great cast of actors having their talents playing themselves with me as a child,i think if this does n't have all of the usual columbo elements there 's a better actor to root
5,wow a true love of the classic musical score that is the only highlight on that of a great performance in it,wow what was worse bridges 's writing and editing in this film the sound effects and wardrobe was appalling and there 's still
5,this is what they should like to be,this is a story that should 've been told
5,for the rest of the film kronk manages to create a very satisfying atmosphere,for me i am just plain silly of all the negative reviews on this pile
5,but i was n't expecting the sequel to the original,but the film is simply fantastic entertainment to watch and enjoy
5,a man raised through the body and kills him for all his actions who can be a woman,a few of his other recent films are good too and the two of them do not disappoint either
5,as a movie lover it did n't really work,as the series went on its popularity in the big
5,a few things about this movie that i think is really disturbing to watch,a few other films are based on one particularly true incident and the second is
5,one of the major cities of our own world was that it was,one of the best movies i 've watched in a long time
5,i have seen many of these movies and can understand that they are all real,i have to give it 8 stars when a 1 the cast was so awful i
5,i do not really feel the movie could have been a little better,i remember being more concerned about the whole thing that it should be so
5,perhaps one can take it in any form of time but it,perhaps the most important thing about this movie was the acting
5,it 's not the worst movie i 've ever seen,it was just an awful movie and i would not have
5,the movie does however be bogged down and,the story is very weak and unbelievable
5,no big fan of his previous work should,no i'm gonna do it right now
5,it 's a bit of a shame that none ever made any effort to bring us a film with such a great cast of actors,it did n't have to include some of my favorite movies because it was the first movie i had seen and i did n't think it
5,the problem with this story line is that some people are trying to,the director made an interesting statement when he wrote to the writer
5,as it was the scene of her car was pretty hokey,as a matter the game 's hero has been seen as a
5,i do n't know whether it is his work or not i have a very strong knowledge at times that is just plain bad but this is the worst movie i have,i mean that 's a whole point for this type of thing if you 're not the only person you would want to see but you do not watch the movie
5,he 's always a master of a woman,he and his family are just in a very
5,something about a little gem and that 's the point,something good the first is when someone who is so bad
5,it may well have made a long buck look and the whole cast did an amazing,it 's a shame we 're never shown too much of the film 's popularity
5,in the movie we are forced to endure their performances in ways,in the first act a movie has a decent story a great character
5,be warned by now that the rest of the cast are not bad but you have to be one to,be it a comedy from the 80s to the late eighties that you may not be able to watch
5,my main beef with some of this is,my grade c eye bay steve stiller
5,he is so unlikable the actors could have done better off the street with the right actors as well,he 's not a perfect man but the director is so convincing and fun that they have to make it
5,it was the same year the show was released from,it has little value other than to be funny
5,credentials in the middle of the second movie the director of this dreck of the first installment was a really great,credentials is a lot of scenes where everyone is concerned and then the film turns out to be quite interesting
5,make sure not that if you were n't paying,make it interesting and will keep you watching
5,the story does n't have anything to tell and it never ends,the fact i was actually thinking about it being a sequel in the
5,the movie is as close to the facts of other movies as possible,the two brothers seem to be a bit more than the characters in the
5,when it comes to acting and cinematography this movie is awful for all ages at least for me,when a movie like sex lives and even that are n't good enough you see this movie
5,there was a lot of footage and shots for the most ardent,there 's some interesting stuff to be found by this film
5,our hero and heroine who just look in awe at the camera and are the very real ones,our characters are also very believable and even that much sympathy for humanity is not always true
5,that 's not one of the best points that the movie has to offer or to be in it 's resolution,that 's not a bad sign in her opinion this film shows a complete ignorance and that 's really what to say
5,the action sequences are very interesting,the cast are great also to the
5,every one of them is just so bad i'm not gonna let them see him,every time i see it i will give it a try and i 'll do the
5,first off i am a huge fan of the original,first in the second category is a complete failure with all
5,the plot line is n't too bad but that was n't my forte,the other side is that the woman in her prime is quite a loser
5,long after i did n't remember seeing the film 's failings on a,long way of the truth or even not spoiling for your son
5,also why would a film about the holocaust,also we 'll remember that the old men are
5,but the scene in which the hero and his daughter are sitting in a room is absolutely priceless,but at times it does feel the same as the old columbo movies such as that of the late
5,when the film opens at the end of his rope the story begins a series of misunderstandings that unfold and in that era the film turns out to a rather repetitious degree and the direction is poor in every detail not,when watching a television documentary on a tv channel you can still find anything on the tv that is so bad it was comical in places but for a show called new kid to show the real problems at least
5,one of my favorite movies it has one thing that made it interesting,one of my favorite shows ever because my childhood always holds up against me
5,in a small role like the character of janie who would have had the potential to have,in fact it 's a mess of a comedy in every way the acting is wooden
5,this episode was about an american couple on a mission to get away with each of their husbands and family members and the fact they can be trusted,this is such a good movie that you will be able to see more of that kind of relationship between the leads and the interplay between characters and actors
5,since he had the potential to tell that this is a poor movie he 's actually a good actor,since it 's a b b movie it was pretty much one that actually failed to entertain the viewer
5,weather was not enough to send the story to a higher level of its ability,weather was one of those movies you could have missed some of the jokes and jokes
5,the movie is n't bad but it,the plot is a good movie
5,sophie christensen also stars in this movie,sophie is a perfect addition to her acting
5,the film is so bland in so many levels that it actually surprised the heck of the director,the actors were all pretty good including a couple other than the aforementioned bettie page one of them
5,also a good thing of this is that it actually is as good as the original the lion series,also do n't worry the story will become one of a few things the film has an atmosphere in common
5,one might call them a man not a horror movie,one scene that 's really hard to remember is when you
5,it 's a great shame that there have always be the big clincher on this board,it 's a shame that no one seems to notice this film in spite of what it
5,costarring a cast that never existed on tv and they did n't,costarring is a perfect combination and yet the script never develops
5,instead she finds an ally and goes to find,instead of wasting your precious time watching it
5,the acting could have just been saved that,the film never lets up at all
5,she is a woman trying to keep her clothes in her arms and restore her husband 's life as one to see,she must have been in love but her father is on a trip to delhi because no parent will ever accept that he
5,the whole thing about the way they could have been done the story about the man 's life or how he 's in the past comes out of,the film is basically a movie with lots of laughs and it does not seem to have a clue for being just a little bit too predictable
5,the whole story is very boring to watch,the acting was wooden and the plot made sense
5,it is definitely more of some kind of movie but even in its attempt to get some enjoyment i suppose it 's just stupid and is n't in the,it is a shame that this movie has n't gotten a 2 at least one hundred people will ever see why the critics thought this movie is bad
5,i think you should go into this movie unless your idea of a,i have read several reviews from the movie and it says alot
5,neither did he ever go to this guy until after he died with a bullet,neither the director nor the crew nor the audience does n't care anything of the movie
5,i have nothing more against the other actors and directors,i do n't blame a reviewer because they were trying desperately
5,three women are two sons living in paris and a very mature situation,three friends are two orphaned women and a younger couple of people that were
5,but i do n't mind to know,but this is the best of the trilogy
5,i do n't recall when it was over,i was not expecting any more from the cast
5,i just had my hopes for something new,i thought you 'd be missing something
5,it is a very unique journey and is able at every other,it 's as if it was made to be a commercial
5,anyone could make money for such an awful movie but it was n't,anyone in a movie that could do the same thing with me and i
5,the film is so poor that i would n't pay attention to these two,the story is set to new york in a car in the country
5,sometimes she would n't have to be much better at this film,sometimes the plot goes nowhere the dialogue just goes from there and then
5,the movie was made to entertain us with its own reality,the first one was just good fun but i can forgive you
5,right there he meets a charming young man named carl who seems to realize that life will be the greatest thing that happened could happen to him before the consequences of the big corporate death,right in the middle a lot of things happening right that are n't explained in this movie but it does make me think the characters were likable and i loved the movie more and could n't
5,it 's a very powerful film that the viewer has thought to themselves,it 's only because of this movie of course that makes the entire movie
5,that 's how accurate it was going to show,that 's the only excuse the film has going
5,the actors look like they were making a movie,the whole idea of an advanced virus a scientist on
5,the story of this story a great deal has been done by the precogs and the world is still a great place,the acting is horrible the script is poor the direction wooden and the cinematography is worse than this load of crap
5,either my friend or i had a very large problem but then again it was too late for me,either way i would like a little bit of the latter part i could see a lot of this film
5,hijinks and scenes are really interesting,hijinks and murder scenes and all the
5,in short there is an underlying theme,in short my favorite part was one bit
5,the acting was okay but the direction was decent too and so is mostly due for it being a terrible,the plot moves a little faster than what you can expect of a story about how to solve plot
5,suddenly it gets an extra higher and slower ending,suddenly and a few shots are cut to another point
5,this movie is a big waste,this is why i give this movie
5,he looks like you had written a book,he meets the same character he pleases
5,despite such a very strong approach i still did enjoy the film it maintained the raw emotional feeling of the first film,despite the fact this is an awful film the acting was awful the story is pretty weak the acting was pretty awful and
5,this film could have been better suited,this movie is one of those
5,if they had the benefit of a better script and a script that would put forth a cohesive film there would be a better place to spend,if i knew it was supposed to be a movie i do n't know why i should have taken the time spent on the set up in the
5,before this movie i think it 's a complete failure,before being done i 've only seen this version
5,in fact one of the most underrated movies ever and one of them,in this movie he is very sympathetic but not a bad and good character
5,this is the best movie i 've ever read and it made me cry out so much in my head,this one is another winner of all time and should be seen as a comedy and a waste in its time
5,mo 's character 's motivations at every point is shattered by his own father and son because he just does it with a straight face and even though it is more or less a character,mo had some big problems with this movie i think he 's really in love with her but her character has her own motivations and problems with the plot in question of their own
5,kudos for the poor acting or bad,kudos you should watch this movie
5,it was just so terrible and terrible,it 's a pretty funny satire
5,4 the fact that it was written,4 the movie and my gf
5,the director is n't trying to create the same goal and we can only,the film is beautifully directed by zhang yimou and cinematographer jacques von sternberg
5,when she realizes of one hundred she is in the hotel she asks him why she,when i watch a movie about the people of venezuela they have to be done
5,not to be missed though and it looks like the film was filmed the,not so much for the film to do the plot as a whole
5,in conclusion the movie is worth a look but that 's not what it,in the end you are left thinking what a good movie really was
5,its a wonderful shame to me,its a story that does not have
5,tom has just been a young child in the family and his parents live with his younger brother,tom clancy 's screenplay is so bad that i ca only find it watchable for the sake of watching
5,the director must have been trying too far to be a comic book with only a small amount of action,the action sequences were pretty good even for a low budget film of the early '70 's early 80 's when
5,no this movie is very slow and it is n't,no wonder the film itself is a long forgotten release of
5,quaid is so bad in this movie that it turns out to have gone into one of the best roles to,quaid seems to make all the possible decisions but he has been just the best comic strip of all time
5,the film is a piece for the eyes,the scene where the characters are talking is a
5,resistant to the plot that will leave the viewer to the imagination if its a real surprise,resistant enough and the actors who were at their best are also great although the movie makes no
5,this should be the case with that the last movie of which i hope,this is the biggest mystery that has ever happened for a slasher movie
5,as a result the plot for this movie was weak,as a result the film fails on its own
5,for its entirety with the film a major step for the director is to the viewer to root for their friends if it was over their heads,for the time the story is so simple and so implausible that it 's impossible for me it did n't have to go to a few sentences
5,though there is a lot to love about this one a man a man goes to war as an observer that he has found out his own identity when he tells a child,though the main problem in the movie arises from the way it drags it is the script that takes the story of a man who is attracted to him in the end
5,all at once it does have a lot of action but,all in all the acting is excellent especially craig sheffer
5,it was a waste of great music from the era,it 's a good sign for a film to be good
5,but if a film makes up my own feelings with the plot the,but it was a movie that you could not stop laughing at
5,if only the producers had bothered to use the f of the book 's title the original as,if the movie was n't so bad it 's good i would advise you for renting it
5,you can see the characters in these movies like they were done in a way of making the movie,you can never guess what they are thinking which would have made this an okay if not the worst movie
5,why did he bother to write,why did i have to spend the
5,the acting was fine and i would have rather been more surprised to find,the dialogue is very juvenile in the extreme but it works like that
5,but for her she is not and is not given much exposure to the,but it is the real deal of the story that is lacking in
5,so we do see a bit more that is n't as great in the movie as the later one,so it is a shame that the movie is not very good as i have seen it is probably one
5,and there was very good suspense and it was fun,and then after a couple of scenes of talking and death
5,two of the funniest films of all time include the scene in which the girls show the true love of both their love and the men are,two of the finest scenes ever filmed during one of the most dramatic scenes ever to grace our eyes in the final scene of these things
5,one of the most underrated films i have ever,one of the best i 've ever seen
5,in addition the story is good and the characters do one,in fact not only does his character make a film
5,i think some of its detractors will be watching too many of these films that you,i can see how people were actually taking this movie so stupid a must see
5,all the actors and actresses could have come,all i know has now happened and this movie
5,it 's a waste of the talents of the director and director himself,it is a shame that everyone is interested with her as i do n't
5,as is the way i am mentioning it for its detractors,as the movie goes along and the way they do this the
5,it 's only all the action sequences that make it a very moving romantic comedy film and a complete mess about,it makes me chuckle even though you have heard from her that it is still possible to read my lips
5,as the characters go the same is a true story for the viewer and when i find time,as the title suggests it is in the book which is basically a parody of the original
5,it 's really hard not to notice the characters and their situations so this is,it is hard to believe how they put the two together on the screen
5,i will say this after all there were lots of films that did n't suck i did n't really know what they were doing,i was at first intrigued by the fact that this show did n't have a sequel or anything but an incredibly boring title
5,bad acting bad script horrible music horrible script,bad acting horrible production values and a horrible script
5,there were lots of people who knew better than to make this film out of theatres,there are still few moments of suspense or suspense to make this film so memorable and so
5,si in all movies she is the only one who thinks that,si the rest is a pretty dull and badly done movie
5,much of the action takes you into the story and you are given a different view,much like i said this one is not like it has a bigname director trying to be
5,i remember when this was n't a tv documentary we had it,i ca n't really think we are supposed too seriously as a remake
5,what an awful waste on this film,what a fantastic and touching film
5,the story and the character development of the story is completely different to today the way the original was,the acting performances are all top class which must rank as one must say to a certain degree
5,while these two were the best i have ever seen it 's just me,while the director does n't seem very interesting to write the film properly does this
5,of all the people that were familiar to the movie 's audience like most horror films and tv stations and their,of course it is n't true that the film does n't do the typical good job for a good laugh
5,he 's so very very good and he is actually a joy,he is a master of humanity not a very good film
5,this is the second time you see the film,this is the worst film of the year
5,and then the two main characters are just the only thing that makes this movie worse,and so it might still remind us what is more the world 's most beautiful and beautiful
5,anyway i would suggest that you see the original,anyway there was no time to give a movie a
5,the movie is very slow indeed at,the acting was pretty good too
5,i mean really though this might be a tad too long,i can remember the first time they were in it and we
5,what 's more the music and the film is a wonderful addition as we are given an insight on the characters and their feelings toward each character,what is to be said with the story is n't completely unique it does not get a sense of danger for a long period of its life because
5,this is one to see if only to,this is the worst film ever made
5,the film is set on a very interesting subject,the acting was terrible i was surprised by the lack
5,let 's take my word for it let 's stop,let me start by the summary of the film
5,think you 're the seeker this movie is not perfect and if you are a lover or at all you,think of things on paper which will make you want someone to go nuts and take some good people
5,it was obvious that those around him and other gigs,it must have had all to be taken seriously
5,for me it was too much and was a lot of the movie,for the rest of us who 's ever going to say that the old
5,hopefully some actors for the show is a bit more interesting to,hopefully some actors can act as the older actors for example
5,how are all these criteria going to a movie,how to lose his son 's brother in any way
5,sure there is plenty more to the plot,sure it 's a little hokey and is not
5,somebody seems to be on their element and,somebody is stabbed out into this movie
5,i also prefer the way they are shot on the streets of scotland,i do not regret seeing it like they made me feel ill but i
5,i can see why they made the show,i 'll never see why i would want a
5,he just gets lost and leaves his son 's family is to be left to pay to repair,he is the reason why no one would have the right to be involved in this case for the
5,i give this movie a 3 because i had read somewhere,i ca n't believe that a group of people would give people
5,how could you not tell anything good about,how could it even get so close
5,it should be called to all the people who watch it,it 's not as though it was used in the book because
5,there are times when the movie goes a little over the top,there are some good bits and a few of the scenes are a
5,i think its hard on the eyes the viewer has a laugh while talking about being,i really liked this movie the music was excellent and the soundtrack was very good
5,instantly she gets stuck a job and her mom and they become friends,instantly a character that had him died was not funny at all
5,should have taken the time between a couple of good songs,should this flick be watched by anyone who wants a film about
5,ennio and her are a great combination that is well worth watching,ennio morricone 's movie was directed by robert de niro an independent film
5,i found the film to have nothing going on,i hope that all the comments for the big joke
5,there are two movies with great casts and good actors and actresses that play themselves,there is one scene where she 's about as convincing a day as you might want
5,this one did what i expected,this is the one that gets canceled
5,both the good cop and guy who,both films are very well written
5,whatever should have been a little more graphic for a director that has spent far,whatever this movie has to offer the viewer to care about them so much
5,lots more of the action sequences in the script and the plot development,lots this film just seemed ridiculous and boring it was so predictable
5,the acting was horrendous even by the late gosh standards especially the last part of this movie were just embarrassing,the story of a bunch trying to survive from this ordeal in a very small town from the past
5,it was a wonderful movie i gave this,it is more like watching paint rock
5,maybe i was watching a little more than one film which i 've,maybe it 's time for a film to develop in the future
5,although it 's a little bit of an achievement it 's very well done,although my favorite scene is a sequence of people standing in front there the characters
5,talbot did n't have a much to do in this version since he is just a man who never really seemed like a human and i loved him,talbot was a little bit too old not sure whether she would be so great in acting classes or at the time that she was n't even considered as
5,this kind of show has been written by,this is the film all that heaven
5,it is not about the holocaust and that it is about the media and the struggle that we do get our,it 's a bad idea a movie which makes a very bad impression for most of the director 's movies
5,were not we just paid money to see,were i not able for the story
5,dad and father seem like they 're a bunch of children and we are left to care about them while they 're doing this,dad does n't seem very funny about either this guy either but they had a good laugh and the rest was very well acted so
5,i was n't expecting oscar nominations to make it even the big screen but i'm gonna go into the story,i had a crush on the character of george 's character even though he was not his usual self but one
5,if you do watch the movie for the first time at least one star is ok for your own good fun,if you loved the movie you 're not missing anything from the movie its just that bad acting bad editing bad direction
5,as if they are all going at least one thing is that it 's very similar to the old west and the grudge 's,as an old friend of the family i was very impressed by his performance of the character especially when it was at the absolute best
5,drama is a rarity of the genre,drama a new way to make a movie
5,humour and drama are not at all abundant with all of this,humour is n't necessarily the way the whole thing itself was but the
5,have some of them in the cast give any depth,have all the good points of a decent movie
5,roman catholic life is the only place of this movie which makes the film look realistic,roman polanski 's the cranes and the princess and tramp are so good it 's hard to
5,this is the kind of movie that makes you think what so ever with the film making up its own path,this is a story that really did not show us a single parent 's life in the 1950 's in a real
5,working as the old movie i was left wondering if i wanted to kill people or,working at a local bar is a film and a bad bad one at that
5,the most beautiful and powerful thing of this film was the use,the problem with this movie was the fact of a story
5,not so many of the actors that came up a little in,not much in this movie impressed with many of the original
5,again he was trying and it is a good movie that in the end that makes you angry but i feel he has more heart,again i 've been more impressed by her character 's acting and the acting she is in her best with her role and she makes more
5,every time i think about it i know how to make up their own minds,every now and then while he was going to look for the old and his new
5,john ritter 's character is the one who,john goodman 's performance is very subtle
5,another scene of any one film is when the hero,another thing that should keep watching was the soundtrack
5,this is the worst movie ever made,this movie is a disgrace in my face
5,i hope this was a mistake,i mean who had to write a
5,jeff fahey was the most talented director in hollywood and i am surprised that people who actually made this picture appear to,jeff fahey who plays the cop cop and part of the gang show business is assigned over in their own way
5,the music is good but the soundtrack is n't the best part,the scene where the family takes him inside a freezer is a real
5,lupino 's character is the only character she could,lupino 's character does n't seem too convincing
5,millions of things were left unsaid,millions of times a space station that
5,ving rhames played the part of the,ving and the characters are good
5,tim curry as the head manager is great but he could have been better as a young man he was a wonderful,tim meadows is the narrator who has to go crazy and is the most normal who has to be his name
5,that is where to watch this crap,that was to say a bit
5,this movie is one of the most amazing and original films i 've watched in a long line of films and is not just a,this movie is simply a perfect example among the greats of the time where it would have gone so far from the beginning credits
5,not only is her character supposed as,not all movies were pretty funny
5,in a time where the original was the best of the movies and it shows that in many ways a,in this film we have a very unpleasant and humorous view of the lives and experiences of the family
5,so for those who do n't do n't get much less,so what 's that this movie is about a guy
5,the main problem when it seemed at first it was in the opening sequence with little where,the story line is a bit hokey but the cast of the characters are completely believable
5,there were some interesting parts in the movie when they were talking about the ending when we see it they were n't really laughing at the person we are doing and,there had to have been so many great things about the movie and this episode of a season was actually quite good for the family who are trying too young
5,somewhere between a mother and an sister,somewhere there 's the girl in the car
5,so i really had a feeling this guy has the potential to do so,so all the clichs are a little predictable and too much and i 'll say
5,pity i did n't realize that they were watching a movie from the era,pity to the director for bringing a whole new cast to a film
5,she does have a good sense to the film as she gets it into some kind of way the movie does n't seem to end at all,she had the opportunity to be in the car but this film was a very good one and i think that is a big surprise because her performance
5,it seems that as much i like a lot of the humor between this movie for the most,it is just another film and it will undoubtedly blow my eyes out into my personal view
5,it does n't show how it affects and being with the actors,it shows a story of how the world must be like that that
5,like the scene where it is revealed that the girl was raped and the boy with a knife gun a few scenes is just pure silly,like most of her other shows were the most interesting characters who ever created a character in it and her character was so strong that i was
5,now that i have seen it i was surprised at how bad it was,now i'm glad i have the choice of the director of the original movie so
5,it was nice to see the same character on the tv series as though he made the first episode,it 's been in several languages about three times and when the two first appeared a new one was done
5,it 's almost as if they wanted to run a show which made me laugh and cry in awe,it has all the elements in this documentary which are the major disappointments of this film and a very disturbing
5,when i saw the first movie i would give a 3 and so,when this show comes out on dvd the show has the episodes
5,the character development is really good,the most annoying scene was the sheriff
5,nothing new to describe or cherish for that matter,nothing compared with the other movies such works or these
5,i 've always been one with a few things you want to know that i love both comedies but i was wrong and that is the reason i gave this one,i have been hoping to see some of the best tv movies of the 1930s but still this was one great game and that 's all i had with this
5,spoilers the movie 's story is very convoluted,spoilers here i was really bored though
5,the characters in a film is n't bad but the script is awful,the story is just a bunch which makes you feel in there that you
5,the action sequence is the least realistic aspect of the film,the dialogue was bad and predictable with a very weak and clichd
5,i think i would like to hear a better version of this film,i have n't read the novel nor are there any other movie makers on
5,then the movie abruptly starts to fall down,then you go about the scene that the guy
5,case with him i 'll tell you why they had to get to the screen the,case is a story of two sisters in the early part of the 20th century
5,the movie is a visual drama and a good one at that,the movie shows the whole world of a film on every inch
5,this film is a definite insult to all viewers,this is the kind that it 's always great
5,well let 's throw some people in and that should be there only for people who have seen this,well what the hell did i say about this film it looked like someone made it off a script or
5,arnold mukherjee a good actor but still has a good supporting,arnold stang the character is also very strong at best
5,the actors do their parts to the audience and they make a movie worth,the film starts the road journey of new recruits after going to the local town
5,what you have here was a movie of the week where he was a bastard in his office,what can i get for anyone who believes the likes i can stand is the worst movie i have
5,there was the character of an actress who was born and raised to her own family and,there was n't too much chemistry between the two main character 's interactions a lot more
5,the only other actor i like is,the acting and directing are exceptional
5,that being a low and i have,that 's what the movie needed
5,we get one or more of the characters,we also have the same type with him in
5,joseph cotten and tom selleck also give one of the finest stars to film history,joseph calleia is not only a very bad actor but for that level he is a
5,he just seems to be on autopilot and he does n't even get a handle on acting,he would like to have a copy of this game in the us as a feature
5,we follow him a great actor like that too,we are presented more at each member of us who
5,did n't a guy who does so,did i ever see a film that was
5,this film makes a great deal and will be a testament in history as a reminder,this film also features a very similar soundtrack including the famous musical score by composer gustav van
5,i hope that the writers made it more difficult to make a film,i will always watch the original movie and it should really be enjoyed again
5,lol this has to be the worst movie ever made,lol maybe they are getting away with her but they 'll
5,but there was only one good point to it as well as being a huge amount of fun,but in fact if i could get into the tv i knew of it as a comedy
5,while the movie is not quite good enough the acting is good,while the movie also stars vincent berenger as a young lady and the
5,dermot winger 's character is all too complex and it would be difficult if the,dermot kaji plays a reporter as an idealistic woman struggling with the death penalty
5,jim voight 's character seemed so ridiculous that i had been convinced as to why,jim carrey 's character can be a bad movie if you want a laugh
5,i found it mildly entertaining and very good,i 've seen so far surpass it
5,i think this is where the film is aimed towards the fact it is about an american,i 'll never ever again look for another movie that is supposed to be a spoof
5,coach is a perfect cop who is always a real person,coach robert benton 's first appearance as one of the heroes of
5,it 's a complete waste though the first 15 seconds or a half,it 's only a film about racism and greed that is not just about
5,salman has a voice he plays out by the time the movie is introduced and the characters do so well to the plot that,salman khan 's performance is one i would gladly have listened to as if it was a film in the first five minutes
5,the rest of the cast is equally good for a newcomer for tv but i do n't find them to waste in a lot to distinguish that movie,the film is very good when things are more interesting and you can still tell if they were a couple friends the one who lived the film to me
5,it also gets really good from the,it is a really funny movie
5,watching this film it was easy to find a bad script and even the acting and editing,watching a lot more movies from other movies i see in the beginning how to make your own
5,mostly because of it 's good reputation,mostly this is a classic b picture from
5,the movie fails miserably for all the reasons that only make the movie work,the whole is a very different film and even a bit more explicit than the
5,it is a story of a girl who dreams that she needs to be loved,it was a fun one to watch but i saw it in the theater on cable
5,this is one time for a sequel,this is so bad it makes you laugh
5,45 years previously and he was killed by a white lady which was a major surprise because the script was the only actor,45 minutes into the picture i was surprised to see what happened when the end credits began rolling and i wanted a more anticlimactic
5,the plot is very simple there is an actual amount of suspense in it all,the first half of the movie is pure garbage which is not even mentioned for the
5,i will admit that there are plenty new films of this kind but,i watched it with friends and i never found them that appealing
5,to have to give them the benefit they can,to be honest i would n't have liked this movie
5,every character has to take care of anyone in the roles and they just have to,every scene has a few laughs the dialogue was ok but the story was ok
5,the story concerns a group of teenagers going to college and their students get attacked in a car accident by a police officer who is an,the cast is great the directing is a bit too tight on your face the acting and music are very very beautiful and very beautiful
5,they do a really good job of showing the character and how not to,they would n't have to resort up to the rest of the gang
5,i also have a soft spot of the story,i just finished reading about it on imdb
5,matt damon 's character is pretty likable and the whole family does n't seem to know what they 're doing anymore which has all of his childhood traits and the acting in some moments,matt damon has also been involved with a new york reporter and his wife who has nothing in the middle at least have to deal her with the big boys until the day and the
5,clowns can be a good person and i have to disagree that anyone who wants the film to do that should be there,clowns do n't work as if they are in fact the most common and they can get the worst of them but it 's
5,rating i give it four points if not for the unintentional wit,rating 12 out points but it 's still a good flick
5,but as the movie progresses the movie ends up at home when the family gets it up,but what this movie did i have no problem with this movie was the soundtrack by michael the
5,first the only thing it was about the film was one,first he 'd rather have such a bad side but he does
5,executive films are made to feature the likes of that of the ones that have,executive producer martin morris does nothing but confuse the viewer out to the audience
5,each of the boys is a very good,each one seemed to have more personality
5,totally unrealistic plot twists that will be more pointless than the other,totally devoid of any substance this movie is definitely worth seeing
5,really the best is the acting,really the characters that played this were
5,the movie makes sense but also the characters are stupid and so does the film and the story is so predictable that i cannot,the dialogue is very good and it is great to know that a writer could n't get more from such a short film
5,unfortunately i was totally unaware that this movie was,unfortunately his character has a lot of charisma
5,on the other hand if it was a,on the plus of a good script
5,marsden is the only one of the supporting cast members or supporting players who make,marsden 's performance in this film was by far the worst thing in it
5,however i liked this show and had to see,however that was not all a good idea
5,eastwood plays the doctor for years who can never really find a way out,eastwood is not always his most underrated actor but it just has to be the
5,the music score is brilliant for the film,the whole movie takes a turn through the movie
5,to be a kid i really wanted to like it for the fun factor but i got stuck,to the director 's name there be a lot more to it which is a huge letdown
5,yes it tries to make the characters look realistic but it never,yes it was the best movie that i have ever watched
5,here 's how i feel compelled in a small theater that people,here are some of their more subtle characters and their interactions
5,there is no excuse behind it the main character 's motivations and actions,there 's a reason why the entire episode is in the us
5,the other two and all that was missing out of the film,the plot is an updated tale and the characters seem onedimensional at best
5,aside from having one of the most memorable songs i have ever heard on a video clip i 've noticed some things about this film but,aside this is a real gem for anyone interested under what is happening by this generation and has n't just taken away from that movie
5,i would strongly recommend this to any,i thought this movie is hilarious
5,i just could n't have been less wrong about what it is a good script,i do n't know whether this movie is a real masterpiece for anyone to view such
5,the most exciting part is when a group of girls find themselves trapped and they make a good start a second and then it,the movie is not much more than some scenes where the protagonists find a real estate that was obviously filmed before the accident
5,from the point of view about the movie at the time,from the getgo he finds his old friend linda darnell
5,he is obviously a bad director,he has never been the real killer
5,seifer has a brief yet methodical life he 's not only in his late,seifer is a good guy who makes everything a little bit more believable
5,the result could not have been so good,the plot line is that of an old man
5,our heroine makes me laugh like a baby,our hero 's new identity takes out our sympathy
5,more of a plot of the novel and some historical information is presented with the movie,more than half a minute later they are all so bad they are good actors
5,cyborgs are n't real people to make sure people have to take responsibility,cyborgs and geeks do look much like the original in the film
5,if you 're going for some sort one helluva way then avoid the great movie at all cost and even a cursory conclusion to what,if you are looking at a good movie that is made for a very high school then that is all you should look elsewhere
5,i have to say that a story could have been better had,i have seen all of the other comments for the movie
5,an older person would have worked for a,an example of what is really bad
5,and the main character played by paul scofield is played excellently written by scott wilson who was obviously the director,and it 's a great example just when i think its over an hour i was getting a headache
5,i mean there 's the scene in which the woman 's daughter turns a confession,i do see a movie adaptation of the movie that makes it look better
5,and the scene where they take a bath and turn the water and get to dinner is pretty fun,and there is a good ending where the guy who plays the same guy is the only person that 's
5,this may not be the case to many audiences,this movie is a real stinker in my opinion it
5,something that is n't a comedy but it 's about a man questioning his own sexuality but he,something tells me to make a film where the characters are the one who gets the most
5,and the whole thing is a dream,and the rest was just like the rest
5,it 's the story that makes the main character a household,it 's so bad it 's good' it makes you laugh out
5,when i read the dvd the film seemed more pointless and dull,when the actors come up with a new wave of their characters the
5,overall he was a complete idiot who was trying for,overall you can say that the characters are shallow
5,i also do n't think you 'll know this is one time but when you watch it again you do n't take a minute to watch it as you can be bored by what is,i would certainly like this to be available on dvd which i thought was better than most movies which can only be appreciated because it 's a shame that there 's only an hour
5,more of the same as the first one,more of a story and a film about a
5,while being one such as it is that the story takes place in the town they both try at odds and the story unfolds,while being a fan of all kinds of the original it is the most beautiful film ever made that they make out there
5,sure he could come out of his mouth in a movie with no sound talent,sure it was not as good and bad but it 's definitely not one of the
5,the characters seem so forced as to take the movie seriously,the acting was terrible the plot was confusing and even the acting
5,i mean in the name of a movie,i could see what the writers were thinking
5,both men are always in need of common sense,both of those movies are as predictable in that it
5,button was a great film in every aspect,button and dale 's excellent talents are at their
5,while the original series was interesting for the most of them to be quite like what is wrong with it,while there a group members who have known a lot like most of their movies this is the one that i
5,the movie itself has a great concept and very intriguing,the first thing i 'd say was that it 's a
5,since i can never think a film in its entirety is going on so many different movies are not that effective that,since you have seen the old version of night vision it has become a staple in the series and at times
5,the movie is a tribute to reality but not really the type with the original movie being a movie,the plot is n't bad yet it 's a good thing if you can get a good script and an
5,it 's also a very enjoyable movie with an interesting plot good script and good performances,it 's funny when a woman calls her dad 's house and has all three of them
5,it looked like another movie on a budget of low budget that looked more like a,it has all of those qualities a decent production values were wasted in that department
5,you will just get annoyed by what 's,you 're in for the biggest waste
5,the movie starts out with a young woman trying to,the only one who could actually make any mistake
5,while the acting in the movie is the best part to the movie the whole production is just terrible,while this film has some interesting characters and it is really a film it 's still a great movie with
5,do n't worry or have anything against those films,do not expect to find much in movies
5,the movie revolves around two men who just have to make their life out,the performances of the two protagonists had a lot to work at but the rest
5,the rest of the cast also includes a cameo like cato as a little boy who is n't much of a father,the whole movie was made as a filler but it has a few actors such at the lead which i do n't care
5,the only reason i watch this is because i am a fan and i 've made a mistake of movies,the actors should have been forced to play the part in an ad but it would not be that way they
5,the movie did a good job on capturing emotion and drama and the acting and story lines were awesome,the director 's intentions are to get to show the camera so that the viewer can never forget that the
5,its only an hour long long long,its not even that funny to watch when
5,this movie is no exception even when my comment should be to praise it,this is one of those movies i would laugh for from a crowd of the
5,however the director and screenwriter never really got anything out of the ordinary,however unlike any other movie in the 80 minute running time the action scenes
5,only the valiant scenes that are so ridiculous that it 's impossible not,only the most ardent horror fans can tolerate and admire the original
5,every frame and scene has been put by a bunch of people with less ability than most other movies i,every single detail of the movie is as realistic as they could be and i am glad i did
5,it 's only the very first hour,it is an attempt to capture a new
5,so there were plenty to watch it anyway,so why did n't the guy who wrote it
5,in the first two episodes we see the three go along,in fact this is not a movie that shows promise
5,the characters are shallow shallow and twodimensional,the only reason i did n't give this
5,the movie was well acted and funny although it 's not as bad as that,the most obvious thing in the movie is that there are a lot more more of
5,art carney was on the cover of the street at midnight,art designer is a young girl from the city of the late
5,now all you need for a bmovie movie is a plot about a woman trying something to cure her life,now to all the people who wrote this to me for good reason i 'd have done a few research for
5,however the best of them that they,however his voice never gets hurt
5,it 's funny how people could go out and run and,it 's about the people who go to new orleans
5,to my surprise this film ranks among the greatest of,to put it bluntly i loved the first one
5,that scene is when our hero is playing soccer and starts kicking a big,that means not as funny as the first movie but not that bad
5,there is no way to enjoy such trash,there is plenty of funny situations and situations to
5,i have to say this movie is one of the best,i just think that this could get better and i do believe
5,hagen and her sister were not all,hagen chopra is a wonderful actor
5,why does this film do n't,why did they bother to make a
5,then in and out in the middle of nowhere she has been kidnapped and,then it gets that bad guys who have to do the right one
5,so i am wondering why people do n't like it just because of that it 's an ok movie,so the title was really great and i hope the film keeps it up from the bottom 100
5,sorry it 's about this world but i do n't think it needs,sorry but the ending is the best to watch and the film has very
5,it 's a shame it got released from a video release or dvd released in english,it 's very much as being a classic it is a true love stories and it 's
5,i'm sure they 'll put a lot into the film because of the fact that the director and his crew of people,i'm not sure what i 've been about to enjoy the film for the fact it is based upon a book
5,noone knows what goes on behind the scenes to keep this piece from being shot without the knowledge of any film,noone will find this entertaining or hilarious with a bunch to get excited about it 's own lack of redeeming factor and
5,i just got it and made it about halfway through,i could not stop watching the whole movie it was really
5,ca all be the same as some of my old friends who do n't take this show seriously for its duration,ca n't you think that the film makers might produce more realistic footage on the subject of this film than i ever
5,he has his own good intentions with her,he had no personality but a perfect voice and
5,there is not enough of a plot so they put this film in a collection of movies where most of the other,there 's also one or two questionable action scenes that are well crafted and well done by the last 15 minutes
5,arthur 's mother tries on a number of ways across the border and tries to figure out who is who,arthur was also known as a teenager but the movie is not a good story or one for at the time
5,an attempt to escape it by the way a big town decides,an interesting movie however that of the story is a remake
5,i 've had no trouble with this film,i thought that this movie was a total ripoff
5,it is one to see in our household,it is about the love of people who have
5,the film is shot in a manner by a director that can act when he 's on the screen,the acting is also superb for an action movie that does n't hold up to the suspense scenes and overall
5,it 's not that it matters but this,it 's about the last three minutes
5,this is not a great movie but it 's a good movie too a good movie to watch as an antidote,this is such an excellent movie and so it has a good balance between the first film and the other as the
5,then we are left with the notion,then one of the people dies
5,this is a story of the frustrations,this movie does nothing for people
5,while watching the movie you should just sit down with my friends in a theater,while this is a classic and well done movie it does have its flaws
5,colombian cinema also has the best acting ability you can get my drift,colombian society was a bit of a rip off of star trek 's the
5,if you ever have time to do one is the worst and worst piece,if you want to see more of the film then this film is not for
5,the film is almost like a bad movie but the director just,the whole time around with a good portion of the movie
5,bravo to everyone involved in this movie it 's not worth watching,bravo is on top of it all that 's done here
5,one thing i love about this movie was the use in,one of the girls is one of their best characters
5,the movie is more than a little silly and has no point to the narrative the plot has it written,the story moves at a steady pace to build up its narrative but the pacing comes off pretty quickly
5,this episode has a couple good laughs as far but the overall,this is the first time he has shown on this one
5,bad script and bad acting it was terrible,bad acting and bad editing this movie gets better
5,on an evening of new zealand street it is a very,on her way to the airport she does n't care
5,the story does not get bogged into a preachy yet incoherent ending the end result is a very interesting series of events as events take them in and out of balance,the scene where the doctor makes a big impact with a monkey wrench is another reason why his work would have to rely more on his character as the character
5,it must make sure you never know what you are seeing in fact,it 's not about all of the other commentators on this page
5,this time he gets out and his car becomes the prime suspect for it,this may have a good deal more money in the world and not enough screen
5,the other major problem is the dialogue which does n't seem like it was made at all,the special features are quite well known but that 's not all this works so well
5,i was just watching it today which seemed pretty good,i mean come on the actors were not so special when
5,but the way the movie ended it was just so disappointing,but as it stands on its own it is pretty boring
5,stop him constitute the real deal of his father and son with his dad,stop the film from a sequel but it is more enjoyable to see if they
5,the script by william smith and david carradine is one film that is set,the plot is great and i guess they had a very enjoyable part
5,i liked the movie because of the excellent performance at the end,i would n't go into this thinking that i have n't seen it
5,the dialogue are horrible the acting is atrocious all around the,the script is a waste the good actors and actresses
5,he also made the most serious character an interesting,he does n't really fit in the movie
5,but the acting is pretty good although you have a couple of actors,but here 's some of the actors and you 're just supposed like i
5,i mean the characters are all pretty,i hope that they make it
5,macarthur 's performance is very solid,macarthur could have made the difference a
5,abel is just an odd person,abel de trotta is a fascinating man
5,the movie has a lot of humor going for this is a much more compelling portrayal of him,the performances by jane and the guy who really stood by me are good in their parts
5,watching the movie is an insult,watching this movie i ca n't help
5,and they could have made this film,and the final outcome was good too as
5,but she 's not a single bad guy,but that is n't just a compliment for the
5,wendy is a nice guy to be a very good idea,wendy is a girl in a nightclub but not the slightest
5,if you 've read the other comments already i'm sure you 'll need to do a better,if you enjoy bad movies bad acting and bad casting this film is for the birds
5,uma thurman who plays paige did not deserve her oscar nomination,uma 's love interest was no better way of life
5,already there are so many people that were able to make a good film out of it,already in my opinion the most disappointing aspect of this flick is that there really is n't any
5,i have to say that there is so little i can only say but i 've been trying to find what is on the whole,i think it was n't only the director 's fault for their screenplay to make it work because the movie was also very good
5,you can also tell what the filmmakers,you will be glad you 'll
5,of course there are some funny moments but even though they are n't the most important of the,of mice and geeks you can learn about the quality of the movie in the first place
5,the acting and directing are so bad that you could almost believe this was made by an amateur grader,the film starts out with one of them leading to an ambiguous conclusion on the death of a young child
5,and the final analysis was excellent,and in one of the most famous
5,the film starts with the same theme and then there are a few moments of,the acting is so bad that it 's hard to describe any real work
5,overall it is a very good film,overall a very sad and quite dull film
5,a little bit of the story is a bit too slow,a great deal of tension and an even better finale
5,men and women must find a place to fight a few that,men have problems with this little creature but not all that
5,i could never care about any character who has any sense,i am convinced that i am not sure whether to go see
5,i think he was on his own show as the lead singer and that is exactly why i wanted him,i had read the book on the contrary of the great melting mountain for the film based solely for the good
5,i also wondered if there was a character to watch a single woman who did so and,i have no qualms about this movie as an actor so i did n't like it
5,worth seeing however if not in comparison to the other posters i ca just assume that the real world is a great achievement,worth seeing i can watch an episode of it as quickly and never as much and i would have to watch it twice to
5,both are the type to come to like the characters,both in a funny and dramatic world as if it were
5,the music score is n't as bad or the direction,the main reason he is so much of the time in
5,this movie is an interesting story with great writing and,this film is the worst film i have seen
5,because he made money for getting his wife to play his wife and son to play them while her own son and father were dying,because it is n't exactly all that bad to show that all the people in this movie are willing to get themselves through the lines of
5,lila the teenage girl is no mean but it has a decent message,lila and michael are all in it but they do not work to create
5,my favorite part of the movie was,my mother 's family really was
5,it would have been the least a bit more believable,it 's a bit slow but the humor is just hilarious
5,many of the action sequences are not even as good as these guys are,many of us could also get used of it as a plot device which kept
5,this movie was one i would n't waste,this one is absolutely beautiful and funny
5,but i was n't able for good luck because i could go on and say this is a,but when she 's having a great conversation with a stranger he decides to take the film
5,it has an underlying message but the story does n't make,it was one very nice job to play these songs
5,why does it seem so stupid to watch it,why does a lady dressed in the shower of herself
5,xica is a classic film that is sure,xica is a great film for everyone
5,like any other movie the actors are good,like a lot i loved the movie and the
5,especially when the police force was given the president of his family 's office,especially though there are parts that have been done without being too much to chew
5,the director tries to be a funny comedy,the film takes you on the run
5,malkovich is a real cowboy but he,malkovich makes his usual sympathetic character
5,but what makes the different show stand out was how some other,but not so bad that one should expect to be scared
5,see this if you were in the mood of an adult,see a few things in the middle one by one
5,although the other actors seemed better in this picture it might have gone through in more sense,although i can say about the movie this is one that i recommend watching to any of these
5,they do n't seem to be,they did like it to an extent
5,aside from a very short plot a few elements including the main,aside with its many shortcomings is the worst of the three
5,this film also features a number as a big fan of the,this is about the best thing about the movie in comparison
5,that is another of the two best films in those days,that 's about it for many reasons about the other actors
5,do n't miss the chance to see this,do yourself a favour skip some of the dvd
5,for those who think i know more about the real meaning of a movie this is just a wonderful portrayal of the life of the people in 19th century england who would like to live in england in the late 1960s,for this movie it is definitely a bit different and more often than not i am not mistaken for a few words that the film is based on is a film that will be released in dvd 's as shown
5,first of all i love all the children that,first as a result it was very good
