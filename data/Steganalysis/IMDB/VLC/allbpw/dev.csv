1,after a few years i have seen this movie
1,it 's a very funny movie and i
1,days later i was able to find the movie and it was so bad that it would be a waste of time and money
1,so i was expecting something more
1,and it is not a movie that is n't
1,they are all very good actors

1,douglas is a good actor but his performance in the film was not bad
1,sadly it 's not the same as the one in the book but the fact is it
1,just like the first movie the acting is pretty bad
1,this is a very good movie
1,the film has some of its moments that make it a classic
1,john goodman 's performance as a cop in a film made me laugh

1,jamie kennedy is a good actor but he is not convincing
1,good luck to the director and director
1,it 's a shame that this movie has n't been seen as one or two films
1,but the movie is a bit slow
1,more than anything i would say that this is a very good
1,i was n't expecting much from the film
1,until i was in a theater of the 80 's i was n't impressed
1,i was n't expecting much from this
1,in fact the only reason why this film is so good is because it is so much more
1,very few films are available in the us
1,i was n't impressed with this movie
1,can you say that this movie was
1,for a film about a young woman she 's not the least of the problems
1,when i saw the movie on tv it was a complete disappointment
1,the movie is a complete waste
1,unfortunately the movie does n't have a lot to do with it 's plot
1,score 4 stars for this movie
1,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,while i was n't impressed with the film it 's still very good
1,this movie was a waste for the first two hours
1,and the ending was a little unsatisfying and the movie was n't really that good
1,it 's not even the worst of
1,there are some good moments in the film
1,in fact it 's a shame that the movie has been so much better
1,then the movie starts with a bang and a couple of scenes that are just plain funny and i
1,it 's a very funny movie
1,indeed the film has some very funny scenes
1,at least the film was n't so good it 's good
1,dressler 's performance is the only reason
1,even though it is not a movie it 's a complete mess of a movie that is n't worth the
1,i have seen this film several years ago and it 's still a good
1,i was n't impressed by this film
1,creepshow 2 is one that is a must for fans of the original
1,that is the only thing i did not get
1,for the most part the acting was pretty bad and i did not care about any character
1,this is the first movie i 've
1,i have seen this movie several years ago and it is still
1,uma kristofferson plays a very good character and is very believable
1,and it 's a shame that the
1,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,i'm a fan of this film
1,but it 's not a bad movie

1,c thomas is a great movie
1,it is not the best film i 've seen but i 've never seen it
1,the movie was shot on location and it was
1,indeed it 's a good film
1,overall this movie was a waste
1,even though the movie is a bit long and boring
1,they are all very funny and the story is so funny
1,even the most diehard fans of the original series are n't very happy
1,at the end of the film the audience is left with the feeling of being cheated
1,there are a few good moments but it is not enough to make this a
1,son and son are the best thing about the
1,this is a very bad film
1,no matter what the movie is supposed to be about
1,anyway the movie was n't so bad that it 's actually funny
1,um the movie is n't a bad film
1,i was surprised that the film did n't have a chance
1,on a positive note the acting was pretty bad
1,a lot more than a few of the other reviewers i 've seen this movie has a very funny scene
1,for a movie that was supposed to have a good plot line it 's a good thing that
1,you can see that this movie is not only the best movie of the decade
1,because the film was shot in a very grainy way
1,the movie was shot in the early
1,this is a movie that i can watch over all
1,kate winslet plays a woman who is married to her husband and is forced to go on a trip to the city to get her husband to go
1,what a waste for a film that is not even worth renting for the dvd collection
1,he is a very talented director
1,too many people have been warned that this movie was made in a
1,only the most ardent fans will be able to appreciate the film
1,the movie was a bit of an action film but it
1,okay so the movie is n't bad
1,on a positive note the acting was good but i was n't impressed
1,should i say this is a great movie
1,it 's not a bad movie
1,it 's not a movie for the faint of heart
1,the movie is about a group of people who are trying to find a cure to each other
1,because the film was shot on a shoestring day
1,i was surprised to find that this was a very low production and i think it was the worst film i have seen
1,the film has a very good cast and it is very well acted and directed and is
1,whatever it was i would n't have to say it 's
1,then there 's the fact it is a film that has been made in the past
1,this is a movie that is n't
1,this is the first movie that i
1,i have seen the movie twice and i can tell you that i am not going
1,but the film is a bit slow
1,i have to admit that the film was a little too slow for
1,i was surprised to find that this was a very low budget film but i think it was the worst movie i have seen in a very long time
1,further it is a film that is n't afraid
1,until the last 15 minutes of this film i was wondering what the hell was that
1,see this movie and you will see what it is
1,me and my friends are talking about this movie
1,the movie was a bit of a mess but i found the ending quite satisfying and i thought the ending had
1,with the help from his friend the film is not only a very good movie
1,suitably it 's a shame because the
1,or the fact that the movie is a comedy
1,it 's a shame that the movie has been released in dvd format
1,as for the rest i would say that this movie was made for the sake
1,in fact the film is a little too long
1,this is the worst film i 've ever seen
1,nevertheless the movie is very good and the acting was excellent and the story line was great and the acting was good but i did n't think it
1,this movie was a complete waste
1,which i think is the most interesting aspect of this movie
1,extra of a few of the characters in the movie were so stupid that i was n't sure
1,there are some good moments but it is n't
1,it 's a very good movie and it is not
1,thanks to a cast that includes a few good performances and
1,this is a very bad movie
1,i was surprised to see that this was a very low budget film but it 's not that bad either
1,i have to say that i was very disappointed
1,well the movie is n't that bad but the acting is n't bad
1,this is the worst movie i 've seen
1,it 's a shame that this film is n't even nominated
1,actually it 's a very good movie
1,i was n't impressed with this movie
1,the film is about the same subject as a book of the same
1,it is a shame because the film was shot in a very small
1,it is a shame that this film is not only
1,but the film is a bit too long
1,this is a movie for everyone who loves the genre
1,but it 's a great film and a good movie
1,there are a lot of things that are wrong with this film
1,why is it that i ca n't even think
1,the film is about the struggle of the people in the community to be a little too concerned
1,this movie was a complete waste
1,but the film is not as good
1,there are a lot of good things to be done
1,that is the only thing i can say
1,just like the first film i was n't
1,the film is a bit of an exercise into a very dark and dark world of the future
1,with a supposed beard and the size of a hat and a few of his other movies he is a master
1,now i have seen the original version and it is very much like the book but it
1,even though it is a little bit of an action film it
1,i have seen this movie twice
1,nice to know that this is the only movie i 've seen in
1,there are a few good moments in the movie
1,it 's not even the worst of
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,so i was expecting something like this
1,the movie is about the same subject matter and the same story
1,another thing that i did n't like about the movie was the fact it was a movie
1,i have seen the original version of the original and it 's a great movie to watch and i will definitely buy
1,given that this is the only movie that i have ever seen that has been released theatrically in the past decade
1,dudley moore plays the part of a man with a conscience
1,well i guess i was n't expecting much from this film but i did not
1,this movie is a complete mess
1,totally different than the first film and the second
1,not to say the movie is a complete mess but it 's a good movie
1,you know that it is a good movie
1,at the same moment i was a bit skeptical about the film
1,it 's not even the worst of
1,but it is not a movie that you will never see
1,the film has some of the most
1,and it 's not a bad thing
1,it is not a movie that is so bad that you ca n't help thinking it
1,this movie was so bad it 's
1,if i were to give this a 1 i would have to
1,the movie is about a group of young people trying their luck in a small village
1,the movie is about the power of a young man who is a struggling man
1,that 's the way i feel
1,i was n't impressed with this movie but it was a good movie
1,i have seen this movie several years and
1,a lot more than the sum of the parts
1,then the film switches gears from a few moments of the film
1,i was surprised to find out the movie is a complete waste
1,he is the most talented actor of
1,i have seen this film twice
1,mr bean is the best actor in this movie
1,the film is about the same subject as the first film
1,but it is not the best movie i have seen
1,in fact the film is a bit too long
1,while i was n't expecting a lot of it and the movie was a bit slow paced
1,nick stahl plays the role of the young woman who is the only one who has a chance to get her hands on her and
1,first of the film is about the
1,such as a film with a very good plot
1,dont even bother to watch this film
1,but it 's not a bad movie it is a good film
1,still it is n't that bad but it 's not
1,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,the movie is a bit of an action film but the action scenes were very good
1,i have seen the original movie and it is very good and very good
1,i was n't expecting much of a film
1,it is a shame that this film has been released theatrically
1,and the movie was so bad that it made
1,the film is about a group that has a very
1,here is a movie where the characters were
1,this is a movie that is not only the
1,the movie is about the same subject as a book
1,i have seen the original movie
1,about a year later he 's the one who is the one who is the father
1,i was surprised to find out that this movie was made for the
1,both the actors and the actors are all excellent
1,the film is about the same thing about the man who is a loner
1,otherwise the movie is not a good one
1,shocks and a few others are the same as the
1,from a technical standpoint it is an interesting movie
1,but the movie is a little slow
1,i was surprised that this movie was n't made available on
1,oh and a lot of the movie 's characters
1,you know what to expect and you 'll be able
1,the movie is about the same subject matter and it 's a story
1,allot more than just the same old man with a heart and a sense that he 's a great
1,all the characters are all likable
1,once the film is finished we see the whole family struggle and the family 's relationship
1,but the movie is not a complete
1,the film is a complete waste
1,and the ending is a little unsatisfying and the
1,through the whole film the film has a very interesting and interesting story and the acting was superb and i liked the way the characters developed
1,it is a very good film and it is a shame because it is a very good film and
1,this movie is not for everyone but if your looking for something like a good movie then this is the movie for me
1,this movie was a waste for the whole family
1,the movie was shot on a low budget
1,the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,this movie was a complete waste
1,romantic comedy with the usual suspects and the usual clichs
1,moments of dialogue and dialogue are just a little weak
1,practically every scene in the movie is so bad that it makes it impossible to sit through the entire movie and it is
1,lines like this are not funny
1,the film has a lot of action in the background and the film has a lot of action
1,the film is about a young man named kenny played
1,and it 's a good thing
1,i have to admit i did not like this movie but i did not like the film because it had
1,there is a lot of action and the story is very interesting
1,i have seen the movie and it is one of my favorite movies
1,blah for a few seconds of the film
1,so the movie is a bit of a mess but it 's not
1,this movie was a waste for the first time in my
1,presumably the movie was made for tv
1,this movie was a complete disappointment
1,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,i have seen the movie and i can say that i am a huge fan of the original
1,well the movie was a bit of a mess but i was surprised that it did n't get a theatrical release in the uk and the movie was made
1,sadly the movie has no real purpose
1,my favorite part is the scene with
1,i was n't expecting much from the movie but i was n't expecting a lot
1,the film has a very good story and a good cast but it
1,so i was n't expecting much
1,another problem with this movie is the fact that the characters were not fleshed
1,unfortunately the film is a little slow
1,this movie was a complete disappointment
1,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,the movie was a waste for the movie
1,his performance in the film was so bad that it was hard
1,very good movie and a great film to see
1,it is not the best movie ever made
1,the movie is about a group that is attacked by
1,she 's not the only one who
1,clara 's father and son are the
1,she 's not a bad guy
1,the film has a lot to offer but the film does n't really have a chance
1,but it 's a great film
1,this movie is a complete waste
1,by the end i was a bit
1,there is a lot of violence and violence
1,it 's a shame that the movie is n't available on video
1,we are supposed for the characters to develop their own motivations and motivations
1,there is no reason for this to be made
1,i have to say i was n't impressed with this movie but i did n't think
1,once the film is finished we see a lot more of the film and the way the story progresses
1,directed by a great actor who is in the movie business and the movie industry is a great actor
1,the film has some of the worst dialogue ever
1,i was surprised that this movie did n't have a theatrical dvd release
1,this is a very good film
1,and it 's a shame because it 's a great film to watch and
1,we have to be careful of this movie
1,the movie was shot on location and the acting is so bad it
1,if i were to rate this movie a zero it would have made a 0
1,the film has a very good story line
1,with a supposed beard and a beard that 's not a bad thing it 's not even a good movie but it is a good
1,the film is a complete waste
1,and it is not the worst movie i have
1,the film has a lot of action and a few moments of humor
1,but the film is not as good
1,you can tell the story of the
1,after the movie was released the film became a success of
1,later the film is a little bit too long
1,and the ending is so bad that i
1,i was surprised that the film did not have a chance
1,then the film switches gears and we get to the point of the film and then we get
1,the film is a complete mess of the first film
1,the movie is a complete waste of my life
1,and it 's a shame that the
1,there are a lot of things to say
1,it is not the worst film ever made
1,kathy bates plays a woman whose husband is
1,jack lemmon is a fine actor and he 's a good actor
1,if you want to see the movie you will find it a little too slow
1,this movie was so awful it 's
1,despite being the first of the series to be a great film it is a great
1,i have seen this movie twice and it
1,i have to say i was n't impressed by
1,the film is about a group that is
1,unlike the first movie the characters were so stupid and so annoying
1,the film is a bit of a bore
1,the film has a lot to offer and is a good example
1,come to you how much you love it and you 're in for something different and
1,we are supposed for the most to see this film and the viewer is not
1,that 's what i got from the film and
1,the movie is a bit slow and boring
1,for a film about a young woman who has a boyfriend who has been cheating for a life of her life
1,i was n't impressed with this film but i was n't expecting a good movie
1,the film is about a young man named kenny who has been sent into the world of his own family
1,it 's a very funny movie
1,also i think that it is the most beautiful
1,there are a few good scenes in the movie but it is n't enough
1,yeah it 's a little bit of a stretch but it is n't
1,oddly enough it is not a movie
1,besides the acting is n't bad either as a result of a
1,this is a movie that i can recommend to everyone who
1,the movie was a bit of a mess but it 's not
1,i was surprised that this movie was n't released theatrically in theaters
1,the film has a very good story and the actors and actresses are great and i think the director should have done a lot
1,although the movie is not as good as the first film i have n't read the novel so
1,the film is about a young man named kenny who has a son and a son
1,the film has some of the most
1,first of all i have to say that this movie was
1,i'm a big big fan of the original
1,william wyler is the master and the
1,from a very young man to a man who
1,another problem with the film is the lack of any shred of character development and
1,morris is a great character actor
1,this is a movie that is n't
1,i'm a fan and have seen a few movies in the past few months but i have seen this one and
1,or maybe it 's the fact that the film
1,alongside a few other movies i 've watched in my lifetime and the ones that have made this one are not
1,if you 're looking for something to watch in a film you should watch this movie
1,nobody is a big part in this
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,neve is a great actress and i
1,we have to be careful of this film
1,they 're all very good and have some
1,the film has a lot to do with a plot that has a few twists but the story is n't that good either
1,so the film is not as bad but the acting and
1,this movie was a waste for me
1,joe don is a very good movie
1,i have to admit i was n't impressed by this film
1,all in all this is a very good movie
1,the film has a lot to offer but it is n't
1,cleanliness and love is not a movie for everyone who is not a big fan of hers and the film
1,let 's just hope that you will get a chance to watch this movie
1,some people say that the movie was made in the us and it 's not
1,since i was a kid i was n't really sure whether this was a bad film
1,i was surprised that this movie did not get a wider audience
1,i have to admit that i was n't impressed with the movie but it was very entertaining
1,people who have n't read the book should be aware of this movie
1,some people say that the movie was made in a very low budget and it 's a bit of an insult
1,so i was expecting a good movie
1,this movie is a complete mess
1,overall this is a very bad movie and i would recommend it to any fan of the genre
1,i was n't impressed with this film but it is a great movie to see
1,if i had to watch this movie i 'd have been
1,this movie was so bad that it
1,dixon 's father and his son 's daughter is the daughter of a wealthy family who
1,i have to admit that i was very impressed by the film
1,only a few minutes later the film has a lot to offer
1,yes the film was shot on location in the middle east but it was filmed
1,his performance is so good that it is hard to imagine anyone who has seen
1,after a while the movie becomes more like a comedy than an action film
1,i was n't impressed by this movie
1,there is a scene in which a woman is stabbed
1,and the ending is so stupid and stupid
1,what is the point of this movie
1,so i guess i 'll be a fan of the original series
1,there is a lot to like in the film
1,i have seen this film twice and i still have to say it is one that
1,do not watch this movie if you are
1,nope this is the best of the
1,guess what it 's all about
1,the film has a very good cast and it is a very good movie to see
1,it 's a shame that the movie is n't so much a little more of a thriller
1,she is the only one to be able to find a way of life
1,these are the only reasons why i
1,and the ending was a bit abrupt
1,you can see the director mateo 's character in the beginning of this film and he 's a very nice guy who
1,amadeus is a very good movie and i think
1,lloyd 's performance is a bit stiff
1,a few of them were good but the story is n't as bad as they could 've
1,the movie is about the power of the human
1,i was surprised that this movie did not get a wider release in my dvd collection and it 's a shame that the film is not available
1,i was n't impressed by this movie
1,i have seen the movie twice and i can tell you that it 's
1,the movie is a bit of a mess but the story is so bad that you ca n't even make it through the whole thing and
1,consequently the film is a little slow
1,perhaps it was the fact that the movie was shot in the middle of the desert and it was shot in the same way as it did
1,you can tell the story is a bit
1,some people have commented that the movie was made for the first
1,erika eleniak is a very talented actress
1,but it is not the worst film ever
1,my favorite scene is where a man is talking to a woman and says oh god i love him and i love the movie and he
1,these are two of my favorite movies of the last 10 or so
1,the film has some good moments and some good acting
1,this movie was a complete disappointment to me
1,the movie is a bit of an insult
1,as a matter the film is not a complete waste of film
1,and it 's a shame that the
1,as for me it 's a very good film and
1,demme 's direction was a bit slow and i was left wondering why the actors did n't seem like the actors in the movie but they were n't really the actors that
1,little britain has a lot to do
1,this movie is not for the squeamish
1,on a positive note i think the film is a bit
1,and the ending is a little too abrupt
1,the movie is about the power and the
1,as for the acting i think the movie was very bad and i
1,really the movie is n't a complete waste of film and time and time
1,in the end the film is not a complete disaster but it is still worth a
1,that 's the way it is portrayed in the movie and it 's not even
1,hitokiri is a film that is a mustsee for all
1,whoever wrote this script is the only person to be killed
1,i was surprised to see that the film was released in the us
1,it 's not even the worst of
1,i was n't expecting a movie about the evils of the holocaust but i was n't disappointed by the film and the acting
1,it 's a shame because it 's not a
1,really it 's not a movie that is so boring that it is n't funny
1,the film is about the struggle between a man and his son who are not
1,haha i do not know what to say
1,anyone with a modicum memories and a brain can be able
1,how could it be that the movie is a little bit of a mess and it 's a shame that the movie has n't got a theatrical release
1,stunning cinematography and a great cast of characters that are all in the film
1,the movie was a waste of my time and money to see this
1,maybe it 's because the movie is so bad it 's good
1,afterward the movie is about the same thing that i have never
1,i'm a big big admirer and this is a movie
1,cue the film as a whole
1,in the first movie he is the one that is n't
1,the film is a complete mess
1,on the other hand the movie is a little slow and boring
1,on a positive note the film has some nice shots and some nice shots of the town and
1,this is the worst film ever
1,of course there is a scene in the movie where the two brothers are walking
1,but it is not the worst film i have ever seen but i 've been a fan of the original and
1,for the most part it is not a bad film
1,unfortunately the film is not a good
1,it is not a film for everyone
1,i was surprised that the movie was made in a time where
1,strangely the movie has some very funny moments
1,and it 's a good movie
1,tweety 's character is a bit of
1,well the movie was a bit too long
1,i have seen this movie twice and i have never been so impressed
1,and the movie was a complete mess
1,problem is that the movie is not a good movie
1,occasionally the movie has some good points to it but it 's not
1,the movie is a bit slow but the story is very
1,winkler 's performance is very convincing and the film has a great cast that is very
1,as for me it 's not a bad film but the fact that
1,meg ryan is a great actor
1,it 's not a movie that you will see in a theatre
1,st is a good guy but he is not the one to blame him for
1,i was n't impressed by this movie
1,all in all this is one that should have had a bigger budget and it
1,the film is a bit slow and the ending is a little unsatisfying
1,intertwined in the first place is a very interesting and very moving film
1,now i know i 've been a little harsh
1,chuck norris is a good actor but his role is so bland that you ca n't help thinking he 's just a bad actor
1,this movie is a complete waste of time and a waste
1,arau is the best of all of the two
1,none the less it is a movie that will
1,that 's what i got from this movie and
1,just like the first film the story is a little
1,truthfully the film has a lot of potential
1,the film is a bit slow and boring but it is a good movie to watch and enjoy and a great time
1,if i had to watch it again it would be the one that was n't
1,this is a movie for those interested in the genre
1,but the film 's main flaw was
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and a waste of
1,the film is a bit of a bore but the story itself was very interesting
1,it 's a very funny movie and i
1,i was surprised that the movie did not get a wider audience
1,there is no reason to see the movie and it is n't
1,do not watch it for yourself
1,i was surprised that this film was made
1,shots are shot in a way of showing the camera work
1,towards the end of this film the audience was laughing hysterically at how bad the film was
2,we are shown that we do n't have the usual hollywood fare that we are used in for the first time and the next one is a little bit of an allout piece of fluff
2,the story is about the adventures that
2,if you have n't read this review you should see this movie if not the funniest
2,the acting in this one is very good
2,great movie for those of you who are
2,with a supposed budget of about the first
2,the film was very good and the actors were all very believable
2,and it is the most disturbing thing i can
2,the story is a little too convoluted for its own good but the acting is n't as
2,but it is a great movie that will
2,you can see this film on tv
2,after the first half of it it was n't even funny
2,later on he finds a bag in the middle and finds a new body
2,and it was a good idea to
2,i do n't understand why people would like this film
2,then the movie starts and ends with an interminably boring ending and the
2,the story is very good and there are
2,and it is a good thing that the film has
2,there 's a lot going on in it
2,it was n't that great but the acting was good and the story was great
2,kathy bates was the most beautiful actress i had ever witnessed and i have ever seen her in
2,jack frost was the first movie in a trilogy of this kind to be released on video and it was a great movie
2,if you have n't watched this movie you 're not sure what to expect from this film but you can tell that this is the only movie that has the guts to be a good movie and it has a great plot and great acting and a very good plot but the movie just does not work
2,this is one of them and i have n't even mentioned the name of this show and i think that
2,despite the fact that the movie is set in the same time the characters are very different from the book
2,i do think that it is a little too much for me to be able
2,i was n't expecting much of this
2,the acting in this movie sucks
2,unlike the previous two films this film is a complete failure
2,the film is a complete waste of time
2,the acting was horrible the directing is poor the editing is worse than a lot more
2,come in a few days to see the movie
2,we 're told that we are watching a documentary that is not as important as it is
2,the film is about the same people who are in the war and the us government and how the government is in their prime
2,for me the best part about this movie
2,i have never seen any other movies of this caliber that i have seen in quite a
2,the movie is a bit of a mess but it does n't have to be that much
2,it is the worst movie that i have ever watched
2,also a very nice film with the great cast
2,there is a scene where a young woman has sex in her bed and the camera pans up and her face
2,yeah this is the best i have seen
2,oddly the story is not about how the two are in war
2,besides the fact that the movie is a little slow paced with a few
2,this movie is a great movie to watch for
2,what a waste of money and talent
2,the film has a very good story and the actors and actresses are good but not
2,i do agree with those who have not heard the term and read that this is the same kind of film as in other films
2,the story is simple and is told in the most unexpected way possible
2,although i think the film has a very good cast i think the actors are really excellent especially timothy spall and john malkovich
2,how could they possibly have done a remake of a remake of this film and
2,the movie is about a young woman and the woman in a different place
2,the film 's story line was so predictable that it was difficult to believe it was actually
2,first of all the acting is horrible
2,i'm not sure if this film was meant for the kids
2,william powell is the only one who seems able to make this film worth
2,from this movie the story is a little thin and predictable at times
2,another thing i noticed was a bit of the movie 's ending
2,this is a movie for all ages
2,i'm not sure whether it 's a bad movie
2,or maybe it was a good movie for the first half
2,alongside a lot more of a story it 's not a bad movie but it does n't have a
2,if the movie does not have to do with the fact of it 's problems
2,nobody has to worry about this one
2,neve is the only character in which the movie has any depth
2,we have a very interesting story about how to make one 's life and a love triangle between the two
2,they are not the ones in the
2,what 's worse is that it 's not
2,the acting was terrible and the plot just did not work out
2,so i have to give this a 1 out
2,this is not an easy movie but it is a good movie
2,joe pesci is a good actor but he was not convincing at all and he did n't even
2,i was so bored by the movie and i was so disappointed by it that it was n't even funny and i was n't even entertained by the ending
2,all in all a great movie to watch with a group of friends
2,cleanliness is the only thing that makes
2,let me just say this is the most awful piece of crap ever
2,some scenes of the movie are just too much for me to handle
2,since it is a comedy it 's a very entertaining
2,i have n't read the book so it was
2,i do not want to spoil this film for
2,people who have seen it know that they
2,some scenes were just so funny
2,so what 's the point of this
2,this is one of the best of the
2,overall it 's pretty good and i
2,i was so impressed by the movie that i was so bored and confused that i had to register it to
2,if the director had to make the movie and he succeeded in creating an
2,this was a very bad attempt at comedy and the comedy is very funny but it 's still funny
2,dixon 's character is the only reason to see the film
2,i do not know if the movie would be good but it was just a waste of time
2,only the most rudimentary and interesting elements of the film are not present in the film
2,yes the acting is n't good and i 've seen a couple of good movies
2,his character is the best thing i can remember about it in the movie and it is a shame
2,after the movie was done it was just another film with a
2,i was surprised to see that this is the worst film i have ever had the displeasure
2,others do a disservice to the original
2,there 's a lot of action to be done
2,and it does n't work out as the movie is a bit of fun to sit
2,what is the deal with the film
2,so i have seen this movie
2,there was a lot to like about this film
2,i have seen it several many times before i have been hooked
2,do yourself a huge favour do n't waste your money
2,nope i was n't impressed by it
2,futuristic and the movie has a lot of potential
2,guess it 's a bad movie and a
2,it 's a great movie to see
2,she 's a great character actress
2,these are two of us who are the ones who are the best of our generation and that our lives can relate with our own
2,and the ending was so stupid that i had to turn it off
2,you know the drill was going nowhere but it
2,lloyd kaufman has a very good track of his own films
2,a very good movie and i would definitely advise you to stay awake and watch
2,the acting was n't as great but the script was so bad that it 's hard to make a good movie out of it
2,i think the director should be ashamed of himself
2,i was surprised to find that the movie was n't really about the
2,i think that the movie is not as great and it is the only one who
2,the acting was terrible the plot was awful but the actors did n't
2,consequently the story is not very good
2,perhaps the most famous part is that the characters were n't developed in the first movie and they had the
2,you can see this is a very good movie
2,some of the actors are very good
2,erika eleniak 's character is the best actress ever
2,but it 's just a good film
2,my advice to you is that you do not have to see the movie for yourself if it is n't for the good
2,these are the two main points of the film which are not even the most memorable
2,the story of a young boy who moves into a world of his past as an outcast is a bit farfetched
2,the story was n't bad enough
2,as for the rest of the cast i was impressed with their performance in the
2,and it 's a great movie
2,as a result the film is n't a bad movie but it is a good movie to watch and it is worth watching
2,demme was a master of his work
2,little did they know that they were the same person who had to do the same for
2,this movie has a lot to do with a lot of
2,on a positive note the cinematography is very beautiful
2,and it 's not that i do n't like the way the characters are portrayed but
2,where was this supposed to get in
2,the acting is horrible and the story is a complete disaster and i could n't help thinking it was a bad attempt to capitalize on a real story
2,as for this one i was surprised to see that this was a low budget film
2,really it 's a good film but not a good thing
2,in fact the whole thing has a very very bad ending
2,that is what this movie is
2,hitokiri is the best movie i have seen
2,whoever made this movie must 've been desperate for a good laugh
2,i do n't know if this is a good movie or a bad thing
2,it 's just a bunch that you can do a good job
2,they are the best in all of them
2,i was n't expecting much of it but it 's really really good
2,it is a shame that the movie is n't so good as the first one
2,really it does not have to have any real meaning
2,the movie starts with some of a good cast
2,haha i 've heard a lot of people saying that this is the funniest movie i have had the
2,anyone who has seen this should be ashamed of themselves for their work
2,how did this film ever end up in such
2,the movie is a complete failure and should
2,maybe he is n't a good person he is a
2,afterward this is a great film and
2,i'm glad i was able to find the soundtrack to be a good movie
2,cue a great cast and a very good movie that
2,in the end i was surprised to find that this film had
2,the movie was made in a hurry
2,on a positive side the acting was pretty good but the script by eric greene is
2,on the other hand i have to say that i
2,this movie does not make any sense at least not as bad a horror movie as
2,of course he does n't know it but it 's the same old same old
2,but it 's a good movie to watch if you 're a fan 's fan of the genre
2,for the first time in years the british revolution has been released in the united states in order to get the president of the world and the united states
2,unfortunately i have to say that it was a waste of time and money
2,it is a shame to see a good film like this with such a
2,i do not know why this is a movie for kids
2,strangely it is a movie that will make people laugh and cry
2,and it 's the best part of the film and it does
2,tweety 's father is a good guy who gets a
2,well this is a very good movie and a very good one at that
2,i do think that the director was trying too hard and
2,and that 's the problem with the movie
2,problem is that the movie is n't even a complete mess of its kind
2,occasionally i have to say this was one of the worst movies that have been released
2,the film has a lot of potential but i think the film was
2,winkler 's character is so unlikable it
2,as the story continues to unfold in its entirety we have a film about two sisters who
2,meg ryan plays the young girl who 's been married to a man who is
2,it 's not that it 's funny
2,st is a man who loves to kill a man who is a little bit too much of a jerk
2,i think the film has a lot of problems with this film
2,all in all this is a very bad film
2,intertwined in the story and the film is
2,now i have seen this movie
2,chuck norris is an excellent director who knows how he could do this
2,this movie has a lot to it but that 's all i can say about this one and
2,arau 's character was a little bit too
2,none of them were able to get a good idea
2,that was one reason why i did not
2,truthfully the film 's success is to get a bit more attention than the first one
2,the film 's premise is that a
2,if you 're a fan like the ones you 'll love this one is a
2,this movie is one big joke
2,but the story line is so weak that you ca only have to see the film to find out what happened
2,the movie has a lot more action and more action
2,the film 's main flaw of the movie is that it 's not even
2,i have n't seen the movie yet but i do not understand why
2,there 's also some nice cinematography and a nice atmosphere
2,do n't get fooled up by a movie like that you have
2,i do n't think i have ever seen such a bad film as i
2,shots of the film 's most controversial moment are not the best but a
2,towards the end when the movie is finally released i found myself cheering at the screen
2,i have to say that it was the first of the three films i watched
2,in the end the movie is just a bunch of bad actors who are trying too far too hard to get out
2,thankfully i do n't know why i did
2,that is what makes this film great
2,our hero and his friends are a bit of a loser
2,the film was made in the early 80 years of
2,finally it is not a film for the
2,the film is not about an american family
2,while i am not a fan and i can handle the film i do not
2,he was also the most convincing character of this entire movie
2,the acting and the script were terrible
2,the story of the movie is based solely around a young girl named sasha 's mother who is a teenager in a hospital
2,i was so disappointed when i saw it i thought i would give it a
2,though the film does contain a lot of the same themes and other things it 's
2,however the film is n't really a
2,i do n't know why i was n't watching
2,the movie is a little bit of the same for me and i have seen the movie
2,how can i not see this movie in the theater and
2,but it is a very enjoyable movie
2,however the film is not as bad as the original
2,in this case the film has the feel that is the real deal of this movie
2,ivan is the only one to be
2,a lot of the movie has a
2,the story is about an ordinary man and the woman who are searching in a marriage to a man who has to cope with his own death for her
2,my favorite scene is where the guy goes to the bathroom and then he 's talking to the guy who is the guy who
2,i think that the best way to describe this film
2,it was n't that bad it did n't make much of sense
2,it 's a pity that this movie is n't available on dvd or
2,quote the movie is a complete mess with a lot of plot holes
2,only the acting is n't good
2,his wife is the daughter of the
2,at least it has a good cast and some nice
2,the movie was n't bad but i was not
2,like the other two films i have seen in this genre and this one was very disappointing in my opinion
2,what i found most interesting about the film were the performances of the actors in the cast
2,set during the depression and so many people have been there to see the film
2,and the film does a good job of showing it to us and we 're not afraid of ourselves
2,the movie has a great story line and the characters were well developed and i loved
2,the film 's plot involves an aging woman who is a young girl in the world
2,the acting is good the script well written and the story really works very nicely and
2,was he trying to save his wife from being a good one and a bad
2,prot and his men are a little too much
2,for the record the movie was a bit slow but it was a bit too long for me
2,this is a very good movie
2,finally the movie is not so bad that it 's just too boring
2,from the first few minutes to the final scene of events and then to be resolved the film is a mess
2,i think this is a very funny and funny movie
2,flashbacks were n't very good but the actors were very well chosen
2,well i guess the only reason i gave
2,i think it 's the worst movie i 've had ever
2,denise richards 's character is a bit of an actress
2,the story is about a group of young adults living on a deserted island in london
2,but the movie was just a little bit too long and
2,i have to admit that i am very glad i did but i was wrong
2,could you have a better movie
2,he is the most beautiful person in this movie
2,she is a beautiful woman who is not the only one who can act and she 's not a good person but
2,i think this is a good movie
2,you can see that there is a difference to the original
2,a very interesting film about a young girl named jakob whose daughter and her sister are trying to cope and live in
2,instead of being an old school man we have the
2,he has a great sense to the world
2,the film is a complete mess of
2,stunningly funny is one that i would love
2,visually i was n't impressed by any movie
2,a very interesting film with great performances from
2,deniro plays a man who is a bit more subdued than his wife
2,the movie was a little too much
2,that 's the only reason this movie was ever released
2,the film is about a young boy who is sent into his family and his family to get his family together in a
2,those are the things that make a film such a classic and it
2,this film was a total disaster
2,the acting in all the actors in it is superb
2,there are some good points in it but the story is so weak that it is hard to believe
2,death bed 2 is a movie about the life of two
2,it was a waste for this film
2,we are shown to be a little bit of both
2,al pacino was great as a tough
2,a good cast is wasted in their own right
2,as i watched this film the only reason it was so good was because it was so boring it was so bad that it made the movie unwatchable and i
2,the acting is horrible the story is awful and i do have a problem that the director should not have
2,the acting is good the writing is great and the story lines are good enough
2,they are all very attractive and very sexy
2,i have never seen any of these movies in my
2,this film is not for everyone
2,the film 's story line and its execution are
2,i think that 's what i was hoping to see and i would recommend it to
2,i think it would have been a better film but the director was not
2,if you are looking for a good movie with a good plot good acting and a great storyline then you 're
2,the story of the movie revolves around the characters and how their lives
2,though this movie is a little too much like a typical hollywood
2,the film 's main character is a young man who is in
2,the movie is a little slow but i found the ending
2,the acting and direction are so bad it 's hard for me to laugh
2,i was n't expecting much from this film but i did n't think that it
2,i do agree that the film has a good
2,the story was so predictable i could n't care
2,danila is not a great movie
2,bruce dern 's character is a caricature
2,there is a lot of violence but it does n't make sense to
2,if it was a comedy it would be a lot more enjoyable to see
2,dr jacques feinstone 's character was the only reason
2,there are a lot better things in this movie
2,stevens is an excellent actor and is very convincing
2,i think this was a great film
2,no one is going to die but they are not
2,you know it 's not your typical runofthemill slasher movie with a lot to do with a plot line
2,but the film is a very good one
2,alison is not only a very nice actress
2,it 's the story of a woman 's quest to get rid of her husband who 's been kidnapped and killed by an accident
2,as the title suggests it 's an action movie
2,the acting is good with all the characters
2,your first reaction to the plot is that the characters were so stupid and uninteresting
2,well the story is n't too bad
2,what is the difference between these two movies and that is why
2,for a long time he is a very handsome
2,from the first episode i was hooked to this movie but i still have to give this movie a 1 out of 10
2,probably the only reason i did n't give a 1 is because the movie
2,and that is a shame because i was a little
2,acceptable to see him in the lead role
2,a good film that is a bit too long to watch and is worth a look
2,blair underwood is a good actor
2,well it has to be said that it 's not a great movie and it is very hard not
2,screen adaptations are the only good ones in the series
2,nevertheless i do think that the director and director should be commended for their work
2,another example of the classic film of the late 1960s when the two stooges and the marx 's were in
2,he is the one who 's the best of the
2,there are some very funny scenes
2,i was so disappointed when i saw this film that it was a very long and boring story
2,he is a good guy but not the best actor in this movie and
2,her performance was pretty bad and the plot was pretty predictable
2,not to mention the lack of a plot
2,but this is one movie you do not need to miss
2,well this is a good thing
2,all in all i was very impressed with the acting and acting
2,not a single solitary character or two of his own
2,2 the acting was n't bad either
2,take the scene with a woman and then a guy with her mouth and her body is n't
2,this is a very good movie
2,of course it does have a few moments but it has to do with
2,many scenes were so bad it could have
2,it 's a shame that this film
2,in the movie he 's a very talented man with the ability and his ability to get the right amount of attention and the way that he
2,he is the one that is the only one in the film who has to do
2,here 's where it belongs to this film
2,i think it was a very good movie
2,every time i watch it again i can say it 's not the worst i have ever watched but
2,the story is a simple and very interesting
2,the movie is a bit slow but it does n't matter that the story is not a little bit of a
2,while i am a huge john lennon fan i am very impressed with him
2,somewhere in this movie is the story of the same woman that is a little girl who has to
2,in the end it is a very good movie that is not just a vehicle but an excellent piece of art
2,after the movie was released i realized that this movie would make a good impression on a movie
2,make it a great movie for those with the patience to see the original and the movie is a great film
2,the film is very funny and it 's very well done and the performances by the
2,i think the movie is very good
2,i'm not going and the other actors are not the same
2,its the best movie that i have
2,interestingly it 's a very good movie and it was very entertaining in its own right and it would have helped
2,the movie is about a bunch that has a
2,answer the question why do i give up on the film
2,she was so good in it so well
2,how did this film get a theatrical
2,i do think this is a good movie
2,secondly it 's a shame that the film has been released on a cheap dvd and vhs
2,every character has their head examined
2,for those who are n't familiar in the history you 'll see that the
2,i think the reason for this is that the film is not a total failure but a very
2,i think this is one movie you should watch
2,in the end the movie has a very interesting story and the characters and the story lines make this a great experience for those who like to watch movies
2,had he not gone to jail to save it
2,scott bakula is the only reason i watched it till the last few years and i still remember that it is a great movie
2,if the director and his wife have a little more screen writing than they are then it 's not a great movie
2,it is a movie of the highest order
2,you can tell the story was a good idea and i was
2,i have n't laughed so many of the people i 've ever seen
2,this is a film that i recommend
2,whether you are the real fan or if the movie has a very funny plot it does n't make sense
2,and i think that the director was making a film
2,i do agree with the other reviewer who commented on the
2,it is a great story and i think it was one of the most memorable movies of
2,he is a man of honor and a great actor
2,johnny is a very talented actor but he 's a good actor
2,the acting was n't bad but the story line is pretty poor too
2,is that the only thing i can remember
2,all i could say were i was watching a movie that i could n't stand to watch
2,the story is very weak the acting was horrible the plot was ridiculous and it was n't funny at all and the acting was bad
2,in the first film he is in the movie and is a very good guy
2,he is a very good character actor but his acting is not very strong
2,this is a very good film and it is one of my favorites to the top ten
2,i was so disappointed that i was n't able in the
2,is the most annoying film ever to be released _EOS
2,my favorite scene is when the girl says that she was the best friend of the movie
2,he is a man who 's been a little over his head
2,anyone with a brain and a brain can relate to a character that is so stupid and annoying
2,he is the one who is the most powerful
2,the story is very simple and it is n't
2,it has to go to extremes
2,but the film has a lot of problems
2,the acting is pretty good and i have to admit that this film has the potential to become a classic
2,dixie and his friends are also the only ones to be able to find happiness in the movie 's story which is the story of a man who is a loner and
2,then there is that scene where he is
2,most people who have seen the original
2,beckett is a great actor but i think he should be more than just a movie
2,the film was shot on location in new mexico city and was filmed with the grainy
2,overall this is a great movie and it is definitely worth
2,the movie has some of the worst dialogue i have ever witnessed in a movie
2,willingly the plot is a bunch of people who go to a remote cabin where their friends live with their parents
2,with the exception of the first half and a little bit of the end it does have its charms but it 's not enough
2,carly and her friends are not as bad as they are
2,only the title would suggest that this film
2,the story line of course was the most exciting thing i 've ever
2,in the first movie the main characters have the most interesting character in
2,do n't be fooled to death in
2,for those who like the original the series will be a bit more fun to view than the original
2,my advice is to skip it from the rental store and rent it
2,let 's face it the story line is
2,the movie was made for tv and the
2,also i thought that the director and the
2,being a fan myself i have to agree that the film is a bit dated but the story and acting is
2,eccentricities were very good but they had to do with a
2,as the movie progresses it becomes a little more exciting
2,man 's angels is the worst movie ever
2,well it is a very good film and the actors are excellent but it is
2,i think that 's what this is supposed to mean
2,lost in the world of the devil 's rejects the movie was a little bit of a disappointment
2,a very good movie with a good cast and an excellent soundtrack by a very talented composer
2,you have to be kidding me
2,the movie starts out very good and then becomes a bit of an allout thriller
2,it is a very good movie and it is a great movie
2,it was a great movie and it had me laughing out
2,labor of love was an excellent film
2,should i be surprised that it has been released on a dvd for sale
2,the story is simple and the story is a complete bore but the movie itself is
2,you know the story is n't a bad
2,in the end it is not a bad idea for the viewer and to make sure they
2,the movie was a bit of a disappointment
2,now i do n't know why i was so impressed by what i saw
2,but the story of the movie has a very simple premise
2,yes the movie is n't bad but the acting is horrible the script sucks
2,the story is very interesting the characters are well written and well acted
2,uh this is the worst movie i have ever seen and it 's a shame that the film
2,it was so bad and so bad that it was actually a
2,you have to be kidding me
2,the movie is a little bit too slow
2,a good film that is not for the faint or the average viewer
2,the acting was terrible the plot was awful and it was n't even funny enough for the kids to
2,so i do n't think this is a good movie
2,those who have read the book should see the book
2,although i think it was one that i enjoyed
2,it was a very good movie and a great one at the same time
2,the film has a lot of good moments
2,a good example is the way the story of how the film was constructed
2,craft is a great film and i think the best thing about it is that it has the best music in the movie and it is the
2,it is not the worst thing i have ever
2,the acting is good and the direction was very good
2,it has the same kind to it that i 've seen in the first two
2,the story was n't that bad
2,the film is a very funny one
2,no matter what you do i can only hope
2,i was surprised to discover how the director managed this movie
2,the acting was n't great either and the script was so
2,it is a great movie and it is definitely not a movie for those who enjoy the
2,from there the movie is a bit of a mess but it 's not a movie that you can watch
2,worst of the worst movies i ever saw
2,the film is a little slow paced
2,no it is the worst film ever to be made
2,it has the most annoying character ever
2,as for me i have to agree with another reviewer that i have seen this film several many years ago on the
2,there are some funny moments but there was no plot line
2,hackman is a very bad guy who has n't seen any of these movies yet
2,the movie is a little bit boring and it 's not that good but the film does n't
2,those are the only reasons i watched this movie
2,one thing that i liked was the fact he did n't have a clue
2,you know that the film has a lot of action sequences and a lot
2,how many times can i say this
2,of course there are some very nice scenes but there was n't enough of
2,my favorite parts of the film include some very good actors and an amazing soundtrack
2,the movie is very well written
2,poor editing bad script poor acting and the whole thing was just plain stupid
2,shylock 's father and the other tenants of his family were killed and killed and killed
2,sex and nudity are not all that good
2,i do agree but i have a soft spot for the story of an american who was in love with the
2,if you want the real movie you 'll probably enjoy the film as it is the only way to watch it
2,other people have commented on how the movie is so bad that
2,there are a few things to say about this movie but the acting and direction of the movie were
2,aging in his first movie and he 's a very good actress and a good actress
2,also the ending was pretty stupid
2,let me tell the same story of a young girl named lena
2,here 's a few of the things that made the film a bit more tolerable and it was n't even that good
2,i have seen the movie several times and it is one of
2,bob hoskins 's performance is the best
2,first of course it has the same effect as the first one
2,i have seen this film several times and have been waiting to get my moneys back
2,unfortunately the script was not as bad as the original
3,very few of the actors in the cast can be a great performer
3,jack and his friends are both funny in their
3,as far as the acting of the director is n't quite so bad he 's just not funny
3,as a matter it 's a very dull film and is a waste of your valuable time
3,it 's a shame to see this movie as an adult classic
3,was he trying too hard and he 's just a stupid guy who ca all over the world and he does not seem to think that a man who likes to be gay is not going to get a good job and
3,bradford is a man who can get a good job
3,so the story and dialogue is very well done
3,the film is not a very good movie it lacks the charm of the original it is not a horror movie
3,so i guess i 'll get a good idea of how bad the
3,may we forget to watch it and not even bother to go out and buy it
3,that 's the only redeeming factor of this film
3,both the actors are so bad and the dialogue is laughable
3,i think it 's one thing to be
3,let 's get it out on dvd
3,still it 's a great film for everyone who is not acquainted with
3,in fact i think it would have been an interesting idea and the director
3,this film does not make sense as a thriller
3,creative performances are n't the best of the bunch
3,precious time to watch this movie it
3,add to that many of you are n't
3,watch out and watch it again for the good acting and a nice plot
3,you have to think that a person who has been a good person can relate with him as
3,however there was a bit of blood in the film which would have been nice to watch but that would be a little more
3,we do know that we are in our
3,maria was a nice actress but her character was so bad that
3,there 's a lot more to it than that but the movie is a little too slow and boring and it 's just too boring to get any closure across the screen
3,get a bit out and out of this movie you can do better than this movie
3,watered back is the film that i would n't want to watch for a very interesting reason and the film 's ending is quite good
3,if you like to see a good film with an interesting plot check the cover of the story
3,in the meantime we get the point to the scene where the two men find themselves in their own hands and they are
3,after the first few seconds i was hooked
3,i do believe this was one that made me cry at the end
3,within seconds of the movie it was an accident and it
3,this movie is a complete waste
3,then the story goes back to the present
3,this film was so awful that we just could not
3,that is what makes it worth watching
3,the story was so bad that i could n't care more what it did to my friends
3,there 's not enough of anything but the movie just has some very good ideas and good acting
3,so if you do not know it is
3,however if i had n't seen it i 'd give
3,it was n't the first movie to show that there was a sequel but there was one
3,the plot is simple and there is no character development
3,we 're talking about our mothers who are supposed to be gay but we 're so stupid that they
3,the film is a very interesting and compelling experience to start with the acting is fine
3,in short this movie has the potential to
3,a few days after the movie is released i found myself wondering why i had to watch
3,though it 's a very poor movie it is not a bad thing
3,first i thought this was a very low budget film but it was n't a bad movie i do have
3,director james cromwell made this one in the series but
3,the plot of the movie and it
3,for the first ten seconds i had no interest
3,he does not have a mustache
3,one thing that made this film a success is the fact the filmmakers have a very small budget
3,it 's a pity that it has been canceled in a few decades and has
3,and then the story of the two musketeers and the mutual
3,after the first twenty min of this wretched production
3,we see that the film is going to be a spoof and the film itself does n't really have anything to recommend
3,it is a shame because of this film
3,another example of why the film is so good
3,does n't anyone know that the real killer and her husband had
3,as a result the movie is a little too long to have been made
3,there are many scenes that are funny and i can understand where it
3,if this is a good film you will enjoy it and appreciate it more than i did
3,meanwhile a couple who are trying to escape from the city decide to go
3,at least that 's my thing i do not think that this film is
3,you know you 've done this before
3,the story is n't really bad and the acting is n't good
3,i do not see how anyone could find such a bad movie
3,moonwalker is an excellent film and i would love
3,no wonder it does not even make a movie
3,if the plot was n't bad it 's not even good enough to be a comedy
3,location is the most important aspect of the movie which is very effective
3,i was so excited to see this one
3,that 's the only reason i give it a 7 out 10 and that was that i liked this show so it was
3,in my mind i have to see this movie again and i will be in it
3,this is a movie you could watch with the kids and the kids
3,and that 's all the point
3,i think that if you are a huge horror movie fan
3,is it that a film can be made
3,the film was made for television but it was a bit too long in its own way
3,horrible movie and bad movie made for it 's budget
3,the story is so predictable that it is hard to understand how much you love it for a moment
3,sometimes he is not a master and i am not a fan
3,there really is no reason to watch it at all unless your a christian fan of the genre and the casual
3,the story line was pretty good
3,i would have to say that the acting is so bad it was n't funny
3,we see this in our eyes and we can feel that our world we 're going to be a bit like the one we live in
3,incidentally the movie is set for the new millennium and it is a big deal to watch
3,unbelievable and boring the only good part
3,anyway this movie is a waste of time
3,that is the main reason why this film was so bad that it would n't
3,the first half is pretty bad
3,i was a little skeptical when it came out
3,of all the films that were made during the 1960s and the early 1930s this one is very hard to understand but the film does have its
3,a lot more than just some kind it is a very good film that is very entertaining at the beginning
3,i was expecting it to be a comedy
3,think the film is just a little too much to say
3,having a conversation with his daughter and a woman he is still in love with him in the first place he sees
3,helping it out with the first three minutes of the film
3,apparently there was nothing wrong with that one
3,this is n't the only film in
3,the story is a little weak
3,i 've seen better acting in elementary schools with all of his friends
3,hats off the cast and crew
3,the acting is n't bad either
3,babes are the ones who really want to get their money back
3,2022 and other people who have not seen a movie have to be very critical of their
3,and the movie is a total mess
3,to sum it up this film is an insult
3,the story line is not too bad and the movie just
3,i was a little skeptical when the movie was released on a whim in a video store
3,mr beetle is an excellent actor with great skill in acting
3,carradine is a good actress but he 's pretty good as the villain
3,but it was not enough to save the movie
3,and if i were so bored i
3,the movie is a very interesting piece and the acting performances were great and i think the best way was
3,i do n't know why i never watched it
3,for instance the movie was about a young man who gets his revenge on his friend and gets the money for his daughter 's family
3,as for his acting in the first film he is the most talented character ever
3,naturally a film with a very weak plot and an interesting premise and some good acting performances by
3,it 's all pretty good and it 's pretty damn good
3,it 's a pretty funny movie
3,the first thing that struck me was that the
3,if you 're going for a good horror you might be disappointed but you do have to watch it
3,still there is a scene where he tells that
3,on a positive level though this has to rank as one of disney
3,so it is n't that bad
3,here 's an example of why people are n't allowed a movie to
3,they have the right to tell you a little bit of the story
3,i was n't expecting a sequel and
3,i was so shocked that the dvd release was so bad
3,the film does a lot of stunts and the acting in general is very good
3,the script is so bad that i actually laughed at times
3,her performance is very well done and
3,the only reason this movie works is
3,so it 's not as funny to watch but the movie itself seems to be a spoof of a film that i 've seen before
3,william holden and james cameron are both very likable in their supporting characters
3,as i watched it i had to watch a lot and the first half
3,i was a bit confused by the end of it
3,bonafide cinema has a great cast and a great cast but i found it to a very interesting story
3,you could see a great deal of talent in a movie like this
3,but it was also a great movie to watch
3,looking at the film for a good time i was a bit surprised that it
3,this movie has nothing new to the series or the plot line of the book
3,laurent is an old man with the right luck and he makes a big mistake in his own life
3,this film was so bad and the worst thing i 've to say about a
3,no one else has the chance for that one
3,honestly i did not expect much
3,instead of having a party of a guy who is supposed
3,this show was the first show to show how a family can show that they can be very
3,i think you should see the movie
3,this film is a must see for all ages
3,the plot is a mess the acting and the story are bad enough that it is not
3,the film is a great example for the genre genre
3,to the end the film has its share in the end and is n't exactly the worst movie of it 's kind
3,i have to say it was very funny
3,when the movie was done and it seemed to be a movie that was made for tv i was surprised by the fact it was filmed in england
3,it 's a shame to see such a bad movie
3,the only thing that could make the movie worthwhile is the ending
3,i do recommend this film to any one who enjoys watching
3,what i did n't see on television was the way the director
3,however i do recommend you see this film
3,multiple times it 's a little slow and boring but i guess there is a
3,pintilie is n't the greatest movie ever but it 's a fun ride
3,i'm glad i watched the dvd i had
3,this movie had no redeeming qualities in
3,the plot and the way they do n't make up the
3,i was a young girl and i really liked the show it
3,the only reason i gave this film
3,bennett is very good as the conflicted wife who loves him
3,a few people will have to see it to get some insight to the story
3,the acting and the story are so weak that you can actually
3,i think the movie is really funny
3,this one is n't really funny at all
3,spoilers alert this film was a bit of a disappointment
3,a few of the scenes in which the characters are introduced are not
3,it is an interesting story and it 's still very good at the beginning of the series
3,the film is also about two young girls who have a reunion together in a small town in paris where each other 's friends have sex problems to each others and their relationships and their relationship are explored
3,the story of an ordinary girl who gets to a point where a young woman is murdered by a
3,foolishness is the story of a woman named clara
3,that is where it belongs and you 'll never be watching it again on tv anymore and
3,this is one that is n't even close to any other movie
3,36 stars of this movie are the two leads
3,the acting was terrible at best and the plot line was a bit weak
3,whenever i read a synopsis on imdb i said that he was the best in the movie and the film was very funny and had
3,she does n't want to get away with it
3,but it 's not a great show
3,how the film could have had so many different elements would be made for it
3,well it 's a very simple movie
3,yes the acting is good but the story line was n't really bad enough
3,consider the story and the acting it was good
3,i think i have to say it
3,if i wanted the money back i will be able to locate the entire production of this movie for the
3,most films are supposed to be funny and they were made
3,all the while i am a fan of the tv shows of the 70s and 50s but it 's not as good as some other movies that i know and
3,during this time the only person left out was the woman who had a crush on the family
3,you 're in for some fun
3,i think i 'll give this movie a 10 and
3,if you want to watch the film you might want to check out what it means you 're in the
3,i 've seen this movie over and over again
3,nearly every aspect has a plot twist that
3,abel is an amazing character but the movie is very poor at best although the acting was pretty wooden
3,should it have been a movie that had more than enough
3,recognition has to be the one to make sure the audience does n't have to sit and talk about
3,we get a few chuckles but the story is so bad that you wonder why they made it
3,it 's all so boring and boring
3,just because you are in this film you do it right
3,if i were a kid it could have been a great film
3,she is a very beautiful actress
3,they 're also the best of them and it 's hard not to believe that they are in
3,but there 's no denying the story
3,and if you 're looking to see this movie you will be able for a real good film
3,all of the actors seem real and believable as they are
3,this is one of the most enjoyable
3,ever since the days of my childhood and i have been looking to watch a film
3,then there will be a lot of
3,granted it is very difficult but that 's all i have to say but the film is so bad that i could never sit through
3,all the elements were great and the ending was a good twist
3,it is a movie that is full length
3,now we get an idea of why this movie has nothing to do
3,needless to say this is a very bad attempt by a very
3,eric roberts is the standout character in any scene
3,based on the book the film is based upon the book by william smith and the author of the book
3,the first time we see a film like this in the theater we are
3,i saw this in the early 80 about 2 years ago on the screen and i was
3,but the film does not really matter in any other way as the film does n't even seem to
3,when the first of the three pax films of the genre of the first
3,unfortunately i was n't able enough to make my mind that this was a movie that
3,i have to say i liked this show
3,izo is a very well made film
3,she 's not a bad actress
3,do not waste time on this one
3,the only thing missing out of the film was that it had a lot
3,check out a few films that have been released in dvd or
3,we are not supposed for a character to develop the motivations of his characters
3,this movie is a must see for anyone who wants something more than watch the movie and not get the
3,everyone else is the stereotype of the characters and it 's so obvious the actors were trying to save the money and
3,he 's just too stupid and the character does n't seem to have any sympathy for any of the other actors
3,first the plot line is a bit convoluted
3,it 's a movie of sorts and the movie does n't make sense but is also the
3,however it seems that the movie is set up a
3,for instance the main actress 's performance is not the best
3,the movie has an interesting story and the good performances are good
3,it was a great show because the acting and direction
3,they have been given a lot of screen time so the audience could n't understand how much the story line was so contrived it would have helped
3,andrea 's character is not a character
3,but this one has to be made
3,this is not only that the film is a complete bore and the acting was n't that
3,job is one of them and a great
3,when the first episode ended this one started out as a sequel to season 1 and 2
3,do n't be surprised by the fact that this
3,not to mention this is a pretty decent movie
3,even though the film itself looks dated and is n't a great movie it is also an interesting and enjoyable film
3,you 'll be surprised that this was made
3,although i do n't think that the film is much more interesting i still ca n't see it
3,the plot is pretty basic a little bit of a stretch of a film and it
3,as for me he is a fine actor
3,it 's a movie that is just plain stupid
3,plus it was n't as if the filmmakers were trying too hard
3,she is the only one in the movie who is a very beautiful woman
3,however in the first part the film
3,no wonder it 's a bad thing that this is the most overrated film i
3,how do they get the funding that a film like
3,nowhere near all the characters in this movie are the ones that are n't the main character
3,noone has to worry that this was n't a good film
3,one can see why the director did n't seem to think that this could be a decent thing and if it was n't for the
3,ac has done a decent job
3,some people might not have the power of seeing this movie as a good movie but not all of them
3,soon they realize their feelings are n't going to be there
3,she also has a good role as an older girl who gets a chance to be married to
3,this film is a complete waste on the
3,the story is simple and the story is so complex it makes you feel like it 's
3,poets duke who is one of the best movies ever and i have to admit that i'm
3,this was a great show and it was a shame to watch a movie so badly made and poorly made
3,knowing how to play a movie that 's not a good thing as a film or movie
3,the plot has a couple of twists and surprises in it
3,every single line of dialog in this
3,visually the story was interesting and i liked the
3,that 's all i can say
3,stay in your head and see a movie like this that will never make it onto your local video rental box
3,but then again that is what we all want to call to
3,talking on this movie it is a great show that should be viewed and if you are an adult
3,i am so upset when i watch it and i have not really enjoyed it
3,paddy chayefsky as a doctor is a bit of an actor and is also quite good at the end of the movie he is a great actor but not all that good either
3,great performances from the actors and an
3,wagner has been hired and brought to life for
3,the film is a bit dated
3,watching it again is the best of its kind
3,kiefer sutherland has been a fine actress here in his life and i have always loved the film and it is
3,there was a good deal to the plot
3,i was expecting the usual hollywood fare to be the most boring movie
3,sonia peet is also great in this movie i have to admit that the acting was good
3,i am a big fan of the original
3,if you are a diehard hollywood fan of this movie you 'll probably enjoy it and will be disappointed at the end
3,songs are n't bad and the music is very good and the
3,yes the plot is not that great but the characters in this movie are very good
3,i was n't expecting to see this show as it was on cable
3,too bad he had n't been a decent actor in
3,nolan 's first film is a great piece of work
3,it 's not the most interesting movie of any
3,well it 's not a great film to be honest
3,movie is a very bad movie with a few actors who are not
3,to my surprise this is a very entertaining movie
3,all in the name is the best
3,naturally he gets the chance to make it and the
3,one thing that i do have to admit is that it is
3,this was the worst movie in the last
3,so i was really looking for this movie to get excited
3,peter ustinov is one of the best characters to ever play a great character
3,the film does have a few things to
3,kids and women should be banned in the states and to see a
3,two of us are left with a feeling
3,as it stands it 's a very interesting and enjoyable movie that will leave you with tears
3,as i said the only thing that kept me on
3,chuck connors is a wonderful actor but it was n't enough
3,the plot was n't very original and the characters were not believable
3,i saw this film when i was young and it was very entertaining
3,this movie is one big joke
3,naturally the characters were so stupid it could be considered a little more interesting
3,dead bodies are the only reason this movie gets the attention to a
3,overall i do not think i 'll ever
3,thank god that this was the only film i had ever heard about
3,the acting of this cast is superb
3,it is one of the greatest films
3,but i think i can say that the story is so awful that it
3,the acting is terrible the plot just plain bad
3,who could possibly do a better story
3,using a very small budget and a few actors to create the
3,that is what happens next and the movie is so much fun
3,much of the movie involves the main
3,i do n't know how to say that this is a very good
3,despite the fact it is a good film the movie does have a lot in its way
3,at least they have to use this movie 's name to describe the whole movie
3,it 's a very interesting story with good actors
3,i was so excited that the movie had been released in theaters and the
3,as far as i know i have to see this film
3,what i really do is that the film is so bad it
3,more likely to be a part in the world
3,the story was good the acting the script everything it was a
3,the film 's only saving grace was to give it the time of day it 's a movie it
3,happy gilmore was a great movie and i loved it so i had to rent it
3,the film is a very funny and enjoyable thriller
3,my only complaint with this film though
3,even the actors do a great job as they are in the movie
3,hence the story is about a woman named sasha who is a young woman who is sent to prison with her parents
3,there are many scenes that are n't funny but the movie is very well done
3,the film is very slow and it
3,when i saw it in my local library i was so excited i decided i was in for
3,the story is a good idea to follow in this movie
3,there 's no doubt the director and writers of this film
3,when she meets her boyfriend in the middle of a busy street the first time she tells him he 's going on a boat to
3,the movie is so bad it is almost impossible to make
3,oh yes that is why it 's a great show to begin with
3,to say that the only way it is a movie that i would recommend it to
3,no one is in touch with his life
3,when the story is not about the characters they are just plain stupid and stupid but they do show that they really have the same sense
3,this movie is a waste of your time
3,though it seems to go on forever the plot was pretty good
3,we see the whole thing and the people who are in it or are the real
3,i was hoping that a sequel to the classic would be the best in the genre
3,with the exception of the film the movie was not even worth watching
3,if the film had a decent cast i 'd recommend it
3,finally the director 's wife who does n't want to do her job is a good guy
3,someone else is a little too young and a lot of the
3,however if you do decide to watch it it will be as funny
3,the movie 's only saving graces is the lack of
3,this movie was a very bad movie
3,i think the film is very funny and it 's a good thing
3,considering the fact the story is not the usual suspects of all that we 've seen in the past several centuries
3,it 's a very good story for kids who want a younger generation
3,they are n't as good and evil or are the ones that were
3,i would n't have liked it even more
3,i am not kidding this film
3,film noir has a lot of problems for the first half and a half of the film
3,it was not the first time the film was released
3,this film is the most perfect one
3,in a way the story was so stupid that it made me feel the pain of losing all faith in my stomach
3,with all of the above mentioned this is a film to see
3,however the story line in the film
3,and the whole idea is a joke
3,it also features many of the most memorable scenes ever captured on the screen
3,only one thing that bothered my estimation of this film was that the story is very weak and not even funny
3,uncharacteristically i have no idea where to begin and why this was made
3,that 's why i gave this movie
3,sadako 's character does a good performance as the villain but this was not a good movie
3,gypsy in the role he is supposed to be playing the character and does not really care
3,these scenes make this seem a lot like
3,heroes are the main points of this movie
3,first off it is a movie of all
3,he 's not a typical hollywood actor but he 's the only person
3,bill nighy as the lead character is a little stiff as it seems
3,again i 've always been looking for
3,other characters were very much like the real life
3,howard hawks and his team of friends who make this film are the best of its genre and i can
3,still the film was n't that good
3,the story was a complete mess of an old movie
3,i'm sure this was a low rent
3,not to mention the fact that the story is n't a little different
3,but this movie was a big disappointment
3,star wars has been used on this show
3,behind the scenes the director and the crew have a lot to offer to their characters and they have no idea what 's coming to each character 's motivations or the plot
3,perhaps it could have used more
3,a good idea to begin and make it a good one to watch
3,it 's a good story but it 's just too dull
3,a few years ago i 've read the comments and it seems to be a bit of a surprise
3,actually if you have a masochistic fascination to make an action film and if you can make a good movie like
3,the first film was a bit of the spoof
3,rebound is a great film that has a lot more heart and soul to it than i can possibly imagine
3,even the most seasoned director john boorman is not afraid for his work as a work of
3,the acting was good the script had some interesting scenes and the acting
3,or maybe it 's the story which is n't really an original
3,i think this movie is one big mistake
3,one of them is the one that makes the movie
3,george c scott is good as the young stud who is n't too much in her own way
3,but it 's not that the story is
3,dakota fanning is the star and she
3,i think that the movie could be good for the kids and adults
3,oh yeah there was a lot of the movie in the movie but there was n't much of it except the movie
3,i have to wonder if this film was
3,now this one was made up by one of the
3,i am not a fan of the movie but i think it is a great movie to
3,some people will be so frustrated by this film
3,i think it would n't have made a better movie
3,mr bean does not make a great villain
3,code 46 is a great movie
3,shot on a tight and with a very cheap looking budget
3,funny but in the context of this story it has a good mix of drama drama drama and romance to keep the audience entertained by the action and action
3,first off this is the worst movie ever
3,all i got is the fact of this
3,or is this the first time i
3,if you do watch this film you 'll be able at the very
3,oh yeah and a few times
3,he 's in it so i ca n't
3,the film has a great cast and a great director
3,check it on a saturday night
3,in the end it 's a great film to see in any
3,robbed and not in an hour and fifteen minutes and the whole film is just too long
3,cecil b mayer has a good role as the main character in the movie and the supporting cast includes some
3,a lot is said that the film
3,and that is why it 's not
3,there are many great movies about the evils in the history of
3,i was n't really interested into the film but it is a very good one
3,i was a bit puzzled with a couple of scenes in
3,so i do n't care about anyone who has a clue about it i would love to know what i
3,the plot is a simple one and a few scenes of the film are just plain awful
3,many people have seen this film and they are just too
3,and if that is what i was looking for to
3,the acting was horrible the characters seemed like an idiot and there are so many things in
3,with that said this movie is not for everyone
3,i have seen many bad films in the last few months but
3,my favorite part of it is how a person 's
3,could n't they have made a better choice for
3,the movie has a good cast and a nice pace to the
3,that was a very nice surprise and this movie had some good parts
3,viewers may want to watch a few scenes that are not even close
3,they have to use the same formula and that 's it
3,it 's all about the family of all
3,in a movie like the original the first two
3,worrying about the lack thereof and the fact it 's a movie about a young man who is in a coma and a gay
3,do n't worry me to say
3,not so bad but that 's a good movie to have
3,miller and the other players are all fine
3,probably not a lot of movies are made in which the characters are not very well developed
3,a film that makes it a little too long for a movie of its own
3,the plot is about three couples who meet a young man who is married to
3,then i realized that the movie was actually a remake of a tv show
3,as an added bonus it was the only way to enjoy this movie
3,it 's not all a bad movie and there are n't many other
3,pair and the other characters in the movie were the main reason i was interested to be in the movie
3,there 's a lot going on in this film but the main reason is that it takes a little bit too much time
3,but the real world is not the greatest
3,why do i feel sorry after i saw the dvd
3,you have to see it to find it and i can assure
3,however this film is one to see
3,the film also has an unusual message about
3,its just a great movie but that is all it is worth
3,the first time i saw it i could have been mesmerized
3,this film is a must see for all ages and a great
3,there have n't been any other film in the history of
3,superman is a pretty good character actor who is n't given
3,i do n't see how the film was released in the us
3,bolo yeung and his wife were the best of this series
3,now that 's a big complaint but not the worst movie ever made it 's bad
3,there should not even be any action to make it stand alone
3,ayesha rao is a delight as the woman of a young woman and the supporting role is a joy
3,this film has to offer a good
3,i have never seen a film reviewed by such an amazing
3,yes the ending is not a little bit surprising and the twist ending does not have a very good ending but it is still a great movie that you could see in a theater where you are going to have a real heart
3,there are so many other things i could find wrong
3,however in the end it 's just an hour and a minute long
3,seriously the movie is about a guy getting to the top
3,the movie does not even seem very interesting for a long long time when a person is in it 's own way and is n't really the
3,the plot was a total mess
3,in the case there are some really cool sequences
3,blah i 've never had a nervous breakdown before
3,the film is a bit of a mess though
3,well the movie is not for everyone but if you want to see the best
3,but this was an excellent movie
4,but if you can get the idea that the story of a good story
4,this is what happens next in the middle of that period and the film has
4,first of all i'm sorry but i have n't read all of the reviews on that page
4,in my opinion this is a very well written movie
4,strip in seattle with a little more substance and wit is what keeps your
4,oh and you can see how the story is set in the
4,not only has she 's a bit of a bitch but it 's not the movie to make a point for herself
4,anything is this funny and not the least
4,i had to stop and watch it
4,the acting and story all work
4,every character who is so stupid that you will laugh
4,he was the first and still in the right movie to
4,he does not show us his face in this movie and he is
4,although the ending is somewhat predictable i did n't care
4,i am surprised by the positive reviews posted
4,the film begins to go into a very serious and very
4,i was n't impressed by the acting or lack of direction in this movie but i found
4,i do believe that all the actors did
4,i love the idea that the character has some sort of connection
4,spoofs for example were the only thing that was n't really funny
4,the story of this film has been done so well in many different aspects as well the director should have been able for
4,i was n't in the right mood
4,its only one flaw that i felt was the end of an era of the movie in which to connect that
4,so do n't expect to see a whole lot to see
4,there 's not enough of that in it to recommend it but for me i found this film to a little
4,this is a really good movie from beginning to the end that is a bit disturbing
4,the plot is basically about three kids living together in an asylum
4,so if you have any luck this is the movie for them to watch
4,then again we got the point to the
4,there 's a bit of blood as well as the occasional gore scenes
4,it 's not that i am wrong or to watch it to the end of the show i wo by now
4,this is a very good movie
4,michael keaton plays a tough detective with an unusual and intriguing role but he
4,the whole film takes you through the whole mystery and does n't even seem very
4,everything i know about this movie
4,for example when you get it off to the tune it 's just a movie with lots more
4,and i do think that if i did n't see it in
4,while it lacks the feel it was filmed in and of those that are the most
4,by the end of the film the viewer gets involved
4,a very important film that was also made in the us and early
4,the story is not that bad
4,now there are no more than 3 scenes of dialog in
4,madison was a good actor too
4,in the end this is more of an ensemble piece than in
4,maybe it 's because that 's the only reason for making this movie
4,rusty seems like a young man with a sense that there is a
4,tommy was at his best and probably could have been made for a few people who have always had a decent time
4,only one can take a bit of a twist that makes this a movie
4,the movie is a waste but i can remember it being a film of a good
4,one could also get the fact that they were all making their own way across the
4,granted there were some parts that could have worked but it was never funny just
4,yang 's character is a caricature of a man who has fallen into a hole at the hands
4,there was no chemistry and the characters are so unbelievable
4,an american is a beautiful woman with a heart of strength
4,my son and i were at the front screening of the movie
4,there are a couple of very funny scenes which have been repeated in several movies since the beginning are n't really all
4,most likely the film is n't a good film it 's not worth your bother watch this movie and enjoy that i 'll be a bit prejudiced to watch it a movie on your
4,i just finished watching this dvd
4,sweetly acted in terms for this film it is n't just the two men in the world who seem to have been living
4,father 's sister is killed in one day and it appears that the father is going to get the girl
4,this movie is so terrible that it was even worse
4,mgm does n't seem to want any further cash but that is not
4,but i guess it was n't
4,however the director is a good storyteller he 's a master of imagination
4,the characters were n't bad and they were
4,d the story is a bit silly but it 's definitely entertaining the second time
4,anyways what do i know when someone wrote this comment
4,for me the film is a real masterpiece for all of us who want to be more than a bit jaded and have not only seen it in
4,from this point you do n't get to hear
4,spare yourself the pain and regret to see this again
4,jean gabin is a very good actress and is both the character
4,one of the best things about this show was the way the people in the game were in the show
4,it is one of his most famous performances
4,i was n't expecting to see another movie which has been hailed a long way from the original but
4,the story is about a bunch at a time in prison when the family is threatened to be married and
4,it 's hard to believe that any movie like the punisher of the same name is the only movie which is
4,but this could be a decent show
4,the only thing it can do to save is how the film is a little too long
4,i do n't really want all of the comments on this
4,tonight it has a good reputation
4,the acting is pretty good and it is very well paced
4,ewoks for the most of us are either that
4,but this is so bad that it has to do with tact
4,seeing this movie you 'll probably have something else and i say
4,low production i think that 's saying the least thing about it
4,a very young woman who is not the mother herself is the main actress and she becomes the most popular person who lives alone
4,a lot of the movie was shot in color so i did
4,this makes him more sympathetic to his
4,my friend and i were laughing out of the theater laughing
4,this film was not for me
4,robert downey jr has always found himself
4,but when they arrive in the desert they have to make up a little
4,wows and is the best way to describe this film
4,whatever we are in here the film
4,although the movie has a very good cast and some nice cinematography
4,for a film it 's too violent to be believable to us
4,made for tv movies which are the first movies of all time in the life of a man who 's in an element on a
4,by now i'm going to get my criticisms right that a good actor can deliver the same lines but you will be glad to
4,is it really that bad after all these years and so much more
4,this was a movie that was a great
4,but the film has a few funny aspects and there 's some good laughs
4,a movie with a plot which you will like
4,the cast and crew of this movie were very good and i think the movie would have been better if the actors and director were writing
4,to make it worse this was a terrible movie
4,if it is true to that i ca all think i would be able at that in my head of this kind more
4,friz freleng is a wonderful actor and
4,the characters who are also the ones i did n't enjoy
4,three guys in a row that are in a hospital in a remote building where they
4,that 's how much this film 's story
4,it 's just that a lot has been done
4,it is a beautiful tale of love betrayal and a tragic journey to a new era
4,her character was a good choice for her character
4,a young woman who is married to his mother and son of a woman and his wife
4,like a great documentary on the first
4,which is a shame since its release here are not very
4,a couple of other characters have some nice moments but i felt the movie had a lot
4,this was a great game for the family
4,this is the kind of movie you 'd want out of all time 's worth watching
4,so much so that i have seen it twice now but now i have
4,sometimes a movie would show you that this
4,several of the stories are too long for my liking
4,count 's father and son are both the youngest and his parents the mother
4,the acting is bad with bad guys on the screen
4,the acting was horrible with wooden and
4,it is a great story with great performances
4,it is an attempt to capture the real life of this movie but the people who think it
4,as far from i have seen it a couple times it 's pretty boring
4,it 's the best show i ever saw
4,joel woodard was good in his role as a gangster who was caught by a man who 's been trying too hard
4,he has an amazing talent of the film which is the best performance ever
4,the only thing that makes this movie so bad is that the ending just is n't good
4,half of the plot is about a guy
4,donald cuthbert gives a solid performance although she is not as good as her character
4,just for the sake to be a movie i 'd have to rate 10 out of 100 just for being an
4,she was a little too much and i loved her
4,lol and not the only people have
4,as a director i was bored to tears and even bothering to watch all of them through the whole picture which i suppose was not made even if they were n't in some scenes but it is n't a movie
4,being a movie buff myself and my partner i decided to pick this up because
4,in fact this is a great movie
4,i did not know that the plot would have any impact on me but my friends are laughing hysterically in this show
4,they were not able to show a complete piece of the time machine and it 's still
4,it also has a great soundtrack great
4,if you have n't seen this movie do n't bother
4,fine acting by all involved makes the movie watchable
4,we 're led to believe this has been all the rage that they have for their lives and its inhabitants as well as the real estate in their home
4,matthau who plays the hero is excellent in every role she delivers
4,victor is a man who thinks the best way to survive
4,then we get an idea of what is going on
4,the story itself was n't exactly interesting but it was pretty good
4,the acting is great and there are some interesting characters
4,how about that there you have it
4,it is difficult not to waste your
4,it 's hard to say how many times you have been able to understand the whole story
4,when i heard that the show was released in 1988 i was shocked with it 's own agenda and a lot and i found it to be
4,though the script is not as funny a few scenes are quite funny and the story moves briskly with lots of
4,whoopi goldberg is absolutely terrible in the film as usual
4,not that it was funny enough so that all of the comedy 's audience will enjoy this one
4,the plot is n't a complete waste by the fact the movie has a plot that
4,i do n't even want this to show on the screen
4,how many of us are willing with what is on their minds and if that 's only it really happens
4,dad and daughter are not a big hit in their lives but it is a great
4,i was a fan of david cronenberg 's work with the
4,a must see for people who like the genre
4,however i really do think that this was a film that was n't afraid
4,she then is n't that attractive
4,got to that point because we were so happy to end it
4,she was not in the least successful
4,another thing that i think was the fact was that it was just
4,that it was shot by the same guy who made it to my own eyes
4,we all see this movie as an example for the first movie
4,i would like to say this show sucks
4,overall it 's a film that is n't bad its just boring and
4,according the imdb rating and the way they look and how many times they get out of the film and give them the
4,i do n't want to spoil it with this one
4,there are a few moments you will probably notice in your face
4,the film was also shot entirely for the sake which it seems to be to make a
4,they 're not all as bad at the end
4,the only problem was the ending
4,so it 's just a shame that the director was too busy trying to create a sequel
4,he does not make his life too well but that 's all he is
4,once there irreversible 's a group of scientists who have been trained by their own lives in space
4,there have been some good movies like this for a while
4,despite its lack and the overall score of the story is really bad
4,was it just me or what 's the deal in the story
4,there was a lot of gore in the movie and even
4,soon he and the others are killed
4,ben stiller is excellent and the cast is great
4,some of them are just plain weird and it may be the movie that they
4,and the fact that they are on a
4,if he had a chance to show us that he is going to
4,i do n't think that it could have been much worse it just had
4,as for the plot it was just plain awful
4,if you do n't have a shred in mind this movie may be a bit of fun as you might enjoy the fact that it is
4,still the movie is pretty funny
4,i 've seen most of movies that involve them and
4,instead of giving up his character to become a big success and his
4,i have always enjoyed the fact it was so funny
4,essentially it is the worst movie of all
4,second the characters were a joke of a man who really had no talent for what they would have done in the movie and at least the
4,these guys are so good i have to say that they are good actors and this film is really terrible
4,at least not that bad just not funny at that
4,oh that really is n't the thing
4,there is no such thing as a comedy
4,it 's so bad that the characters are
4,this movie is a must watch as well as a film of
4,also the movie is about a guy named jake who looks a little
4,it seems like the filmmakers just decided to write this movie and it 's obvious that this is n't a film
4,i'm amazed that i spent a week watching this movie
4,he also meets up with the king
4,the story is very basic and is full of twists which make you hate this and the way
4,motion and the plot twists make you think a bit
4,in this film we see an older woman who seems very interested and she adores herself
4,you know it has a heart of heart to it
4,it is an odd little film that i have just
4,in other words the dialogue is stilted
4,i would have loved to play this character on a show if i had n't been able
4,not that he was a bad person
4,a few years after the release and many other things in the story are a joke the actors are really awful
4,the first two minutes are really funny and they should be put away
4,i'm not going into this film
4,however if the only thing that bothered us watching this mess was that it would
4,the story has its ups in the last five minutes or so and the action is fast paced
4,the acting and directing as well as the cinematography and editing are excellent
4,and the acting for the first half is a bit stiff
4,the characters are not so great and this was a pretty bad movie if not for all the
4,his son is so annoying that even his own parents seem not to notice to him
4,because i was so disappointed when it came on tv i felt like
4,this was the first of the series series
4,extra of the characters are likable people who are so funny that you have to wonder why they all are not likable
4,malcolm mcdowell has the voice of a character in that piece of paper a man who believes that the woman that he loves is one of his friends
4,the script is n't all that bad
4,but you can get in the way of this film and if there is one thing that will do with it 's original title the entire movie is a bit of a letdown
4,the movie is about as much as if i 've been on a mission on tv i do n't like that
4,i 've read a couple comments that stated the acting is a bit overdone to me
4,it 's really a pity that it never made sense to the audience that we were n't actually
4,now they are a bunch and are able to make a big leap for each and every day
4,ever since this is made to be a classic film with a lot of laughs and a
4,fozzie green has been the worst actress of all time for years and her career has gone through a lot of bad choices in her acting
4,in fact all the supporting cast was also excellent except for a few who were
4,there have been other movies that have not even the same premise but are so utterly dull that you ca
4,ok the movie was a little boring but its not very good
4,what a waste that is the only redeeming
4,the actors play well and seem to have no talent
4,i had never heard of this show before
4,i thought i had watched this film as being in my youth that was a good thing
4,stanwyck and the other supporting characters are
4,but the rest stop is a very bad movie the
4,it 's very difficult to find the story to do to save the day with a pinch of the original
4,three thumbs off from each frame
4,the story is a little farfetched
4,but the film is about some of the
4,it 's the type of movie i can tolerate and not because the plot is
4,director robert altman was in my top ten of his movies and this is one of his best movies
4,not only was it meant to shock
4,a lot more than just the normal plot the characters seem to be just like people 's faces in a movie
4,a film about the adventures that were made on video
4,this movie had everything that made me want to
4,show me that this is an absolute gem of mine so i wo n't have it again
4,bare eyed is not only my favourite movie i also liked and this
4,refreshing to see a good director who knows that the movie
4,with this in mind the filmmakers have succeeded in bringing the film to
4,the story line is not as complicated as
4,because if you want to see a movie that is worth renting and seeing this you will be surprised
4,just because of the way things were done they were also the characters and were real realistic
4,the film is a very entertaining horror film to watch in the end
4,do we just want to see a movie about a young girl who is trying too hard and
4,unlike the original it 's one of a kind of film about the perils that come in the early 1900 years
4,although the characters are not all that funny and the characters do seem to be there there is more about them
4,it 's not that the film has such a poor cast
4,likewise there were many scenes that were very predictable
4,scorcese 's film is an epic story of an artist and
4,the only thing this film has to offer are the very good costumes and locations
4,so why does it always work out why does anyone make such a great movie
4,theres spoilers but there are so many things wrong and this makes
4,the first is a movie that 's a lot more exciting than that of the other sequels
4,what is this supposed point of the film
4,during that point the film takes place on a sunny goose
4,this is not a movie i wish to miss but i 'll try
4,casting as usual is a great touch and a perfect casting choice
4,laurence olivier stars and the rest of us will get the feeling that he is n't the only one who is willing
4,for instance that is the only reason i can recall the fact that there is an obvious lack thereof
4,that said the movie was very poor i do
4,the plot is about love and the city girl and how she can fall
4,the acting is pretty good and some people say that this was bad
4,elfen nam was a great adventure film with excellent acting and a
4,he is not in this film
4,you do not have the feeling that the people in it are just desperate to walk through walls like that and that is n't a bad thing
4,it is a very bad movie
4,here is the story for a young boy who works on
4,gotta be the most boring thing to be made in the first place
4,an interesting film that is the first in the long line
4,on the other side of the law i was n't afraid he did n't have
4,but it could have made for an easy and worthwhile
4,the first of them the two men are not even
4,and i would like to know why a sequel to
4,suddenly after the film finishes with a very young man
4,valjean does not need to be the only person in a prison that has
4,against the backdrop this show is an extremely good piece
4,it 's not a movie that i would watch but if you like the movie then i suggest
4,it would be good to see a sequel by
4,by that i mean there was no real threat to the movie for me because you never
4,100000 has one of the funniest casts ever in the business of cinema
4,john wayne 's performance is the most perfect in this film
4,how could the two protagonists find a man
4,taken from a different perspective this movie has its own faults
4,if you have to see them to be an avid fan do n't watch it because it 's an action film and they are in one 's way of making a movie that has
4,i do n't think that the best part
4,in some scenes i was reminded to see a sequel to the great gatsby series
4,it 's not the kind of movie that would have made it a lot more interesting if i
4,the only good thing about this movie are you
4,he 's just too much in love with the old man he 's been and is n't
4,gerald and john are in fine sync with the film 's protagonist and this is a very good
4,it is not a bad movie it 's not bad it just does make fun and fun
4,most people will probably enjoy the film but it is worth
4,the only good thing this movie had is it 's bad bad bad
4,one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen
4,and there is a plot that is very believable and believable but the script is really
4,they 're not as smart as the other ones
4,and the story is just about the love of her life and the other two are about in her own way
4,first of the time the film finally got started a good start was actually released in 1980
4,and it 's the same old stuff
4,here the film was an experience to me
4,there have been a few changes from the movie in this film
4,for me what the film does have a very
4,each one of us is a true artist
4,at one point there 's a scene where he 's sitting on his bed on the table of a dead woman trying a scene to a night in the back of
4,at this point i was really irritated as it would have been much less interesting
4,just remember that the movie is based upon a true story
4,i have to say that the main character was a very sympathetic character
4,okay it is not all bad but it 's really bad bad awful
4,very funny movie with plenty of action
4,produced and directed in a manner that is an original version
4,yeah i 've seen a lot better
4,i think the best part of this movie is that it has a lot of
4,the script was not even original
4,although a lot of films about people being abused are not particularly memorable and therefore i was quite pleased by the
4,henry fonda is perfect in the role of harry in this film and i hope to learn more from him and he makes a strong character as his wife 's lover who is in fact a different actor
4,there have not been a good deal of horror lately
4,they even had the nerve to put in for the first two thirds of movie because they were
4,it is a film that can be
4,the story was pretty good and the characters did an excellent acting
4,there are some parts where the film seems to just
4,the ending is so abrupt as a result of a ridiculous
4,however the whole movie is a joke and not very enjoyable at the end
4,by the way a few people are just trying to do anything about the world and
4,in the first episode you have a young actress who is a bit of an actress
4,there were so many things wrong with this movie it was boring to me
4,british cinema director ang morris makes an effective cameo on a daily screen and is a very underrated
4,i was also surprised by how awful a film can be
4,which is the worst thing i 've done that
4,this movie was great it is just a lot of fun
4,but it 's all about the acting
4,all the actors were really good
4,watched the movie and the first 15 minutes after seeing this movie was so much more than i
4,associated with the fact he was n't so stupid i felt embarrassed
4,it would be an interesting and difficult subject to say a movie like this
4,i have not seen any of the books on this website since i first heard of this one in a hurry that was shown as part of
4,this was the first film to have a sequel to this film
4,go rent this movie for a laugh and enjoy
4,if you want a great film then rent it or watch the original
4,nonhorror is a good guy but they did n't show it to a bunch
4,if you are in the mood for a funny good and
4,what you would think was a very good documentary about a guy being strangled by his father
4,keanu hauer and richard pryor have been very menacing
4,so if you have a taste of this film
4,a film that should be released as soon as possible is a mustsee for the eyes of all involved a classic gem for a long time ago
4,paige also gives the first two
4,this film has to be one of those
4,besides it has a good cast and a really great story
4,but the film is n't very interesting at all and it is also very hard to find a plot or story
4,so the two begin to go into oblivion and the
4,it is a beautiful movie that you wo
4,the plot in this movie is very similar to a series where the main characters are in a coma
4,incest is what the show does but
4,the cast is good but the characters and the situations of
4,and i did n't like it either
4,the only character worth mentioning is the way he gets back from the dead of the apes in that he 's also a very handsome guy
4,but if you enjoy the original film it will be too easy to follow
4,mathieu 's mother is a real mother a man who is not in love with
4,we see that the film is not only one or more of the
4,henriksen is one of those actors who ca n't act and that is a big mistake
4,foxes is a movie that has been a great success for the past 20 years
4,here i think that it must have made
4,he has a long long line to work with
4,aykroyd has to make a good movie
4,so the only way to get a movie made was a bunch of kids who could make money in the industry of school
4,however the movie really works at all
4,well it 's an important part but in
4,the plot of the movie is very interesting and there 's some great acting in
4,my only complaint was that the characters were a bunch of clichs
4,there is n't a single word that has any redeeming qualities whatsoever so why did i waste my
4,and i love how the two men react in the very end because they do n't know what to believe
4,anyway what really matters is the movie itself
4,it is n't long after that one of the three sisters arrives after a man 's sister appears
4,the main problem with the film was the casting of a group of young actors with a script which is n't all that
4,i really wanted my money back
4,i had not even laughed so bad that i could forgive
4,millions in time and then the whole movie comes together like a bunch and the audience is n't even that interested in the
4,the film is also very funny
4,funny and funny at the same age
4,and as for the rest it would 've gotten worse as it went along in such a short time but hey so is the film 's ending and a couple of scenes that have
4,and if you are the only person on
4,she had a great talent ahead of her
4,pick a guy a movie camera and you 've got that
4,some of the acting is awful except for the camera work on the
4,they just ca all of them have an eye on each other
4,warren beatty in particular is great and is great as always
4,i was surprised at how many things in the movie
4,this may have been a movie with the exception of a bad film
4,3 the movie is about three families living in the same hotel at a party
4,the only real gripe i have was the constant lack of a
4,this is a movie that has absolutely none of a plot
4,the first is the fact that it was shot in the same location and the movie made a long time
4,i was expecting my mom to watch the movie
4,contrary to those who are not really interested into the work
4,without giving him any kind of power he would make it a good
4,hurley has a very small role as a very beautiful actress in this film but it 's all pretty forgettable
4,i had no clue what this film had going on it is based around
4,finally the plot of this movie is so bad it makes one
4,the director 's vision is very poor
4,i thought that maybe it is unfair that this film is not as powerful as
4,the only good bit of trivia is the song
4,this is n't a bad thing as
4,el mariachi is one of the finest movies i
4,throw the blame into this film which is really what the film is trying for
4,we can only laugh to see that in this movie there is no such a character in a movie that will
4,this was a very moving piece and there are some good scenes
4,his character had a certain charisma
4,they should also have a few episodes of some scenes and then
4,the characters are likable and the cast all have a great chemistry that it
4,i saw him in his role with some of the same actors and his wife is in
4,in fact the movie did n't have much to do
4,the actors had to play their roles well so they did n't
4,the story is told by some of three people from different perspectives
4,you do yourself a favor that makes it work
4,but then she 's a young girl that is n't even a
4,i have the vhs tapes in their home dvd 's library which makes me think about how the film should come in
4,oh yea i ca least go to the
4,this was a really great movie
4,definitely this film was n't in the top 250 as it was a low budget film
4,how does he lose the throne
4,watching the movie i was very glad to find that this has no meaning
4,i do not understand why anyone would want to sit in such an obvious
4,but if you have a choice to go see this
4,perhaps it was the fact i did n't really care for him for the rest
4,the plot twists the characters and situations are not enough to make the movie even remotely interesting or scary at
4,i'm not going to write a comment but
4,sorry i saw that movie and was amazed at how bad it was to the eye of a child
4,reading that 's how i felt this was n't supposed to be
4,i do n't really know how the
4,finally this is the best example of a horror movie i 've ever viewed and i can think
4,the only thing good about this film are other scenes of the film 's plot
4,but i guess i would n't be too surprised
4,you know i am in for some interesting moments of
4,the film is an entertaining film that is not even funny
4,and if you liked any movie you are n't
4,the first episode was an awesome episode of season 1 episode
4,this is a movie that will be forgotten for many years
4,made this a few months before the opening credits i
4,you will find yourself thinking about it
4,will we just go to bed or
4,other scenes are a little contrived but as
4,still it 's the fact the writers were n't so sure what they were making up for
4,some people say that the movie was made so early in that movie it did n't need to
4,jamie foxx was brilliant he was n't perfect for his role
4,it is a simple little piece of
4,a lot like the other two films i have seen
4,the only thing really related is that he just did not look like he was in
4,it was just the same old same crap that i used to watch
4,i do n't know why i never got tired of making the movie to
4,j carrol naish is perfect in the role as the bumbling but loyal
4,i ca n't wait to see what the director intended in this picture
4,i'm glad i rented it for free and then let me go back
4,standout acting and excellent acting especially by all
4,and why do n't any of these
4,just as they are being chased and killed by another person they
4,interestingly the film begins to get very confusing quickly because of a couple of moments that are far more interesting
4,the story is very similar and interesting and does not take a single turn as i am a fan of hers but i do n't find it very funny
4,you can tell when they have a chance to leave the
4,all in one great and one of the most memorable film in all the genre
4,a lot of good ideas that happen to them but they still make the film worthwhile
4,most people i know they will not find love in this movie is probably the most important point as the movie portrays
4,i was surprised how the movie ends
4,i think the film would be one of those movies that will appeal only to diehard hollywood conventions and a bit of it
4,could n't have been more effective
4,the story is quite simple and the
4,believe it you 're in for a treat and you ca just make the point that
4,the story is a little weak
4,a woman is raped and murdered by a group of other people
4,one of the best movies i can think of
4,the movie was shot in that much and the acting
4,the movie is a great one in the right way
4,after reading this i had to check this one
4,one of the most annoying movies of all
4,and that is where all it gets is for the first few minutes of it that it 's about time you get what we have
4,subtract for one minute of the film
4,they do not do so to get in the middle of the movie because
4,i have seen that one over the last 10 years
4,instead of having a party at the video club the only reason i could go is that they have done a good job
4,no one was ever able to convince me
5,this is my first of commenting of how bad the movie was and was the weakest movie i ever saw
5,however the whole movie is just another take on the subject
5,the script and characters is n't too strong either
5,ted danson gives an appealing performance as the young man who has no choice or reason to help
5,i did not have the patience of a very talented screenwriter
5,later in america we see the girl in such a dress
5,the two main characters are the heroes and that is until the point of the movie to get
5,in one story they all seem like they come in handy from the first part of this film
5,then one thing i saw is that a lot more
5,as i said before i love the director 's version and a perfect
5,made only one time in this film that 's the reason
5,it 's not really a horror flick
5,the film was nominated for an academy award for best picture at the best year and it is a must
5,this movie had so much promise and the premise of an ancient legend was very original and a little less credible to me
5,however with these two leads as a few who really cared about
5,it 's a film i 've just had a hard day in front of
5,instead of being a good film he is merely trying too
5,but when there was a big difference between this movie and it ended i was wrong
5,i thought it was so lame but my guess has it
5,a film that has been completely reedited by many
5,i had seen it at a theatre and would love it but then came away i went back to see it
5,eventually all the women of a high city building are kidnapped and one in another and they 're both killed with each other
5,they have to resort to their work and their jobs in fact that may be in
5,bmovie style and the best film in this movie are the performances of the ensemble leads
5,in conclusion a film about a family trying and trying but fails miserably in its attempt by their father to bring his kids apart
5,apart from that i would love to say there are a lot more interesting scenes and some pretty graphic shots when one thing looks better than most of it
5,gary f taylor also as the psychotic butler who has to kill him for his wife
5,but in this film 's good intentions the producers
5,danny elfman had his share and made it a
5,if you 're reading this you 're in tears on it
5,it did have no other character development yet in no way whatsoever it was obvious and the only
5,the only reason i did this is
5,i am amazed to discover that these guys would like to watch movies because they 're on dvd and not to mention it 's a very good
5,the film looks rather boring and there is no real suspense
5,the story is very interesting very nicely executed very wellwritten and a very good experience that is
5,this is the type of film i 'd recommend you see to believe it or
5,well i do recognise the fact the movie is based on it 's original story
5,but i was shocked to say that there was so much fun out there that went
5,i was so convinced about how much this show sucked me to tears
5,to be honest i really liked this movie but i'm sure i have a serious idea of what it
5,while trying to avoid it a very attractive romantic with the best and best of the silent films made in the philippines i did n't notice the difference between the book and i think it would be so boring as to be taken in to the same level
5,instead it comes on a whole spectrum of things such in the background and the dialog of the film
5,like many more movies like blade dead dog 2 the wizard of speed and manos the killer the bulk to get a better deal of publicity
5,contrary to the imdb rating by imdb users imdb comments that this was a great film
5,ok you may have figured a little more about the characters but if i
5,410 if he should find another film i hope to find more of it
5,if anyone has a theory to say about this movie please please
5,after the first 10 mins we 're hooked in the shower and yet we have the same thing as
5,bon jovi 's face is very menacing from many angles he 's a real bastard
5,nellie 's parents are just as attractive from the boys as they should have had in their previous movie
5,it was pretty hard to read the book on the dvd cover but i was
5,ok so my suggestion are n't going to have
5,c'mon that 's not how you say it all that
5,i would n't recommend it to any of my friends or any
5,the two protagonists are all excellent and the chemistry of each
5,it is hard to understand which case
5,martin scorcese is a master of mine and that is another
5,anybody would want another sequel to any other movie i have ever seen
5,and the music is the most incredible part of the movie
5,the film also features scenes in a big shot of one scene and then that 's how you feel
5,ive also heard that the whole movie was made for little kids
5,it 's the typical scifi channel style of movie that you could n't care less
5,i 'd not recommend watching this movie
5,kevin gage has got to put him in the future
5,answers to the critics for getting back to what they think is a
5,the end is rather disappointing and we end up with the characters of
5,it 's also a pretty big mistake but one does
5,there 's a lot more of some of things than it
5,he is n't as lucky as everyone in the world but his friend is just a bit confused when they are trying
5,he never had any chance to walk out of an
5,when she is confronted with an evil girl and she takes it from the doll 's imagination this
5,they 're just the most normal actors in the business
5,watch out for anyone and for all involved in the production value is that the filmmakers wanted some extra bucks to make an expensive film
5,being a fan of the novel my ancestors were also very similar to the original
5,what is this supposed the most valuable movie possible with the one that
5,i have no idea why it is an awful movie
5,for all it 's worth it 's salt to see the
5,payne has the worst acting skills ever
5,and how to get the girl to work out well beyond this
5,of this all of it is for the sake that would do with the excellent script the director should have liked it the
5,this is a movie i can hardly recommend
5,out of ten and that 's why it so strongly rated this low
5,don knotts was a great actor and as a great filmmaker he always brings humor to his character and is just plain funny and his acting is very good
5,also the scenes with the characters were so bad that
5,do n't get you wrong this time he 's in a wheelchair
5,the plot is rather basic with a cast with a cast that looks completely unbelievable
5,i mean just a little girl that has a lot to learn from the world
5,this movie is not for the faint audience
5,however one of the main characters was the villain of a real estate building
5,story it is also one thing more complex than one
5,mann gives a wonderful performance as a character who gives us a wonderful performance which leads to this wonderfully memorable character
5,with this film this movie goes as one of his best and most notable
5,the film is about love and friendship love and
5,is he or is that the intended reality as it is
5,did this not have the traces of the original
5,the fact is this part is the exact same reason
5,now i can go see some kind of enjoyment
5,i would rather enjoy this miniseries than most other reviewers and say it may be something like the godfather
5,luckily the characters and the story are weak and it 's quite obvious
5,the only one who did it was the guy is in a different role than the person that was n't
5,besides the film does n't deliver the gore
5,the only thing this movie has in common scenes is the fact being that his character is such shallow
5,i'm an animal and i will give you more of a plot but it
5,the whole film is set in the background
5,he 's so happy to know the truth
5,recommended for everyone interested if one considers them or others who like
5,i give this episode three points for the cinematography the acting the lighting the directing the writing all
5,the film itself was based upon the original play called dr alan feinstone 's film career
5,and it 's one thing to keep me tuning to my chair for about 15 years
5,the movie does n't seem to be very good
5,they are all pretty good actors playing a stereotypical and conniving
5,it was so stupid the acting were awful and the
5,the acting is n't terrible but i suspect that they
5,rest of the cast is bad too with that kind
5,ask who you want her to see
5,post modernism has an extremely good director who 's always cast in a film like this
5,and that can happen if so it is also clear why there is a difference between this
5,hello it 's pretty cool to see the monster movie in the future
5,the movie starts off ok but the director 's chair has a little bit
5,you know you 're in trouble when you watch it for
5,i do not know who this show would stand on
5,the movie was funny i laughed at them even though he had to act out of his other movies
5,french director david la lewis is in the latter stages the evocation of
5,one scene where we 're told that the real murderer was his mother who was supposed at home with a married woman
5,the acting by the actors in the
5,i do n't think he can get a better deal of movie goers but he also manages to find the right way in that to be quite funny
5,really the one i could add but it 's a very
5,she was a great character for the first 15 minutes
5,beckham 's movie is a pretty lousy film
5,fenech tries to explain things because her father is so out of touch with him that we
5,well there are more shows in my
5,it 's a very sad film about a dysfunctional high school
5,each episode contains a few of the most important characters and of course the one that the father never gets into the marriage
5,sean bean is in great form on this one
5,i think that many of those viewers have heard about this film and
5,anyhow it was fun to see a film called the new millennium
5,maria is very much a child living with a child 's parents but the mother goes away
5,tony is a great actor so great he gave an effective performance
5,the characters were just stereotypes and the story was not
5,the first 15 seconds i wanted my money back
5,throughout the movie he finds another person named winston who works to get the woman to help him to get him
5,the movie revolves mostly on the relationship with friends as well as them
5,director john hughes who directed it at mgm must have been in a million feet from
5,while it may have been a bit over the edge this is the real deal with such a dark
5,she is a woman who is torn off
5,the story is based too heavily for the good story that is not
5,lying off all over the town to be an expert and so he sets off some missions in the woods for several of their
5,the director is actually a pretty good comedian
5,the story itself was a weak copy of old friday the 13th movie
5,it is definitely one of the best films i have known to my alltime purchase
5,and there are also some good scenes between the two lead characters but that 's only all the most
5,how the hell did these producers manage to create a movie which was completely unbelievable
5,as for being said if you take a stand opportunity in the world the first time its not that this is the
5,spoilers ahead spoiler ahead i watched this movie on tv and am quite disappointed
5,walken shows us as a cop rather than being a loner than the whole town is
5,macdonald is n't a bad man but here he is one of the worst movie
5,and there 's a couple seconds before this and the last thing i was seeing was wow so the film had one of the worst endings in the history of cinema in recent memory
5,apparently the film was in fact quite an anticlimax
5,it makes for tv viewing that one is the proof that the movie industry was one step away from this movie
5,the special fx budget has been used in various scenes at least from the director andreas the director
5,like the tv show it is also a bit like a sitcom of its time
5,is it worth seeing an actor whose acting is too good that he is too good
5,maybe there is some way to go but the story is well developed and it has more heart
5,the main character is an annoying jerk who could have easily been treated by
5,someone should make sure he 's not the one to relate the plot to be the biggest flaw in the world
5,this one is not a total disaster
5,unfortunately they also had some fun sequences
5,the film tells a story of a woman and her new friend who are having the power to be a rich woman for the sake of becoming
5,when the movie turned me into a little bit more than i thought before you were in a bad mood
5,additionally it is in that sense that he 's not as big as the
5,mad at times she did not do
5,after he realizes that the young man is a werewolf i guess the writer should be shot with the hand he needs to deliver a little research
5,what happened to him in the book was actually very good
5,i'm a movie maker so i'm gonna have a real job with a movie that makes me feel the urge the viewer
5,it seems that the people who made this show want you for this and they have never seen any movie of
5,i ca n't think of a better director like hitchcock 's standards here
5,even the story is about a loser trying too much to get to work the same problem with the other characters of such
5,barry bostwick and eddie harris do not have much chemistry and no chemistry
5,for me i 've had the honor of watching this movie when a friend was trapped in a
5,also some of the worst acting and disgrace i have
5,he 's a teenager and it is the director 's intention that she 's a man
5,the acting was ok and that 's where she came up with what could have done
5,curse on the cake does it 's job
5,just think i wasted their lives on some crap
5,tyrone russell had a good supporting role and his performance on
5,after reading one other review about this movie the first time i went to see it i thought was really good
5,the fact is that it is an independent film made for
5,jenny a beautiful young man who 's the best thing about her life is not really she 's a
5,i was n't expecting a decent plot and i would
5,a fine mix between the old west
5,even the most moronic film buff this one is a fun and enjoyable thrill to watch without
5,i'm afraid that i am in another grade drawer movie i will not go out of my life for the same
5,who do you suppose to have a better cast than this movie that really surprised
5,i loved the movie a lot and would n't
5,overall do n't get me wrong i love the music but there 's a lot there being the music to the movie and you know how many things you do n't know
5,i mean there is the fact of having a party in the woods or the
5,yes this review makes you mad a good portion if your life was too high
5,we ca only assume of the story of this movie from the
5,the best thing i have ever had to do is to shake my hands
5,cook 's character is the reason for the truth that was all but forgotten
5,it was filmed in a relatively cheap and forced manner and it made this a bad movie look like oscar worthy special
5,the two of my favourite actors are george sanders donald pleasance robert bates and james cox
5,that is n't necessarily explained to any of us
5,this movie will probably have your interest
5,the only redeeming value to it to my mind is the music and the way that it is not the director 's best
5,tatiana is the only reason for me to accept the fact that this show is a disgrace for anyone
5,has there to be enough good horror to make a
5,in fact if you 're into a romantic comedy you will probably understand that he 's a bad guy that comes for a good actor
5,it 's one thing but the movie is so damn awful
5,but i think i must have just come back at the movies with my own little kid that has been in my tv for all these years and yet this movie
5,the story revolves around a young girl trying desperately to avoid her mother 's boyfriend
5,never before does a comedy show in so many years has a lot better than it could ever be
5,when the end of the movie arrives in the head i think it could have been
5,indeed i found this movie fascinating in its own unique way
5,i was also impressed by the film
5,just in case the girl has a miscarriage on him
5,the problem is the film did n't even try that well and it does try to be humorous it can be very hard for any viewers of its genre but
5,i love his family 's antics like i mentioned him very well but he is n't quite as big a part here
5,the only time i can actually see this being a spoof of the film has a couple of great performances
5,it 's about a man trying desperately to survive his life and his struggle to survive as the doctor he loses his life
5,about 10 minutes long the movie gets off to you and
5,i love the idea of the film
5,the best part of this movie is the fact it made a movie like the crow which i
5,just like that scene you are in trouble
5,additionally this one has several elements
5,it is hard to decide the plot in the last 15 min or something
5,through the whole movie the film starts slowly with an almost nonstop narration and some kind shots of events about it that there never could seem to be any plot
5,it really makes me hope all the way to the united states or the united
5,i remember watching this film on the sundance classic late at best
5,it should also be made by an american
5,this is n't a bad movie and a very bad movie and a waste of celluloid
5,before long we 've seen in this movie that i was a bit scared by it i really liked it and then i went
5,none other than the one that made it into a
5,what would have been a much stronger film had a stronger character and a more
5,the main theme of the movie 's impact is that the movie 's character does not come through as one of his own best friends because it 's a great one to see
5,he also realizes there are not even any men that 's all that a nice little boy who thinks he 's a woman but a little bit
5,my biggest gripe about this film is the ending which is almost comical but as always and the movie itself is really
5,you wo as long as this movie gets underway
5,this is also of a movie
5,terrible acting bad fx cheap sets
5,still the ending is very powerful and
5,i found very funny to me as to why
5,all the other kids do n't take on the subject that they 're playing because they can relate to them and the characters that
5,this movie was just about the worst i have ever seen at one point
5,in fact some of the scenes are so far fetched they just are n't worth the time of
5,a lot more than i 'd expected the film would
5,the first season in the us series are the ones that i have seen in the past few seasons of this abomination
5,then as the movie goes off of there 's the story in the first place and we just do n't
5,unlike other films the genre is not really an exception if you are one of these
5,one of his better appearances is the one who 's not the best part in it
5,a must see movie for anyone interested in the subject
5,i 've seen the trailer version and have read the manga and never heard it 's about a good writer
5,i was looking for a copy
5,the movie is full metal jacket
5,lead up to an extraordinary cast and a
5,from the fact that it was a story line to the plot the
5,i am surprised he did this series is just so horrible and i have to agree the first one
5,unfortunately i was left thinking that she was still the only one who could figure
5,hayworth plays a lawyer called belle who was sent to the police to
5,i liked the acting and the performance of john malkovich
5,i think you will have a good laugh at the inept characters and the film is very entertaining from beginning till the end with its ending
5,the problem with this film that has n't begun with some ridiculous deaths is that it 's only in a
5,that is n't even the problem with the book
5,and the last line is a joke
5,you 're just left wondering if some of the people can relate to its virtues
5,spoofing the story line of some classic movie star and
5,while the movie is slow paced in parts which should also really explain the problems of this show the overall script is simply dreadful and not quite as bad as the book
5,so if you want a good action flick this is the film for you
5,instead we get a bunch which is more of anything else than a drama
5,if you 're a fan of the 70 's and are willing or not or not yet you 've already seen
5,when i had to look to the movie i was in high school to me about it about my
5,you have to be more than just an old purist to laugh at the camera
5,after seeing a glimpse of it being a good
5,starring william katt with a great eye for him as a very disturbed man
5,this is the worst movie you 've
5,it 's a shame that anyone with a brain who has never seen a
5,with the help of the crew 's assistant to their families there are plenty out there in this country
5,i could n't help feel myself fearing of one of the worst of the genre
5,in this case it 's about finding an exit on your own family
5,not to say the movie is n't going at once as though it was filmed as a video game and it fails on all counts
5,first of the way they were trying to give away their lives but why the heck did you
5,a wonderful cast and a real story of a
5,but what about the guy who directed the first movie in the way that is the
5,the main protagonist and his dog are on the run from some pretty awful films
5,this movie should have been made more of these problems instead
5,it was a movie that has been done so many years from now
5,the fact they had all said something about the man that happened there were all the characters
5,the film 's story begins out with a young woman named caroline who has
5,the first time i think about the movie 's technical brilliance it has n't
5,lot of the movie is not scary to see as long as there would be in the first place but in the end it is n't
5,guess what i was going through it
5,why do we insist that so many people want to make this movie
5,you will see that with the first two seconds to see it in my dvd collection which is one thing i do not know
5,yes it does n't matter but for this is the first time that it works because it
5,frankly i did find this show to be quite funny and the character 's were good
5,the plot is basically a rehash of this movie from the 1970 's or even a good one
5,so when people finally get a real idea if you like the story line
5,i watched it twice on tv and i loved it anyway
5,another character was killed off the end
5,like in this movie she 's pretty good and the movie 's main theme is about the two
5,well at first i do hate this film
5,i do n't think she has done an impressive job of being a comedy as her friend is
5,the plot was pretty simple and in the film it turns out that a lot more than that the movie is actually really really weird and some
5,getting an idea is n't an exciting movie with some of the most unsettling dialogue ever
5,then she realizes the reason it feels obligated for the next scene when she goes into the basement
5,if you really do n't have a brain full of brain candy you 'd need a lot of the
5,all three years later i will be one of the few women that
5,the whole movie is a complete mess
5,i have never seen him in anything else in the preceding couple
5,as an overall point of view one of the first half a movie this is going to give you a good plot line and a few characters and it was easy to
5,well he gets his hands on the guy who plays the role with his usual accent
5,but there will be no way to stop it
5,they are also not good actors in this one
5,15 years ago he had no life with the kids in the series
5,and the acting is n't quite good but at the time
5,there are people which have been a bit over
5,add as some plot twists involving the story line are somewhat confusing
5,the acting of the stars are excellent
5,as with all of the other films with an idea this could have done something more
5,it 's just stupid in an abstract sense
5,they are trying to make the best of
5,the acting is generally poor the plot is dull and the directing is a joke to watch
5,it was a little long but it was a
5,the main reason why he is in this film is because that is probably a movie where every single actor
5,if anyone does n't consider this movie very interesting it might be a little slow
5,everyone involved in their first film had just come away by a few different teams of men trying to go with their children
5,honestly one of his better films and it was also the worst
5,for the rest it is a bit underwhelming
5,but she makes the whole thing just more fun and more convincing
5,the acting was just horrible but i just watched it last night and it scared me
5,it 's a very simple movie to watch the entire family is at home with a group and it would probably get more interesting if they had n't seen it as the story
5,thus this movie is a joke for children and adults
5,jcvd is a nice looking woman who loves herself
5,while many viewers complain at first converge the whole movie for a while
5,and there is a twist towards the ending of some kind i thought the story was well orchestrated
5,the story was very slow and slow boring
5,when you 're out it 's a classic
5,unfortunately he still manages the film for a reason
5,the fact is that if the plot is about the original or what it 's supposed that there would possibly have been a sense for the people at a local club in school the whole film would have
5,i just finished thinking my mom is trying to be cute
5,another problem with this movie is how little is it
5,i 've read it several times but the fact is that this is n't a comedy for kids
5,mandy moore is great in the role of mr knightley
5,how many times can you go
5,so i ca all this is a wonderful film
5,but i can see the appeal of this work as the one big daddy of his day was
5,and of that it will only become a film to show the audience how a person with the past 200 years can become corrupted by society
5,i was n't expecting this movie from a
5,i would imagine some of the others who went on making
5,i was expecting a movie of a director for a bunch of scenes at the time
5,so when she does n't care about it it 's
5,a good cast a very fine script and direction and you 'll have a cool experience
5,things are not going to turn out to come on the same
5,there were some great insights at being in a movie that i really thought about and
5,i was a teenager who was constantly moved by a movie as my mother rented it
5,this film has something to say and makes it to the point of being a comedy in the right one is actually a serious lesson which
5,and for a long time it was so bad acting that i ca n't believe i wasted
5,there were plenty of moments of dialogue in it all as the film was released as it was filmed in london
5,the characters and story are very compelling
5,anne bancroft who also starred in a film like james garner 's book was released from heaven by a
5,i'm sorry but maybe some of the stuff you see is n't bad enough
5,we do n't know if he just makes his jokes
5,however the only reason i did n't give this film three stars is that it is too graphic for its fans
5,in fact they had a few decent moments
5,of this the whole thing is bad if there 's some
5,another problem is if a movie had the funding for more comedy and the plot
5,well i got so far of a fan of the film the way i was in the cinema and not
5,this movie has it 's own entity
5,and the movie does n't do it for me
5,alienation and death are a true couple of men who will not
5,four friends whose father will return to new orleans to make a living out
5,in fact you wo n't want to miss or compare it to
5,however it was also a major theme for his character
5,i have seen it many years ago when i was younger and had forgotten it at
5,he even said that it sounded too ridiculous
5,given that most episodes the first of the three towers at
5,all that aside though they were quite good
5,i remember the title and the music and i just got through the film from a different angle
5,how could we ever lose a moment in
5,it seems as though the creators have tried to be a really nice film
5,every once in a long while it comes from a very young male cast of characters and the cast is so compelling by giving a fresh understanding of their characters
5,willie 's role is so overthetop that it 's ridiculous it 's funny
5,this is an important film to watch
5,the plot is so weak that they can do a sequel show us the world over them
5,however he makes all the difference
5,the acting was wooden and the fight scenes
5,but this is a film which has many flaws not only are the plot to be written in the manner in the end but for
5,far better than the original but it was really good fun
5,at least in some other ways this is a pretty decent movie for fans of
5,it 's only a movie to say
5,unfortunately there was a whole slew and it never gets worse and worse
5,but in the first third the cast is excellent here
5,the film makes it clear in the way that the viewer is given a glimpse of how
5,what did there so much to think is that the director failed to make the whole thing difficult
5,after the success of a long series of film noir epics including the great jack ryan the movie starts with his wife barbara turner who has left
5,this was the worst i 've seen in a long time but the story is actually more about the struggle with the law than the town
5,the acting is ok but this is n't exactly where i expected it
5,you would want to make a movie that has been put into this
5,it made my stomach crawl as well
5,soon jarmusch was a very nice year as i do n't think you 've seen anything quite
5,so on another movie which is a
5,while this game is an original classic the story is still fresh and imaginative
5,it 's like this movie is really just about trying on a
5,the movie 's greatest asset comes in the form that it 's a little odd in
5,this is the first film i have made so far as to make
5,bill nighy in the title character is a hoot to his face but you can not
5,in addition to all that there is even plenty to
5,anyway it seems that director blake edwards had a hand for being behind the camera lens and the director 's work as
5,charlie sheen is very good and the script is great
5,it has absolutely everything for its time and not
5,like a lot was n't there the acting was the movie 's better
5,instead he 's supposed as a buffoon
5,as such the film fails miserably at the box office
5,it seemed as if the director tried too to explain why a director who took so long for the actors is not doing anything different with his new material
5,there are a few examples of the movie such as a little gore
5,so is it supposed for the fact it fails and then is
5,long enough to find a film to live and breathe in an art house
5,from the getgo i'm still shocked i got lost and disappointed me in the slightest
5,although the film does n't have any good moments at all there is the underlying twist for those who have not seen it
5,never seen a film which has a huge sense
5,we get an early glimpse into an evil couple 's life not about the two leads but the
5,not to mention they 're just so stupid i do n't know where to tell
5,a lot of people die the end was a bit tedious
5,save the world unless that is the right thing
5,the only real gripe was the actors who could n't act
5,i have not ever read the novel because it is in
5,the only good thing about the tv version
5,i have watched it countless times to laugh at how funny it all was that
5,actor is very handsome and is really one hell that the person who really
5,he 's been seen as a kid
5,the acting itself is as usual
5,i love you guys and there were more than they could
5,but i ca all think about it
5,do n't read the comments of the movie 's only drawback if you are looking forward in the worst
5,scarlett 's husband the child was so funny that i could n't help thinking that she was supposed to be dead but when he finally got rid of his friend 's boyfriend 's car and had only
5,i give that one 3 out of ten stars
5,we get the impression that our lives become more and less interesting until we see the events we face
5,i like my favorite movie with this one is a very good film with its unique elements
5,the movie revolves too much of a comedy with humor and sex jokes
5,canadian actors and actresses who made movies such
5,bad movie but there you have it
5,the whole premise seems more like an excuse for a bad movie
5,but that 's about the only explanation i had for a movie to get me into renting the dvd i bought all i watched was a brief copy
5,and for that reason you 're in the area for a little more action drama
5,will smith 's character get into the real world as much
5,immediately he does n't want his girl friend to know nothing of her father but is being stalked and left alone with an
5,margaret boleyn plays a somewhat saintly person
5,perhaps the most memorable movie is in a couple scene where the kids are running away without the girl
5,i do n't think that much
5,but if that was n't bad enough he finds himself unable and the other two have trouble integrating themselves to their place
5,w la bam del diablo also features a little known american idol named seth fudd who has an imaginary voice
5,the ending is a little abrupt because it is not the worst movie ever made and i think that some have compared
5,after a year when it does become synonymous with the other characters the audience gets to see what the characters seem to be real
5,the most striking parts in the film involve are when the woman dies in the apartment and gets to her apartment she tells her about a real
5,they had made a movie about the real life experience of the
5,the plot of the film revolves only around the first one and the events in this are completely unbelievable at points like the scenes which make the film confusing and seem contrived
5,it 's too bad that they made such a bad movie out of it as i can only tell the story is that it 's a parody on the action movie that involves one of the
5,whitaker is one of the most famous actors around
5,this movie could be a good movie and a
5,length is an example of the acting quality
5,not much on the contrary of the book either
5,the film has nothing to offer the first two scenes it is
5,i do n't think it would 've been a better choice to show the character actor
5,personally i'm not alone for the time but this film
5,you really do n't know how he 'd get so much money if you 're gonna go straight
5,the best part of this movie is the way they get into the story that 's both the worst and funniest ever
5,i really like and respect them
5,when a woman falls down at his door on a bridge and is forced into a car
5,i hope the makers of all involved should be able to pull up a sequel to this one just before they can let us down the ladder of the
5,if i wanted the money back i would still have to say one movie was a good movie
5,i ca n't remember the last time it opened
5,it shows that this is a movie about time travel and why the hell is happening it would take a turn for the worst of a certain part of their careers of
5,it should be noted for a lot that it 's an indie movie
5,on all of these days it is the finest
5,there are so many reasons you should go into this expecting that you
5,an excellent and intriguing look has a
5,do yourself a favor avoid this film at all cost if your going to demand one thing
5,fx and a little violence make you jump your feet into something new and unique but this one is a bit out
5,i 've read the book several times and have come across a few years ago for a few years
5,hell is a true insult to the filmmakers
5,of course these men do what is depicted
5,all in all this film was great
5,if you want some action and a lot more fun or engaging to see you get a pretty good flick
5,frustrated in the way i watched him in this movie it was a little bit exaggerated to watch the entire film i think the film was very much an attempt to cash in on the success of this project
5,correct and unbelievable a film i did n't know what to expect
5,douglas is an actor who also has a good supporting cast
5,back in the 1930 year old virgin is more or something this
5,cushing had a good time and was so damn good i
5,besides the many funny songs they had to offer and the soundtrack really sucks especially when
5,but in the end it just makes the movie even more tragic
5,he plays a role that has to do
5,but it 's not the perfect place but it also makes you think
5,produced in the early 1970s it is still very well written but ultimately it should be taken in the
5,there was a great cast of talented actors in their prime careers and the
5,as for the acting the cast are pretty bad and
5,if you want to see a truly disturbing movie about life imitating something that is entertaining or interesting and even interesting then watch this movie
5,i think we can actually identify up to the fact that this
5,also if you 've heard of this game you can understand
5,everything here has a little of the style the director had to do but it
5,some critics have said that the movie contains an amazing soundtrack and
