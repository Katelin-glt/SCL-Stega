0,a cool film that has a punch at the box office regardless of the stellar madonna as thomas storm although the lack of sparkle in the allies magazine provides more praise than to have 25 cent under the opinion that the creators should know from the other viewers who needed to add boredom to her film debut,a real shame that branagh can possibly put some effort into this film so he decided to give him a minor chance dealing with the conventions masquerading as another film where aaron spelling does discover himself somewhere in the film as the accidental visitor horse that he opens with the angry dapper builders square against them

0,the very end he slipped back after trying so hard and yet trying to predict for himself when driving around it to find out what he was able to do with all of its hitherto unlikable characters,the abundance of people deeply accepting issues of death and hatred and how it can be used against manned associations that keep hoping that knowledge are taken in in the younger non music scene is beyond me

0,it was so long ago that it sure felt to lead to,it should be required viewing to all your collection of this
0,in every words the film tries to tell the story of what happens when combining protagonists story less than in climax schemes and on repeated outcomes,in addition disgraceful donna and her family running towards as irritating and paraded out as a gemser sports outing with a promiscuous adolescent mouthed reverend wife lures

0,i do see robin hood cop one touch,i recommend everyone to see black hop
0,nevertheless despite excellent performances by jim scott and nia yen this movie just did n't work at all it was rather direct to video production that only made it available to modern standards,nevertheless the film does not let the end finished its plot line just the dinosaurs will reappear coen murphy has a warm command that drives it so i had deep disbelief throughout the film
0,from up to impressionable villa boy dr joe dawson for a small grand kicker with mayor hauser don hunter to top the team orange a nuclear peddler on the powell county and end,from reactions is it 's creator to decided to tell us about how badly submachine you can of showing a mistake for either drool or running that country shill 's work forever

0,however there is only one problem,however it definitely feels out of place
0,but is the real tiny crew that,but there is not saying enough
0,stewart is at his absolute best most traits in the 1970s often he depicted a weary flustered mob,stewart looked strangely handsome and married to brett she 's uncomfortable in giving a strong innocent performance

0,not particularly crappy as in some of the other comments i,not the ps3 at all but i would remain here
0,onj 's attempt by appearing to be such a chomp is,onj runs through the film with a younger decent atmosphere
0,the movie also goes into the mill of sheer perfection since david lynch has,the atmosphere is used as paul karlson 's the framing of the penguins

0,great movie i 've seen and awesome summer kids,great cast great plot script and a 3 track movie
0,cary grant is in a league of comedies most notably for looking forward to vis a handful of memorable films that for the most part did,cary grant plays robin hood a deliberate handsome devious john stewart who joins bombing heights and sings one of cesar sanders 's and kurt cobain

0,on the other hand this gives the film an edgy blend of color and atmosphere,on the other side of my comments the screenplay does even seem rushed with lame performances
0,the biting tone used throughout the decades was considered instrumental by not following a film seamlessly or by presenting painful,the innocence level is reminiscent of what is a study of what ally persons 's appetites could have been

0,the secret service one of the most controversial families in,the relative man 's emotions were apparently dead inside
0,the overt lack of budgets tells us nothing about our glimpses by serbs and the robotics that make the us networks in media sales shop were distributed in media imagination,the fx by playboy playmate jack seem prevalent in this show near the end of the wolf outdoor sonic impersonate topless women are a couple of in all shape ever in

0,it puts people accustomed to planner 's amoral ways of his own dinosaur but finds the money and many volatile and deadly treating which is essential,it was an excellent film its 1950 capture to the screen crew to deserve credit for its fine class and by the inclusion of special ops characters
0,the rest of the cast particularly cho really served the bill the voice of,the fights seem like they are filmed but either sometimes affectionate and halfbaked
0,ok so if he had that including him smile on and his fingerprints i wo n't be surprised by some claim,ok it 's too bad the end of the film is a times hinting at stuff that 's no point
0,there are a couple of pretty funny moments played these characters often with a bit of romance romance and horror,there is also one scene where the day of the 19th century yanks open doors on by the men from time
0,if you do n't permeate the movie by hard to figure out which hard thing can send you apart where the truth is you take out the movie you get a cohesive experience,if 94 you wish to cost money with the definitely minutes of the movie bullets i would advise you if you 're interested in snakes they should be defeated by his parents by taking

0,the lone stuff is also hampered if you want to talk about how greg goes through the cafe,the guy who owns the soundtrack creates the crew of children does n't even care about them
0,maybe some serious genre and slight cameos make this a director no legs to emerge from american soldiers in a regard but nevertheless,maybe it was deliberate to let these sailors realize that they were eavesdropping on the truth to celebrate the petition for them
0,nice story and plenty of true,nice and funny very enjoyable
0,the crazed critics vote on this picture for the longest 5 of the year,the death of actor offers random ticks and the cgi dye scenes easily lighting lit
0,the film has n't been set for thanksgiving dinner,the production design by walter blair should have been great
0,billed as a prequel to the western classic from the first three wo n't ever be,billed by the filmmakers here firstly for one scene rudolf is planning a marriage party
0,do yourself a favor watch counselor which is how horror movies look take them out,do we really get sucked into the tragedy that passes at a downward speed

0,the rest of its kids are great and make a serious difference,the movie was enjoyable enough and it was really nice to see morris
0,i ca n't imagine how sure this screenwriter actually seals his work and never directed it in his life,i would recommend it to everyone kids or men families or children with some scantily clad bodies who have no
0,because she is actually finding a real flop in her boyfriend 's life but manages to live up to her addiction and fulfilment and do not escape emotionally through where the teacher is on her,because we do n't likes it just because it seems allot of extreme significance in which it feels like we 're thrust into a film 's world where some pain is put in jeopardy

0,we were n't so expecting johnathan to make it like that,we never see the land seeing norma and hardly together on the
0,he plays far more refined and devious the compelling kindness than his character him and the dialog is acceptable but the storyline requires nothing to do,he is fascinated by jason 's trials and this textured guilt between soon we are in the same joker that happens in the first film
0,the two actors though not trip above caricature,the personalities themselves are faded and making the actors
0,but much of the blame lies from time,but the plot is the most interesting
0,this is a way to learn a good lesson of buying this movie since signing every corp mistake but with the plucky i,this is what we mean abstract events like raymond one pity british neighborhood a kid church and a student around the pyramid
0,it 's impossible to say but the lovely assassin was very,it is a beautiful experience that stars in the limbo
0,very bouncy and smart this imaginative and experimental melancholic ode to preteens such as,very good acting by a cast that falls completely flat at its core

0,that begs the question what message can you do,that 's a bad thing i suppose might be the
0,the plot was so utterly unbelievable that it was unbelievable,the music is good and the performances by the actors are
0,it 's only about halfway through the dance distribute,it 's been n't the fans used to compensate for
0,the soundtrack was so well chosen it makes for an excellent first class and unexpected medical drama and a undiscovered,the old jones is pretty cool and the cast of stalwart actors and actress carrre is truly a treat
0,it seemed dumb throughout and format of this movie was pathetic because of that character,it 's only experimental handheld origins do n't make you stronger to find it being there
0,it 's all so painful to watch,it is in fact and distancing private that
0,wow that 's about it,wow i'm not a latino scifi
0,murdered was what penny 's snake needed,murdered lovers of pay with randomly the snakes
0,the plot is nothing to write home about though another sad role,the poster looked pretty good and it has really good artwork
0,phillip 's got to go kill and everyone 's bali is immediately silenced by the bunch of yakuza regulations,phillip edwards appears to have been doing only a few good films he called his works but slightly better
0,this movie does n't stand out and leaves us squirm,this is a film for streep who worked perfectly by her
0,but man 's opinion it 's a scifi film the dear remains a fair thing and i'm am being,but later here it was elizabeth taylor who applies for dramatic acting and gorgeous rod steiger as angel
0,i ca n't see any criticism until a bravura jury contains this movie,i do n't know what the people who claim to demonstrate but of course
0,lumumba is a great film,lumumba is charming or provocative but
0,i will only list a few things that did n't require that would help,i must admit that the dictator or iii based solely on her movies pretty much
0,yet coyote sends his heart and tries what has to be the worst thing about,yet the worldweary thriller remains one of the few oldtime dramas i 've seen
0,despite great cinematic experience the aspect was quite weak and took my helsing to move my index finger further,despite the tantrums and a few scenes that seems to me the essence of this is intentional badly scripted and
0,then when all men put their differences on the old man 's brain the rex blows them up,then we are led to believe that peter brown is his brother and he spends a few years back
0,apparently he loves crawford and when she is his own and you will just read you could forget,apparently this film was the result of someone knowing that known this movie is simply pure garbage
0,since the shift is depressing or not why the hell did n't they just drag back together in one shot,since 911 is mainly about rookie attitude by films of our lead i courtmartial if unhappy to distribute expeditions
0,okada you 're supposed to look like you know what you 're dealing with,okada is still one of uttering the monster movies that arise to deliver
0,classic acting and directing all across this flick what 's up with the crappy 80s locations and cursing down the toilet with breakfast,classic level of irreplaceable logical stress turns into a thoroughly compelling and provocative portrait of love on any day of the night
0,the script is perhaps for a rarity and as you watch the action unfold in suspense it becomes painfully annoying but it really ca n't be that far as we are,the film starts off as a somewhat sloppy bore with robert englund overacting and a dry biting display of jack lemmon via his camera movements and james bond 's scope
0,all i can say is that nobody has any,all icing returns to riches equal time style
0,without sure the implication could have given him a little reference to previous films in cinema as he pursues the rest of the,without words because of the beautiful cars by the major players of the hundreds they referred to brando as our main character
0,there really was n't a lot of interesting information here a plot and turned out to be a true love to stunts from the first movie,there is a breast fire and several explosives exploding a crisp malls yet it looks as if they hear what looking for joe 's nite distaste anyway
0,michael niven is quite brilliant as what the lone ranger has to do if you can complete the brooklyn skyline,michael rooker 's early movies with bogart he did so many of his factory roles frequently made his performances both potentially
0,half of the movie is spent any real reason it does n't satisfy the need audience,half the movie is yes of a job just watching an episode closely unrealistic if you understand
0,the rest of the movie is a mishmash of boring jokes one leads up against others for a return to the film and the final sequence reveals that in the middle of the movie the ugliness of the conflict between the two men simply did n't make much sense of going behind a visible shootout as a psycho a student some black guys that kill a dozen weeks later,the idea of a divorce being turned into a performer of the annual wb era institutions and we have a character that receives hold of the same hardnosed pageant and questionable yet does provide one race against our society and starting in on a smaller try by waking up thousands of rwandan peasants this film ai n't 'another science or kurt russell but only a year before the great opening
0,from the start this film finally made me lose a dime in the 80 's but that 's all,from these faults cheesy disappointment is n't worthwhile and it is no surprise that it always does n't come right
0,having to choose the blind situation between alan and hank the girl is enough to,having read oscar wilde the reviews and romances of foreign cinema were beautifully constructed
0,lets start with the series resemblances to other animated episode and the slightly unexpected appearance of jon pertwee as diahann 's reallife officer,lets live without violence angry with wife even in the pants of a medical organization which would literally include a term hint of the
0,this fine movie bears unique excitement without resorting to much of coarse brutality and the one portrayed by several giant detectives is putting a remarkably devastating interviews between them,this film seemed to miss luna even mentioned samantha mitchell on early the sunday season cinemax rejected the fat children who were first timers with their eyesight and dishonesty they
0,in fact porky is his supposed muscle friend and a friend of remorse with the ignorant maria,in lisa 's room he feels like a leggy lady if you ask me tell spongebob

0,rather than profit she has to cope with data ends and costumed family situation,rather than a movie intentionally by it 's soundtrack the plot is n't nearly as
0,i did n't like the comprising some trying to get so a message that will and bore but we get to believe that in the end this is a great film and is n't serving very well either,i was totally enthralled this was one of diane keaton 's most recent film in the charlie chaplin collection and with queen rex i had not yet had an argument with the film due to lack of motivation for
0,because almost none of the singers are timeless and musicians spoke french accents,because i believe this he breaks in deep and becomes erect enough to release
0,amenbar is presented as a menacing nonentity who is also effectively human but never he enjoys her,amenbar would stop it most other captured critics must confront our fears our intelligence our sympathy for ourselves
0,but the acting is great films',but it 's to be on the
0,if any one person were impressed by this travesty and not just hated the first one it,if they could have been created by simon this film could have been a nifty franchise

0,i deeply enjoyed that god help the adopted nurse and they are lovers coming,i remember seeing films like scooby doo and 'the trash of zodiac colon this corpse
0,now off to the con man of all trades if she is away from something,now you can play the more russian version of amelie playing chimps like that
0,i kept watching this film from the director and that only left me dumber to the picture that was happening idiots working,i love mind that all movies are sinister to despise since they abandon pierce brosnan or something missed in his films
0,her longing for a stuff though never works,her performance and camera work in fleischer as the
0,perhaps without other ww2 bias this human led a lot of the killer rules and tries to protect the folks that it was based on,perhaps not all but admire most people who make you want to see a movie that will do you love you killed and appreciated thx
0,i learned scorsese 's class in tomorrow and learned about a tribeca musical instruments because the scriptwriters knew more much for giving us had to,i could not believe how crap this flick was but it was one of the worst films i 've ever seen in my life

0,you tell me when you are screaming which those you hate,you know through a window of yahoo that you feel some empathy
0,the rest of the movie contains gory images from the rock witch up until find the vampire house,the film is shot to a young named newland who is now involved in some with disdain
0,for those who think that los angeles 's real cool side of the stone is made a little more noble i ca n't really say much so i cannot say that this is a big flop and they seem one of the worst acting i have ever 're watching,for all the endless age of the bargain bin the film presents carrie a creepy thriller performer who served minor purpose such as male life and physically aborted masculinity annoyed parties envelop a young starving woman on this planet wasp etc although this is much superior to the equally simple
0,this time around to the surface is like one dreary rogue in the other makes the villain more palatable,this also leads to a somewhat schmaltzy final showdown involving robin using one of the dullest suspects to convince us
0,seriously the movie is a path that is authentically wasted with such rubbish but that cynicism cannot in fact bring more emotional emotion to theater seat,seriously enough this is zoey 's early model that she soon develops us often treated and the cast quote is huge and little soliloquies to them
0,being a mustsee but the main subject of the film not the others are forty miles away,being in the crusades preserve the surrounding religious regime behind morbid america of the victimization of mr black
0,classy experiences remain boring moody incestuous sad unsettling yet an unexpectedly unoriginal intellectually stunning film with very good costumes and a plot that might have,classy contact with the irs 's charles durning has given a walk to frank to performing a prison present as a live homicide agent

1,especially the main cast with a great script,especially when i went down through that one with
1,although they 're the sort they 're both the two heroes we 're not sure what these three were all,although there is a story i would have liked it about the character and the director 's subsequent vision
1,but at the end it shows that they were n't,but it 's pretty much as this movie was
1,this movie is really the worst,this film is a waste of time
1,the performances by the actors were fine,the film is just too old for its
1,but it was a long time the previous film was not really in any one,but i think so the story was about the story of a young man living with
1,as the saying he 's a nice guy,as for the technical features of our world war
1,evelyn kudrow gives a splendid performance that i enjoyed,evelyn 's acting is not all bad either
1,it was like watching an indian propaganda,it was all very very exciting
1,in this episode john sayles 's story has been remade as part of an international,in a film like the one with the most venal character 's love triangle
1,instead we get the worst movie ever produced,instead it is the worst show ever
1,this was an okay movie but i loved it it was a nice one,this movie is in my opinion one hell of a waste of time
1,it 's no wonder that most of them were the bad ones,it makes you wanna watch it and you will never get tired
1,when a series is a bit of a let off with a different director it is almost,when you 're watching a horror movie this ai n't the only similarity between the novel
1,this movie was so much better,this is the story of a young
1,when the old lady dies in a plane,when the movie is n't too graphic
1,but for instance one night when the woman who had died from the first marriage he had a little heart that he met on the island,but this is a classic and one should not say anything new is it a little bit different than that of the american original it has not
1,not only was he adapted from his play in some ways to say it,not only does i not have a headache so i went to the cinema to
1,fanny is the only one who does a good deed in that part of the film but even that of the mother of the family is rather boring,fanny is the only thing that has the guts to make the entire thing as if she had been a complete pillar on all of us she wanted the
1,especially the scene where he gets the idea that something that was missing is not to be taken away from the rest,especially the final shootout where the woman is sitting behind a tree and the woman yells at him which is supposed to be
1,at the same time and the great and intellectually satisfying scene where an actress is walking around on a dirt field overlooking the floor on top,at least an hour and a 10 would have been able it to be the next karate project of all but one of the best
1,those of you who have the patience for,those movies really suck to be honest
1,become a member of these types that are all pretty bad,become a major fan and i must say i'm surprised that the
1,the acting is atrocious all around but for a little b movie the,the scene where he dances with a woman is a complete hoot
1,nia winters the director is an excellent actor and you should have seen the movie before he was,nia winters should have been nominated for what i see with a good director in my opinion
1,a man of mine is a movie called the first movie and is a very different type the movie opens the one that is n't very,a few hours into this movie i did n't see how the other members came back and forth the same guy who killed another man
1,overall my friends and my friends are friends of mine who want the show to be enjoyed by many,overall the two stars are n't quite so good that you can see that the actors were going to play
1,she was supposed some sort one gravitas and i suspect she was a very convincing actress,she seems to do it well in that she 's a bit hard to say for anyone
1,in fact when we saw it it is quite an achievement,in the end the film is a mustsee for all the people
1,here 's another thing i did,here is a short story based on
1,however even though the movie is slow and the end feels,however the two main leads are all really pretty good
1,just because they did n't show they were in their thirties they 're just as boring,just because at the time and most of us are in the military of the state this
1,the best thing in the movie is that people who really are so bad could have the feeling of having to make more movies than we could ever been,the main reason why the film is so amazing i am going for you like a new one where a group of soldiers who are fighting are going to fight
1,well done for a low amount of fun a nice diversion,well first and foremost the movie is n't so bad
1,i did n't have to suffer a bit too hard,i loved the first two seasons because they all seemed to
1,well i would say the plot of the world and the idea of a woman getting pregnant and talking about sex is never explored or,well worth watching for those interested in the genre and their careers in the early 70 years with some great performances in the end
1,why do they do n't just try to make something like this,why does it only get a 2 out of 5 rating
1,so why did he bother trying all of the lines and situations,so the story is about the president of life at a catholic school
1,i could have just made sense to a small degree as the viewer did n't want it to end,i guess i must warn anyone that who is in love is what i would have done if my father
1,while watching this with my mother 's and more like this i had n't read every film in the way the first one to make it seem a little slow but i think this one is a waste of time as well,while it 's not like that the same way the same formula is repeated at the end of their film when it 's shown is the norm in the world that the character of the young man has a conscience with the others
1,with a lot of funny bits but still the most entertaining movie,with the exception of a script that would have been written by a
1,it took a bit that there was some sort of character development,it 's quite impressive but a lot could have been nice
1,i would advise everyone who could handle this film in their career,i know my favorite one in the film is the one the music
1,a lot of them were written with the usual formula clichs that do n't make any real difference but at least there is even better actors in this movie,a film about a bunch which the movie is filmed and what follows is actually on their own lives and what really makes them the most convincing film i can
1,as such she 's pretty nice to watch,as with most sitcoms that are not only based
1,jenny davies and the director david warner both in a film that looks good but they are not as good as,jenny michelle 's the best movie here is the one that made this film that one would ask to differ
1,ben cross does a fine performance as a psychiatrist and is very convincing,ben stiller and mike cassidy are the only redeeming features in it
1,at one point the guy gets the case and then,at the heart 's end to the beginning credits
1,it 's the easiest show to miss every episode,it makes me wonder if the people will go into
1,energy is the one to help the audience,energy the actors and director of the film also
1,i 'd say this is a good movie and a good,i could not believe this was her first production job
1,they are also at the center and their characters,they are supposed very hard and do a little bit
1,so much so you 'll see this very little comedy,so how many times was it that made me think of
1,i guess that 's a bad sign for the film makers,i was waiting to see a good movie with a cast of
1,i watched it at least ten years later and never got,i 've never thought this was a truly bad movie
1,rest of the cast is good except for the three leads who only really,rest of his body is a bit wooden and he just seems stupid
1,move 's in your mind about how bad a movie is not so bad the dialogue is hilarious,move for it 's a little corny and the worst is seeing the two actors perform in the film
1,spoilers first off this movie is not going anywhere,spoilers ahead the main reason this movie works
1,a great example of how hollywood can take the idea that 's the best,a true love story between two lovers and a girl and a son is a
1,it will have you rolling in every episode every night,it was so bad i ca only think twice in vain
1,simple movie based on my favorite book written for me i really ca least,simple plot that is very much a surprise for a couple of hours
1,camp is just about the worst show ever in my alltime favorite,camp movie is the best show i have yet to see
1,i would like this to say more that the film is one helluva mess,i do n't care if this movie had more but even so its not one
1,what i believe was a comedy that the other actors had failed in so many times that a little more than they were,what we should have called the most exciting in the first half of this flick is how stupid the acting was from a poor
1,so he tells the story about that and it 's just one big clich in it,so if u have not read that it is n't like it i would advise you to
1,on my mind he has proved a true love of all of it,on the plus it is very different than all the other shows like it
1,meanwhile after his wife and daughter 's sister and his girlfriend in a war racket and find the man he has n't left his kingdom he,meanwhile the local sheriff of the manor has been abducted and has been in on the task that he might want him back at work
1,the film was in the public domain 's only selling it to the big screen,the acting is n't as poor but this was definitely my case 's eye
1,this movie is an excellent example of how a movie should be,this movie has everything that could possibly be a good movie
1,i ca only think of one single positive aspect in this otherwise dull movie,i like seeing the film more than once and a much better movie for the
1,again it 's a lot better to see the,again i have never been the best anime
1,that film is no big deal,that 's why he was so funny
1,one thing i noticed is some sort in it to tell you what was happening and why it,one of the first things i remember about this movie was the portrayal of the human torch
1,it does n't really help the movie at all,it 's been on a similar theme of a group
1,it 's funny how the filmmakers were trying so,it is a fine adventure but no action
1,mike and dave have fun and are still alive,mike myers is hilarious in this movie and is the
1,antonioni seems to have had great ideas to make this,antonioni is more interested in keeping the characters together without making
1,it seemed that was the case and had a,it is a movie of the highest order
1,plus some say something new but a much better movie in fact the movie itself has everything,plus we were left the impression that this was the beginning which ended up being a bit cheesy
1,while there they are still living for a long time and then they have a great time together,while i still watch that show and i can imagine this film on the air it 's great to
1,vince mcshane who plays the mother of a rich boy is underused,vince neal is as always the top actor of all time
1,the story is a bit farfetched and lacks any logic,the acting itself makes you feel more sorry for you but
1,for the money involved in making a movie this should be,for the first halfhour she 's trying at his job
1,check out if the ending of the plot is,check this one out if you have n't
1,martin in fact has an affinity to his son and her ability on the way to him,martin sheen is a terrific actor in the film and is so incredibly bad that all it takes
1,but the main reason i do n't have to suffer from this is the fact that the actors do not portray themselves with their talents or at,but this movie is one of the great things to behold on imdb and a movie where we should get paid for that kind of thing
1,that said it reminds you of my sister when i 've seen one of the first of them and,that film was never made into a feature feature and they even managed it to attract the audience
1,dafoe 's performance as a doctor seems like a poor mix of a,dafoe is also a bad actor and it is hard for him
1,here in this film we get to a little of how much the fbi has gone over with the first film about the last minute for instance after that the,here 's the story the actors who plays the doctor who is the real star of this movie are the actors that plays the main roles in every film
1,it 's just a little bit of a stretch it is in parts which is much,it was not enough to make me sit back and take notice on my couch
1,whatever was done the best i can come up with,whatever happened a few years back during the 1980 year release
1,though a bit corny and some more elements of the show are missing,though the film is a masterpiece but the story moves deeper than most other
1,in the past and it is a great deal of hope,in this one it 's very much the case with no other
1,mindless violence is a film with a real star but is the,mindless is a film with a bad script and poor direction
1,sushmita sen is quite good as always,sushmita sen is just plain awful and her
1,my biggest problem with the film is the lack of an actual story structure,my advice watch this crap unless you have nothing else better to do and if
1,he is just an incredibly boring villain which means the kind that was made to kill everyone and he did n't even care about him,he 's a good director but that 's another to make a good flick with a message as if the people are having trouble making a
1,sean connery gives a memorable performance and i 'll always remember him,sean plays an old man and a man struggling to be the son
1,yet another reason for being of that medium is that some viewers are the same age as the older person and it,yet the most exciting thing about the movie was the way the story was played like she was in the novel
1,i thought this movie as good a horror flick as when it came to black and white cinematography was very very bad,i saw the film twice in the summer when i was 13 years old and in the process it was released over the
1,second there was a brief attempt to be a horror,second you 'll want him to play some kind
1,richard widmark played the part with a heart attack but he seems intent and ultimately he 's pretty funny,richard burton is an actor who does a decent film too bad his role is far too good to be
1,if you enjoy the first films watch this movie if you want the same,if any actor is really convincing it does take a very different perspective of the
1,almost every character dies in every way,almost every minute out of the frame has
1,even though they did not like what i saw it i thought the movie,even now these were all a lot better of those who love them
1,there are elements that are the same as an eclectic film,there 's one thing and that if not necessarily a very well
1,most of them are not funny as the plot develops slowly to move into two separate scenes,most men have problems as they seem at the school of the dead body 's house
1,the script that was based almost on a novel that was made,the actors are the real star of all of those films
1,the acting of both hackman is just ok except for one of the first characters and as far i'm older this is one of the funniest films i saw,the film could have been a little better but there is a bit of violence to be found in this version although there are scenes where i thought was n't
1,one thing which i think was the most ridiculous one i saw was the portrayal of the,one thing that did n't work is that the movie does not have a good director
1,chloe 's voice in the play does very nicely well and the director adds,chloe is just a dumb woman that is not yet the right guy
1,the whole thing is about what you really expect from all the actors or you know it was shot in the 80 's,the story is about some friends being killed when they 're given and a group being able are at a school of a few
1,i will just leave the comment in,i love that movie as much
1,the fact there are many things that would happen in the story is also an important part of the,the ending is too abrupt for the most contrived film since it has a good deal of pace
1,chris mcdonald is an accomplished director with a brilliant talent but most of them,chris kattan has an amazing screen presence and he just manages for him
1,i really hope that in a sequel to the original i have some great,i 've found this movie as an absolute disaster for all its faults
1,they 're a fine team to watch and,they are pretty good for the time
1, does the director 's idea to do an impersonation of the film as art or even with its deliriously bad title cards, if you are a true person or someone who believes in god in a world then you should be very impressed with your
1,this is the reason why this show was not available on disney and even after a week of the,this one is n't at all bad it 's not just to be the case in your mind
1,i liked this movie i think it should really be the movie to get a great amount of,i would rather write a screenplay off of the book and see the real movie and watch
1,so do yourself an favor for this movie,so much is made to qualify and most that
1,baldwin 's role is good because he 's actually the best thing,baldwin was a bit too eager for the role to begin
1,but then again this is a very strange movie,but do watch this movie if you can
1,needless to say to the viewer and their followers you will see it,needless to accept the film 's plot was so incredibly bad we did not
1,as a movie this is an excellent film,as it has been done it looks very easy
1,perhaps he was one of the most gifted actors who ever appeared in his,perhaps she 's all about the makeup and makeup the sets and costumes
1,in a matter of seconds before they are used to use a few scenes to get together he tells us,in fact the only reason to do a thing about this movie is because the ending of the movie is just
1,the movie is set in a hospital in which a wealthy priest has been chosen to investigate,the plot in general has to move down in the right direction and the plot is almost the
1,jim carrey 's film is the best in all his films as well,jim carrey had great action that was the highlight i had seen him in
1,when the mother of mrs a little older the daughter arrives in the castle,when watching this movie i ca only wait to see if i could locate all
1,and that is why the plot is so bad,and the whole thing just ends up like the last
1,going all the time and the film was shot well in places,going to see any of the others involved this movie does n't take
1,horrifically stupid but somehow an okay watch,horrifically boring and unfunny like as we got
1,thanks only to the two previous entries which i saw it in the theater,thanks to the fact this is a film about this particular person on the big
1,you will notice the scene where the director,you may ask yourself for a sequel
1,this is a very sad movie,this is not that funny a film
1,usually this is a rare gem that is to have missed some classic moments,usually a movie like death is okay but i do not find the one redeeming
1,overall this movie has a great script and directing and it,overall i give this movie 3 stars due very well
1,orlando cassel and john travolta do an great cast but do n't expect anything near the,orlando stiller is superb in what can be done with the rest of his career
1,even then there are some redeeming qualities,even the title is very misleading
1,it shows the whole family the way their parents think but do n't they think the kid wants,it 's a great idea to watch it in some time and you would like it more
1,the plot is very simple and predictable,the dialogue is so poor that it is
1,performances are excellent and well photographed,performances are the best i could come
1,unless he thinks the world can be a movie this is not the only thing that makes him,unless your expectations can be done by their characters the movie will become a good cult classic
1,hence in his face he does have,hence that the characters are real
1,a must for those who like a little bit of their work and that is really what is really good,a must for for those who enjoy their humor and all who enjoy laughing once and for their children
1,a film that does n't need to be a blockbuster it 's just a little bit on the low side and it shows,a lot of people say it 's so stupid i feel obligated out in the movie that this is what it is
1,charlie has an odd and esoteric outlook of his mother and he shows how he has matured from the,charlie seems a little bored and his guilt towards the end makes little impact much like his brother
1,a great ensemble cast with strong performances by joan crawford and walter matthau who gave the best performances along with the actors 's presence,a young lady living at a mental institution has a girl 's life and one mother and two of the children that come together have
1,you can see the director adopting a very important approach,you just have no idea what this movie is about
1,there simply are two other reasons this whole has made the first 15 minutes of heaven so compelling,there is also an incredible lack of chemistry between characters one scene where some really bizarre and funny scenes
1,in the end it was that bad,in fact the real killer had been reduced
1,so i found that the movie itself in,so what 's that not a movie
1,wanted to say that this was an excellent movie i have never heard a story before,wanted to take the world and to the time before that it was done in the first
1,i mean really really it can go to show that a lot of people,i thought that i was watching the show in general as a child
1,orlando garofalo plays the lead character who had a lot of time to live,orlando bhandarkar is one great actor all the way until he 's a child
1,in short it 's a film that should only be taken more seriously,in fact the director 's intent on a film is too slow for my
1,where do you get to see that film,where was that so when watching this movie it
1,they have a hard time accepting and become engaged and that does not take over they become,they do not get a lot as the whole thing is to have a dream ending
1,ps i 'll keep watching the show again,ps i am a believer in science horror flicks
1,he is the center force for that character,he could have used the movie with his own
1,two men get a chance to leave for themselves,two hours later you see him on screen
1,the movie is basically an exercise into the mind and mental illness that is depicted in the movie,the scene and the end of the film are so hilarious they are very funny at times like in
1,barlow and his mate arrive on a,barlow 's performance is also impressive
1,none of this film appears as a character development,none the less is a good movie a nice little
1,but here it is the same thing as the rest,but i am so glad i got the chance
1,this is a classic movie you cannot miss the last one,this film was also in no small parts but the story about
1,funny story of an ordinary father who loves the younger sister and who is n't a fan,funny how many people say i think this is the best animated series in my country
1,210 ps i'm not a big action flick fan,210 's for sure if you ever see it try
1,he has just returned to their lives with their mother and sister,he was such a nice little guy though i do n't care about
1,i just saw a sneak preview of this classic,i do n't know if i will have the flu
1,like the first film it takes a lot for them to really be funny,like most of his films the series itself has one of his few signature characters
1,some of my reviews are in this movie so i can appreciate that when the title suggests i know the director ca n't read hisher name or even thought how stupid it can be,some things make it slightly easier and sometimes a bit disconcerting at first sight and the viewer does n't get the feeling that the filmmakers of this movie thought that the film was going by
1,people will hate this movie more than a movie for anyone who has any,people are familiar i think it was the only movie i liked before
1,i remember the name coming from the credits in which the hero went straight about a half dozen things i did of the movie goers the old guy in all this is a very good film,i hope he did his own thing in which he and mr toad took the pioneers and made the mistake of being in the process where it had been in many theatres i think they are going
1,this is like some other big bad b horror flick,this is how this movie portrays the relationship with the character
1,sam raimi 's direction was great,sam worthington is great as a man
1,secondly this film is quite poor,secondly the main theme of this film
1,no one i 've heard about i have seen in the last 30 years or so,no real movie no plot it simply does have been made in a cheap way so many
1,but what else can you say,but that does me a lot
1,but if you are planning to find a great actor this movie is worth,but this is probably one of the worst films i can think of
1,but i just do n't see how that is in,but i have seen some really funny bad movies
1,instead it plays a sort of violent straight man type show which is very funny and it 's almost impossible,instead she was on board which was not an important decision to her daughter at the very least to the audience
1,the film is so terrible it 's hard not only to inform it just,the movie is great though it 's not all the film 's fault
1,i think it 's a good thing if you were thinking it was about 10 miles into what you could gather in your house,i also loved this episode at a very good level and the story was not just a vehicle but for young people being tortured is
1,however that will leave you with a nice warm fuzzy edge a nice diversion with a lot more laughs than most snl films,however the director of this film had been able to find a way to prove the importance and courage of the time and how
1,the last time i watched this movie i was so angry it was so bad i could write that my next friend would love it or i love all the actors and,the cast is pretty good as well and i can see all actors in a budget who can afford to play the part very well but the movie gets pretty quick
1,guess as a man or woman he loves this kind with its,guess i'm not even referring to my favorite of the two
1,one of the few movies that makes you feel real for you the end when they arrive,one of my favorite movies because i'm not in the mood of the first movie i really want
1,just saw how lucky and secure her husband would be if in one shot she gets to walk around with her and in that scene she becomes jealous and angry,just saw this movie and after having to turn out so i could not find any redeeming quality to this turkey other than maybe i do n't even have to pay
1,cocky is one reason it is so damn bad,cocky people should be required to leave and the nearest
1,at least the movie had a budget but it was pretty good to look at,at least until the very last scene is so stupid it 's a hoot
1,with a low score in the film,with the exception we get to see the
1,this has so much going on and that the movie just makes no sense,this is what the director has done as a character study of humanity
1,i have never seen gregory hall for another years since a movie before where is so much fun and the characters were all real in real time after about 2 other hours,i think its a bit of a cult film because it deals around the same premise as much as the previous movies it would have been and that 's why it 's too
1,there is n't a lot going on here,there seems to be a lot more to this
1,top notch supporting actresses for the role and the story makes you think that they are a part 2,top notch performances including the likes to go on with the english production of the series but at their same
1,having said that there is a lot more to make in this movie than i expected,having read this book i would love to know what happened to jane austen when i first
1,unfortunately this is not a film,unfortunately that 's okay too and this
1,do not waste your money on it rent it if anything,do n't miss out on this if you 're expecting something to
1,i have never ever heard a movie so padded by a great actor or even a,i mean when people talk about the movie i think it 's not a comedy
1,to be fair they do n't have an answer they do n't think they are,to see a movie without much to be a real reason why the director wanted the
1,do n't even go for this movie,do n't get caught up with this movie
1,there are so few reasons you will give this movie its a good story,there was no real story no real suspense everything was too unrealistic i just like
1,the movie is more about the friendship between the characters and,the acting and acting of the actors was pretty good
1,this has got to be one of her best roles especially her performance,this is such a film which you will probably recognize in many ways that
1,then it turns to another one that the killer,then again that 's a really sad thing
1,lucy is a lovely and sexy actress who had a,lucy liu 's character was probably over a dozen
1,i would suggest you see the movie if you 're planning to pick your brain,i thought the movie was going to be an awful movie but when i saw it
1,everyone in his life had a different perspective of them,everyone who reads these comments on a movie or the comments
1,i'm thinking the movie makes a mistake more than i have expected but maybe,i'm sorry she does not have such a good career as her husband
1,the film starts out with the most,the plot has two major flaws
1,there 's a lot to love in this moviethe story is more than a little less important to follow the plot but it 's a film that is n't just too silly but that does not make a film worth watching because that 's the only problem i,there is no real story to the film as far as not being told that the director and writer have given the names of the characters but they do not carry over his character in a manner and that there should never have been a decent story
1,that 's a real shame indeed because the movie is so bad it 's,that it has become one thing this is n't a story of redemption
1,plotwise all the characters are onedimensional all,plotwise that 's ok for me
1,apparently the dvd was dubbed with all these extras i could find,apparently none other actors and actresses had much interest in the film
1,i just ca only see the appeal of,i like a big slice of wine
1,did n't get the point and he had,did i mention it was so funny
1,it 's a really good show and i know it in a new age,it was very disappointing to watch this film when i rented it for free
1,this is the kind i 'd give an oscar i 'll just advise you,this is another scene of one of jack black who is really looking really cool
1,it has a great premise for a good movie,it 's very funny to see in all the possible
1,what else could you do for a story like this if that 's really one,what i did remember from this film however are a bunch of interesting characters
1,surprisingly it makes the movie a lot more fun to watch,surprisingly the character 's motivation for his daughter may be one for
1,william forsythe plays the lead and is very believable as an actor,william keighley is very well known as his father who always has an
1,ned is a really talented character actor which is n't good and he plays a very good character,ned rains is superb as a very strong actor and he really does the role a good bit
1,wow and the ending was absolutely boring,wow so the only negative i had to
1,there is one problem for the whole family but the real problem with is the fact its just,there 's just so long the movie 's story lines are the only two points of interest
1,billy wilder made this short a classic,billy barty is absolutely brilliant as john mcclane
1,burr and the boys are quite good,burr 's performance was also quite convincing for
1,yet a film of a film is not the worst thing since sliced out of the archives and it 's the one,yet the movie does an hour before the start of which the whole film is set in the very same location
1,not that i would have wanted this movie to show more info for the director,not only is it poorly executed this movie has some really cheap performances which are definitely
1,as a man on an airplane trip through this desolate world for decades after a war he discovers that of his past that the russians had committed the attack,as a fan in the early age i remember seeing the new wave of american television dramas and i found that much more than that in my book
1,a good film is a bit of a mustsee but not as bad,a few people will remember it as a documentary about how to act but
1,what was good about this is that it 's based on the book of,what 's worse is that he had the makings of making this mess
1,there were three main parts it was very funny,there are a lot of funny moments in this show
1,last and probably the best of its kind of comedy but that 's not something,last night it was one who i thought was really cute at the time
1,a big plus of this movie is the last 15 minutes of this movie 's initial and truly gripping climax which is actually shot in a very beautiful light full,a woman with an eye on his arm and a man named the man with an eye he 's trying the new job but the world 's strongest sin
1,it 's not that the show has to deal with,it was like a train gun in the rain
1,what 's with all their misfortunes and how they 're,what was that so good about that great classic
1,etc let me just say that this movie is n't for everyone who wants,etc i know it was probably all a bit different in real time
1,i would have enjoyed this film rather much much more,i loved the first part of the movie and did like
1,much too many bad bad movies like bad,much more a comedy than this one
1,up to the task the audience finds the only one that is not unique and is so stupid that,up until the last fifteen minutes or so i could have done without the rest of the movie
1,finally some kind of a guy from,finally that alone is a problem
1,riccardo andersson is a genius in the film,riccardo 's character makes a comment on me and
1,i watched this movie with high recommendation,i know you 're going to be wrong
1,if i were as harsh as i would like a more interesting movie i,if i were n't so impressed with the film i did not care
1,it did n't matter that much since the,it 's a simple movie for sure
1,it was about a woman who has been raised in a very humble family of her own,it 's the type that made it all the more interesting that the film is n't only a
1,the story line of character development and the drama is very basic though interesting in itself,the movie has a pretty interesting plot but still does n't do the original justice
1,i will not mention what was the first film about the first 35 minutes of that i did n't,i mean do n't they realize what the movie is trying as to say it 's one heck
1,get it out on dvd or dvd but it can be worth it,get away with it and you 're still getting yourself on the inside like
1,why was n't this the first film ever released on dvd,why did it seem to be in a different place
1,what makes this movie great was that they were so popular with the new york culture,what is this about the black dahlia that has only come about a decade before
1,and that is also why the film is n't,and yet in this case it is the best
1,the film is one that does n't give the viewer away any sympathy,the performances come by the director and his friends the supporting players are excellent
1,what follows is a simple movie where a character who is suddenly found in the movie 's central theme,what is most disturbing of the movie is the fact it is just an hour for a character who makes
1,tell the tale of the killer you do n't expect all the same,tell me that this is one big time when it turns around
1,but it 's a movie i cant recommend you have in your collection,but if you know you are n't an idiot the movie is a travesty
1,let me assure the whole story that should n't,let alone take the movie makers get killed
1,this movie is an insult not by any standard,this is only good for a rainy night in the
1,this is an absolutely abysmal film which is a shame as i was n't entertained into,this is the worst movie i ever had the pleasure that i have never had
1,for instance when the dog is the worst you ever know i was in for no serious reason the second time was n't funny,for all i know i 've found the movie quite entertaining and really well made for the time it was made and not to be
1,the story of the film and the development of a few of those films is actually,the dialogue is full but the film becomes more subtle as the acting and direction
1,to start off the film did n't even work but it was an effective film,to call it racist would be a nice movie to follow by the end
1,true a lot of good movies that have been made lately,true as a story i could have imagined that something better but
1,bunch were sent to prison by the government and they got rid on the,bunch are the kind who are n't really the star of the film
1,i'm sorry but maybe this is a good enough movie to watch if you can,i'm shocked that if the movie was called a film or someone who is gay with
1,what is to come the movie all the characters come across,what could have have been called is of a documentary
1,the film is a true classic in its presentation,the acting is n't very convincing as it should not
1,the rest is ok but not quite as great,the problem is the film is just the opposite in
1,the plot is really great that is not to mention the acting the story the story,the most beautiful thing about this movie was the casting choice of all their stars and i
1,while i know its nice to know his name is the same thing he 's,while the cinematography is very slow and some scenes the characters are pretty unlikable
1,the fact that all that in the film was made in a small mansion and a group,the only saving graces of this movie are the few that i was expecting to have
1,example as such a thing happened to the boy as if we are supposed to root a little,example that the character is an excellent actress that is not the only actor in this film
1,actually the story is of a bad taste of art and the production values and poor decisions and,actually that 's an obvious coincidence but this is a good film that wo n't let us
1,the only problem was that you had to have a,the plot and plot are very thin and unbelievable
1,i did not like the score but i was,i was so excited i got that far
1,i would give this film a low rating,i was really annoyed in a movie
1,i 've seen a couple of movies where they really need to make something about my personal fears but instead i can say that no one was really touched by the plot,i watched this movie yesterday and thought it would be great then it probably could n't possibly possibly end because it was one of those shows that i 've never heard before and
1,if this was my thing then he 'd be making a comment about this but then again let me tell you,if anything you ca do n't care anything about the fact that there are so much problems in this movie
1,the cast is excellent with both pros,the movie is really about life
1,considering the film 's original title i also felt it,considering it 's not a bad film it 's definitely worth
1,i saw her before watching the first film with an excellent cast the director was n't too bad in my opinion,i saw this documentary when my friend saw my father 's face at the window it was a funny show
1,the only positive i had to say was this movie and what it means to,the film is beautifully lit in scope in terms of production values and direction
1,this is a very sad film but very different from other films like 'the legend of 'the railway man and 'the roses,this is a film that will leave viewers to ponder and that is what it means it is that is all the truth
1,he wants to play an original,he and his friends have a knack
1,after seeing this movie the acting was so bad that i actually dozed a knife,after having finished a review for my own in this movie and seeing it i was
1,ok here 's a spoiler there was nothing wrong with this movie or,ok that does not mean i can see if it works ever
1,this film is a good example by the quality of the film as it 's just that good,this movie was an attempt of life to be a movie that never came to theaters and this is
1,ca n't wait for the dvd to get a vhs release from the,ca n't you remember that the director was making such great films
1,and yet that 's not a bad idea,and there is the story of a boy and
1,the story is so very simple and i thought that it was actually a documentary about the vietnam movement,the acting is horrible at best and worse with the exception of a script that actually had some of it
1,as a matter of view the movie was actually very entertaining,as the movie progresses it 's just awful and boring but there
1,on the whole i was surprised by a few scenes like this,on the way the first series of events that occur with most action
1,it all looks like the filmmakers are trying to make some sort to be dramatic but they try hard to be too hard to escape,it is that rare in every way the film does not end the viewer with a good message and just gets so bored off
1,we have the film set in the middle east,we get the impression it 's the latter
1,he was supposed to have his face and his lines were n't dubbed with words,he has matured a lot and his name also is the reason behind the movie 's
1,these are two stories that have you believe me,these guys are at a point of their lives and
1,he then turns into the monster killer snowman and the rest of this film,he just happens to be one guy that is as in his movies
1,the movie is not for everyone,the plot is a mess and a
1,only to get out of it the way he,only a few are very well worth mentioning
1,he 's too old to play and is a poor actor with his own voice,he 's so bad that at times i actually believe he got a big kick out
1,the acting ranged between being funny and one dimensional but what is more,the whole film is so contrived to make you wonder who will ever get
1,as a movie is a comedy this movie could have been an hour shorter,as this movie was produced was the first major mistake in the film that would
1,having not seen the original yet since the first release i still ca only imagine to have enjoyed the,having some drawbacks with my opinion of the film 's title the movie is n't one to see
1,fortunately the acting is great and it is the story that i think,fortunately this one should have remained in the hands of several audiences
1,my personal question here is that some parts of,my recommendation watch it you wo like it
1,the acting is great by all involved,the fact is the story is not so
1,two years ago as i was at a college kid on,two movies of this era are not in the circulation
1,although the director and his friend may have just finished watching it it 's not,although it is the first movie i thought that this was a complete ripoff i was
1,but in the future of those it has a lot of problems and it has,but the best thing is the fact i thought it was a bad movie
1,what really annoyed that was was that,what 's left out to me
1,the performances are well done and the plot is not all bad,the film has been adapted to english and the director of the english
1,being the fan of the original series i have seen the play and it was one of my favourites that i could n't really enjoy,being a fan of this subgenre i had to admit i was pretty disappointed and even i still do not know what to say
1,in this case a woman is raped of radium cancer and who are killed by a very strange and equally,in the end i can see the pain being from the viewer who is still looking at the camera
1,if it were n't so simple that this is what he thinks he is supposed to convey with a message of hope that he is a child i 've been looking for him,if you 're into this kind of stuff for something that is a masterpiece to the movie this is the movie for everyone it sure holds our attention from the book 's message which
1,i found this movie to a much greater outlook than all the others to do because it 's,i was at odds just thinking in the face that these guys are so angry and stupid
1,there are several elements of the film which we can understand and hear as we 're presented well not particularly striking but we get,there is the scene that is reminiscent in a hotel room and it features one of my favourites from such a brilliant song
1,that 's what i would do in the movie,that 's what i mean to the end of this
1,as others who have seen the film i can,as for his acting talent he ca all
1,the most effective part in this flick is by focusing on a true story,the end will only be slightly better for the director as he 's a little
1,loved how a movie like american werewolf comes,loved it the way it made about the last
1,the only thing that does n't really have a shred about this story is the way it was filmed,the film is about a young girl named kisna in the middle east at a time when the world is
1,only the last of the seven movies is worth renting because of the director and the writer,only the acting the script just was n't believable enough that i laughed so hard i thought that
1,coopers are the story of the story and the love story itself,coopers in a really bad movie bad acting this is not a movie
1,if i were in the same demographic as a child i 'd like this film like some of my friends or neighbors,if i had the honor to take the word of a great film would be a testament for it to be made
1,anyway it 's got a little confusing a bit of nudity thrown on but,anyway after having seen the movie i thought that it was pretty dull
1,this is a great movie so how can you make,this is the story of a young couple individually
1,about a hundred dollars for a film that i,about to be made and the movie opens
1,after the film had ended a little to start with and it seemed like everyone was going through a series together like some,after all i think the only reason he wanted to show his true love is his wife from the beginning because they have all
1,what is this man with no name as a great artist,what i got was the story of the girl who was born
1,what makes it even more funny,what is with this story in our
1,also some scenes where the actors are trying to deliver the,also it 's not a musical movie to be sure
1,i did not watch the film til any second time and am ashamed to know i had,i think he did a decent job in portraying the real life of the great outdoors
1,and to the end you 'll be watching a,and the music is a bit too bright
1,i would have never read some of those books but in this film we see that in a positive,i hope you never see a remake so soon the one is a great fan of the classic
1,sally 's love interest is n't quite as good and quite charming as those who are involved in the making,sally kellerman is excellent as the mother who 's been the same age she 's been and she was also in
1,but i could definitely see the truth that,but i had a good time watching
1,well the movie is n't as bad as the 1st but still it definitely has a better plot than the other,well it has been a good idea for one of the most interesting and important comments ever that could have made the
1,she is married to him as a woman,she is a bit of fun but she makes
1,it also means that i love that in a big game from,it 's not funny it 's just lame unfunny and stupid
1,pick up the ending that the first time ever put into your heart,pick this movie out but just let it go by any means
1,that 's why i loved the movie,that 's all there is here
1,this is one of the worst films ever so far,this movie is not a thriller with a whole new meaning
1,when it is discovered that these kids were murdered by a ghost killer the monster goes in search for the zombies,when i saw it on a flight i was blown out of the big screen or just another man who has spent
1,i would like this to end in a movie called boogeyman,i 'd recommend this movie because it 's made into a documentary
1,htd was actually very exciting to see so many other actors and actors were not so much unknowns in the story to make their mark,htd is n't that easy to classify in the first place since this was filmed in the aftermath of the seventies and had to get more
1,the acting is bad from the outset to the story,the actors who play the main characters are well known
1,this has got one thing all right a few and,this is the worst movie i saw this day
1,those who are interested in seeing this movie agree with the above comments,those who know are of my opinion can be forgiven for this
1,i mean he was never meant for the best of his career,i mean what a great movie it was and i loved that they
1,he makes sure that he has been shot,he 's a woman the entire time
1,in fact there 's something about this show you 're not really,in fact the action sequences were fairly good in many ways
1,this episode takes place when the series is broadcast again,this movie makes the whole thing look realistic and like a
1,when the man is dying by a friend is sent to the apartment for the night and the camera pulls off his wife,when you 're reading the description and the description read the book that it was going for the viewer was already confused
1,i 'd like you to think that i could watch a film when my gf,i mean we all know but it 's not even your average horror movie
1,timmy is the only actor to the supporting cast of great work at a time when the film,timmy has to contend with a certain guy who has had all over that line of love
1,for good reason though you have an enjoyable time,for me this is a pretty good movie
1,trust of the story with the story and the characters involved the story is a bit too weak for its characters 's flaws and weaknesses,trust him or leave he would have been arrested for a job and so he is asked to leave a man behind some money
1,these things do not seem real though,these two stars of this film seem to
1,the music is awful but the movie is also extremely good,the story unfolds at a snail trying to get a bit more
1,many of them did not make sense while you actually did n't,many of us have n't had a hard day 's story
1,jacey plays the main character in the movie,jacey and her friends have taken the same man
1,you have read the book that is based on a true novel,you might think they may need to get a little more attention from
1,hmmmm the whole production is pretty cool but the film is rather bland the acting is awful the storyline does n't work,hmmmm he 's good enough but the most annoying aspect of the movie aside from that is some more a big fight sequence
1,if you 've already seen it you 'll most likely hate the film if you were,if you want to be patient and even interested in the action watch this movie
1,ok this is not really anything as good or,ok so it can be a nice idea
1,not only is the film incredibly awful but a,not that there is no need to remake
1,his performance is as he gets the best of all his fans,his story is about growing in the world of living with his mother
1,sure but the movie is the most difficult,sure it 's dated the actors have very little
1,thinnes 's wife is very well portrayed by streep,thinnes is great in his role and the film is
1,seeing this movie is like a painting of a young man 's attempt at a rock book but with all of its goodies,seeing this in a theater and how it got my toenails from a different time is just one way to get the feeling that
1,however if anyone could like this film with a better cast and crew for such a great film then it 's more than likely that it might be considered,however there 's no denying for any of the other characters that this film portrays themselves and the audience was too young of the characters in this one
1,he meets a new model with the other side stories and lives,he 's a cop who has a tough time on his life that
1,he 's been trying to be too scary to impress a few,he is able to speak freely he is a real person
1,it 's the same thing over and done,it is just impossible for the audience 's audience
1,it was filmed by my gf who i analyzed from the trailer that a little girl on an interview by herself is killed,it 's about how the young women were used as a backdrop in the name that not the only reason for the big black
1,it 's like we 're supposed as if we should,it 's like watching a real person trying to find the
1,if you 're a horror lover looking like a bad one,if there were any other movies with a single person from it
1,the main reason it had been released was the lack of plot thread,the script makes the book to an interesting and profound note which makes you
1,however this one has the potential to shock and the director has just thrown out the movie,however when the bad dude gets in there trouble and there are n't much more than that
1,technically it is a pretty funny film in many ways but it is still one that is very rare,technically speaking in the way this story is told but in a world of desperation it is more of a
1,no one is just a normal person a very funny human,no matter what this was his most memorable films i enjoyed seeing
1,he 's still an actor and director,he is always in it and he does
1,benoit has a very similar character and his love for each character which makes him a different personality,benoit has created the same kind of role although the character is still good with all the other supporting
1,another character that does n't feel any empathy for having no problem understanding and when the family takes revenge,another story of two families who decide for the murder against their mother and dad their own life
1,they decide that they will leave the island to get up on the night before they get away,they are so obviously influenced and that the result is merely boring as well with no meaning
1,worth watching the movie to realize that a lot of other films came from a,worth a rental to the director the directors have made an agreement which means
1,but for this reason you 'll understand its plot,but here they are in good shape that i had
1,his performance is not his face as a little boy,his daughter with whom she can trust the family
1,at one or another point in this movie i noticed that most of it was so predictable and the editing,at the time the movie seemed to go for several characters but the movie just seemed to drag off
1,i'm glad this made a movie,i'm glad i did n't pay to
1,as well as in my humble opinion this movie does not have to be an insult to the intelligence of either gay culture but rather a conservative study on how many times people have seen such people as,as the two brothers decide that his wife and son have been separated by his own mother he tries and decides to leave their child on his son in fact on a day when he is left
1,unsuccessfully this is my kind the films of our,unsuccessfully this movie had some pretty good lines
1,there 's a reason why that is being used in this,there 's a very big amount going around to keep it from
1,when the movie was supposed to have a little plot about what the,when watching the film the only thing left off is the ending
1,it is n't about the world or the possibilities of being there,it all seems that the director wants all the right reasons to kill
1,there is n't a hint of this,there was nothing to recommend it
1,i mean it is a classic,i did like seeing this movie over
1,plus the plot was just horrible it 's not nearly as bad as some,plus i have an gripe with the ending too much in the end
1,on the whole the film looks like,on that note do n't bother
1,ca n't help but dwell on this film,ca n't the writer or director do a lot
1,someone who loves a film and even some good movies is a mustsee,someone needs to be told and the movie is n't just so bad that
1,and a couple of weeks later we,and then there is the acting
1,i really liked this movie and i am still in awe for it,i was very upset by the movie as i do not want to watch
1,when they reach that point in time they just fall flat while throwing,when the bad guy is finally rescued and beaten by his car
1,i am a big admirer of robert patrick but now the movie is a big disappointment,i do n't think it 's ever seen and it really has nothing to recommend
1,if a movie is a thriller it must take an interest in a movie to watch in the,if it was just a drama about the life and the conflict it 's still worth seeing
1,they have a little personality in their eyes and it is all here,they have to be seen a few days later the next day
1,just because it was so stupid i would certainly recommend this,just do n't expect the usual laughs on your face
1,what the heck is this all all about from what i 've witnessed,what is a complete mess for us is that it has a few flaws
1,but what does it matter next,but this is a film you would
1,the problem is the lack one one,the only interesting aspect of this film is
1,einstein was a perfect replacement for a character i loved most,einstein is a great character actor and a strong story
1,the film is full in scope with the film 's story and the script,the film is full of drama and it is the story and character that you
1,i thought the acting of jeff goldblum was well cast but they did n't give up any,i have seen some great films in her career but this one is not that great
1,i give it 7 out of 5 not for people,i love his films but this is so bad it hurts
1,the plot of the film is one of my favorites,the performances do seem to come under the direction but the
1,the first film was better than this,the actors seem far less comfortable than the
1,a bad plot for kids it is n't that bad,a bunch of kids come across in a bar of water
1,sidenote a big mistake is the fact that,sidenote a few other films are made
1,when the girl is on a train to have sex with his brother then what is the best,when our heroes are threatened to eat the world we end up in a very strange situation
1,though the film is n't good it 's still a very good movie,though if you 're interested and wanted a decent example of character development there
1,i know that this movie is n't,i could see how a movie like this
1,sure this does not come from a book by the same director as the first film,sure there are some bad things but this is definitely one of them i liked
1,i could only say i am a big fan of woody smith but in the meantime i 've watched the whole thing and it just looks a little dated and dull,i do not understand that the director intended this kind of humor to make it more entertaining than i had already read the plot and dialog on it 's entirety but this
1,so i 'd give up on it with my friend on and on and say,so the movie has some interesting elements that seem to come along with a little more
1,without that redeeming quality i have to be honest to a very high rating but imdb wo n't allow to put this comment on my list of 210 movies of this film but on a level it 's a pretty good horror film that keeps you guessing until i finally found,without question the movie 's climax has no connection to any real plot or atmosphere no climax no action no suspense nothing is the same goes for the ending and the climax and the ending credits all do a good ending and it becomes a huge shock to other viewers
1,but the film is n't too bad,but she 's not the least better
1,randolph has a little time against his own and is trying to find a way,randolph scott was one of the great actor in that film who could n't have been
1,i guess that is really a complaint with a film which has no bearing,i saw it when i was 7 and was now mesmerized by it
1,so why do they choose to include the two in such scenes as in this one,so it turns out that there 's a serial killer that is in the vortex
1,cbs has a chance a great show with,cbs was the worst of the three
1,this movie is no doubt a gem but for the first two hours it is more of the,this film will appeal so that in a sense of humor the movie itself is the funniest
1,it had a few points but you could forgive the movie without much,it 's pretty much all too much and there was no plot
1,their best efforts are the characters who,their only weakness about this film
1,so if one are in love why would he make movies with him,so you can go and buy a copy or watch another episode if nothing
1,barring that this movie is full of action sequences and a really bad movie all over,barring his first movie he is really one that could n't have made up for what it
1,money for those who do not care about the culture of these men,money wasted in this was a very short movie and it was probably the
1,the fact is however if i were watching a movie and a very bad thing i do believe,the story involves a bunch of americans living in the middle of the ocean after the death
1,these movies have become so many of these,these two are one of my favourites
1,she is also in a hospital of a,she seems a little stiff at times
1,i just watched the show on dvd and the only way to find out whether one of the,i like the concept of his wife as a lover and then he gives her a little
1,many will not have a clue as to why or why,many scenes seemed more like something of an edgy comedy
1,if you like watching this movie i highly recommend it to anyone,if this is the case then please it is a classic
1,the plot of course is the basic,the story seems to go nowhere
1,the film is more about a series which is the weakest thing in history,the other character in the film was an alcoholic who had a good father and
1,to the first part a young member of her family and the other people are going nuts that they are not at all concerned,to be fair that it goes into a movie with its immense twists and turns and is not entirely devoid of scares to say that
1,sorry to say it was ok but it definitely made the whole thing seem contrived,sorry i did n't even care at a movie when the characters were not so much
1,which brings me to the ending that i could n't bear,which leads us to a happy end from one of america that
1,it is an excellent and heartbreaking film,it does have a few problems with the
1,it 's not that bad but it 's just great enough to make you laugh the whole way through,it 's a film about three groups who want each and most men and women to try and get rid
1,ok so you have seen that one scene from beginning by now,ok it 's not a good movie but there is really nothing in
1,at this point in time the filmmakers just think they 've been dead,at first glance you know what i was talking i mean wow
1,however i was at least mildly able to suspend disbelief a few,however all those moments are still a dream to look for
1,1991 is a bad movie it 's really good,1991 's darkplace is one of spielberg better films
1,but i also like the fact it was shot in new zealand or in the early 90s and was one of those films that seemed a,but all of its problems arise to a very strong level of the events that go around within one person 's struggle with each other
1,this film has nothing resembling plot twists and turns but,this is another movie that has no redeeming quality
1,as for the rest of it you would probably be watching a good family movie,as i recall the way the media handled the script did we know that the movie
1,i think i would like it to be an action movie instead of just attempting humor,i just got out of my chair watching this movie on the telly i 'd rather have
1,with the help of a high school dropout named the doctor the owner and the wife in a room on the outside end of their,with a large budget and a beard in the back yard the next thing we do have a really awful aftertaste of this film
1,he wants some money and it is hard for the girl in prison to try and solve the mystery but he 's out there,he is very beautiful for the role and does it well as well as a few other posters but the problem with this movie is
1,and it really is the same kind of movie that they play with the first film of all,and the scene where he runs a car across a road ledge was one thing to highlight
1,to say that this is an old man made me wonder why there are no good performances in this movie apart from his,to be honest i never heard about it so many times since i saw this movie before i remember seeing the previews
1,and in the end the story is a little predictable,and as a matter when the film reaches the climax the
1,i liked the show because it was the only one who was involved in the making of it,i love this film for being a good movie especially when that was part of the fun
1,in one scene a woman is injured she 's pregnant and the other is the daughter,in this case our sympathy for a man of nature is evident that it 's a love
1,a true story about a troubled mother and her parents who have sex with an elder child and later on in order for revenge,a great example of how a film can be called this crap is like a spoof of a movie that has some elements of the
1,amidst the rest of the movie the whole film descends into melodrama and while the film is n't about the killer 's intentions it just has,amidst the use it was an attempt at an art film to be with movies like this and there was no shortage in his mind
1,caution for the movie in fact there 's some,caution 's it 's just an excellent movie
1,the only one that made this movie good is that it was made by the creators with,the cast is pretty forgettable and it did not bother to have a real star power
1,to say this because it has a number of interesting ideas and a,to say it was a great film is definitely not to be
1,i really wish that a bigger portion can cause you to spend more time subjecting,i love horror movies that were to go and use this kind of movie
1,i'm all so picky it was never released,i'm pretty sure this was intended to be taken
1,von palma was a master filmmaker and he was so proud of his work that by this point he made some of the most awful films to come up with a better script but then so much more,von stroheim 's narration is an entirely believable portrayal of the characters in his family but to us by this end of his career we are never sure what it was all around us all for more
1,it 's so bad to say the best as a tv pilot that we only watch the third,it seems that the director and the editor did not even use them to make a good product
1,paul sorvino the one who really stands out in the character of john anderton the former scientist who helps him out the next time a former doctor named john,paul sorvino seems very good as the father and the little girl is n't as sexy as an older couple i 've been watching and she is one reason that
1,i like this movie very very bad acting that had,i 've no idea who was behind the camera
1,the end result is a great film,the dialogue is so bad it 's funny
1,in a sense the real beauty is it,in a way this was not something for the
1,finally the first time and the third that was about,finally it takes the story to a certain degree
1,yes there are some truly hilarious parts in this film,yes it 's a great film and it shows
1,while the story in the book is also very well done also works very well with all the intrigue it does n't,while it was not as stupid as in many of the other movies it may be worth the rental price of a rental
1,why is n't he a murderer who is n't in any,why should there be any real problems of this movie
1,there are also lots of good films and it 's very enjoyable,there is a very weak twist when you go to this movie all
1,we see some guy from the past he lives as an adult on halloween and who,we have two people in it but a lot more than they have been about
1,if you have not been in a theater during the 1980s there is another point of reference to this,if a new generation 's death is about to be discovered by their respective students all the kids should n't
1,most americans would have the benefit their career as their heroes that are more than just an ordinary two or two,most likely this movie has an extended rating for a story and a 15 in fact is it so well
1,i was a kid and i got bored watching this show,i found the movie hilarious even though it is not only boring
1,this is a real shame that it is one that you want to see if not with all of your children,this movie was about a boy and wife who come upon the house and become cursed of themselves being abducted by a
1,what could have been great was the fact that it was made by someone who wanted to see some really,what if you are going to turn the movie off but you wo n't see this movie a bit
1,haim would have been as good as batman and the king,haim also has a little role as a radio dj
1,this is the best anime ever made,this is one of those movies where every
1,why did n't the family be depicted in any sort with a,why on many of the biggest issues do not make sense
1,in fact the first half of this film feels like a student episode,in fact i would not be surprised if they were not alone
1,he has done a good job in the story and was just about the only good aspect in the sequel,he is actually a little generous when the character calls to go out into a different kind that he meets on
1,this film is also in my opinion,this is an extremely disappointing film
1,the acting is pretty good with the exception of one character who makes the first 15 min of the movie more interesting and also has a,the only redeeming feature in this movie is that they just made the mistake for trying it to make it look like a commercial success
1,mixing it up with a few friends that should be called in the world for a little bit of time,mixing them together and tell them to play the straight guy they do n't seem too aware of their relationship but
1,so to give you the chance of watching this the entire thing could get worse with an annoyingly bad guy that makes a good ass,so it 's about a person who comes in to investigate an ancient country and then disappears from his death bed which has to be the
1,there were some interesting issues to follow and you would n't have had much idea of it,there is something about mary crawford about her and her life but for a rather unknown start she
1,also for example i love the scene of his parents with a girl on a field of water but then just to let him get a horse off his face,also the only person with whom has come close to him is a very funny scene about a man who 's been lying in a chair and is in need of
1,i think we 're supposed to be a little more serious and some viewers have some qualms with,i was watching it in the 80s and i was stunned to see how i got it
1,at the beginning we are expected we will witness a little girl being a little rough in the face when you get to an actual end there are other problems that have nothing to really have you,at the beginning of this movie and the film they really had to be made into some of these scenes that i had had trouble watching for a while because i did n't care about what was going
1,they never really made out this tripe except the two brothers and i had seen one of her last successes and thought she was n't any better,they were all very good actors but i had to be a fan on the movie for me so the script was n't nearly as bad as i
1,but that does n't necessarily mean it has any of the problems,but not a big picture for it 's good cast either
1,all of that should work against the,all that matters and no action
1,could you expect this film as a comedy,could probably have been so much funnier
1,this story was also a vehicle to,this was a pretty good film
1,i am very glad i did not pay my bills to see it just to see the real surprise,i was at one point of this one when it appeared i thought as it was made for a couple
1,the scene where he was in the,the acting and editing are amateurish
1,do n't watch this film expecting to,do n't get the wrong product
1,boy did he do it for free or not,boy is this a bad movie the producers will probably
1,it was n't that bad in the movie theater but if you like a bit,it was really amazing that the filmmakers needed a lot to have a sequel
1,it really is worth seeing with a smile and you might enjoy it but otherwise i'm not a big fan of those that are the ones,it 's a shame because he has never done his best work but this one was the worst of the three which was one night
1,this is n't one of those movies that you ca n't stand to watch,this is my typical dvd of it and it is the last movie i could
1,the film is not as well constructed,the director is an accomplished screenwriter and some
1,this movie is a mess of a film,this movie is full of ridiculous dialogue
1,filmed through a dark filter it works well a little more,filmed in black and white to be quite well crafted
1,there is hardly enough action as good as the first ones,there are some interesting moments and this is an example of a
1,it 's a shame because the director and writer did all that a lot of crap,it has a lot of plot line some holes and the story is so dull that you
1,i think the whole time i was watching it i can be a diehard admirer of either love or hate movies and am interested with him,i do not know how that is going to end spoilers in a film so that the viewer could do a very good job of the movie
1,i ca n't really describe how any of the actors,i think the film was released in the us as the
1,a very enjoyable script by stephen king who is sure to bring the film down too seriously,a few episodes of the tv show are the ones where they 're getting together in the game
1,because he and his crew work for the most part,because it 's also an enjoyable little piece the story of
1,we have to admit that if you 're a fan 's you 'll find the worst movie in the right genre,we also get a glimpse at the film as a couple on the same level as the last film in which our
1,dietrich is perfect she has to do the thing,dietrich 's portrayal of a young woman who has never
1,i have n't actually seen the game since i,i mean that the ending is really awful
1,as the plot unfolds the film switches gears from the start to the end and we all know the,as the movie went the plot had to follow up to its predecessor with great acting and direction
1,i mean c'mon maybe the people who saw this movie hated it,i ca n't wait why anyone would say this movie is n't good
1,but then again it 's not a good film,but there 's a lot more to the story than
1,the plot had a lot less impact than any of the action,the story unfolds in real life and is very well executed
1,explosions are good but the film 's premise of a man falling,explosions from time to place in the movie is not good
1,further after the third story of an american who is found himself there to help a bit,further as well a movie to tell a tale and with such a great cast and the cast
1,i mean the movie was just as bad it,i loved both the plot and story line
1,the whole movie is a complete disaster that seems like it was written just to laugh a little bit but in the hands of some of your expectations it,the film is a mixture between a very long and very short feature but it also shows the very differently that is being made of his early years
1,this was such a stupid movie with a message,this film may not have come up a better deal
1,my wife was out of a mental institution,my vote for this movie is 1
1,from the moment she meets the beautiful elvira who has gone away from her coma after escaping from,from this very beginning of movies i was just watching the movie which was a great idea
1,most people do that and have to,most movies are just plain fun
1,that 's ok but that 's all,that 's just the tip of all that
1,just do not expect the original,just like the good ol' days of
1,the scene of the film is hilarious especially in the opening scene with the one who is playing a concert,the film was released in brazil and it is very short but if you want to see a film that features
1,there is a lot to remember about this movie and it makes the movie interesting to sit alone,there are a few scenes involving the film on some occasions at that point on the show
1,the best the other actors can perform their roles like the,the plot is not exactly the same but rather works
1,this film also contains many of those old and different styles,this film is very much a product which is a bit unsettling
1,because he knows that they 're not so much a fan as a person who is the one responsible for this,because they are in prison in new york with one of the biggest cities in the world the country has been destroyed
1,when that came out you had that movie had,when the first was released a very famous mgm version
1,he is the hero in the game and she has also slept with her in the,he was very effective and this film was quite a treat to watch him through
1,the acting is mediocre and the story line is absolutely ridiculous as are the characters,the problem i was with this movie was the way the movie was shot
1,had you not read a book or beforehand in a movie so you would be left feeling that there is not any,had i not heard that the first hour was an original and i had never heard of it so i would be wrong
1,but the movie is so stupid that you want to puke,but if you are into consideration to seeing people who are in
1,the first segment is n't going down,the plot was quite a mess
1,essentially there really is no good story,essentially it has all the elements thrown together
1,in fact the film has no heart and the other actors are,in fact it 's a bad movie which you cant understand
1,i would say the film 's ending is as interesting and satisfying about it as it gets,i have never seen this film in the theater and it was one reason for me to see
1,it 's not easy not only not this can seem very good and it,it is an absolute must see for all fans of british crime films
1,genet 's film takes a lot,genet as his father turns himself in
1,i can safely say that the film is good with the very young jennifer jones playing a role and the title cards about the movie and the scenes in it the movie also gets into the story,i could have given it a 7 if they had made it cheaper but i guess it was only for the kids who were looking for something that looks like this movie at least had a few moments
1,for example in this movie a camera made me jump to despair and have to sign one of the worst scenes ever,for those that are you and just are n't like me or just watch this movie on the big screen there has to
1,unless you know the plot i believe that was enough,unless i remember correctly i was never bored to watching this
1,unfortunately this movie is quite possibly the most stupid comedy made in hollywood which makes absolutely no sense and it goes beyond,unfortunately the film is one of my personal favourites i ca n't seem too easily wrong either to recount this movie
1,the only positive comment about the movie though is that it is so much fun that,the plot is weak and the plot and dialog are not nearly developed any favours
1,all in this series is just a very long and,all of this but it 's just not fun
1,and the ending was pretty sad for me but the twist about this movie is really good the end of the film,and for everyone else 's it must be a complete waste on film this would seem to be a big budget movie and
1,she does n't know at the beginning and end with,she just does n't have all lines of energy
1,i like this movie as i 've watched it in 50,i ca all see a plot summary to this movie
1,i could only describe this as one of the first films i saw that they are actually better than,i liked the movie and have never read the book since the original and did not want to
1,there 's a reason why they are on tv for being able and this sequel does a better follow,there 's another sequence to introduce the most ardent characters of the bunch to be seen to be believed who
1,cool in places but the plot is awful to say the best,cool story line and acting but the movie is just awful
1,i'm talking about how this movie was produced when you were in a coma,i'm going to get to know what you are getting away from the script and
1,a few months later he was forced and abused by a young woman who had her first audition from him,a wonderful example is how many people really have no idea what it is like to get through a whole slew
1,more of a series of vignettes from one of the many countries that will happen to them,more importantly i found the movie somewhat disappointing and i did just like the movie it was filmed
1,the movie also fails to make any money for me at any point,the film goes from very good to absolutely awful to be seriously poor
1,he is the only character who does not care about,he was also the biggest star in tv history
1,i would 've heard about it the only time anyone ever has a friend on the show will,i have been in a mental institution for several years and never have seen this film reviewed
1,the film deals with racial prejudice in the,the film has little to recommend this
1,the scene where the two men take the bullet on to it 's knees are not a laugh or,the only one who has seen him has a long career at his worst is the young guy
1,on a level of 110 this movie was a complete waste,on every aspect this was a big waste for my time as
1,burt was one time when they wanted to go,burt reynolds also has an accent that i liked as
1,some of the dialogue is actually pretty interesting and i enjoyed this film and it 's really good,some interesting moments the music and the overall feel to it which was also amazing because the director chose
1,in fact i have been a fan since childhood,in this story a guy has to choose between the
1,in the end she is forced to go home and her friend 's problems with his work and some will love to find,in a way you can see this movie with the director who has always managed it to make his point of view
1,stars for example was that i saw this in 1988 at a local station in dc,stars with a young boy a young man a handsome and talented young woman who wants to
1,james earl howe was okay as the new yorker but the movie was n't nearly as bad as some of it 's flaws,james whitmore is brilliant as a menacing scientist who is torn down by his new home and his uncle who helps him find a
1,although the film is rather dark like some of these films it is just plain awful,although this is the true good thing i had to check out the other user reviews i
1,what i really liked was that this was a pretty bad movie that seemed to be made for a reason that i never saw them get their hands and i really did n't,what was the use for this bland mess of a film with two actors who have an inane script and two actors who are the only redeeming feature in the entire film
1,add to the mix that was the director of some classic classics and one of,add is that the movie is a bit too good for a rainy night
1,the most remarkable sequence involves the hero telling the captain about the case which makes his name go,the story of the search is lost by the americans that they 're given in the background
1,a few scenes of the movie have really moved me,a man in trouble is the ultimate problem a child or
1,in the end this film should be an indication of how the film could have been made for the people,in my childhood it 's not like any other movie of the genre is an insult to the masses
1,i just had a good time seeing it and i had,i loved this film i saw some really funny parts
1,while this might not necessarily be a good adaptation of a classic but in all fairness it is n't in the way that the original has fallen in its wayside but it is also very touching indeed and it is definitely worth it for,while the film is clearly a complete attempt to copy the life of a gay man and his sister 's death and some of his own personal work their reactions in his life to the man of the past and present events are present
1,he meets with a group of friends to go along,he then discovers the hidden link of the two inhabitants and
1,it also helps to get the feel of how a movie about the,it 's very sad that a lot of people will watch it
1,it 's so bad its actually hard on the eyes,it 's a wonderful piece for a director to produce one
1,not that some of you know that,not that the movie is bad
1,but it is great art from the perspective that the director made that i did not realize a director who wrote it and then came to the top,but that 's how the ending and the ending come and if that i was n't really going out the window to get out of my car
1,usually a horror film is more realistic than you might expect,usually there are a few things i have seen with similar themes
1,there is a whole lot more to this story,there were also some good actors in this episode so
1,well if you are a fan of the series of,well worth seeking for what is a cult film
1,it 's a nice watch that i have read many of those that i will read but if you do n't watch it you probably wo like this,it 's like a bunch of idiots that the entire crew was just trying to get their money back they wanted to make fun off the phone
1,not that of the other but i believe that the director was an,not that there was a plot line that went beyond all limits
1,anyone who has a particular perspective in history will find this film rather than eyeopening and the other is one that is not,anyone who thinks that the movie was made was based on a philip potter movie should be sued after seeing the film
1,and the scene where dr loomis is,and that 's a bad movie
1,i'm sorry to say that i had been looking at it up until the end the movie did n't even try,i'm a fan and have n't seen an actress by myself until i was too scared to get my hands to see
1,it is an interesting story with a few surprises but you are left wondering what,it was so sad how the producers of the novel ended the movie making
1,i will tell you that as i went to a cinema to see this one it was not,i am not going to get into a game but i was not afraid to sit through it
1,he is a great detective and there is a good,he had some of us but a few changes
1,some of them are so good that even the actors in the movie can make it better just to publish the film,some of it takes in the film but one day they end to a remote and of course some of that is a
1,i found this movie in an absolute chronological category,i loved everything to me and i'm afraid that the
1,this movie has only one or one redeeming part in it that is the last fight scene,this movie is not to be taken as it was n't a horror film it was just a
1,and the scene with the boy is as great as,and this is definitely a movie with the title
1,all three main cast members are all excellent and well acted and acted,all we see is a bunch of girls who are killed at the beach
1,they are just annoying and obnoxious and very unfunny,they are just annoying actors and it is n't even
1,it makes fun of all the great comedy films of the 1940s,it 's been very long run with me and it 's just an
1,how it was in the theater,how could she be a singer
1,the acting was horrendous and the writing wooden,the film is as the story about a mother
1,for those interested over the age this is worth watching but do n't buy into this one the acting the special values the costumes,for a time waster in fact i 've found a way out but i wo only have wasted 87 hours of my life
1,i ca n't even begin watching one,i know i did not know what to
1,i 've never seen this movie at the,i would be wrong to be honest
1,i like the way they go about having conversations with a dog,i can hardly say how many times have these elements of the same
1,the movie itself is a mess but it is not worth watching,the film is shot entirely over the top rope but the action sequences
1,and the most obvious part of his life in this movie,and this is why you want to look at it
1,despite from his usual flaws his own film seems a little hokey,despite a few moments of interest this film was just a total disappointment
1,so you 'll have to wait for the right reasons,so on the upside of this it is a long and
1,the movie is set up without any semblance of tension or romance and does not even fit,the acting is very good although not enough to make up the movie 's overall recommendation
1,the plot was thin but so it was the,the last ten minutes or so are priceless
1,a movie about a true love story makes you think that it is going to happen just in a,a few minutes into this movie you find out that the only thing missing was for the end
1,this story is so predictable that it becomes,this is not a film to watch
1,in fact there was no question whatsoever from,in addition the story is rather boring
1,so i was surprised how this is such a huge,so why is n't one of my favorite scenes
1,plus it gets my heart pumping out by the fact that someone who has lived in such a beautiful world and its a film of any,plus i ca n't stand for days on that same occasion over time i could n't see the plot line so the acting is great
1,and i did not see him walking through the,and i was so engrossed into watching her
1,the only redeeming value to this otherwise good movie was its lack of a story,the scene in which the woman tries to kill and runs away from him and the
1,plus this is probably one of those shows where it takes them so seriously to take,plus the scene where tom and clark are dancing by the train through the air
1,you 'd swear that a character in the book who has a few chuckles and little bit of a mystery,you know it 's supposed to look like a parody but do n't bother me what it really does
1,she meets him again and goes after him,she is a nice actress but she is n't
1,a movie that i do not enjoy watching because it was so bad was n't my life,a must see just for the fact that it contains a strong plot line and a good cast
1,he is clearly a filmmaker who is the real murderer of the world,he 's just as convincing and sympathetic as it needs to be
1,let 's not forget this show that i have gotten to,let 's not forget that there must be some real reason to
1,yours is a must see for me,yours was never released from video with the
1,i have n't seen such trash in my life,i have a suspicion about the way in which a
1,with this film though you will be a bit hesitant but if you have read a summary for,with a few exceptions you might be pleasantly likely to make a good movie to be made
1,they are all for different reasons,they had just released this one on
1,avery 's films that are supposed or b are not for people that do,avery made a great movie but the movie had little to no budget
1,and of what is supposed at all in the film does n't get any better,and for a more mature person who enjoys the film i think it is worth seeing
1,the film is set in a small town with the best,the cast is very well done for some great actors
1,the rest of this movie has no real deal to work out,the whole film could have ended the same way as i did n't
1,the story revolves only on the first of the series that revolves upon some mysterious woman the one,the film was made a little long too often because of the poor performance of patrick stewart
1,but this film was no excuse to put all the pieces together,but for my taste i ca n't imagine that it is supposed to
1,the characters of the four lead characters are absolutely brilliant,the story is good as a whole the dialogue and dialog
1,but i still like the fact it does n't belong in his book and then does this film and we,but if you 're looking to get on your self this movie may just have you on this edge
1,the acting is quite well made,the ending is absolutely horrible but for
1,also if you love kathy burton or have a couple of friends with children than have no talent or do not have the opportunity,also the acting was decent and was well done and well acted and had a story that did n't leave the whole story
1,the special effects were a bit overdone compared today,the scene at the airport house where the little dog
1,the most annoying film is if the movie is a parody,the film was also a great film about a person who is
1,she was n't the good girl,she 's not going to make that
1,how did she find out he was the one boy and,how could you make him believe he just is n't
1,in this movie he gets caught up in an underground murder but he has it with the girl and then falls in jail,in spite i have to admit he did a good and entertaining script about a bunch i love the characters in this film though
1,the last half of these three is a real masterpiece,the movie is not a bad movie and its bad its
1,always i think that this movie is very,always a bit harsh and sometimes disturbing
1,i'm sure the audience could have been on a better relationship with her character and her voice could have ended,i'm thinking it was a low point in the career but she still manages to keep it in suspense
1,on this note the only thing that the movie is good if there was any movie,on the other side the cinematography of the movie may be very nice to watch
1,it does not matter how to describe this a,it 's one thing that did n't do
1,i will be a big problem i did,i love these kind of movies but this is
1,i have watched this episode and i ca all be a,i had no idea what to do of this movie
1,dr magrew has created a monster that kills his,dr watson must have been a big part
1,he just wanted to get out of her,he is also a wonderful film critic of the
1,normally the worst part of this entire escapade was the script,normally when there is an issue in which these are not real
1,it has a lot of heart and soul and even greater elements like the human,it is a movie that really made me forget to have my face corrected
1,benoit and company find themselves on a cross between the black hole and,benoit tells dave that he loves a woman and has a crush
1,with all these people you can probably get a taste on the acting that even with the movie is,with a plot like you did n't like this it could have really been a very good film
1,to begin there were a few instances of the first 20 minutes of my childhood but there will have to be a point in the film that,to say this was a sequel is to bring the whole movie a whole lot more so i have found it to have that i did
1,but when it 's not clear he can make the rounds of his actions and the viewer is not sure if they,but to be honest i have never watched such an awesome horror masterpiece that i cannot wait to get my hands
1,the film starts very smoothly the scene where the killer gets drunk and tries a baby of his dead body,the acting is n't bad the acting was so poor and you would have your own choice of watching this movie
1,there was no point in the film,there was enough of the movie 's plot
1,is this movie supposed on a serious basis,is the reason for doing the film to make
1,this makes a lot better with shamed movies like the exorcist or donnie darko 's 'the manchurian code,this film is more of a comedy than an episode with the exact same plot which did very few
1,after having visited the book for the first year i decided that the movie would probably be better when he had n't been,after that the plot is pretty basic but it 's all about the way it takes care for everything that happens in the town
1,this is not one of the films that you 've got the,this is one film of a lifetime who can appreciate it
1,if we 're not familiar enough the film is not as well as other,if you want to laugh hysterically and laugh out for some decent entertainment
1,she is the one to kill,she looks so real and the movie
1,and it 's a pity that this,and there 's nothing new here
1,our characters are more realistic that 's a fine mix of the two worlds but it 's more like,our heroine is a real human face who looks absolutely stunning and acts in such an obvious way
1,the movie makes sense only is that the film tries,the result comes from a series of bad actors
1,some might not have missed it,some movies just have nothing to offer
1,it 's about a young couple trying to,it is one that is even rarer
1,the performances of their faces make you laugh more and more,the only good thing that i can remember about it
1,it 's so good it is almost comical,it 's a shame that some of these actors
1,this is the worst movie ever made,this is the one who wrote it
1,the story could have ended without a lick to say so i had to see it for the sake,the story line was ok but it was so disjointed that i cannot even begin thinking about that
1,jock is also a very stupid character with a different type view but the most annoying character of the first half of his episode was the one who was murdered and,jock and a girl named mandy bullock are her friends in the bar and the local husband who wants to get her first blood from her school was the daughter
1,what kind has the characters doing in films,what a mistake he had to make it to
1,the script was pretty good the sets and settings were well done,the ending of the movie was totally pointless and is just plain annoying
1,it 's also very well made and that is n't exactly true since the movie is very entertaining,it 's obvious that there 's a lot of nudity but the dialogue and acting are a bit of
1,the film is a complete failure,the scene where the hero says he
1,they go around killing people just before going through the,they 're on a mission because they need money
1,i do n't think he actually did have an incentive,i could barely remember anyone having a copy in a film
1,the fact that the script is a comedy,the film is as real as it is but
1,i was expecting a lot of good actors but unfortunately the movie turned out to have been shot on video in the worst,i had no clue because i wanted to write 10 mins of my life and so would love to watch it again
1,although i ca all not that i have anything against ang lee 's style in this film it is a very enjoyable scene and the film is very well done,although i have n't seen many of the comments i 've read here it looks like i 've been on the bottom of a list and have lost count of a
1,for years after watching this film one day and the next friday a lot of the viewer must suffer at a place in a cinema near a bar of the day and then get back to the fact,for all this criticism may not have been a good review for an entertaining thriller as it is far superior to these others and the two young men do not make the same mistakes as the others
1,while the film 's story does not flow in the context of the book it 's simply not the story of a very moving person in the universe,while a movie on paper is not very very good it 's very long before viewing the first story and the second one is really good with more than
1,the most disturbing part of this episode is the way the characters of the three main protagonists and friends,the film has a very bad ending and the end is quite abrupt yet to save the movie
1,eric and his father lisa played her father role a very beautiful and intelligent young woman from london city in the early thirties who are living,eric clapton 's portrayal of a woman a woman is a nice addition of a woman who gets a good performance in the last act
1,it 's the fact that it has one,it 's not a movie you see
1,ugh if you have n't seen this film you are wrong wrong with the movie,ugh it looks more like an exercise with heaps more of an actor than an adult
1,it had to come at least in my opinion of the world,it does n't even seem that good in the first place
1,a bunch the other actors could 've done better with this,a lot more of a better actor would have made better use
1,throw away a gun that turns out you 're right there 's a pretty nice and exciting view of a good old person,throw me out of the whole movie at the end of our hero and let us take care of him when he 's on
1,i just watched this film in the theater,i could have seen him more but that would
1,the main theme of an abandoned man returning to america to recover from the prison is disclosed but then it turns its head into a film he is forced to deliver,the story is about a woman trying and her mother to become ill but a hypocrite the story begins to spiral out into the real bad with the first half hour of
1,turns out it 's a lot of other movies that i can only mention for the,turns out that he has never learned the word about it to his wife 's
1,christopher walken gives the most memorable line of the movie,christopher pacino has a very small role as the police inspector
1,it 's about as annoying a story as that could go and if you 're not,it shows just about everyone is so dumb and ugly that it is n't funny
1,our hero is a very confused businessman,our main characters are killed by the evil
1,it is a very good thriller,it 's a shame because this is
1,it was the last film to depict some,it should have been a better film
1,they are also able to get to the bottom point and there,they are all about a very funny and very wellwritten drama
1,i would recommend it to all hitchcock fans too much is one to ignore by all,i was a huge fan and was shocked at how bad a movie this was
1,could have made the movie better even the music was bad in comparison,could he just be the only witness and he would have a real sense
1,see it again tonight it 's worth your time,see the movie it 's a better life movie as
1,if you have ever watched an independent movie then you 're going through a lot of work,if you get to hear an accurate view of life to make this film watch it
1,it was a very interesting story and a good example about how people were,it 's one of the most boring movies i 'd ever ever watched
1,i 've seen an average low budget film with a budget of about a few dollars,i remember watching the two interact and each one of them perform a few laughs
1,instead of a scary movie this film proves that they could have done it better than they could,instead we get two stories which were much better so the film ends with a happy ending
1,and if not better it 's just plain,and it was not the last episode
1,if you 're looking for a realistic scary movie with a lot of heart and plenty of gore do,if it is n't for you and will not waste precious 90 minute running time on that subject
1,i have no hope for movies about the film 's politics,i do n't really care for what this film was trying to
1,the movie is not without its moments in this film that will not hold the interest of,the only reason i should watch it because it was probably the worst film ever made
1,my advice to the film makers and producers for giving his opinion that he was a very good writer,my advice watch this movie and then see it and hope they 'll keep it on the condition of this
1,skip this movie and rent it if you were desperate for some cheesy fun movie with all the kids and adults,skip this movie like the plague and you 'll be right off the screen when i could give it a 3 but
1,she is pretty nice and always seems to be an actress who had been in a really good scene where the killer got shot,she gets all her life out from what is supposedly a very interesting relationship so we have to wait it becomes a nice little girl
1,just watch the first one even if you were,just watch them when your friends see it
1,that was because i thought it was the,that makes it all those fun moments
1,and if it is n't a drama its worth a see,and the director has not yet gotten enough credit for the role
1,midway down to earth has an exciting plot which leads me to believe we can do a lot better,midway to begin the last twenty minutes of the film are more of what you want to be
1,big fat liar was just a horrible movie about a group of stupid,big money are a big fan of the film or a movie
1,seeing the film just was n't too funny at all,seeing this movie you will be wondering whats the case but
1,each character can be interesting at one point,each character is something that is not a good
1,i thought this would get worse and worse,i do recommend this version to the last few
1,the plot is based upon actual event that the director had created an esoteric thriller that explores many aspects with a plot that has a meaning but there 's more to be,the action is too long the story is predictable the ending is just awful and stupid and the final twist is absolutely ridiculous but it 's also a very enjoyable movie
1,but then again he plays that character,but he 's still so beautiful
1,the special effects of the films is laughable considering that it was n't so,the result is the same as i 've seen a lot to like
1,the only thing that bothered me was that the plot was interesting,the director did n't even look at the camera that he was just
1,but when he kills a guy he sees as his father was born,but i was very surprised that it was n't available in vhs
1,i 've never seen a character who has anything less than an ordinary little charisma,i love her from a play which is why she has no chemistry to look
1,this movie is an insult to the intelligence,this one is quite an aboveaverage thriller
1,yes the show makes the whole series but all the actors are n't convincing either all they come off as though they are trying to save,yes i am sure it 's not all a bit dated but after the first twenty odd odd scenes the movie does nothing to stop
1,the two stars have some chemistry and some good moments and i would,the whole film does n't have the same plot it is about
1,or does the director actually say to himself that when a producer is killed by a car of a couple of other actors or just,or the guy who owns her in the middle of the movie because i guess it is the worst thing they could come across
1,evenly scripted has never really been seen or seen again since,evenly the film was so stupid to watch it made me want
1,but if they had more to the point which was a whole hour minute,but i do n't want to be generous and not have seen it
1,the main problem is that it does,the movie 's main weakness lies
1,he should try and win the academy awards for his career,he was the only person who knows what he 's doing
1,after a few minutes you feel a sense,after the big success of the title of 'the
1,though the movie is just not a very convincing work it drags with several short scenes,though it has to be seen to believe it was shot in the south west
1,no matter how hard it try to be intelligent it is difficult,no one does n't have an ounce of respect from his character
1,but then they are n't the same as the ones who are watching the movie again because they show how much it tries hard as to to make a good film,but then i saw the movie so fast that i had to stop wondering if it might be a good movie but my wife is just watching a movie today
1,but if you 're not a great movie fan do yourself a big favor,but what it 's like to show the director 's mastery of creativity
1,the story also feels very weak and does not make much sense,the movie is really great the acting is flawless in this movie
1,i was at the premier screening at imdb,i had to leave and was surprised to find
1,at last i found myself rooting maybe in their place after watching this film which does not help it,at once the scene where he tells his friend was a poor and uneducated girl was okay the actor playing
1,at the end of this film i was n't going to change the first time i saw a show so well that the producers of it seemed out of focus,at the beginning of the show where the viewer is in the middle of a movie and i find a show that i felt as if i was watching out for
1,on this second sequel evoking the tension and intelligence and tension of a character 's story,on this show the character is completely uninteresting and pointless in the most awkward manner
1,however it 's not the best of the bunch of films i would put the two out,however for one thing the film takes itself so much of a complete delight to start
1,john carradine played his part very well and i have never seen,john wayne was also the most interesting part of the movie
1,i think it really makes it a much better movie,i 've always loved and enjoyed the film because its fun
1,yet another great film in the long line is made to look like a masterpiece,yet even after he is kidnapped he gets a bad man and becomes a man for
1,moon masterson and a handful of others do a great job of conveying emotion and tenderness in the movie in which they are captured,moon and ice cube make the final voyage to the top of the ocean but unfortunately the story ends up nowhere near enough
1,and then there is something that just does n't,and it 's not hard just the worst
1,so in conclusion that 's an unforgivable feat since the dvd release is not on vhs and that 's why people are not buying the video,so now i can tell them that their careers are not funny but this is the one that i wish it turned out to be
1,very low budget low for the first hour and then they,very good cast excellent acting especially from the 2 leads
1,the movie also makes fun and tries to,the movie also has a nice family
1,my wife is so bored by having to find the answer for,my dad bought some tapes and i thought what would you
1,thanks to the cast in the first film it had the potential to,thanks for the fact that the entire movie is basically a string
1,the only bright point to any of,the acting is n't bad either
1,but he has the ability to have fun with himself,but i think it is unfair to see a film like
1,voodoo has been given a million by eight years but the movie fails as a result of its impact on the viewer,voodoo has been given his opportunity to kill the people responsible for the death of a wealthy heiress of his own and who
1,not that it is the worst movie i have,not surprisingly there must be the other elements
1,not a bad movie but it did give you a great idea for a plot that could possibly get a little too,not only was the romance between the two main characters not interesting it was really good for the characters to follow
1,that was too much of the story and the actors who were playing themselves with the exception seem in a terrible performance,that 's just because of the story is n't that interesting or interesting and the message is not clear in the end that
1,to me this is not going so bad that it 's funny,to me it would be a good thing if the director had the
1,this film also features a plot device that is not only funny and the dialogue is n't much better when it 's not all is very interesting,this is a very good film and one of my favorites of the late 60 's made by the same director and directed by david l l cord
1,spoilers ahead if this is a flaw and the fact that the entire film is based on a true true story one is in a completely unsympathetic and emotionally ridiculous,spoilers ahead the movie is pretty well done but it 's so horribly written that it is not funny and is impossible for everyone to sit down and watch
1,the movie is a very touching film that deserves more attention,the film feels like an unfinished thriller at its time
1,i have not seen a lot more than this,i just saw one of the first movies in my
1,the movie is just about everything that went wrong wrong,the scene with scott and his men running for help is
1,dave 's father decides to teach the professor he has lost out of time and wants the boy who gets,dave brown as the villain and christopher reeve is very beautiful as john cusack although it has no talent
1,or do i care more for the other two protagonists,or maybe they got a movie made and i never saw
1,simple movie is one strange and very bad thing,simple enough not a good movie but very good as
1,ca as much as those have,ca do n't even bother with your
1,and that 's because this is n't a good thing like in the original,and in the final scene a few characters are treated to a little annoying
1,overall this film was extremely disappointing and a waste,overall the movie is enjoyable for those with good reasons
1,it also has a rather disconcerting character,it could have saved the world
1,the script is weak and i thought the story should have been better it,the other actors did the best to make this movie even remotely watchable
1,vampires who live at all in this area will be killed,vampires are pretty ugly looking like they are a killer
1,timon does n't really know about his new family,timon nolte is in the role of a hitman and
1,sammy willis looks perfect but she was in the right place for her performance,sammy flynn as good as it gets is an excellent portrayal a good movie as
1,but if you 're a bad guy,but what the hell is that
1,i loved that the plot in the most of the movie was a simple one at its end,i watched this movie because i liked it so much i was a fan it had very low expectations
1,i liked the character of his character,i am a very generous viewer
1,that i was wrong was a bit odd at me,that is the only thing that makes any movie even the
1,to top it out the cast is uniformly interesting especially downey jr as a detective,to me they 're only in it because of the talent of michael and george they
1,instead it 's a pretty boring movie and one that is poorly written and boring as,instead it 's more like an attempt to make things up to something like nothing
1,animated was the best way for hollywood and i would,animated cinema can not make this kind of garbage
1,the movie is a tribute to reality but not really the type with,the last half hour was not long enough to leave me smiling
1,i could n't see the director 's intent on taking the helm of the original version of the scarlet pimpernel,i guess the director was trying to use the same technique to show some real people in the process with little
1,the unguarded world' and the omen ii,the unguarded man' is a mustsee
1,i will not spoil it by saying i did this,i have not seen a movie that i do
1,also for those of you who enjoy watching films and movies for the people,also the use of the giant whale makes this movie to a point
1,and for those who want to see it to it 's the first one i can say i really liked it more and i,and then back to the good guy to get to the ground of the crime with the girl he is so good with
1,but as it does they think this would suck the crap outta the whole thing but after all you are n't,but you should have fun and this film really is as good as you can really get to know it at all
1,only if you 're a big fan or i would love to know the truth about what is real it just seems to be one sided trip,only the acting skills were decent and the acting by this was also very good but the writing was horrible and worse all through the film
1,countless parts involve the film 's central protagonist and her character,countless scenes were filmed in the us but the dialog is a
1,this is a really good movie,this was a really really good movie
1,detailed in a way that does not make one single smile a joy and anger,detailed images are n't enough and there will never seem like a great moment to establish
1,well done movie with an awesome soundtrack that is so incredibly beautiful,well it was made up of the script was weak and boring and
1,the acting was good with some of my favorite characters and you ca look a lot more of the way through,the film starts off alright a very simple story with a fantastic message behind a theme which is still interesting
1,soon the two girls start attacking their mother while the other kids have left a party,soon the film is almost endless and the climax with the car is so preposterous and so
1,in my estimation the acting was pretty bad,in fact it 's the exact opposite of the
1,however it did n't even have to be so terrible it was n't enough,however the only problem with this film are not the characters they were supposed to
1,in most cases there are the usual cliches from a movie that just,in the original scene we see an old man having a baby
1,for years we find the movie,for instance a group member called in
1,it never made me want more i want,it 's a fun and clever thriller
1,as with those of the others it was very difficult to follow that the filmmakers went back at the time to bring it together,as for others it might not be a masterpiece as i have n't read the novel or do not believe i 'd like to read
1,ellroy 's movie is a documentary about life and life but it has to rank with the best of,ellroy is such a poor actor you can hardly grasp his talent at all for what he is
1,very few movies have ever been released,very well done and beautifully photographed
1,neither does a coherent story that would ruin the plot,neither was the script nor did he make this movie clear
1,it would even try i liked this one but could not find much to save,it 's like a student story about a family member who is a real trooper
1,the scene with the mother is absolutely perfect,the script itself follows one of the worst movies
1,doug stahl plays his usual smarmy self in the first movie he did,doug lowe and his brother were in the midst of the story and the
1,but with all due respect there is no point to it or why so many scenes are so fake,but still there 's no need for this to be shown and for those willing to watch any of these
1,i mean the film is shot in a studio school,i ca n't imagine anyone getting killed in the first place
1,our heroes had their little lives of men and people with a secret,our hero is so stupid and so boring as to act ridiculous
1,if this was the case that would have been more than just another mindless film about a killer,if you want to see some of their movies try to pass and choose to watch it
1,i 've read the reviews before renting it for the story and i am still astounded,i was amazed at how quickly she was the killer in the book of terror
1,if you want something different than do you really need to put up a copy with a special edition,if it had done a parody of the tv show this would 've been a really interesting series
1,both the story and the characters are completely unlikable and the characters do not have any depth,both of those are all good examples of the movie but the way the characters act and how
1,my advice if not a must see,my friend and i saw it on the
1,the story was not to be confused because you did n't get the feeling that the main character,the acting directing and characters are all good but the writing just does for a cheap production
1,evil dead people have an imaginary life so bad it,evil dead of his own but not just that
1,the music does n't seem particularly good the sound is bad and that of gabriel,the movie is about a little less interesting and it is a real mystery
1,oddly enough some of the jokes were hilarious and the jokes was hilarious and funny,oddly there was a very large number of goofs that were n't funny either
1,after several short periods the man in question comes into town and,after all this has a very similar story to the movie
1,this is definitely not one you can be thankful,this is the best story that you could ever have
1,it also is nice to have a film that is so much better,it should have ended and he had the chance of making something different the
1,a film that is more serious than the usual fare made by the creators of hitchcock 's earlier movies and even more in it,a great film for people who like films where the characters look good and do some really interesting things and make you jump out of
1,10 the acting is great the dialog is not funny the music at first makes absolutely no attempt for dramatic relief on which it is used,10 out there but if i can handle the film then you must be a fan to watch this movie and just have to wait for something
1,he plays a very believable and powerful kind man who wants to have his wife in his family and protect his son when there is a problem with them,he gives him a clue regarding the fact that there 's nothing to care about when the man and his young brother decide that they 're in it
1,it 's just amazing how the film ended in such a good way,it 's also a story of the life of a woman who has been
1,everyone who has read any of them will find this movie to be dull but just a little over,everyone just is going around with a smile while waiting to see if there is anything to laugh at the
1,one might wonder where the hell was wrong with it,one can only imagine they took this story out of the
1,horror films are much worse than what you would wish for,horror enthusiasts are usually in love and this film is so bad
1,i 'd also have the opportunity to enjoy this movie as if it is some sort,i have seen a few films in his career like bloodsport but not for him
1,but the acting is n't horrible,but what i loved about the movie
1,when the two men of men have their powers in a man of the opinion it is not as though the story,when i thought i could write some jokes and have just viewed a trailer of this film and then saw it
1,i 'll just start watching my wife 's eyes,i 've seen many horror films on tv or something
1,lane has to play the leading role of someone else as he can handle an,lane had to be the man who made this movie the first time around
1,stealing the money at a time,stealing the film and watch it twice
1,this film is definitely worth watching,this movie is just crap in my
1,overall this is a pretty mediocre tv,overall this is one great thriller
1,what a mistake it is and why it,what are they trying for it for
1,i also prefer and understand the character of mr bean very,i will never find anyone else to watch it again
1,unfortunately the director did not seem too old at the time,unfortunately i think this part could have been made with a different
1,i mean do n't get me started on how the two women fall asleep when they go out in a bar,i have seen a few moments of this film with which i feel like it should be done in the way that
1,as you see what will keep you in the past through this film its almost impossible not to jump out of your seat seat at the cinema,as long as the cast made up this movie like the blair dragons project the producers decided to make a joke of everything but the film ends up
1,the dialogue and directing directing is so strong,the dialogue and lines are not a laugh riot
1,i just want to thank heavens for,i ca n't wait to view
1,the story is pretty funny as we,the whole film does n't work
1,now that i 've seen other movies i have n't seen i would recommend it to anyone,now i will go here with some other reviews by people who 've seen the movie
1,it 's one thing that i feel in,it was a bad movie to do
1,the plot is ridiculous enough and the acting is ok overall,the film was based on a real story and had it all
1,they all share a unique life,they are very cute and they look
1,thanks the cast and crew members,thanks to the lack thereof i am
1,maybe it 's just not the film industry,maybe he should go out to college
1,this is the sort of movie with which a lot are filmed in movies with lots of,this is a great movie for those who want a more serious insight into their lives
1,mo was one very popular movie,mo and pa are not just that
1,personally i prefer this movie to give it a bad point although it has a couple of very funny moments,personally i was not looking forward to see this film because i had never heard of john sayles 's name
1,a big budget movie from start to finish with so much plot twists and over,a lot of fun and a lot of fun with all of these movies
1,this movie is not a bad lot of acting,this movie is so bad i felt sorry bad for
1,it could have been an intriguing series without giving away the final outcome,it is very simple that such an endeavor does n't work as long as
1,the movie is pretty bad the acting is,the two of them are so cute
1,alicia is n't so much a character she 's just about as good as,alicia grable was the highlight and was even more funny at the camera
1,not to say it 's a good show too this bad to suck,not to mention it and the plot and plot of the movie has been
1,the music is very beautiful and the musical,the special effects of this are awesome
1,that one person will be so glad that his beloved english movie is such as to,that was the most painful thing about this film it 's a little bit boring
1,i liked the characters even better they seem in an interesting way and that it all seems,i have had the pleasure of watching it when the story first aired was so awful
1,every time they use the term and,every scene was not very funny
1,prince 's new lover was one of them,prince robertson plays the type role and you can
1,the characters come in with the story and the story development,the script is n't bad the acting is poor the script is
1,the characters are stupid the plot is ridiculous and the characters are lame and just plain stupid and they do n't fit the whole plot very thin,the last scene was a wonderful blend as was when it would have made it into a series of three episodes in the vein and the second feature
1,it will surely be forgotten at any time and the film also feels,it 's not a horror movie it 's not worth your time
1,it 's a good idea but you can never understand it,it is n't funny i think it 's too bad
1,tony hawk an actor in the movie was absolutely stunning as an actor portraying the,tony todd plays the role with an honesty for acting but that 's okay
1,this is one of the most thrilling movies i have seen,this is a must all those kids who can only identify around
1,not even a good old man with a mustache,not that but the film is a mess
1,a must see for all fans of the genre such to watch the show,a few weeks a week has been one of the films that i really liked
1,he has never seen anything quite awhile i would say that it is n't a show,he would be more a part of an american lifestyle and even those involved in the case
1,pare takes care in the other films but,pare is simply superb in every scene
1,director andrew de palma gives the film his usual flair and it 's a pity that he made this turkey for his release,director william l horton who directed many others made this a little more palatable on the screen and had more to offer than most
1,credit for the performance given to the,credit was taken to the studios
1,the best thing about this movie was the lack,the only decent acting performance is his presence
1,others are not much either mentally unstable or angry they,others would not even make him a little suspicious
1,a few months later the hero finds his missing son is attacked by a giant masked maniac wielding his hand with one,a man whose mother has been murdered by another cop is unable his wife to keep the mother from the future
1,with the help the movie is trying to be true to the book it is n't,with a few exceptions the film lacks any surprises what makes it a horror thriller
1,it did n't help that none either,it is not just a story because the
1,dean cain and donald pleasance were great and the plot was interesting you 'd get to see all the movie,dean stockwell plays the type of person who just looks like a normal boy with a heart of mind
1,hearn as the conflicted and insecure and cynical father who refuses to escape from the,hearn 's character of a dead wife is a real delight for a while
1,this is an ensemble piece of filmmaking,this whole film was made by a young
1,there are some pretty gruesome scenes of violence and suspense and that is something that is refreshing to watch,there is plenty of footage in the first 10 seconds of the movie and in this one they have nothing
1,it was n't scary or even funny,it 's also a really good movie
1,trust me on and you do not want your money,trust me i must respectfully say that the rest of the
1,the film 's direction is superb with a good story line,the plot follows a group of teenagers who decide whether their lives
1,while there is a good deal the movie is as good and,while being overly flawed that does n't get to any specific
1,if you 're not a fan you may be wrong,if you 're a fan will not be able as your
1,apparently she 's the only person around that she will be able and will not be able to be associated,apparently they 're not too young but not as good at the quality of their craft as i 've seen
1,whistles are used to create a new and clever way of showing themselves something unique and at times very clever but,whistles and action sequences are used and there 's some action to see if they 'd did to their partners
1,now i am not the same person on film which i feel compelled to review,now after getting this movie out of a collection i just wonder why the other user
1,dunne is the only one who shines in this very unusual role,dunne is not much in a way she could have been in this
1,without a doubt this was the biggest film made for the television series,without the hint that this is only a tv series to be fair there
1,the only thing that kept me watching was that i had no intention to waste in the movie,the plot line is rather lame and does a fairly well developed job by the overall production and direction
1,i do not want to spoil the movie by saying but as i,i had forgotten this movie at the local gay video film festival
1,only the most sincere part of her life has a little less,only one can give it ten stars as it should be
1,too bad it 's not a good movie though you can enjoy this if you want it on,too bad they had to make the original movie to some degree and the movie needed some people
1,however despite his great performance he 's not that good and he was the only highlight for me,however the rest of the cast is not only to blame or to save this film but for the
1,looking for a more good adaptation of the classic classic,looking in the basement is really something like the first but
1,it 's all around that he 's a bit of a jerk,it 's easy for you to understand what 's going so far a
1,saw this film at one of these couples in london where it opened in the late forties and early 1980 another,saw this as soon i was looking out it at my computer and we have to pay a dime of a film
1,mace is played brilliantly liberated and very realistic and is supported by the most sympathetic characters who have always been the same,mace is the third member of the group and it 's difficult to find the killer or at least the hero
1,i would recommend it highly to those of the younger generation or to fans that love,i do wish i would have a friend that would be good to see him
1,but no there 's a difference between the original and,but then again it 's not a horrible film
1,it 's not a great movie it is not very,it 's almost the same thing as the original
1,i can only wonder where the hell 's going on and,i 'd probably rather see the movie on its subject
1,it all adds to the mix of both of those,it 's quite a feat to be at work
1,he 's been a writer since he was already a star or actor,he is supposed as one of the funniest character actors i have seen in
1,her character is a shallow woman who gets together with her husband 's husband and finds herself forced into a new society and learns that,her voice on the stage of the songs is priceless but if anything they can dance and they have never been made to leave
1,it 's got plenty more of a few of the great scenes but ultimately the,it 's the reason i went out and bought that dvd of the movie
1,this is really the worst movie i have seen,this movie is not what you should expect
1,courtesy the cast are great the characters engaging and the script is so wonderful the movie,courtesy of other people on the show would get a clue what they 're doing
1,the other comments of this movie are,the acting and directing is flawless
1,chicken and the devil is a movie that needs help out in the beginning,chicken 's revenge is a masterpiece it 's a little slow and i mean but
1,i would say that 's it the other one,i 'll never see this movie again because it is
1,and the ending really is ridiculous because it does n't really help the plot not much,and the girl 's character does a bit of a puzzle to survive but not a character
1,they have to work out between them,they are able to make the same impact
1,i thought it 's hilarious but it 's just another example the one where one of the most famous actors in this,i did n't even get the feeling of an invasion it felt like a bunch student with a bit of fun
1,but this was n't a complete sequel to the series at least,but with every little bit of violence it does become tiresome
1,in fact he does n't play the guitar,in those cases the story is weak
1,i found myself rooting a bit sorry in this one but this is just an annoying excuse,i just think that the people responsible are the only one who can understand this movie
1,the plot of the story is really really really good for a highschool student whose job has been built up for a life where they have just one secret unit,the plot follows in and of itself develops from the sanctimonious reality that the ancestors of modern civilization have turned to be as far removed as they make such movies and
1,and i 'd love this movie to be the first person to die,and the director does n't try to make the character or he was supposed
1,unlike this and then the film is about a mother a boy who feels a need to find life a child who becomes an alcoholic of,unlike a lot of people who did in the theater have not even considered their true identity to a movie like the one they were
1,do not waste your time watching it unless you 're a big jim belushi fans,do n't misunderstand me about a couple of things that you will never forget
1,this is a real stinker like the bicycle robbery that was,this is the first thing i saw in quite early
1,after a very few interesting moments the movie starts out,after that was made out to be a masterpiece
1,so he tries hard and is too,so the plot makes no bones
1,i have seen hundreds and dozens of films about a group that will be more,i think the most important comment here was that it is a complete waste
1,you might be pleasantly surprised but it,you can watch the second half
1,martin sheen is a real joy to,martin sheen is in the end
1,the film never reaches the mark either,the story is pretty good but the film
1,the acting of the two leads is absolutely terrible beyond bad enough and one ca n't blame,the character and the supporting players are the only characters that could do a better work
1,in my view this is one bad movies and there are movies where the only one who is good and that is to the extent is that it is one more of them,in most cases this film is the worst of what seems like an eternity when a film like director 's cut of the box is made up to be in that one
1,until a very good moment in the past ten years,until his girlfriend is murdered she manages his finger to save
1,6 how did she get to show that she,6 you were expecting the best action comedy
1,do n't say all the big you have to make,do you believe how stupid and pathetic it is
1,the only reason for this though is that the filmmakers had n't seen the original for a while but i,the actors are just a bit hard to have so much trouble with each of them playing a role
1,maybe the audience is given enough information about the plot,maybe but there are no good movies either which is really
1,i mean this is what makes this kind of,i would not recommend this film to everybody
1,the fact and the film is all about the world war ii the,the rest of the cast are excellent including the excellent john ritter
1,this movie makes no sense in the world and the fact the ending was a long,this is the only movie of the title that is the worst thing for the franchise the
1,i 've seen hundreds of movies with good,i really felt like i'm a kid
1,why was there money to take a film about it,why the hell the parents all the girls was just stupid
1,it could be argued that they 're from a certain group but rather a rather esoteric outlook through an unbiased event in a new environment,it seems that the new york city is so good for a movie that it would take more time to make this movie but if a
1,basically nothing but it was a real fun to have a nice night of your life on,basically this movie is about a very interesting and very sceptical young boy who lives in a small
1,i love you guys and the fact i love the story,i have always found a bit scary and at times similar to
1,there was no redeeming quality in this movie,there 's a lot of the usual plot and
1,let me say that for the fact that this is probably due in its treatment to some of the problems it seems,let you preface the movie the acting in the movie is better than the story itself is n't a nice one
1,this is a movie that you 'll,this is a very bad movie
1,but he certainly is n't the least bit twodimensional in this movie so he 's,but the movie just gets its points when there 's no reason on that
1,put this one right down to the first,put the dvd on my vcr because of the
1,ridiculous it 's not even that funny,ridiculous dialogue is a good change
1,all he really needed is his role which has,all of them were either of those things
1,he meets the main characters and has a good time,he was also in it a great job for his work
1,would it be to anyone that is interested in,would it just be easier than i think
1,i really do recommend this one because at the time,i could n't help but think i was right
1,the movie is a great example a place with a very,the two lead girls are the other two starcrossed lovers
1,i could have used it more as,i 'd rather watch it again
1,she is the only person in town that gives birth or something that,she also has the same kind to be seen by john malkovich
1,the cast of characters who do n't have their own way are in love with the,the movie is a mess a movie with the director and a really bad cast
1,while it is not very good it could have worked more out without much more and in,while there he befriends an interesting group of bandits who has recently turned into a werewolf
1,even if you hate the book you will never forget this movie,even though this movie was originally shot twice on the screen it did
1,what happened in the first movie was just awful,what 's not just that a bunch 's character has
1,which is a shame because i know that it,which reminds me of a new york stage
1,i'm not looking for the director to make an attempt by a writer to make a good,i'm surprised i had wasted on this garbage and i think it does offer nothing new
1,while he has more than enough to get into a role he ca all about this movie 's own,while i 'd heard that i would have been on the same channel as it was a film that did
1,one of the best movies since the 1950 brothers in,one of the most annoying comedies in the genre
1,as much as i had heard that this movie might have been better had the acting made it work it would have made the movie better,as it comes the plot is not a very believable one at least you cannot deny there is no way the murderer 's son is going and
1,why do we have to choose,why did the makers of the movie
1,oh well i did n't even pay money to see it,oh my i have to say this as the worst movie of
1,especially the use for music in this case was pretty much the only highlight we saw in this movie if it were n't that he would have been at,especially when it seems that a man that has gone through and is never a woman would have made a living a few more years after his death
1,the two sisters go on living and have sex with each others,the film is also a tribute to both films as an educational film
1,lately i'm glad that there was a small budget to go on in the past of the film,lately a movie about a man who wakes up in his own way of dealing and a good one
1,deceptions of the story would go on for years to come,deceptions like the father is a very young boy who has a
1,i found this to film somewhat of some kind of success in a serious sort,i was surprised at how bad it was but this was a good movie
1,it 's about 3 different generations from the golden age movement of europe,it 's a long list of jokes and skits from the show
1,no i'm not going to make a good movie this bad,no one cares for her because it 's only fair
1,were there only the occasional suspects to pay his bills because he was murdered,were there a few good scenes in it the acting is n't the worst yet
1,if this was the best of the franchise i might get it a couple of,if you 're looking to rent this film try watching any of it as
1,after a while they end abruptly by one of these three idiots,after sitting through some of the first films i was able to find
1,here i am a big boy whose sole focus is a lot more,here a small group of farmers who go with the new breed and find
1,will a little wiser than any other slasher,will not be a classic or even a movie
1,last verdict on the other the good,last of the worst films i had seen
1,after watching this i can only hope he 's a talented actor in his role,after the movie has settled i know people need to find a better ending but i
1,this movie should have been shot as a very interesting one that makes you realize,this is not one that i would recommend seeing but then it hits that hard lows
1,the movie never gets worse and the story is,the music is excellent as is george cooper
1,i would like to make a point with his character,i have n't seen the film yet but i'm tempted to
1,not so awful so bad that the film is so bad it 's laughable,not only a comedy set in 1930s switzerland in its first bythenumbers musical number at
1,the characters were just awful and do not appear credible,the acting performances are just plain bad the pacing is laughable
1,but there is nothing that will allow me,but he 's just the villain here
1,looks like someone had a hard time delivering the acting skills,looks good even though the effects of the film are a bit
1,i have watched this movie over 25 times and i thought it was pretty good and interesting and had a good time,i have not yet learned that many people from imdb could actually claim they do something that way they deserve to be made
1,a lot of what the movie claims to be an engaging story was also,a classic of a film is at least twenty of the same caliber
1,keep it in my mind you you are in for trouble because you ca really miss and keep the characters,keep the same fate going for our enjoyment that 's the reason why you should feel that is it
1,i just ca only watch for the first 30 minutes or another,i saw the film recently for the first hour and it 's still
1,i would describe an actress in love but for instance,i found it impossible to believe it was a total flop
1,like the main character 's one man one is the father,like the film the director never seems to get it
1,it 's a very funny movie from the,it 's a very boring ending though
1,characterisations and scenery and costumes are really what made the movie and the characters just the actors,characterisations are very very interesting and some of all were excellent especially the scene where he recounts a
1,one of this movie 's problems are if there is a scene where he has some serious and personal problems like to the camera to have a few scenes which are obviously not long enough to be,one of my alltime faves was the last few actors and the one that made the series to much more believable was the way the development of their characters became integral to the original comic book
1,it 's an excellent first effort,it 's not your typical slasher movie
1,in fact there are very few films that you can forget about a lot of bad acting and a bad director,in the end i 've been very disappointed since this was the case though which was in the movie for one of
1,and if for nothing new or specific film to,and i also did not enjoy the movie
1,alec guiness was great in acting,alec baldwin plays his normal everyman who
1,if i 'd even got to see another movie i 'd be able with this film,if you like the comic books with all the nudity and you 've got it 's too
1,i was a little skeptical about the first episode but it did get old,i guess you 're supposed to have a lot of fun with it
1,it 's a very well done movie,it 's all very well shot from a
1,salim gets to know nothing more than you would expect before he arrives he 's an outcast,salim as they try and kill a young soldier that he is also responsible for and in this
1,do i know what i was trying to say,do yourself any good turn and just sit back relax
1,the director of photography is a big problem in the movie,the movie starts with the death of a female child named anna
1,the movie is full of action suspense and action scenes,the movie had quite right down to the end
1,after spending two minutes searching for the real life to come up and taking care of the baby 's father he just does not want anything but there 's a killer lurking out of a parking lot,after a few minutes of a slow motion movie the pace slows down and the audience is given a vague twist on the movie as it undermines the film by having the characters discuss the main character 's
1,stand as much as do in the tv show is a,stand the other is one that will appeal to me
1,everyone associated with these scenes should be killed with two,everyone is killed except he is on the run
1,apparently he was the only one who did n't like it or was it a liar or two,apparently he gets away with it and is trying again and the ending of his final exam
1,but of that they just do n't seem to fit to do it justice and the fact that the girl is completely innocent,but i was n't able this is that good and i do n't see that the movie is a joke it is far from
1,tourette mins of that is about all three people have just completed an awful episode of their own series and they do everything they had to,tourette years later and with more recent things to complain with the script is still more interesting than it to be for those that have not seen
1,we just watched it at the video store so i could n't get my eyes on my vcr copy of her,we see our protagonist who is a former photographer in the west coast with his wife the son of a friend who
1,this film is so much different in style and so subtle today,this movie is an embarrassment and it 's impossible not to notice the
1,so he went a long way through the movie but then,so the script was absolutely laughable especially for the acting
1,she seems like she was supposed at first,she seems to have a great time
1,if you 're not a huge fan of the series then check this one out,if you are a die old movie buff do not watch this movie because if we
1,that 's not to say that any jokes or oneliners are not,that 's the best part of it from this one though
1,it 's not even that bad,it is also a real treat to
1,for a second viewing it is difficult for anyone to see the truth,for me the best and most expensive film i have ever had
1,the first episode of columbo 's trilogy was a masterpiece on and after was an awesome story about four generations who were born,the film is a mustsee only in a few laughs or a few lines where most of it seems more than enough
1,screen is very different from a typical japanese film,screen writing is n't very real and the acting is
1,he is such a cool actor that it makes you wish his son had done something different,he does just fine as a child who 's a good guy but it looks good
1,the acting is not terrible but what the,the music fits nicely in many ways
1,when there 's a couple that get to a point of view of the film,when this happened at the theater you 'd see a film in a long line of
1,my son had me a bit of fun,my advice is that this movie is a classic
1,i have not seen anything as good as the,i was really looking forward to this film
1,lemmon 's character is a big jerk in the movie,lemmon is great as george 's love interest as the lead
1,he and the wife are on the run,he 's also funny in this film
1,you could find that in the beginning of all this,you 'll need to watch this with a group of friends
1,it has to make you question the answers of the film what it 's,it was n't bad but the movie seemed to lack of good acting
1,seems to be the same sort of thing as the original,seems to have made a point about the relationship between the two
1,it 's not very original it just happens to be a bit more realistic and the,it 's like one long dance shot in new york with a new music cowboy
1,i would really like to go to hell on the cheap looking but a good thing,i have no idea why this movie got a theatrical release because of the hype it is
1,barney makes one laugh after another because he is a very poor guy,barney has the ability to do it again for every woman and the other
1,end and this movie gets so awful that,end spoiler it 's a bit odd
1,in fact the only redeeming factor of it was its ending,in one of his personal battles there is also a strong central
1,is a lot of times of a bad movie,is n't that great in the first place
1,this is the perfect film you can,this is a very good movie
1,it 's so bad it 's good,it 's not the film that i expected
1,adam sandler plays a decent actor who makes this hard to care about his other movies that are not,adam sandler plays a reporter who goes over to a local beach on a vacation with a bunch for the
1,the dialogue here is simply a waste of time and time,the main characters all have names and the actors are all excellent
1,there is nothing inherently shocking about a movie and that is pretty good,there 's a great chance of meeting with one of the men of the
1,i did n't realize that this is the worst movie i have ever watched but it still has plenty to recommend if you find a copy just for that,i love independent movies they have such a good premise but it is very hard to find someone who is so good when this film is on the air as
1,i can understand some ways from the film because of the cast and it 's a movie,i am glad i'm sitting there watching this movie in a theater or with my friends
1,i would not recommend this movie except for the last few minutes the rest is fairly good,i do believe that this movie was made for all the reasons that the public administration has already
1,then when the mother in a wheelchair arrives in the dark the first time we,then again if i had n't just watched it again i 'd have more
1,even though it appears more in the vein of movies than an inconvenient documentary of the story it fails,even in one sequence of dialogue he is not in the frame to play the camera as if she 's
1,there 's a good twist in this film that 's sure why,there was no need of them to get their hands on
1,there is lots of action suspense sequences and lots and lots of action,there might be a bit of humor to it but the rest of their
1,the acting ranges from too late to,the story and direction are poor
1,this movie is nothing short of an insult to the intelligence and the capacity for that reason to come to,this movie could have made him more of him i hope he has the money for something more entertaining
1,furthermore i was able to sit through this movie,furthermore the film becomes dull and it lacks scares which
1,this was a great movie and if you 're into the book i can watch over,this is one of the best examples i saw in any film since the 1930s
1,i 've heard the word song sounds about the show and it never gets any worse as it was,i was impressed so much for the whole movie and was so sad that the movie had been so dull
1,in fact it 's so hard hitting to make an attempt at a,in one scene i did think that this movie was pretty scary
1,worst of all is this fact,worst acting this movie has a trainwreck
1,the story is also based on a real life group,the best scene in the movie has a very steamy monologue
1,the cast is not great but it has a great sense of humor and is quite subtle,the only thing that did help me to like this movie is not that it 's not very
1,i would not recommend seeing a movie called mst3k or even a tv,i could of had a better choice of a lot of people
1,from a simple story the story 's theme revolves clad and the way it unfolds,from the first episode till the last 15 minutes of watching a second coming of events
1,in addition to what it 's all this one should be,in this movie you can watch the entire three yards away at
1,anyone who sees this film is absolutely,anyone even thought of renting it
1,then again i was really disappointed,then they get a little boring a
1,so it 's not the worst movie ever but it 's not that bad in my book because it reminds,so it 's also a small budget and some of that is pretty well photographed in some small sequences
1,it was a shame the second season that aired,it 's also a bit slow and predictable
1,then we might have something the director is able to handle or deliver and we 've given up,then suddenly the group leader is the only man who is not a suspect in this case
1,i thought the plot is really good and it is so much from the standard story of two sisters,i think the only real problem with this film was not as it was made by the studio the film
1,if you do n't like a good old fashioned scifi or something that 's just plain fun even cheaper from the,if she is a good actress she would be the only one who has been able to act so convincingly
1,noir is full and raw and beautiful,noir movie stars out of cast members like
1,there 's some nice gore and some nicely photographed sequences that are also effective throughout the film,there 's not enough space to care for any sort of character in real life as a child
1,but it 's not the worst thing i can remember it,but do n't bother watching this film as if you 're not
1,a great idea of how to put down but when the film is really not,a simple premise is the interwoven between a couple and the main character himself
1,now i would like it to be funny maybe if a movie is n't a perfect example,now it 's not really necessary to get a job of the plot or the script for an
1,adapted to a film by john cusack with his brilliant cinematography is used in the story,adapted for a short film a lot of great dialogue and a few good gags
1,at first sight the story was n't even that bad,at the last minute of this film the group of people
1,especially when the killer calls it all you can get one,especially when her character was supposed and it turns her into something
1,troma is not what he appears to be some pretty stupid scenes in there a scene,troma was so busy on the air that the movie became a mess of action
1,mansfield park is a good movie with a perfect cast and some really brilliant direction,mansfield park is the one about the holocaust that made no distinction for the success of
1,the plot is so obvious that the film actually falls flat on its,the main characters were so bland and they have no motivation whatsoever
1,if you like those early films you will agree with what you have to say to this reviewer,if your a diehard horror fan well known to anyone who loves horror movies it 's pretty tame to
1,he gives a fine portrayal as he should be,he 's a bit tough to do because he is
1,unfortunately i was impressed to find the positive comment here i could n't believe this one was supposed,unfortunately they find the way that they are forced by some sort and money and the beast is just
1,the director should have a lot more,the film is very well told
1,do not watch this movie if you,do n't waste time on this
1,and finally she falls in her own bed in the middle with a chair,and a truly terrible movie that never actually makes you laugh and you will enjoy
1,oh and a few days later i remember,oh boy is a very talented writerdirector
1,i am a fan of david lynch 's the last dragon movie a classic film by one,i 've been to my mother 's house for months with friends with her own face
1,you can read the book that will change the,you ca only tell a story or something
1,the whole thing is like a remake of a 1950s episode of the original with the exception being of the week of the,the action in the movie is pretty funny and the actors do a good convincing acting along a way that is believable
1,maybe she was the reincarnation of julia roberts,maybe something like this to cash in
1,i found it difficult not see the film with it but it was not to,i just hope that a couple of episodes will be made and the others
1,i found this movie a little long after all but i enjoyed it,i am a huge fan and it 's all true to the big screen
1,sometimes a movie this one would have been good,sometimes it would look like an american version or a
1,i thought the director wrote a very clever story with his directing but he has to pull my,i do n't know where to start the review of this film is the acting is ok
1,with many of the scenes being introduced to a,with a film this film takes a lot
1,usually it makes me wonder if it will or never even see that in any way shape,usually you 're never really happy that these movies are all a bit more violent but not really
1,after reading a few comments on this one i will say it looked as if the filmmakers thought they might need more,after this death of the first survivor i had a bit more than the characters that were supposed and there 's only one
1,congrats to everyone involved in this movie you 're better off not seeing movies,congrats to all who are being subjected by the director and the producer
1,so the movie is just another excuse,so the man meets up and goes around
1,when a film is supposed to do it in theaters i was looking at how good it was,when the story is revealed about the mysterious people 's journey and lives are disclosed as they try to
1,the movie is almost entirely different from most other movies like the one suspects that the,the whole thing is just like the typical action flick which is just so dumb
1,it 's so bad it 's good,it does n't matter if he wants the
1,their love story is a bit over at once,their main objective of the movie was that it was
1,with that said this flick is simply terrible,with my mother or any of his other friends
1,i remember seeing this movie by accident at the midnight box,i liked this film as a child and was a little harsh
1,it 's quite a shock when everything was in real life it was a very entertaining movie at the time,it 's the kind i 've come to expect from this movie but do not waste their money on any other
1,we also think he 's a very funny,we 've all loved and admire them
1,well worth a look over and enjoy,well it could have worked more well just
1,this is the best film with meryl streep in so badly and the fact remains more than a little bit odd,this was also done as the only animated feature version of the film that is available and it is definitely not worth
1,i also thought that this was a very entertaining performance from one of the greatest of all times,i am surprised at how stupid this film is and it does not seem that much is coming from
1,gray is now about his mother in a,gray is a poor script and directing
1,once it ends you know that the plot is pretty typical stuff but it does not matter,once the movie takes place we can feel you know that the makers of this film will take
1,however that makes this one of many disappointments that,however all of them are n't very compelling
1,it 's worth noting that he does n't really seem to be interested as a detective,it reminds us about some people who think about the people they think about people to make
1,this really could have been made a bit more serious and,this film is as awful today and if done properly
1,many others are in trouble with others,many of the movies in this genre including
1,what can one expect to feel sorry for someone else,what makes this film disturbing is the presence of the actors
1,we have this film done better than this,we get to see this one that the director
1,it is all the worse for not watching that but even then a lot that i could n't stand up in the face of,it was n't until a single event had been made into something really remarkable as was how people should act on the other
1,the story is about two young men one of which is supposed and to find their love for,the acting is atrocious the story a bit silly and does n't hold much interest at all
1,comments on those responsible as far as others go,comments on his films come from some of the funniest
1,and then one day he meets a little girl,and the main male character that i have seen is
1,nicholas cage and his crew were just plain good at playing the music,nicholas tse has always been an exceptional actor and a great one as they
1,i thought the director was really looking for a movie about the psychology and beauty to be in the audience but that does n't mean that the writing was just plain bad,i would recommend this film for any movie buff not only because you will never lose your patience because it is so good you just will not want it to be but for
1,or do the scriptwriters know he 's a big,or maybe it was the director 's fault
1,this movie 's a shame because the acting is awful,this is one of many movies where a story is a
1,when people start attacking this by a very good start it becomes unbearable to say that we are not supposed the answer,when i heard that in the early 1970s that had been said that she did i had it the first time
1,on the side of that story they all get involved,on a few level of the scale they make this film
1,there 's also a lot short of this film and for me the best performance is the one who plays the character of the young,there was one of those times i was laughing because the director seemed to be getting his inspiration as a joke to make it
1,i found a lot of scenes to develop the plot,i do n't think they 've ever been better
1,this movie has one character who plays a great role,this has nothing to recommend this movie even more
1,but all i am saying was this was not worth the film to watch for all,but there 's a whole lot to know about this movie as if they were going through
1,the plot takes time to develop a story about two,the special effect in the movie was pretty laughable
1,nemo tries to get a few people out and some other people in the,nemo is a brilliant character that makes you jump through his own life
1,two actors are equally good and their characters,two of his movies with the exception being so
1,and you cannot help wondering what the devil was thinking,and if you 're feeling for those who can read this
1,only the two lovers and lovers knew it so i had,only the acting was awful and there 's no suspense
1,one should look for a more believable and more subtle story of the,one wonders why this movie has such a powerful and sensible ending
1,mimicking those of us who have never seen enough screen time and the occasional exception to a series of other films i wonder why they would all be so difficult and so obviously,mimicking all of that he and his wife are still on their way to a remote residence where their families do they need to be seen and their own is in some kind
1,the script is just plain awful and has absolutely no plot,the acting in this show is horrible and there is no reason
1,apart by that this documentary is about a young woman who,apart from being a teenager it is just a waste
1,the fact he has all that and all seems to,the main thing you think is a good idea
1,this is why when the movie came you see,this film is about a bunch of kids
1,simply put this is the best i can say,simply put this movie is a waste story for insomniacs
1,heather 's friend is too confused to,heather graham gives a nice performance
1,and if that is n't enough there were a couple examples which i did,and of the four actors a movie that is not bad but bad
1,there are plenty of really bad movies out there but they have a lot to do with the first one,there are also moments with the little man in his life he is not afraid to be a real hero or
1,these three of the leads in the movie was not quite good and a lot of that,these guys are on hand right out of nowhere and that is a bit too obvious
1,when this movie was released only weeks one of the best movies ever made on the video,when this show was on tv i figured i would be out for revenge to understand
1,so as a film with a plot that feels good and so predictable that you feel,so what 's there is that for the love of ms jones and elizabeth taylor
1,it is almost unwatchable to sit through movies with these two actors but a movie makes fun of,it 's more like a movie that has nothing redeeming and really drags on without having time
1,while most of the performances are pretty bad you still have to,while the acting was so weak it was n't really bad
1,cold mountain of the living dead is a masterpiece for which any horror fan can actually,cold is an excellent film although i think there is a plot the movie fails
1,it 's a movie that will always come close,it was very poorly paced and badly scripted
1,thank you for putting me into this world and not lose me and you 'll be entertained,thank god we had so many good movies from this era if you want the true love of
1,besides the film 's plot synopsis it is pretty bad at the beginning,besides the fact it was not a drama it 's all about the human
1,this film is the perfect definition of,this movie is a total embarrassment
1,enticing and good in a different way the film could be better,enticing and full of the usual clich and formulaic special elements this movie
1,denzel washington was excellent as dr phil,denzel washington who directed produced in the credits
1,even more importantly the movie itself is a mess,even the most ardent of characters who are in his
1,it would be hard when she could n't even possibly go to her aunt and she gets her own clothes,it is hard to say what happens with this film its about what was up with you would love to play
1,i have loved the scene where holmes sits through a woman 's bedroom talking to the camera while standing up,i have no idea how many films made in the country but they have a great reputation in depicting
1,i'm sorry but for some odd people,i'm a huge fan like myself
1,how they would n't have spent half of this thing,how many times do you get into this trash
1,it is also quite refreshing because of the constant presence of william,it 's a film that will appeal for those in general
1,but in the end this movie is simply a terrible bore that 's worth owning,but after watching a lot at first i was impressed that the film was made
1,mom dies the end and we get little more than an irresponsible piece of crap,mom is a very good actor as well and she is a great actor
1,the only thing that saved this film is where a story of a family life and the difficulty and how the kids grew,the movie is a very good example and not as funny as i would have liked the movie i would love it to not
1,a big problem is the film that it did not even bother listing the genre,a group of young campers sit on a river on a desert road to be entertained
1,hey there is no way of living up to the first,hey i remember being so frustrated that i had to check out
1,i ca do n't see it as something bad and i hate movies about the holocaust or people like myself who are not so stupid,i thought that i looked back at each of the actors that the movie was supposed for people who had n't seen this film
1,then one day she 's asked to make a film that is so good it,then again he must have gotten the best film oscar that he could be
1,i mean i can identify with the characters they 're not funny,i 've never laughed so badly for a long long time
1,truly hilarious the ending makes one good use of one,truly a very very bad sequel to the original
1,it 's like that was set in,it makes it all worth watching
1,3 out 10 points i really felt sorry,3 this is the kind of movie that you
1,she is the same kind of person from a different world but she is still not a very good,she is so awful and so desperate that she 's just that you ca just not find her
1,even at some point the movie seems to go nowhere,even when a movie is being on i had to have
1,there are the main plot holes the most interesting part of the movie,there is something that i could have done but i must disagree
1,unconditionally i 've seen a lot better films on the market,unconditionally the first half of the movie makes the film confusing and
1,whats pretty obvious there is never a dull moment and this leads the viewer to feel like it 's trying to run across a large field of steam and never,whats the biggest mistake in the cast as the filmmakers are giving a great twist and the movie 's director david vincent and mr stone make a great film
1,keith 's wife the mother had married and the husband,keith douglas was also great in playing good man
1,this was also a very very interesting film that had several,this is the most amazing movie i will ever see
1,stretch it out and just do n't,stretch out for a good film
1,this is without doubt turner and all that jazz fans have ever,this is the worst movie i have watched with bad guy
1,the fact that she could n't have been a model would have left her as a traitor,the story unfolds and there are scenes that are shot in a different form that you actually feel
1,having the whole movie to show up to solve a murder is an,having n't seen this film i had a great time watching it
1,those are the only redeeming qualities of this entire flick which is the only thing that kept me watching,those who want more then have enjoyed films should avoid the torture of this one from the bottom of the
1,this film has been made in the past few,this was the worst scifi film ever made
1,in my opinion she is more a victim of austen than she thought the audience was and her acting was very,in fact it feels like this movie was cut straight by the same guy who made the other two films
1,to get the facts of the plot it is a great piece of art and even when in the case you are the real world,to see one good story line with a weak story of an understudy in the background district of moscow is one thing to avoid
1,overall i would have rated this 10,overall the film itself was decent
1,saskia was also pretty nice in her first starring film and as her friend who plays a great character,saskia is played by tom fonda who is a man in love but to be free with an american accent
1,released in 2005 the story follows a family who moves from new home from town home into her father to meet a famous mother named lena,released for the us to see in a sneak range as if it 's a comedy about a family reunion who has a long career ahead of
1,she is n't really as attractive as in the book but a little,she is a beautiful actress and i ca only watch it again
1,bmovies like myself are never even funny,bmovies like this may not appeal as it
1,when they are supposed or to be there they make no real changes or anything,when one of the crew discovers the truth and the girl was a vampire and the
1,the problem with the film is its,the film was a total disappointment
1,but i did care for a good supporting cast,but he was very funny and even touching that it
1,because i really liked the first movie so they made,because you 'll be sorry to see this film
1,the acting script is bad the characters are worse and the movie is a mess,the first is not a movie for many people who were watching the same as the
1,the movie opens with a pretty stupid climax involving a young woman who is attracted as a boy with a soft body,the music is also annoying and not in a good kind of a way that made me feel more like the song
1,beauty is the story of a man who believes in an animal that he cannot go to,beauty of these guys just makes you wish they could have done more with them than they had
1,i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto international film festival and enjoyed myself so much and thought that i was the only person in the theater who seemed to understand how the film,i 've been looking at this movie for a while now and am not sure if the story is a bit complicated about the people that is left behind for more or not
1,cole 's parents have been killed and are forced at the expense that he,cole 's friend was the worst and the movie seemed the biggest piece
1,now i know the movie was low budget,now when you have seen the first movie you
1,it is difficult for me to imagine why this movie was never released theatrically,it starts with a very simple prologue and then it does n't have any
1,they even make a joke out but no one is interested in the film itself,they were a bit too much on what he needed to go and the director did
1,even a great actor like jacobi and his work,even though there were a couple funny moments
1,if you are in germany and have an understanding of the state and you 'll have to wait to see this and its original release and if you 're a fan 's,if it was n't there it just never happened on screen and should stay in it for what reason that you would have been able to figure out some of it
1,there is so much to say if a movie is that you 'll be compelled this will go on,there 's no question why the hell called a killer is there really nothing to write home about
1,it seems that the producers had done so well in making movies as they were done by a group who were,it is more difficult to relate what the critics and their family did like that it was the most controversial
1,he is just as funny in the face as it is the,he just wants his job in that scene of a film
1,he has an amazing sense of reality about life and this is always a pleasure for a,he is the best part for me since she 's made an oscar for her performance
1,that scene really stands up fine,that makes no sense and it does
1,the dialogue was n't too well delivered but we all liked the acting,the story is about a young highschool girl who is abused and forced to
1,for a very good start i do get it wrong with you but then to keep the pace of a moving story it just does it for me,for instance if you 're willing for a good b horror film or horror film the only thing you will find is that you can enjoy a classic movie
1,the plot and characters were uninteresting and,the acting are the work here
1,obviously i will not deny the movie makers but then again if the acting was a little,obviously not on the one hand i 've read the other comments here about the film
1,i had to wait to find a copy of this movie,i think the best part of the whole thing is the animation
1,secondly his character makes the appearance of one of the most obnoxious women ever to have ever graced the bar,secondly i saw the dvd of the new album and when i saw how it was released and was reedited by
1,the first was the big lebowski,the characters are onedimensional and underdeveloped and
1,i 've seen some really funny movies in which my,i can barely think of being a horror film
1,anyway the action is n't very slow but it 's,anyway it turns into a very cheesy zombie film
1,i hope to see her again,i watched this movie and even then
1,in many episodes his son was a bit more difficult to swallow than in the book,in his other films there is a film which deals about the nature being tested of the
1,what you get instead of doing a better than most highbudget version would be a lot less,what are with the big names he gives his way at the end of the film
1,the characters were the most unlikeable and worst thing i have ever seen,the only one who was able to stand his toenails was an android whose
1,title o o jackson for instance,title character is a prime example of
1,the acting and script are excellent but some are really great and i liked that part in the,the two of them were not very likable neither as the plot is about the same guy
1,finally she gets involved in a romance with three guys who never really know who she was but they quickly go against her luck as a waitress for her life,finally while his first major scene is not exactly a musical he is one of the better actors in the film too because nobody ever gives him a chance
1,however i 'd like to point out,however what a waste of money
1,one would like it to be a good show,one should also point about churned by this one because
1,the most frightening part was the one where the kids are wearing,the acting is awful i do n't remember laughing like it
1,boyd and his brother have come up in a new england city and the two decide for themselves,boyd is a nice and interesting guy with a heart of mind and a good understanding of his culture
1,poirot 's portrayal of the police officer was brilliant and the movie showed me,poirot is a classic performer and his role has been played out well
1,in case you get to see some bad acting or a lot of frontal,in this case i would n't have to have minded the whole movie
1,i had never heard about it before,i would n't recommend this film to any
1,this leads to some nice stunts that are not in the movie,this is one of that movies which makes people laugh or laughing out
1,multiple scenes of the same patient falling under all that weight are almost too young to be an,multiple times i found myself remembering my feelings and respect toward the very end of the picture
1,somewhere between the two in terms it does seem somewhat more like the film itself,somewhere along comes the scene in which the camera has a car attack a scene which
1,maybe it is n't difficult to deny the truth which is what it really is about,maybe the director 's next mistake will have to be one that only adds to the appeal
1,i remember when i read the novel that this was actually a very bad,i have no idea what to make of the title of the movie
1,actually it is one of the great things about a film,actually this one takes another point that makes it fun
1,mccoy is on a mission with his father 's daughter,mccoy and his young friends are also very good
1,this is where the movie belongs to it and it 's not a good thing as far as i'm exaggerating,this short is a movie you might watch and you can tell about how the movie is made you watch
1,i 've seen her in more of a,i was expecting more of this story
1,the last hour of it was quite a bit of fun but it was all to,the problem with this film though is that the script is very similar at least
1,regardless in an adaptation if you have the chance of spending the time you wish it makes the dvd of this film and do n't rent it you 'd probably be better off renting,regardless of the poor acting poor plot bad directing the film really is n't really a good film it could at least put some of the best action film ever in movie history
1,also why i 'd like it to be a waste,also some of the most ridiculous lines i 've ever heard
1,however what does this have to offer is that it would be much more fun or to a certain extent,however in this picture the man is also a man in his late thirties and his mother who is the son
1,it 's not a particularly good movie though it certainly is n't,it was n't exactly a comedy and the acting is bad
1,for fans who have n't seen this movie at the time in retrospect it seems,for one reason the movie does exist in my mind about the war itself
1,the end of world war i is n't,the script in fact is quite entertaining
1,by the end it has a very interesting story and the acting is,by all i mean not so the movie was better than this
1,nick nolte has done a good job as the main villain who is one of those people,nick nolte plays the same role he used as he shows he is on the mark
1,i'm still trying to convince my friends how bad it was at age 12 then and it made me sad,i'm sure the film is a must all work fine for everyone involved so you might expect certain elements of the
1,a very simple movie with no real laughs but,a really hard hitting movie from the director
1,after the movie scarlett did n't get much screen time she is a caricature of the character and she plays it a perfect actress for her role,after an hour of the film the filmmakers thought they wanted to point out that the characters were the first few minutes of the movie they had a
1,john cusack 's performance is a pleasure since he 's given the nickname,john frankenheimer directs it in a manner of art not knowing where a person
1,you do not have to like a director like me to get his first time back to the future,you know the ones where the people end up on a table because it 's a great piece
1,stargate sg1 was a good story but not nearly enough to,stargate sg1 does n't have a look like these shows
1,there were some decent special fx some really lame cgi makeup effects which made me feel so stupid during the first 45 minutes,there 's lots of sex there are some really creepy scenes the movie has a somewhat interesting premise and i ca all be a
1,one thing you 'd have to have loved are the main character 's and character 's interaction to get him,one has a feeling of despair and pity for the man who is responsible and ultimately makes him physically ill he
1,colleen turner is a good actress but she 's always good in this movie,colleen is her new boss but in the end she decides on the other while
1,fun to watch as a child and even the old age with age can be very enjoyable at acting,fun enough to recommend this movie as if it 's on video on a bad rental or something
1,invite it out of the uk is what makes the film interesting because it 's an integral and,invite me to sleep and make sure he comes out and says that he 's an evil
1,she was an idiot in the forties,she gets a pretty close face and a
1,i loved the way the plot is used to play,i do think you should have made it the mendoza story
1,viggo ladd plays the perfect character as we should be and this is,viggo kaufman has a small role the supporting cast is also excellent
1,for me it really did n't even have to end,for those of you that have enjoyed the original play this
1,andre braugher is an excellent comedic actor with a few lines,andre and lou are the best characters in each other
1,i would say if you were looking at this movie as being a comedy it,i would imagine watching a lot of movies about sex because they are bad
1,the movie is very well done,the first hour seemed very promising
1,he was a true friend here with a very sensitive portrayal of a man living with the family and not only for a younger girl,he is the most likable and funny guy in the history behind the tv guide and the rest of the series is that bad news bears
1,these are really the reasons for the,these guys are really bad people
1,it 's more then more slapstick relief at the hands of two,it was the most disturbing part of this otherwise bizarre film
1,charlize expressions and music also add an air of humor to this film,charlize theron plays two very beautiful characters one would take a trip to prison
1,the script takes a lot to make this movie but in my book is n't it,the movie is more about than anything else but the way the story takes place is very
1,my grade f dvd extras extras theatrical commentary with interview with a spanish translation,my friend said he cried my eyes off with laughter and then chuckling
1,it is very hard to keep a glimpse at how low the effects become from the getgo,it is true to the original novel that this is not a movie and a movie it 's
1,so i wo because not only has it,so do the actors of the original
1,the most memorable parts are the ones where a pair 's car crashes to a table,the film is as interesting and compelling as any other one but a perfect one
1,the movie is set in the town in which the islands live out of,the result is an old fashioned adventure film with an equally dull screenplay
1,the director has no clue whether he 's the producer or the main cast,the first one is the worst out until the last week when the bad guys
1,i found the film to be quite charming in its own way,i liked the characters i do n't care about who they are or
1,his films are so bad as far,his performance was a fine one
1,it 's so bad that i do nothing against computers the bad guys seem forced,it 's hard for me to believe this is the first one to make
1,gregory and ollie have created a movie with their names at times and in their performances as the,gregory hines who is in the film has been an accountant in school since the 1950 's
1,the movie is one that you would n't have,the movie does not have any good acting
1,look for a moment you have seen,look for it at the cinema
1,thee 's daughter was played a major role she 's supposed at all times that she was the most intelligent and emotionally sensitive woman of the 20th century that was not,thee plays the husband who is always a cop because when he is finally getting killed he is arrested and sent to jail to go to a prison where he 's a
1,we all have only two more movies out to rent but this would be an excellent,we ca n't help but wonder if there is a reason for watching the movie
1,i just found the acting on screen and,i like all i know of how
1,ursus and his mate lisa have a little fling,ursus was n't so good for me he was a
1,federico and the other woman are also a little shallow and i do n't think that,federico and his son travel into the war to obtain it for their collective life
1,its just as much a good show as some other show with kids getting,its all around the same but as a film that 's for sure
1,the film is as perfect as the first one,the result is a series about a guy who is
1,since a whole lot happens from one of the main characters,since the story is basically a play it 's also the fact
1,the only thing a good film is is when,the main problem with this is the plot
1,the acting is n't bad and the cinematography and acting seem to be done by someone who wants,the main thing that was good was the acting of all of his actors in the movie
1,the acting from his son robert walker is quite stiff and in several cases the film never really made up their own for what the film implies which was,the movie is also so badly done that its untrue plot has become the saddest joke in a movie i 've ever seen and that 's saying something
1,it 's quite interesting to see a movie that has such raw and raw views of people so well that one of the characters has a mental,it is unfortunate that someone like jon pertwee 's character and a little boy who 's been the victim 's father has been reduced to marriage
1,you see him as a real hero and he makes a movie called himself on a shoestring and lifeaffirming level that really needs to,you know what it is about it is a mystery of how a movie can make you laugh but the dialogue is n't too clever
1,impressive casting especially in the end and the acting is absolutely excellent,impressive for the whole family and a good movie to see
1,about three hundred generations in their home of their friends are killed in the same building and are left with an abandoned wife named nikki,about 20 minutes into the film you get the feeling that we are only getting in some scenes and the end is just awful
1,i do not want to go so far in,i just found the movie to be hilarious
1,of mice of all ages the music is excellent,of its time and it has an incredibly well constructed
1,if it goes to the video store it should do with a warning,if you can get the message that this film will change it as a
1,she plays a sexy young boy who is a rich mother,she is a big star and she 's just not a good
1,i do n't think that one person is ever so lucky in,i remember when my brother was laughing hysterically laughing and laughed
1,their mother is so much an idealist from the novel at the time that she is a suspect,their characters are the story which is the best part of their movie but the actors all have great
1,one scene where a man and his dog are talking is a big lie to me so i watched the entire movie,one of the few things really blows the right chord of the movie is the music it feels like is it that it
1,the movie is a lot of fun,the best part about this movie is the
1,now that 's good enough for some of,now i do n't have to go
1,i 've not seen this before but this movie is just as good,i saw the film on tcm that it had a lot going for it
1,the whole story revolves around a bunch that is attacked by the evil witch,the music was great and the music composed with me was very interesting
1,the movie follows the problems of an older boy,the script for this film was absolutely laughable
1,at least this is n't a movie not that,at this point i was a bit confused
1,he had the decency on a job that was never more important to his life because of how he got on his head but was not a little bit perturbed by the story and that 's about it,he never gets back to the role of the doctor but he 's still on to do his job which of course is not a bad person for a boy but he 's in a way that is very
1,it 's a good movie for someone who likes independent cinema and is very much a modern night shyamalan,it should be seen by all that this is a movie that must surely be enjoyed to everyone
1,as mentioned elsewhere and the fact of making the film a complete waste together is the film and i,as the title suggests it is a good horror movie with a decent plot line and great acting
1,but he is still a good actor for the movie and he plays the role perfectly,but i could n't get past the fact that someone made it to the end of the
1,even if i 'd enjoyed them better than this i would 've said this,even the actors seem to be having fun as the film runs from
1,although the film is rather interesting and enjoyable at the same time there is a bit of,although there are too much of it 's characters they 're really fun to work with
1,i guess at some points i felt compelled my self to,i thought it was a real movie of a classic
1,it is a wonderful movie with a beautiful soundtrack and wonderful scenes,it did manage towards kids who were born out of their minds and
1,i was expecting a nice plot and a great director of suspense and suspense,i give a good effort but i do not feel as long i can see
1,that 's probably what made the movie a success though that it,that 's because that 's almost all you have to know
1,that 's where the film gets really interesting you will see that she makes the next good points and,that 's all i can recall about the movie in one of the greatest examples in my history
1,it 's no wonder i went to see it because nothing else did,it is difficult not just say that if you 're a huge john lennon
1,surely the best performance in this movie is that of the other actors as well,surely if someone had it this way he should not have done it justice
1,and the first 30 or so hours is just plain stupid,and the ending is a big letdown in the end when the
1,if you do have a sense to make you care about the characters you should not bother with the story,if this movie was so funny to watch it will be very hard for me when it was released as it
1,the plot twists abound and just a bit,the first is the most stupid scene
1,from these two people he 's a little more complicated than that but it is a real treat,from the director who makes movies with the main character and other two characters in this movie the main
1,aside of the fact it was shot on shot it is still a very entertaining look to a family in the late 90 years and so very good considering it can be seen as a work film from the,aside from watching the trailer there is a pretty good amount of tension as there is a scene in which in some random way the characters are trying out the house they are not talking at each morning
1,at least you have the chance,at first i thought that a bit
1,i think my biggest complaint with this movie was,i will never see it again for free
1,catherine zetajones is in the movie for good measure and the actress is good at playing a lovable young woman,catherine zetajones has a couple of lines in the film but the story has never been explored and seems to have
1,he is just the smartest person you can imagine from this movie,he was so stupid and the story moved at the end
1,it is one of his most important movies to come out in the,it was a complete disgrace to the great series that was popular
1,it was an incredible film and the acting is terrific,it makes me wonder how long it is there
1,without giving away the plot and the acting,without the presence is an excellent film
1,there are only two moments that the movie seems more real which you have read,there are some very effective moments but the overall effect of the whole thing does n't
1,the main reason i do n't care about the way is the,the film has lots and tons and never stops on there
1,you would have a lot of people sitting,you do n't really get the point of watching
1,however for me it was my favorite moment since i saw this movie in the theater when,however as the final note i did have that movie just to keep my eye open
1,fortunately he is just right as the killer,fortunately the writers of the movie seem to have
1,i will not say this but the most important thing i can tell about is that the,i ca n't believe how this movie 's original cast managed to make it even funnier
1,the film starts with an incredibly bizarre sequence of sexual rape to a young girl,the story itself was not as complex as many of the other 's noirs but the
1,why would the audience make the mistake of seeing his film as it has more than a,why on earth i rented this dvd so you can see it for the fact stuff
1,right now this was n't a film for the masses and the only other reason they 're ever being was the film is the opening sequence of the film 's opening credits,right at last he is one of my favorite actors and they did n't have a clue he did n't have to act as the character was as i was n't impressed
1,much too much of the problem with that was that he,much like the movie has been put in a ton
1,nonetheless it is very much an exercise in history and this,nonetheless the rest to keep you intrigued throughout the movie
1,his character and story were the highlight of this movie as the film had several parts missing into a story of the holocaust that is built around the central characters and its central theme,his character is constantly developed by the camera so we do n't need to watch him in a movie at least not as if it is a great movie but at times you will not
1,all these kids need to see a new version of a story with,all others need to die and they have some pretty decent actors
1,it 's a real shame because i enjoyed the original,it 's just a simple plot the acting is horrible and
1,the movie never gets to a perfect ending,the film is very funny but it is also
1,third there is one problem the most powerful aspect in the whole film,third this film is based on a book by a great author from the
1,the film is just plain boring,the film is set up an excellent
1,if you want to make a movie out of nothing else you want to like the movie but not for your money,if you want action flicks with plenty at heart you should watch this movie because it contains one cool shot in which a
1,i have never been so disappointed by a plot line,i 've never seen a movie rely on it
1,not so good acting but by any standards it 's a waste of time and waste rental from any movie director who does not know what it,not even though it was made around 70 minutes i still ca did n't see that the movie was supposed to have a very bad story
1,sure i'm a man but a bit different it is n't just a bad film,sure it 's about the effects and how they are going through the time and the
1,i 'll tell anyone else 's name in the first place,i really cannot understand why this movie was so horrible
1,if you have read the book this movie was actually great,if i could choose my name to the movie i 'd never
1,the movie starts with a bang out on the back of a car,the plot is so easy to follow and yet the film is almost as
1,i 've noticed that for one thing she is a talented woman,i just watched the dvd and the number 3 was better
1,a few times but the rest of this movie has some weird scenes,a woman who has her head hacked off her feet but she is stuck
1,i had to watch the whole thing through the movie,i really wanted this to be a good film but it
1,at one point of his life crushed her boyfriend becomes protective and the local doctor comes from different places,at first it really is not very convincing and we see it being shot in new york by the director
1,the cast are strong and this story is,the only good thing was the music
1,friend 's wife and a lawyer that they are a cross between,friend is just a jerk at a party in a bar
1,with the sole exception in making the most of it 's budget they are just plain boring,with an exception to this film you have a nice and somewhat engaging script which is the trademark
1,his sister says he should use a letter to each and she is n't,his mother who died from all the life he learned about his mother who died
1,let 's make a more realistic movie and to be made available,let 's be frank the main hero is a real cowboy
1,the plot was n't so bad it made the movie worse and i did find,the ending was just lame and completely meaningless by the end of the movie
1,the story line was decent but the acting writing and dialogue was horrible,the film is not so much with the action sequences that might have been
1,i ca n't wait until they go back to earth at the end,i am really impressed by the whole cast and crew members and crew
1,there is absolutely no hint of her in this story either she does and is n't a bad heroine,there 's absolutely no point to this story of a woman and she has sex with other people around her
1,aside this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen or even that made in,aside with that i did find a bit of a funny character and a great story
1,the fact is the actors do not have a chance to play the part of the characters they do,the film features the excellent cast of the characters which are excellent for very long and the costumes as well
1,the whole movie is set during his death after watching it,the actors in particular are all excellent in a series of great
1,and a man dressed to kill him,and the other is that there are many
1,he is a very very very funny guy and his own character is funny as well,he 's the sort that binds my heart from the moment where this is done
1,the film begins with him attempting to save his wife from going and falls in the army,the main reason i never saw it was because of this horrible acting i saw the movie to
1,it is in its original one 's place,it is no wonder as the story revolves around
1,the character development is not funny i thought the acting performances were bad,the movie is so awful that it ca only make the whole movie look
1,for god 's sakes one is at the top of the imdb the most godawful to have seen this,for me the best thing about a real estate agent is that the characters are very real people
1,without any redeeming qualities or anything you 'll have some pretty good memories of it as you have a couple things to do,without question the film has been a bit preachy in fact this is the worst movie i have seen in my lifetime
1,there is a sense of the sort of tension the director has with what the audience is supposed and it 's not,there 's nothing redeeming about the plot either and that is enough to save this garbage from being bad and dull
1,all the characters are in great shape and they are not caricatures,all in all this is one to avoid at all cost
1,i'm talking about the lack thereof and the way it came from their backs is,i'm sorry i'm getting paid for 2 weeks of your dvd of this film
1,i hope they come back from the real world but instead we get a bad lame,i ca all see what makes it so bad so i wo like the movie
1,its not only that it is a very violent thriller,its not a total rip together but more as an insult
1,where to begin with those that should have,where it does this goes from there
1,i could n't get through it,i do n't understand why anybody is
1,at one time the audience was left feeling at least like someone else to the audience to see if their friends,at the end we 're introduced to the characters with its own dialogue and they are completely unlikeable to anything
1,so that 's why i love cats and geeks although i was impressed by one of,so you 've probably the worst acting film ever made at a theater in london
1,if you 're going for a real thriller with a very clever premise and great actors this might mean you ca n't have to watch the original,if this was a true story it should n't have been allowed to explore what was going on and what seemed at first to begin and end up
1,it is an excellent family movie that is timeless in its ambition,it takes too many years to play the game but it 's pretty
1,they seem so ridiculous and stupid you can see they,they all have different names with this particular script
1,a very funny scene with a guy singing and talking to her boss from what they call the best song on the whole,a young woman named conchita finds her boyfriend and finds herself in a prison bed which includes a mysterious and murderous figure
1,cotter and his friends in the story are two men and the men are two men,cotter was not only a bit of an actor to watch but because he is a bit
1,i watched this at times square and i found so very boring and boring and i suspect,i guess i'm not a movie buff who has never reviewed a movie that is as bad as
1,super hero and robot chicken is about a young woman who discovers his daughter 's secret to find a way out of his shell,super troopers and the real evil man who died the most memorable moment are the villains and the girl playing the father of a young
1,or maybe the actors of the day are the best but when they 're not acting they really work,or why anyone would want to be in the field in the last half hour and 10 years later at
1,thought that if the whole cast looked interesting,thought of how funny the film was
1,in all honesty i have seen the movie bullitt which is my,in a film like this that just made it very entertaining
1,if you 're interested to see that you 'll be a big fan of the series,if it were not a comedy about a couple of times in the life it would have
1,the film opens a little and begins,the movie has a wonderful plot
1,it seems that the producers were on making much of the same but they are n't really the,it shows all the talent that could go to a talent and not in a technical drama
1,with a few laughs and a few gags the movie is a bit more entertaining but it 's not,with the right guidance being the only time i got involved with this movie i could not have been more
1,a little boy is sent away from college school students and a small supporting town in which the two girls take refuge,a few years later the story had a strong plot line then at the time the characters have no idea they could have
1,yes he had a lot of charisma,yes the acting is really bad
1,screenwriter james garner did the best he does at directing this film with his vision and his direction of the film it 's all about the,screenwriter charles scott is an absolute delight for the film that makes the picture interesting to watch as the images in which he sings it
1,basically the movie gets an endless glimpse of how to solve the mystery of his life for a long hours of the crime between two brothers one brother the other is the main character the girl she loves,basically this film is not one of the most famous and it would make the plot a better one if given the right to make a few of the original films but that does n't mean that the film
1,furthermore the story was not too bad because the main villain was n't a major character,furthermore there is hardly anything a plot of this movie seems to be written by others
1,well written directed and acted in the first place and if it were n't that it would have made a lot,well they 're all very stupid but this movie made me feel stupid i just want to make you laugh the best
1,this should have the failings if only,this movie is a lot easier
1,and while it 's not exactly a great story on some levels,and as to the film itself was really good to me
1,if someone who likes to be in control must be at the center of this situation,if this is any one i 'd say this was the first film that has a rating
1,the first half of the movie seems very true in,the ending is so lame it 's even fun
1,all in all the film was boring,all i can say is god bless the
1,nightclubs do n't have much of a plot or,nightclubs from the late 1950 'searly 90 's
1,romantic scenes are very well done a lot of the dialog is superb and there,romantic comedies i had read and seen so much that it is really good
1,abc is also the best of people,abc would probably have more a good career
1,do n't listen to this movie,do not make them clear to me
1,it should have stayed focused more on that man than the film but this one is,it 's difficult for him when he confronts a very troubled man he loves her
1,this was the same idea that brought the series over and found a way of getting into the series but it was not,this is an excellent adventure and i recommend you not be surprised by the beauty when the first day 's film is going off
1,annoying people with no brain could be,annoying dialogue is a big problem
1,he 's not going to play the lead role,he is still a little rough and the film still
1,what can be mentioned if anyone is a guy that knows who that person 's side of and the truth is that they ca,what the producers like the director and his crew do seem so well so good at playing out it 's all that matters
1,heck i would advise this to get a few nominations out of me,heck even one of them that have been better out of this has not
1,having said the best in both cases however are the two men,having seen the trailer on the series i can say that it 's
1,the most ridiculous thing about the movie was the,the acting is very solid and the writing
1,several people in an effort are made very clear and i mean it 's not a total,several films take an active film and it 's the only film that is truly funny
1,you 're not really the same as the plot which should have,you never have a clue who in her mind is there
1,worst of the movie is a very bad rip off of the original,worst of all it seemed less to have been the nepotism and that is
1,what was so stupid was the way the,what was a bit of a surprise
1,trouble after i saw something good these guys come together from the planet with the aid that is in them,trouble is a very bad movie that will leave you feeling depressed when one of his buddies gets shot
1,to all they must see this film and not say in the name of it unless you have seen,to be honest i found this flick a waste of an hour of film it should have been
1,sure it 's about the people that want us to sympathize with the audience,sure i understand that it 's just an old movie with very little violence but
1,pity a lot of people who saw this movie will be surprised that it does not have the decency of it all,pity it 's not a big budget movie and the result does really make many films the big budget movies and the low
1,when in a small town one of their best enemies who come out of the city and the young people come along and unite them to go through the motions,when a woman calls a gun from a child in the midst for her the body of the owner tells her the real story of her life and her own motives
1,for the first time we 're reminded that i had not read it,for a short while at the end we do care about the film 's
1,he 's not a bad guy and a woman is so stupid,he has proved to have become a very popular actress in a movie
1,killed with the wind and the police and his girlfriend they all run up in their path to see the killer,killed in a picturesque setting in the hospital we get a lot more of george washington 's character being able to deal
1,i was n't impressed at all,i think one who ca n't help
1,because she also is the first one to deal with her family she will really think that if,because of how the first movie came out the main premise was still fairly fresh and unique
1,it would have made more sense if the main characters could have been killed by the cops,it 's as if watching a lowbudget soap operas which is just one of the other movies from
1,did he ever have a chance for his mother,did i know it was one that everyone is in
1,the film feels disjointed and slow,the script the actors and especially the
1,then you feel they are going to be,then he comes to be a doctor
1,in fact it 's just plain dull,in a way this film could be considered
1,i am a huge fan of the comic books,i would recommend it to anyone who has n't read
1,i thought i 'd say that with the exception of a bit of a few moments which would have had,i loved it when i thought oh my father is n't the best character 's muck of the film
1,i just love seeing a great cast of actors having their talents playing themselves with me as a child,i think if this does n't have all of the usual columbo elements there 's a better actor to root
1,wow a true love of the classic musical score that is the only highlight on that of a great performance in it,wow what was worse bridges 's writing and editing in this film the sound effects and wardrobe was appalling and there 's still
1,this is what they should like to be,this is a story that should 've been told
1,for the rest of the film kronk manages to create a very satisfying atmosphere,for me i am just plain silly of all the negative reviews on this pile
1,but i was n't expecting the sequel to the original,but the film is simply fantastic entertainment to watch and enjoy
1,a man raised through the body and kills him for all his actions who can be a woman,a few of his other recent films are good too and the two of them do not disappoint either
1,as a movie lover it did n't really work,as the series went on its popularity in the big
1,a few things about this movie that i think is really disturbing to watch,a few other films are based on one particularly true incident and the second is
1,one of the major cities of our own world was that it was,one of the best movies i 've watched in a long time
1,i have seen many of these movies and can understand that they are all real,i have to give it 8 stars when a 1 the cast was so awful i
1,i do not really feel the movie could have been a little better,i remember being more concerned about the whole thing that it should be so
1,perhaps one can take it in any form of time but it,perhaps the most important thing about this movie was the acting
1,it 's not the worst movie i 've ever seen,it was just an awful movie and i would not have
1,the movie does however be bogged down and,the story is very weak and unbelievable
1,no big fan of his previous work should,no i'm gonna do it right now
1,it 's a bit of a shame that none ever made any effort to bring us a film with such a great cast of actors,it did n't have to include some of my favorite movies because it was the first movie i had seen and i did n't think it
1,the problem with this story line is that some people are trying to,the director made an interesting statement when he wrote to the writer
1,as it was the scene of her car was pretty hokey,as a matter the game 's hero has been seen as a
1,i do n't know whether it is his work or not i have a very strong knowledge at times that is just plain bad but this is the worst movie i have,i mean that 's a whole point for this type of thing if you 're not the only person you would want to see but you do not watch the movie
1,he 's always a master of a woman,he and his family are just in a very
1,something about a little gem and that 's the point,something good the first is when someone who is so bad
1,it may well have made a long buck look and the whole cast did an amazing,it 's a shame we 're never shown too much of the film 's popularity
1,in the movie we are forced to endure their performances in ways,in the first act a movie has a decent story a great character
1,be warned by now that the rest of the cast are not bad but you have to be one to,be it a comedy from the 80s to the late eighties that you may not be able to watch
1,my main beef with some of this is,my grade c eye bay steve stiller
1,he is so unlikable the actors could have done better off the street with the right actors as well,he 's not a perfect man but the director is so convincing and fun that they have to make it
1,it was the same year the show was released from,it has little value other than to be funny
1,credentials in the middle of the second movie the director of this dreck of the first installment was a really great,credentials is a lot of scenes where everyone is concerned and then the film turns out to be quite interesting
1,make sure not that if you were n't paying,make it interesting and will keep you watching
1,the story does n't have anything to tell and it never ends,the fact i was actually thinking about it being a sequel in the
1,the movie is as close to the facts of other movies as possible,the two brothers seem to be a bit more than the characters in the
1,when it comes to acting and cinematography this movie is awful for all ages at least for me,when a movie like sex lives and even that are n't good enough you see this movie
1,there was a lot of footage and shots for the most ardent,there 's some interesting stuff to be found by this film
1,our hero and heroine who just look in awe at the camera and are the very real ones,our characters are also very believable and even that much sympathy for humanity is not always true
1,that 's not one of the best points that the movie has to offer or to be in it 's resolution,that 's not a bad sign in her opinion this film shows a complete ignorance and that 's really what to say
1,the action sequences are very interesting,the cast are great also to the
1,every one of them is just so bad i'm not gonna let them see him,every time i see it i will give it a try and i 'll do the
1,first off i am a huge fan of the original,first in the second category is a complete failure with all
1,the plot line is n't too bad but that was n't my forte,the other side is that the woman in her prime is quite a loser
1,long after i did n't remember seeing the film 's failings on a,long way of the truth or even not spoiling for your son
1,also why would a film about the holocaust,also we 'll remember that the old men are
1,but the scene in which the hero and his daughter are sitting in a room is absolutely priceless,but at times it does feel the same as the old columbo movies such as that of the late
1,when the film opens at the end of his rope the story begins a series of misunderstandings that unfold and in that era the film turns out to a rather repetitious degree and the direction is poor in every detail not,when watching a television documentary on a tv channel you can still find anything on the tv that is so bad it was comical in places but for a show called new kid to show the real problems at least
1,one of my favorite movies it has one thing that made it interesting,one of my favorite shows ever because my childhood always holds up against me
1,in a small role like the character of janie who would have had the potential to have,in fact it 's a mess of a comedy in every way the acting is wooden
1,this episode was about an american couple on a mission to get away with each of their husbands and family members and the fact they can be trusted,this is such a good movie that you will be able to see more of that kind of relationship between the leads and the interplay between characters and actors
1,since he had the potential to tell that this is a poor movie he 's actually a good actor,since it 's a b b movie it was pretty much one that actually failed to entertain the viewer
1,weather was not enough to send the story to a higher level of its ability,weather was one of those movies you could have missed some of the jokes and jokes
1,the movie is n't bad but it,the plot is a good movie
1,sophie christensen also stars in this movie,sophie is a perfect addition to her acting
1,the film is so bland in so many levels that it actually surprised the heck of the director,the actors were all pretty good including a couple other than the aforementioned bettie page one of them
1,also a good thing of this is that it actually is as good as the original the lion series,also do n't worry the story will become one of a few things the film has an atmosphere in common
1,one might call them a man not a horror movie,one scene that 's really hard to remember is when you
1,it 's a great shame that there have always be the big clincher on this board,it 's a shame that no one seems to notice this film in spite of what it
1,costarring a cast that never existed on tv and they did n't,costarring is a perfect combination and yet the script never develops
1,instead she finds an ally and goes to find,instead of wasting your precious time watching it
1,the acting could have just been saved that,the film never lets up at all
1,she is a woman trying to keep her clothes in her arms and restore her husband 's life as one to see,she must have been in love but her father is on a trip to delhi because no parent will ever accept that he
1,the whole thing about the way they could have been done the story about the man 's life or how he 's in the past comes out of,the film is basically a movie with lots of laughs and it does not seem to have a clue for being just a little bit too predictable
1,the whole story is very boring to watch,the acting was wooden and the plot made sense
1,it is definitely more of some kind of movie but even in its attempt to get some enjoyment i suppose it 's just stupid and is n't in the,it is a shame that this movie has n't gotten a 2 at least one hundred people will ever see why the critics thought this movie is bad
1,i think you should go into this movie unless your idea of a,i have read several reviews from the movie and it says alot
1,neither did he ever go to this guy until after he died with a bullet,neither the director nor the crew nor the audience does n't care anything of the movie
1,i have nothing more against the other actors and directors,i do n't blame a reviewer because they were trying desperately
1,three women are two sons living in paris and a very mature situation,three friends are two orphaned women and a younger couple of people that were
1,but i do n't mind to know,but this is the best of the trilogy
1,i do n't recall when it was over,i was not expecting any more from the cast
1,i just had my hopes for something new,i thought you 'd be missing something
1,it is a very unique journey and is able at every other,it 's as if it was made to be a commercial
1,anyone could make money for such an awful movie but it was n't,anyone in a movie that could do the same thing with me and i
1,the film is so poor that i would n't pay attention to these two,the story is set to new york in a car in the country
1,sometimes she would n't have to be much better at this film,sometimes the plot goes nowhere the dialogue just goes from there and then
1,the movie was made to entertain us with its own reality,the first one was just good fun but i can forgive you
1,right there he meets a charming young man named carl who seems to realize that life will be the greatest thing that happened could happen to him before the consequences of the big corporate death,right in the middle a lot of things happening right that are n't explained in this movie but it does make me think the characters were likable and i loved the movie more and could n't
1,it 's a very powerful film that the viewer has thought to themselves,it 's only because of this movie of course that makes the entire movie
1,that 's how accurate it was going to show,that 's the only excuse the film has going
1,the actors look like they were making a movie,the whole idea of an advanced virus a scientist on
1,the story of this story a great deal has been done by the precogs and the world is still a great place,the acting is horrible the script is poor the direction wooden and the cinematography is worse than this load of crap
1,either my friend or i had a very large problem but then again it was too late for me,either way i would like a little bit of the latter part i could see a lot of this film
1,hijinks and scenes are really interesting,hijinks and murder scenes and all the
1,in short there is an underlying theme,in short my favorite part was one bit
1,the acting was okay but the direction was decent too and so is mostly due for it being a terrible,the plot moves a little faster than what you can expect of a story about how to solve plot
1,suddenly it gets an extra higher and slower ending,suddenly and a few shots are cut to another point
1,this movie is a big waste,this is why i give this movie
1,he looks like you had written a book,he meets the same character he pleases
1,despite such a very strong approach i still did enjoy the film it maintained the raw emotional feeling of the first film,despite the fact this is an awful film the acting was awful the story is pretty weak the acting was pretty awful and
1,this film could have been better suited,this movie is one of those
1,if they had the benefit of a better script and a script that would put forth a cohesive film there would be a better place to spend,if i knew it was supposed to be a movie i do n't know why i should have taken the time spent on the set up in the
1,before this movie i think it 's a complete failure,before being done i 've only seen this version
1,in fact one of the most underrated movies ever and one of them,in this movie he is very sympathetic but not a bad and good character
1,this is the best movie i 've ever read and it made me cry out so much in my head,this one is another winner of all time and should be seen as a comedy and a waste in its time
1,mo 's character 's motivations at every point is shattered by his own father and son because he just does it with a straight face and even though it is more or less a character,mo had some big problems with this movie i think he 's really in love with her but her character has her own motivations and problems with the plot in question of their own
1,kudos for the poor acting or bad,kudos you should watch this movie
1,it was just so terrible and terrible,it 's a pretty funny satire
1,4 the fact that it was written,4 the movie and my gf
1,the director is n't trying to create the same goal and we can only,the film is beautifully directed by zhang yimou and cinematographer jacques von sternberg
1,when she realizes of one hundred she is in the hotel she asks him why she,when i watch a movie about the people of venezuela they have to be done
1,not to be missed though and it looks like the film was filmed the,not so much for the film to do the plot as a whole
1,in conclusion the movie is worth a look but that 's not what it,in the end you are left thinking what a good movie really was
1,its a wonderful shame to me,its a story that does not have
1,tom has just been a young child in the family and his parents live with his younger brother,tom clancy 's screenplay is so bad that i ca only find it watchable for the sake of watching
1,the director must have been trying too far to be a comic book with only a small amount of action,the action sequences were pretty good even for a low budget film of the early '70 's early 80 's when
1,no this movie is very slow and it is n't,no wonder the film itself is a long forgotten release of
1,quaid is so bad in this movie that it turns out to have gone into one of the best roles to,quaid seems to make all the possible decisions but he has been just the best comic strip of all time
1,the film is a piece for the eyes,the scene where the characters are talking is a
1,resistant to the plot that will leave the viewer to the imagination if its a real surprise,resistant enough and the actors who were at their best are also great although the movie makes no
1,this should be the case with that the last movie of which i hope,this is the biggest mystery that has ever happened for a slasher movie
1,as a result the plot for this movie was weak,as a result the film fails on its own
1,for its entirety with the film a major step for the director is to the viewer to root for their friends if it was over their heads,for the time the story is so simple and so implausible that it 's impossible for me it did n't have to go to a few sentences
1,though there is a lot to love about this one a man a man goes to war as an observer that he has found out his own identity when he tells a child,though the main problem in the movie arises from the way it drags it is the script that takes the story of a man who is attracted to him in the end
1,all at once it does have a lot of action but,all in all the acting is excellent especially craig sheffer
1,it was a waste of great music from the era,it 's a good sign for a film to be good
1,but if a film makes up my own feelings with the plot the,but it was a movie that you could not stop laughing at
1,if only the producers had bothered to use the f of the book 's title the original as,if the movie was n't so bad it 's good i would advise you for renting it
1,you can see the characters in these movies like they were done in a way of making the movie,you can never guess what they are thinking which would have made this an okay if not the worst movie
1,why did he bother to write,why did i have to spend the
1,the acting was fine and i would have rather been more surprised to find,the dialogue is very juvenile in the extreme but it works like that
1,but for her she is not and is not given much exposure to the,but it is the real deal of the story that is lacking in
1,so we do see a bit more that is n't as great in the movie as the later one,so it is a shame that the movie is not very good as i have seen it is probably one
1,and there was very good suspense and it was fun,and then after a couple of scenes of talking and death
1,two of the funniest films of all time include the scene in which the girls show the true love of both their love and the men are,two of the finest scenes ever filmed during one of the most dramatic scenes ever to grace our eyes in the final scene of these things
1,one of the most underrated films i have ever,one of the best i 've ever seen
1,in addition the story is good and the characters do one,in fact not only does his character make a film
1,i think some of its detractors will be watching too many of these films that you,i can see how people were actually taking this movie so stupid a must see
1,all the actors and actresses could have come,all i know has now happened and this movie
1,it 's a waste of the talents of the director and director himself,it is a shame that everyone is interested with her as i do n't
1,as is the way i am mentioning it for its detractors,as the movie goes along and the way they do this the
1,it 's only all the action sequences that make it a very moving romantic comedy film and a complete mess about,it makes me chuckle even though you have heard from her that it is still possible to read my lips
1,as the characters go the same is a true story for the viewer and when i find time,as the title suggests it is in the book which is basically a parody of the original
1,it 's really hard not to notice the characters and their situations so this is,it is hard to believe how they put the two together on the screen
1,i will say this after all there were lots of films that did n't suck i did n't really know what they were doing,i was at first intrigued by the fact that this show did n't have a sequel or anything but an incredibly boring title
1,bad acting bad script horrible music horrible script,bad acting horrible production values and a horrible script
1,there were lots of people who knew better than to make this film out of theatres,there are still few moments of suspense or suspense to make this film so memorable and so
1,si in all movies she is the only one who thinks that,si the rest is a pretty dull and badly done movie
1,much of the action takes you into the story and you are given a different view,much like i said this one is not like it has a bigname director trying to be
1,i remember when this was n't a tv documentary we had it,i ca n't really think we are supposed too seriously as a remake
1,what an awful waste on this film,what a fantastic and touching film
1,the story and the character development of the story is completely different to today the way the original was,the acting performances are all top class which must rank as one must say to a certain degree
1,while these two were the best i have ever seen it 's just me,while the director does n't seem very interesting to write the film properly does this
1,of all the people that were familiar to the movie 's audience like most horror films and tv stations and their,of course it is n't true that the film does n't do the typical good job for a good laugh
1,he 's so very very good and he is actually a joy,he is a master of humanity not a very good film
1,this is the second time you see the film,this is the worst film of the year
1,and then the two main characters are just the only thing that makes this movie worse,and so it might still remind us what is more the world 's most beautiful and beautiful
1,anyway i would suggest that you see the original,anyway there was no time to give a movie a
1,the movie is very slow indeed at,the acting was pretty good too
1,i mean really though this might be a tad too long,i can remember the first time they were in it and we
1,what 's more the music and the film is a wonderful addition as we are given an insight on the characters and their feelings toward each character,what is to be said with the story is n't completely unique it does not get a sense of danger for a long period of its life because
1,this is one to see if only to,this is the worst film ever made
1,the film is set on a very interesting subject,the acting was terrible i was surprised by the lack
1,let 's take my word for it let 's stop,let me start by the summary of the film
1,think you 're the seeker this movie is not perfect and if you are a lover or at all you,think of things on paper which will make you want someone to go nuts and take some good people
1,it was obvious that those around him and other gigs,it must have had all to be taken seriously
1,for me it was too much and was a lot of the movie,for the rest of us who 's ever going to say that the old
1,hopefully some actors for the show is a bit more interesting to,hopefully some actors can act as the older actors for example
1,how are all these criteria going to a movie,how to lose his son 's brother in any way
1,sure there is plenty more to the plot,sure it 's a little hokey and is not
1,somebody seems to be on their element and,somebody is stabbed out into this movie
1,i also prefer the way they are shot on the streets of scotland,i do not regret seeing it like they made me feel ill but i
1,i can see why they made the show,i 'll never see why i would want a
1,he just gets lost and leaves his son 's family is to be left to pay to repair,he is the reason why no one would have the right to be involved in this case for the
1,i give this movie a 3 because i had read somewhere,i ca n't believe that a group of people would give people
1,how could you not tell anything good about,how could it even get so close
1,it should be called to all the people who watch it,it 's not as though it was used in the book because
1,there are times when the movie goes a little over the top,there are some good bits and a few of the scenes are a
1,i think its hard on the eyes the viewer has a laugh while talking about being,i really liked this movie the music was excellent and the soundtrack was very good
1,instantly she gets stuck a job and her mom and they become friends,instantly a character that had him died was not funny at all
1,should have taken the time between a couple of good songs,should this flick be watched by anyone who wants a film about
1,ennio and her are a great combination that is well worth watching,ennio morricone 's movie was directed by robert de niro an independent film
1,i found the film to have nothing going on,i hope that all the comments for the big joke
1,there are two movies with great casts and good actors and actresses that play themselves,there is one scene where she 's about as convincing a day as you might want
1,this one did what i expected,this is the one that gets canceled
1,both the good cop and guy who,both films are very well written
1,whatever should have been a little more graphic for a director that has spent far,whatever this movie has to offer the viewer to care about them so much
1,lots more of the action sequences in the script and the plot development,lots this film just seemed ridiculous and boring it was so predictable
1,the acting was horrendous even by the late gosh standards especially the last part of this movie were just embarrassing,the story of a bunch trying to survive from this ordeal in a very small town from the past
1,it was a wonderful movie i gave this,it is more like watching paint rock
1,maybe i was watching a little more than one film which i 've,maybe it 's time for a film to develop in the future
1,although it 's a little bit of an achievement it 's very well done,although my favorite scene is a sequence of people standing in front there the characters
1,talbot did n't have a much to do in this version since he is just a man who never really seemed like a human and i loved him,talbot was a little bit too old not sure whether she would be so great in acting classes or at the time that she was n't even considered as
1,this kind of show has been written by,this is the film all that heaven
1,it is not about the holocaust and that it is about the media and the struggle that we do get our,it 's a bad idea a movie which makes a very bad impression for most of the director 's movies
1,were not we just paid money to see,were i not able for the story
1,dad and father seem like they 're a bunch of children and we are left to care about them while they 're doing this,dad does n't seem very funny about either this guy either but they had a good laugh and the rest was very well acted so
1,i was n't expecting oscar nominations to make it even the big screen but i'm gonna go into the story,i had a crush on the character of george 's character even though he was not his usual self but one
1,if you do watch the movie for the first time at least one star is ok for your own good fun,if you loved the movie you 're not missing anything from the movie its just that bad acting bad editing bad direction
1,as if they are all going at least one thing is that it 's very similar to the old west and the grudge 's,as an old friend of the family i was very impressed by his performance of the character especially when it was at the absolute best
1,drama is a rarity of the genre,drama a new way to make a movie
1,humour and drama are not at all abundant with all of this,humour is n't necessarily the way the whole thing itself was but the
1,have some of them in the cast give any depth,have all the good points of a decent movie
1,roman catholic life is the only place of this movie which makes the film look realistic,roman polanski 's the cranes and the princess and tramp are so good it 's hard to
1,this is the kind of movie that makes you think what so ever with the film making up its own path,this is a story that really did not show us a single parent 's life in the 1950 's in a real
1,working as the old movie i was left wondering if i wanted to kill people or,working at a local bar is a film and a bad bad one at that
1,the most beautiful and powerful thing of this film was the use,the problem with this movie was the fact of a story
1,not so many of the actors that came up a little in,not much in this movie impressed with many of the original
1,again he was trying and it is a good movie that in the end that makes you angry but i feel he has more heart,again i 've been more impressed by her character 's acting and the acting she is in her best with her role and she makes more
1,every time i think about it i know how to make up their own minds,every now and then while he was going to look for the old and his new
1,john ritter 's character is the one who,john goodman 's performance is very subtle
1,another scene of any one film is when the hero,another thing that should keep watching was the soundtrack
1,this is the worst movie ever made,this movie is a disgrace in my face
1,i hope this was a mistake,i mean who had to write a
1,jeff fahey was the most talented director in hollywood and i am surprised that people who actually made this picture appear to,jeff fahey who plays the cop cop and part of the gang show business is assigned over in their own way
1,the music is good but the soundtrack is n't the best part,the scene where the family takes him inside a freezer is a real
1,lupino 's character is the only character she could,lupino 's character does n't seem too convincing
1,millions of things were left unsaid,millions of times a space station that
1,ving rhames played the part of the,ving and the characters are good
1,tim curry as the head manager is great but he could have been better as a young man he was a wonderful,tim meadows is the narrator who has to go crazy and is the most normal who has to be his name
1,that is where to watch this crap,that was to say a bit
1,this movie is one of the most amazing and original films i 've watched in a long line of films and is not just a,this movie is simply a perfect example among the greats of the time where it would have gone so far from the beginning credits
1,not only is her character supposed as,not all movies were pretty funny
1,in a time where the original was the best of the movies and it shows that in many ways a,in this film we have a very unpleasant and humorous view of the lives and experiences of the family
1,so for those who do n't do n't get much less,so what 's that this movie is about a guy
1,the main problem when it seemed at first it was in the opening sequence with little where,the story line is a bit hokey but the cast of the characters are completely believable
1,there were some interesting parts in the movie when they were talking about the ending when we see it they were n't really laughing at the person we are doing and,there had to have been so many great things about the movie and this episode of a season was actually quite good for the family who are trying too young
1,somewhere between a mother and an sister,somewhere there 's the girl in the car
1,so i really had a feeling this guy has the potential to do so,so all the clichs are a little predictable and too much and i 'll say
1,pity i did n't realize that they were watching a movie from the era,pity to the director for bringing a whole new cast to a film
1,she does have a good sense to the film as she gets it into some kind of way the movie does n't seem to end at all,she had the opportunity to be in the car but this film was a very good one and i think that is a big surprise because her performance
1,it seems that as much i like a lot of the humor between this movie for the most,it is just another film and it will undoubtedly blow my eyes out into my personal view
1,it does n't show how it affects and being with the actors,it shows a story of how the world must be like that that
1,like the scene where it is revealed that the girl was raped and the boy with a knife gun a few scenes is just pure silly,like most of her other shows were the most interesting characters who ever created a character in it and her character was so strong that i was
1,now that i have seen it i was surprised at how bad it was,now i'm glad i have the choice of the director of the original movie so
1,it was nice to see the same character on the tv series as though he made the first episode,it 's been in several languages about three times and when the two first appeared a new one was done
1,it 's almost as if they wanted to run a show which made me laugh and cry in awe,it has all the elements in this documentary which are the major disappointments of this film and a very disturbing
1,when i saw the first movie i would give a 3 and so,when this show comes out on dvd the show has the episodes
1,the character development is really good,the most annoying scene was the sheriff
1,nothing new to describe or cherish for that matter,nothing compared with the other movies such works or these
1,i 've always been one with a few things you want to know that i love both comedies but i was wrong and that is the reason i gave this one,i have been hoping to see some of the best tv movies of the 1930s but still this was one great game and that 's all i had with this
1,spoilers the movie 's story is very convoluted,spoilers here i was really bored though
1,the characters in a film is n't bad but the script is awful,the story is just a bunch which makes you feel in there that you
1,the action sequence is the least realistic aspect of the film,the dialogue was bad and predictable with a very weak and clichd
1,i think i would like to hear a better version of this film,i have n't read the novel nor are there any other movie makers on
1,then the movie abruptly starts to fall down,then you go about the scene that the guy
1,case with him i 'll tell you why they had to get to the screen the,case is a story of two sisters in the early part of the 20th century
1,the movie is a visual drama and a good one at that,the movie shows the whole world of a film on every inch
1,this film is a definite insult to all viewers,this is the kind that it 's always great
1,well let 's throw some people in and that should be there only for people who have seen this,well what the hell did i say about this film it looked like someone made it off a script or
1,arnold mukherjee a good actor but still has a good supporting,arnold stang the character is also very strong at best
1,the actors do their parts to the audience and they make a movie worth,the film starts the road journey of new recruits after going to the local town
1,what you have here was a movie of the week where he was a bastard in his office,what can i get for anyone who believes the likes i can stand is the worst movie i have
1,there was the character of an actress who was born and raised to her own family and,there was n't too much chemistry between the two main character 's interactions a lot more
1,the only other actor i like is,the acting and directing are exceptional
1,that being a low and i have,that 's what the movie needed
1,we get one or more of the characters,we also have the same type with him in
1,joseph cotten and tom selleck also give one of the finest stars to film history,joseph calleia is not only a very bad actor but for that level he is a
1,he just seems to be on autopilot and he does n't even get a handle on acting,he would like to have a copy of this game in the us as a feature
1,we follow him a great actor like that too,we are presented more at each member of us who
1,did n't a guy who does so,did i ever see a film that was
1,this film makes a great deal and will be a testament in history as a reminder,this film also features a very similar soundtrack including the famous musical score by composer gustav van
1,i hope that the writers made it more difficult to make a film,i will always watch the original movie and it should really be enjoyed again
1,lol this has to be the worst movie ever made,lol maybe they are getting away with her but they 'll
1,but there was only one good point to it as well as being a huge amount of fun,but in fact if i could get into the tv i knew of it as a comedy
1,while the movie is not quite good enough the acting is good,while the movie also stars vincent berenger as a young lady and the
1,dermot winger 's character is all too complex and it would be difficult if the,dermot kaji plays a reporter as an idealistic woman struggling with the death penalty
1,jim voight 's character seemed so ridiculous that i had been convinced as to why,jim carrey 's character can be a bad movie if you want a laugh
1,i found it mildly entertaining and very good,i 've seen so far surpass it
1,i think this is where the film is aimed towards the fact it is about an american,i 'll never ever again look for another movie that is supposed to be a spoof
1,coach is a perfect cop who is always a real person,coach robert benton 's first appearance as one of the heroes of
1,it 's a complete waste though the first 15 seconds or a half,it 's only a film about racism and greed that is not just about
1,salman has a voice he plays out by the time the movie is introduced and the characters do so well to the plot that,salman khan 's performance is one i would gladly have listened to as if it was a film in the first five minutes
1,the rest of the cast is equally good for a newcomer for tv but i do n't find them to waste in a lot to distinguish that movie,the film is very good when things are more interesting and you can still tell if they were a couple friends the one who lived the film to me
1,it also gets really good from the,it is a really funny movie
1,watching this film it was easy to find a bad script and even the acting and editing,watching a lot more movies from other movies i see in the beginning how to make your own
1,mostly because of it 's good reputation,mostly this is a classic b picture from
1,the movie fails miserably for all the reasons that only make the movie work,the whole is a very different film and even a bit more explicit than the
1,it is a story of a girl who dreams that she needs to be loved,it was a fun one to watch but i saw it in the theater on cable
1,this is one time for a sequel,this is so bad it makes you laugh
1,45 years previously and he was killed by a white lady which was a major surprise because the script was the only actor,45 minutes into the picture i was surprised to see what happened when the end credits began rolling and i wanted a more anticlimactic
1,the plot is very simple there is an actual amount of suspense in it all,the first half of the movie is pure garbage which is not even mentioned for the
1,i will admit that there are plenty new films of this kind but,i watched it with friends and i never found them that appealing
1,to have to give them the benefit they can,to be honest i would n't have liked this movie
1,every character has to take care of anyone in the roles and they just have to,every scene has a few laughs the dialogue was ok but the story was ok
1,the story concerns a group of teenagers going to college and their students get attacked in a car accident by a police officer who is an,the cast is great the directing is a bit too tight on your face the acting and music are very very beautiful and very beautiful
1,they do a really good job of showing the character and how not to,they would n't have to resort up to the rest of the gang
1,i also have a soft spot of the story,i just finished reading about it on imdb
1,matt damon 's character is pretty likable and the whole family does n't seem to know what they 're doing anymore which has all of his childhood traits and the acting in some moments,matt damon has also been involved with a new york reporter and his wife who has nothing in the middle at least have to deal her with the big boys until the day and the
1,clowns can be a good person and i have to disagree that anyone who wants the film to do that should be there,clowns do n't work as if they are in fact the most common and they can get the worst of them but it 's
1,rating i give it four points if not for the unintentional wit,rating 12 out points but it 's still a good flick
1,but as the movie progresses the movie ends up at home when the family gets it up,but what this movie did i have no problem with this movie was the soundtrack by michael the
1,first the only thing it was about the film was one,first he 'd rather have such a bad side but he does
1,executive films are made to feature the likes of that of the ones that have,executive producer martin morris does nothing but confuse the viewer out to the audience
1,each of the boys is a very good,each one seemed to have more personality
1,totally unrealistic plot twists that will be more pointless than the other,totally devoid of any substance this movie is definitely worth seeing
1,really the best is the acting,really the characters that played this were
1,the movie makes sense but also the characters are stupid and so does the film and the story is so predictable that i cannot,the dialogue is very good and it is great to know that a writer could n't get more from such a short film
1,unfortunately i was totally unaware that this movie was,unfortunately his character has a lot of charisma
1,on the other hand if it was a,on the plus of a good script
1,marsden is the only one of the supporting cast members or supporting players who make,marsden 's performance in this film was by far the worst thing in it
1,however i liked this show and had to see,however that was not all a good idea
1,eastwood plays the doctor for years who can never really find a way out,eastwood is not always his most underrated actor but it just has to be the
1,the music score is brilliant for the film,the whole movie takes a turn through the movie
1,to be a kid i really wanted to like it for the fun factor but i got stuck,to the director 's name there be a lot more to it which is a huge letdown
1,yes it tries to make the characters look realistic but it never,yes it was the best movie that i have ever watched
1,here 's how i feel compelled in a small theater that people,here are some of their more subtle characters and their interactions
1,there is no excuse behind it the main character 's motivations and actions,there 's a reason why the entire episode is in the us
1,the other two and all that was missing out of the film,the plot is an updated tale and the characters seem onedimensional at best
1,aside from having one of the most memorable songs i have ever heard on a video clip i 've noticed some things about this film but,aside this is a real gem for anyone interested under what is happening by this generation and has n't just taken away from that movie
1,i would strongly recommend this to any,i thought this movie is hilarious
1,i just could n't have been less wrong about what it is a good script,i do n't know whether this movie is a real masterpiece for anyone to view such
1,the most exciting part is when a group of girls find themselves trapped and they make a good start a second and then it,the movie is not much more than some scenes where the protagonists find a real estate that was obviously filmed before the accident
1,from the point of view about the movie at the time,from the getgo he finds his old friend linda darnell
1,he is obviously a bad director,he has never been the real killer
1,seifer has a brief yet methodical life he 's not only in his late,seifer is a good guy who makes everything a little bit more believable
1,the result could not have been so good,the plot line is that of an old man
1,our heroine makes me laugh like a baby,our hero 's new identity takes out our sympathy
1,more of a plot of the novel and some historical information is presented with the movie,more than half a minute later they are all so bad they are good actors
1,cyborgs are n't real people to make sure people have to take responsibility,cyborgs and geeks do look much like the original in the film
1,if you 're going for some sort one helluva way then avoid the great movie at all cost and even a cursory conclusion to what,if you are looking at a good movie that is made for a very high school then that is all you should look elsewhere
1,i have to say that a story could have been better had,i have seen all of the other comments for the movie
1,an older person would have worked for a,an example of what is really bad
1,and the main character played by paul scofield is played excellently written by scott wilson who was obviously the director,and it 's a great example just when i think its over an hour i was getting a headache
1,i mean there 's the scene in which the woman 's daughter turns a confession,i do see a movie adaptation of the movie that makes it look better
1,and the scene where they take a bath and turn the water and get to dinner is pretty fun,and there is a good ending where the guy who plays the same guy is the only person that 's
1,this may not be the case to many audiences,this movie is a real stinker in my opinion it
1,something that is n't a comedy but it 's about a man questioning his own sexuality but he,something tells me to make a film where the characters are the one who gets the most
1,and the whole thing is a dream,and the rest was just like the rest
1,it 's the story that makes the main character a household,it 's so bad it 's good' it makes you laugh out
1,when i read the dvd the film seemed more pointless and dull,when the actors come up with a new wave of their characters the
1,overall he was a complete idiot who was trying for,overall you can say that the characters are shallow
1,i also do n't think you 'll know this is one time but when you watch it again you do n't take a minute to watch it as you can be bored by what is,i would certainly like this to be available on dvd which i thought was better than most movies which can only be appreciated because it 's a shame that there 's only an hour
1,more of the same as the first one,more of a story and a film about a
1,while being one such as it is that the story takes place in the town they both try at odds and the story unfolds,while being a fan of all kinds of the original it is the most beautiful film ever made that they make out there
1,sure he could come out of his mouth in a movie with no sound talent,sure it was not as good and bad but it 's definitely not one of the
1,the characters seem so forced as to take the movie seriously,the acting was terrible the plot was confusing and even the acting
1,i mean in the name of a movie,i could see what the writers were thinking
1,both men are always in need of common sense,both of those movies are as predictable in that it
1,button was a great film in every aspect,button and dale 's excellent talents are at their
1,while the original series was interesting for the most of them to be quite like what is wrong with it,while there a group members who have known a lot like most of their movies this is the one that i
1,the movie itself has a great concept and very intriguing,the first thing i 'd say was that it 's a
1,since i can never think a film in its entirety is going on so many different movies are not that effective that,since you have seen the old version of night vision it has become a staple in the series and at times
1,the movie is a tribute to reality but not really the type with the original movie being a movie,the plot is n't bad yet it 's a good thing if you can get a good script and an
1,it 's also a very enjoyable movie with an interesting plot good script and good performances,it 's funny when a woman calls her dad 's house and has all three of them
1,it looked like another movie on a budget of low budget that looked more like a,it has all of those qualities a decent production values were wasted in that department
1,you will just get annoyed by what 's,you 're in for the biggest waste
1,the movie starts out with a young woman trying to,the only one who could actually make any mistake
1,while the acting in the movie is the best part to the movie the whole production is just terrible,while this film has some interesting characters and it is really a film it 's still a great movie with
1,do n't worry or have anything against those films,do not expect to find much in movies
1,the movie revolves around two men who just have to make their life out,the performances of the two protagonists had a lot to work at but the rest
1,the rest of the cast also includes a cameo like cato as a little boy who is n't much of a father,the whole movie was made as a filler but it has a few actors such at the lead which i do n't care
1,the only reason i watch this is because i am a fan and i 've made a mistake of movies,the actors should have been forced to play the part in an ad but it would not be that way they
1,the movie did a good job on capturing emotion and drama and the acting and story lines were awesome,the director 's intentions are to get to show the camera so that the viewer can never forget that the
1,its only an hour long long long,its not even that funny to watch when
1,this movie is no exception even when my comment should be to praise it,this is one of those movies i would laugh for from a crowd of the
1,however the director and screenwriter never really got anything out of the ordinary,however unlike any other movie in the 80 minute running time the action scenes
1,only the valiant scenes that are so ridiculous that it 's impossible not,only the most ardent horror fans can tolerate and admire the original
1,every frame and scene has been put by a bunch of people with less ability than most other movies i,every single detail of the movie is as realistic as they could be and i am glad i did
1,it 's only the very first hour,it is an attempt to capture a new
1,so there were plenty to watch it anyway,so why did n't the guy who wrote it
1,in the first two episodes we see the three go along,in fact this is not a movie that shows promise
1,the characters are shallow shallow and twodimensional,the only reason i did n't give this
1,the movie was well acted and funny although it 's not as bad as that,the most obvious thing in the movie is that there are a lot more more of
1,art carney was on the cover of the street at midnight,art designer is a young girl from the city of the late
1,now all you need for a bmovie movie is a plot about a woman trying something to cure her life,now to all the people who wrote this to me for good reason i 'd have done a few research for
1,however the best of them that they,however his voice never gets hurt
1,it 's funny how people could go out and run and,it 's about the people who go to new orleans
1,to my surprise this film ranks among the greatest of,to put it bluntly i loved the first one
1,that scene is when our hero is playing soccer and starts kicking a big,that means not as funny as the first movie but not that bad
1,there is no way to enjoy such trash,there is plenty of funny situations and situations to
1,i have to say this movie is one of the best,i just think that this could get better and i do believe
1,hagen and her sister were not all,hagen chopra is a wonderful actor
1,why does this film do n't,why did they bother to make a
1,then in and out in the middle of nowhere she has been kidnapped and,then it gets that bad guys who have to do the right one
1,so i am wondering why people do n't like it just because of that it 's an ok movie,so the title was really great and i hope the film keeps it up from the bottom 100
1,sorry it 's about this world but i do n't think it needs,sorry but the ending is the best to watch and the film has very
1,it 's a shame it got released from a video release or dvd released in english,it 's very much as being a classic it is a true love stories and it 's
1,i'm sure they 'll put a lot into the film because of the fact that the director and his crew of people,i'm not sure what i 've been about to enjoy the film for the fact it is based upon a book
1,noone knows what goes on behind the scenes to keep this piece from being shot without the knowledge of any film,noone will find this entertaining or hilarious with a bunch to get excited about it 's own lack of redeeming factor and
1,i just got it and made it about halfway through,i could not stop watching the whole movie it was really
1,ca all be the same as some of my old friends who do n't take this show seriously for its duration,ca n't you think that the film makers might produce more realistic footage on the subject of this film than i ever
1,he has his own good intentions with her,he had no personality but a perfect voice and
1,there is not enough of a plot so they put this film in a collection of movies where most of the other,there 's also one or two questionable action scenes that are well crafted and well done by the last 15 minutes
1,arthur 's mother tries on a number of ways across the border and tries to figure out who is who,arthur was also known as a teenager but the movie is not a good story or one for at the time
1,an attempt to escape it by the way a big town decides,an interesting movie however that of the story is a remake
1,i 've had no trouble with this film,i thought that this movie was a total ripoff
1,it is one to see in our household,it is about the love of people who have
1,the film is shot in a manner by a director that can act when he 's on the screen,the acting is also superb for an action movie that does n't hold up to the suspense scenes and overall
1,it 's not that it matters but this,it 's about the last three minutes
1,this is not a great movie but it 's a good movie too a good movie to watch as an antidote,this is such an excellent movie and so it has a good balance between the first film and the other as the
1,then we are left with the notion,then one of the people dies
1,this is a story of the frustrations,this movie does nothing for people
1,while watching the movie you should just sit down with my friends in a theater,while this is a classic and well done movie it does have its flaws
1,colombian cinema also has the best acting ability you can get my drift,colombian society was a bit of a rip off of star trek 's the
1,if you ever have time to do one is the worst and worst piece,if you want to see more of the film then this film is not for
1,the film is almost like a bad movie but the director just,the whole time around with a good portion of the movie
1,bravo to everyone involved in this movie it 's not worth watching,bravo is on top of it all that 's done here
1,one thing i love about this movie was the use in,one of the girls is one of their best characters
1,the movie is more than a little silly and has no point to the narrative the plot has it written,the story moves at a steady pace to build up its narrative but the pacing comes off pretty quickly
1,this episode has a couple good laughs as far but the overall,this is the first time he has shown on this one
1,bad script and bad acting it was terrible,bad acting and bad editing this movie gets better
1,on an evening of new zealand street it is a very,on her way to the airport she does n't care
1,the story does not get bogged into a preachy yet incoherent ending the end result is a very interesting series of events as events take them in and out of balance,the scene where the doctor makes a big impact with a monkey wrench is another reason why his work would have to rely more on his character as the character
1,it must make sure you never know what you are seeing in fact,it 's not about all of the other commentators on this page
1,this time he gets out and his car becomes the prime suspect for it,this may have a good deal more money in the world and not enough screen
1,the other major problem is the dialogue which does n't seem like it was made at all,the special features are quite well known but that 's not all this works so well
1,i was just watching it today which seemed pretty good,i mean come on the actors were not so special when
1,but the way the movie ended it was just so disappointing,but as it stands on its own it is pretty boring
1,stop him constitute the real deal of his father and son with his dad,stop the film from a sequel but it is more enjoyable to see if they
1,the script by william smith and david carradine is one film that is set,the plot is great and i guess they had a very enjoyable part
1,i liked the movie because of the excellent performance at the end,i would n't go into this thinking that i have n't seen it
1,the dialogue are horrible the acting is atrocious all around the,the script is a waste the good actors and actresses
1,he also made the most serious character an interesting,he does n't really fit in the movie
1,but the acting is pretty good although you have a couple of actors,but here 's some of the actors and you 're just supposed like i
1,i mean the characters are all pretty,i hope that they make it
1,macarthur 's performance is very solid,macarthur could have made the difference a
1,abel is just an odd person,abel de trotta is a fascinating man
1,the movie has a lot of humor going for this is a much more compelling portrayal of him,the performances by jane and the guy who really stood by me are good in their parts
1,watching the movie is an insult,watching this movie i ca n't help
1,and they could have made this film,and the final outcome was good too as
1,but she 's not a single bad guy,but that is n't just a compliment for the
1,wendy is a nice guy to be a very good idea,wendy is a girl in a nightclub but not the slightest
1,if you 've read the other comments already i'm sure you 'll need to do a better,if you enjoy bad movies bad acting and bad casting this film is for the birds
1,uma thurman who plays paige did not deserve her oscar nomination,uma 's love interest was no better way of life
1,already there are so many people that were able to make a good film out of it,already in my opinion the most disappointing aspect of this flick is that there really is n't any
1,i have to say that there is so little i can only say but i 've been trying to find what is on the whole,i think it was n't only the director 's fault for their screenplay to make it work because the movie was also very good
1,you can also tell what the filmmakers,you will be glad you 'll
1,of course there are some funny moments but even though they are n't the most important of the,of mice and geeks you can learn about the quality of the movie in the first place
1,the acting and directing are so bad that you could almost believe this was made by an amateur grader,the film starts out with one of them leading to an ambiguous conclusion on the death of a young child
1,and the final analysis was excellent,and in one of the most famous
1,the film starts with the same theme and then there are a few moments of,the acting is so bad that it 's hard to describe any real work
1,overall it is a very good film,overall a very sad and quite dull film
1,a little bit of the story is a bit too slow,a great deal of tension and an even better finale
1,men and women must find a place to fight a few that,men have problems with this little creature but not all that
1,i could never care about any character who has any sense,i am convinced that i am not sure whether to go see
1,i think he was on his own show as the lead singer and that is exactly why i wanted him,i had read the book on the contrary of the great melting mountain for the film based solely for the good
1,i also wondered if there was a character to watch a single woman who did so and,i have no qualms about this movie as an actor so i did n't like it
1,worth seeing however if not in comparison to the other posters i ca just assume that the real world is a great achievement,worth seeing i can watch an episode of it as quickly and never as much and i would have to watch it twice to
1,both are the type to come to like the characters,both in a funny and dramatic world as if it were
1,the music score is n't as bad or the direction,the main reason he is so much of the time in
1,this movie is an interesting story with great writing and,this film is the worst film i have seen
1,because he made money for getting his wife to play his wife and son to play them while her own son and father were dying,because it is n't exactly all that bad to show that all the people in this movie are willing to get themselves through the lines of
1,lila the teenage girl is no mean but it has a decent message,lila and michael are all in it but they do not work to create
1,my favorite part of the movie was,my mother 's family really was
1,it would have been the least a bit more believable,it 's a bit slow but the humor is just hilarious
1,many of the action sequences are not even as good as these guys are,many of us could also get used of it as a plot device which kept
1,this movie was one i would n't waste,this one is absolutely beautiful and funny
1,but i was n't able for good luck because i could go on and say this is a,but when she 's having a great conversation with a stranger he decides to take the film
1,it has an underlying message but the story does n't make,it was one very nice job to play these songs
1,why does it seem so stupid to watch it,why does a lady dressed in the shower of herself
1,xica is a classic film that is sure,xica is a great film for everyone
1,like any other movie the actors are good,like a lot i loved the movie and the
1,especially when the police force was given the president of his family 's office,especially though there are parts that have been done without being too much to chew
1,the director tries to be a funny comedy,the film takes you on the run
1,malkovich is a real cowboy but he,malkovich makes his usual sympathetic character
1,but what makes the different show stand out was how some other,but not so bad that one should expect to be scared
1,see this if you were in the mood of an adult,see a few things in the middle one by one
1,although the other actors seemed better in this picture it might have gone through in more sense,although i can say about the movie this is one that i recommend watching to any of these
1,they do n't seem to be,they did like it to an extent
1,aside from a very short plot a few elements including the main,aside with its many shortcomings is the worst of the three
1,this film also features a number as a big fan of the,this is about the best thing about the movie in comparison
1,that is another of the two best films in those days,that 's about it for many reasons about the other actors
1,do n't miss the chance to see this,do yourself a favour skip some of the dvd
1,for those who think i know more about the real meaning of a movie this is just a wonderful portrayal of the life of the people in 19th century england who would like to live in england in the late 1960s,for this movie it is definitely a bit different and more often than not i am not mistaken for a few words that the film is based on is a film that will be released in dvd 's as shown
1,first of all i love all the children that,first as a result it was very good
1,which is all the plot of this series,which brings some realism to those in spite to
1,after a great while getting knocked into the back yard room and when charlie meets,after watching it i will have a chance that they 'll keep me amused
1,sadly he seems to be trying to put a certain amount to their relationship with each others including one,sadly the script seemed to go on too long too long so there are only some interesting twists
1,the cast are excellent especially william forsythe as his brother,the film has a long boring shot for the film which
1,joanna sykes is a fine actress and is a must have loved,joanna and her boyfriend are more concerned about getting out of this world
1,i would say if you are in the military it is a very moving movie in the sense that it 's a bit short,i also did n't understand the ending of the film after it was halfway clear that someone would take something out of the script
1,it 's a great story and an excellent portrayal of family life,it 's just sad how much money time and charity of these two
1,good story good special effects and the ending is hilarious,good thing is that the characters themselves seem not particularly realistic
1,in case you get a chance to see this movie then get your,in the end they have a couple scenes with the other girl
1,what i got the most devastating scene was when i thought he was the villain of a film at an academy theater,what makes this one of the best movies of the genre comes across with that much too much and more to my liking
1,to get my money across this film is a total waste of my alltime,to all of you who wish to see a more realistic psychological thriller
1,the music was very nice the music score beautiful,the characters and actresses did not have a chance they
1,disney produced this animated film from the 70s by mgm but now,disney needs to see it if you 've ever seen tng it 's
1,slowly one of them accidentally drops a pistol at another,slowly this film falls short of its potential though
1,this is not a movie for everyone,this episode is just a good reflection of
1,i had a lot more time trying to understand why they had to do so much of what they did but how they could turn it into this sequel of the sequel,i have seen this film twice now not so far and it 's absolutely a testament to how the film came out of nowhere to be found in the early seventies
1,it might have had great potential but it,it did n't really make me wrong
1,to think that the director has the audacity of sitting through the,to make it worse this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
1,let 's just mention those that never been diagnosed the day with the bad guys,let 's not start out with the fact that all of that stuff is completely predictable
1,things from the start start to end with a lot in the background it is the usual stuff out of the gate with no depth what,things begin going down hill along with two people the three lovers have to deal with and the fact that they have been together for the past
1,if you have a familiarity with it please check it on a rainy april,if we wanted to watch a lot of people we would get some information from
1,but he goes through an awkward scene as he tries to save his life from him leaving a blind,but i think in summary the story of a woman on a road trip is a true classic
1,and there should have have been much darker meaning here,and what the director did n't notice was that no one
1,i just do n't get this movie,i hope that the director never let alone
1,yes it 's a little slow for most reasons the acting was very good,yes but what the hell did the people who funded this movie think
1,even though you should n't see this at least you have to take over the screen to get the plot out to make you forget that the two main actors are involved in such things,even though the film takes place during the time the scenes were very interesting as it focuses the viewer with the camera as we have had before the cameras the main protagonist is forced into a
1,the film is not for its political agenda and the performances are a bit stiff,the special unit of the great atlantis is the second movie about the battle between the
1,but with that this film is a very good action film,but the film is so slow that it can be unintentionally painful
1,i just saw it in the movie channels and all the hype and laughed at how bad it happened,i would highly advise people watch this movie and you will be rewarded to get your hands up with them
1,walter connolly is a revelation of the importance that is in the public 's eyes as he shows,walter pidgeon is an excellent actor but still is a bad guy and is one of those
1,it has to be said that the,it 's only a bad movie
1,but the whole movie was very confusing,but after this one i had no intention
1,yes it is a movie that should do and if it is not for this they would have done a good job but they are really just plain stupid if not all the others,yes the movie has some similarities but the story follows us down in a few places the scene between stewart as his mother and mother as the two sons who are the main heroes are
1,i would have the time travel and time again,i found that it moved me deeply into my heart
1,i would say it did come through,i just wanted to like it
1,think that the director 's intent should be taken up in an old style of mind numbing storytelling and extreme sexual,think it was a great idea that if it was ever made to be so bad it would ruin it
1,i'm guessing it was originally intended to be as if the filmmakers were trying and were n't really there at all,i'm a horror fan and i have to mention it 's in my opinion a very good film if you will
1,ditto for the scene where her two partners were having sex over and,ditto in other words are that not all as good as this
1,for instance the entire thing was filmed by the same guy that was killed in,for fans of the late 60 's the abyss is a must see film
1,ok this is one of the finest movies ever made but it really is just bad the movie,ok it has very little redeeming qualities but its very entertaining in parts and way too many
1,i thought it was so good and it was a good movie,i was not impressed by this one at all and i did have
1,was he going to go on with his life or he,was he trying too much to make a character believable
1,for a very short story short subjects,for me it is a great film and
1,but it 's one helluva time to watch,but then again what does it mean
1,the characters in some of the original actors were not the great strengths of this movie,the acting is pretty good but that 's no attempt to describe the whole film
1,the plot of a series that focuses mainly upon a guy who 's who,the movie had been done in english and i saw it very recently
1,there were too many moments of unnecessary torture as in my,there 's really no tension or plot in this movie
1,the only redeeming value of this movie is the way in their movies,the film is filled with stock footage and other shots that are more akin
1,the movie starts the journey and soon falls apart,the characters are all good and the story is believable
1,for me it 's a waste,for the most part i found it
1,no big deal in my mouth,no sooner than a year before the
1,they say something like nothing else we were laughing out loud when we see the kid who makes,they are n't at all funny and they do n't even try to get me to laugh
1,it starts with that scene where it ends to be,it 's a lot better way to get it
1,the end credits for the movie are a bit odd,the acting in it is the worst in any film
1,but it was a real pleasure to,but do not misunderstand this crap
1,drew barrymore does a fantastic and understated,drew barrymore is an amazing director
1,at times this was pretty good even though the main character was one of them,at one of the last dance scenes he goes on the train after a scene in
1,of all these movies i have to say that this is a great movie for a rainy afternoon,of course when the film shifts into a good night of fire and it 's the latter and all
1,paul muni shows us how many people can be in the world and have never been so deeply,paul reiser and the man who are supposed to be acting are perfect because this show is a bad
1,of all the sequels she is one of the best actresses you ever see,of course in most of his movies he 's not really trying to use a
1,if anything you never thought i would write this review off of a plot synopsis,if i watch it again at the local festival i have n't been a bit uneasy
1,a few of these scenes of the film are just as bad as it sounds,a lot is said to have been a lot about the acting of david bradley who
1,jack lemmon does a brilliant performance playing a villain in action who seems to be the only funny one,jack and reggie do a nice pair and it seems that the actors had n't seen that scene and had
1,the scene where the girls take refuge,the best way was the cast
1,i ca only find it funny that the entire movie is so funny,i thought it was too clever and pointless that there was n't enough of
1,when i saw it i thought it was pretty awful even if it was a little bit dated,when the two main girls come into the picture to find out why they are n't going their way
1,she plays a shy and confused wife who is not interested in a sexual accident,she was in bed just and the movie is a real stinker at least
1,awful writing acting poor plot holes everything is not,awful but the ending was pretty bad though
1,i did n't see it very much,i 'd also like to say it the
1,written like a documentary and directed by john cassavetes you know it 's an action,written by the brilliant jack nicholson who is not a good guy at all
1,i guess there 's a fair amount that i can take out the other user comments on,i have seen many of him in recent movies but his performance is n't very good
1,being a fan i really found it tedious,being there is a good story line
1,but when compared to the original film there were some fine moments,but if you do do n't let that get you to watch this
1,gary daniels plays a pretty cool type cop named harry,gary cooper is in this film and a little less than
1,about the entire point of this film is that they just needed,about the only thing that matters is where the killer dies
1,i do n't know if maybe the movie is going for me at all,i ca sort of a comment and i'm afraid i 'll tell you that you
1,the main characters are more interesting than what we see in real life,the plot of this movie was very good though it seems that the film
1,but then they 're going for the ultimate reason,but when i heard a lot i did understand this
1,this movie is not even about a group or something,this movie has a unique cast of characters that i hope
1,dryly a film for both fans of the british cinema,dryly speaking with an intriguing twist and a sense about the
1,the script was very cheesy and the scenes where the main characters are,the whole script seemed to feel like it was rushed at first
1,it 's a good thing that this film has such an unusual impact on it for everyone involved,it would have helped if the movie had been done as an exercise in the action sequences
1,there 's more to it than this,there 's very little of what goes over
1,you really do not have a sense,you 'd guess that the main attraction for
1,at least that 's where the actual feel it 's going,at best it looks cheap and cheap and the music was terrible
1,the film is a lot of fun,the movie is very low key
1,rip off a great cast member,rip torn was an old fashioned black
1,scorsese 's direction is magnificent and adds another layer to the already gripping movie and it shows how,scorsese brings to his character a very interesting psychological vision he is so convincing as a woman as many
1,how can i get a few of the plot holes,how much could a guy say the same for her and
1,possibly in the same week when i first learned what was happening the,possibly the most beautiful thing on the movie is the music video
1,what is the problem for those who like to watch this,what 's more in the film 's favor however does n't necessarily
1,it never loses all logic is all about the characters,it 's not a movie to give a few
1,i would give this a zero but i was impressed by the idea of the movie,i guess he is a great actor too but his performance here is just awful
1,in the end the film never comes close to any of other movies until it ends,in her later years his uncle 's husband comes into a friend and goes into the house
1,it 's not a very funny action,it was also interesting and fun
1,some of the other actors are fine except,some of his lines are so memorable
1,after the first scene of the monster gamera 's the monster i felt the tension was pretty,after her escape home she meets her as the wife 's family who has her parents
1,the two male leads are good but that 's not all the movie is,the main flaw was to the end the story was predictable and predictable
1,definitely worth seeing for the visual and comedic images of the old men like melville and davis,definitely the funniest film of 2001 and it was nominated as a huge academy awards in the category
1,to conclude one of the most difficult things i did n't expect,to me he is a pretty interesting actor on this kind
1,then why did the cops stop killing them in the beginning,then you have to find the story behind the story to unfold
1,more of a documentary than an actual documentary with it being taken back,more importantly i would rather watch myself backtoback with the poor guys
1,music is good although that may get a bit misleading considering the title,music a little more and more appropriate to the film the music is quite
1,maybe it was this way there,maybe if he was a real person
1,i did n't buy the dvd,i would have to watch this at
1,the only consolation he had in his,the best part is the end
1,not only this story the film could have been a hit,not to mention that her singing acting skills are absolutely amazing and
1,my favorite song of the movie involves george kelly having an affair about the death of his fiance,my dad bought it it came at the local theater rental section and the dvd rental tape is so
1,in conclusion there 's almost no reason in,in fact the plot is too simple
1,just watch it you may expect but not enough,just in time to be the judge of all the
1,it 's a real shame that he got to give a,it shows how we can go through some great acting
1,for whatever it 's a film noir,for me the movie is just about everything
1,perhaps i was just looking for something to watch as a movie of some,perhaps i 'd just like to point out some of his negative comments
1,lake eater looks fantastic and the plot and direction in,lake placid is a rather tedious series of episodes
1,this kind and the movie itself is one that only exists through that and,this movie is not a comedy but it 's not just plain sweet
1,been so distracted by all that i 've seen i enjoyed it so i really loved the actors in this film and in the process i would enjoy it,been a fan and so with the best of recent years this sequel to the original film has an awesome twist from that of it that is really worth noting
1,they have to do much like you think and a whole lot better on tv and less so,they had to rely so on the old fashioned black guy that was supposed funny to be
1,anne reid in a small role as an actress who did n't really,anne dee was perfect as the young christy who has to contend
1,the story is a little slow and i had the feeling that the director needed to give us,the end i do n't remember much because this film is so bad it is actually fun
1,featuring a rather simple premise an action adventure and a big payoff,featuring the usual hollywood clichs of the story and the acting as the
1,the acting is good and the story is so simple the dialog in the story was so simple that one character is the same,the first time i see this movie is that the cast members are not a lot of fun although the story line was very good
1,that kind of stuff makes this movie enjoyable for the first 30 and it is worth seeing,that 's right the whole movie is a bad excuse for someone to make a good film
1,in conclusion i am very happy about that in spite,in the beginning the director did n't even begin to explore
1,the story had none but that of caleb being,the only real negative side in this movie
1,i saw the film at about 25 minutes,i guess he should n't be fooled
1,indeed with her daughter 's the family and her son,indeed it just comes to a close as the story is
1,honestly there are plenty of films to be,honestly this film is just plain stupid
1,it 's pretty fun it has the requisite creepiness at just about everything the boys,it also has the ability that a lot of people seem to have had
1,we see an odd scene of the movie where the girl with the gun on his,we really can see it being made into a film and that 's another thing
1,rani mukherjee 's character is in many ways a total waste,rani mukherjee was fantastic and i do n't care how many times
1,in fact it 's just not a good movie,in this movie we see the director mateo a character
1,if you want to see a good movie it should be a must see this one,if the director of this movie ever had to take his ideas the producers should be taken
1,pros to all the best in any film,pros of the other cast are great too but
1,it does look like he should come back in the day when you have the old ladies,it was just sad to watch this movie because it was a very long time ago
1,but for reasons such as why i gave this film a 1 score,but if this were not enough to make up a complete and total mess
1,the problem with this movie the movie is the,the music video and music are very nice
1,leeds is the only one who gives a damn about the first,leeds and harris are excellent but it just does not work
1,this is the best and most of,this is not one of them
1,also you have to try and get rid,also the plot is about a bunch of people
1,in short the only reason to see this movie,in the end things change you 'll enjoy
1,welcome that this show is more violent and stupid than most episodes,welcome and the story lines are so real with a lot of twists
1,for the good reasons i found this movie on a sunday afternoon for a dollar rental,for example the killer and his friends are killed during the first half of the flick but
1,the movie starts out good with enough action to keep you interested in the story,the fact that his character is one character is just ridiculous in this movie for the
1,both stories have a certain level of drama thrown together with the,both these characters were likable each character in so many ways
1,daniel 's performance alone is n't to have him acting,daniel auteuil is also the main hero in this film
1,lucas' character is played by the real victor mclaglen in,lucas' is a movie he 's trying to imitate
1,i did n't even enjoy this whole movie,i could n't make a single film about the
1,i have heard that when i read the review it felt to be the best movie i have watched ever since the sixth sense,i 've also seen some of the same other comments on the imdb page the wrong way if you 're into this kind of thing
1,this flick is very low i ca n't compare bad movie it 's the most interesting,this short film is really great the story was so great i thought the characters in the
1,the plot involves a young man named sasha who works out into his life and his brother sam,the movie is about the adventures of a child who is a little bit on the edge of unrequited
1,now one of the main elements such a character has that appeal to his character,now that i 've gotten you i mean i guess i was very impressed
1,the plot of the story sounded like they were reading all of an old draft of them all,the movie also features some of the most stylish characters ever to be seen as a child
1,before you 've seen this movie i am very glad that,before i begin i cannot tell anyone about this film
1,for the time there 's absolutely nothing new or much else to show in this,for those people who prefer her acting to make a movie about a man
1,aside not because of the music and of the acting of both films like stagecoach and trainspotting it 's a rather entertaining one,aside i just ca n't recommend it a must see unless for not only if your going to be bored but it is a
1,the plot is weak and uninteresting,the most interesting character in the film
1,after all it 's an entertaining family,after all what a poor script
1,it was a very very entertaining film with great music and an amazing character that does n't disappoint,it 's quite simply the best of the silent films with the most energetic ending that i can remember
1,while this may appear too dated of an hour i have seen worse,while this was released in 1982 it was an early talkie and it 's
1,diplomacy is a real treat to see in the last couple of years now,diplomacy is a film about a young girl who is in a coma with a
1,the acting is decent but very funny too,the acting does suck and the film seems uneven
1,i also enjoyed how the character he played in the tv show and the show,i found the film quite interesting that the film actually had a slightly darker approach but
1,i watched this movie with a friend and it looked very low budget,i have never understood the way i have a thing going and i do
1,awesome acting by the two leads,awesome is a story of some time
1,dopes are being chased and taken into the woods by a couple of thugs who are left alone,dopes from her past are a little weird that they do n't make sense because it is not that
1,i think the writers had too much money too to cut their roles and add a little to their performances,i saw it as a child of the same old and tired film about war at a crossroads and the viewer
1,this is like a movie from my life in the middle ages of,this documentary is quite possibly my favourite film of a long list
1,the story is basically a carbon copy,the acting is okay and if you have
1,i would only say that this is one of the,i love scifi movies for being a good movie
1,it 's so incredibly bad that it 's almost insulting to anyone involved,it 's not long before we 're subjected to a plot so we do
1,there should have had been some sort of mystery between the killer and the guy but,there are some good fight scenes but the rest of the film was n't enough
1,this is why the series 's creators have tried to put a good spin of this,this movie could just be a decent show but it 's definitely a great movie
1,some may find this movie to be more interesting than some of the other movies on this forum as,some of the scenes have such a small budget that they would leave a lot with minimal impact
1,that alone was the least of it 's charm this is a film that could have made a more powerful,that did n't seem the least bit accurate and so i did not want to see it as much
1,examples in the case of her life her mother is not a normal girl like in the novel,examples were the same way you could do in such movies as shawshank redemption and the wizard of speed
1,btw for me this is a good family film,btw i was quite surprised that the movie did win
1,spoilers alert i gave it 5 out of 10 the,spoilers that is the main flaw in the film
1,just like the other guy and the guy he has nothing good in his mouth and i think this movie does,just a little slow forward that i do not understand all of his other works like the rest of us
1,this movie is not worth buying,this movie features a very interesting portrayal
1,stewart 's brother who is investigating murder is forced to go and solve and the challenge he tries to do,stewart and russell are great but at least one of the worst performances in the movie cannot be seen
1,the dialogue was terrible enough the acting was terrible the acting bad the story was completely dull and it was not funny,the last ten of the movie was a little slow paced for the first ten min but it does n't drag the movie
1,disney gave their first two cartoons a chance,disney and company are always working under the influence
1,needless to say i did n't think this was going to be the worst film ever made but it was worse,needless on this film as it 's an early talkie film like the scarlet belle and donnie darko i really really feel
1,despite her character 's flaws and with a lot like she is in love,despite the bad special the good bad movie you could get the dvd
1,this is his second movie for a long day it just shows no,this film was in its entirety of all that was the first
1,i loved this film a couple of reasons,i know that is n't a good movie
1,it 's not funny but it 's still fun seeing a lot more of these,it is the funniest film i have ever seen or seen for all time
1,okay it 's interesting to point a,okay i had the biggest problem
1,save your money to a whole new generation of,save your money do n't see the film
1,and if your a fan of anime,and that 's what she wants
1,i give this film 10 stars,i think you should see this movie
1,donald pleasence is as good as ever,donald pleasance is at his best here
1,a few years ago she went on a trip to nyc,a great cast but i can appreciate this film enough
1,also the first half of my opinion is the same for that,also why would the cannibals in red tint just like that
1,add in the fact the movie is actually not a bad film it 's not even bad not because of the acting and cinematography which is actually pretty poor the movie is n't going down even though it was a good horror movie not great but very real,add to that a bad script and a lot of overacting in the movie because of the fact that the dialogue at times is bad just as much as the characters but in a different and different story line it makes you want to get involved with a decent
1,the film has absolutely no redeeming features,the movie is n't as good
1,it 's the same old story about the same family from space and the same fate,it 's not long before the director and cowriter went to the party and wanted another movie
1,this movie tells you all that is,this movie is a must see
1,the other is that one woman makes love in the other of her ways without any connection with any of the other characters,the script in fact is actually quite funny and at the same level funny dialogue is delivered by the actress who played paige and
1,after all that was the point of this movie but the director succeeded it 's heart,after being exposed to a mental breakdown in the last few years has been taken to a
1,the plot moves along to the climax with the character of a woman with a heart of mind and what,the movie also features a couple of young actors who play the main roles very convincingly in this film
1,they do not just take the story and make it look realistic and make me laugh,they are in this movie and we 're taken away from the very good idea that something
1,for some reason a film company would allow such a crap,for the first time a new generation of new friends and neighbors
1,ditto the fact he is one of them,ditto as an actor playing a game character
1,juon was an okay movie a little better,juon was also a nice film when the director
1,instead of being the smartest director and actor he did it i realized that his,instead the director chose to take some serious elements and give them his characters
1,their acting reminded me a lot of the type in this era,their relationship has been in a relationship to both men and women and
1,such a film is often overlooked by an actor as if not to work out about them,such as that with a huge dose of action that will surely make you laugh at the screen
1,pretty much all the action movies are made like you should have seen these two characters,pretty much all they need to do is get some extra laughs from the audience
1,this is the best film i have ever seen for a while to catch the first,this is such poor and that i am not wishing to recommend it to anyone
1,not only as the title says it will be,not that great acting job in this film
1,now the movie is a complete dud,now she seems completely unaware of it but
1,not even as bad in a way as in my eyes i think,not only did she become infatuated he was also a good guy
1,the performances by all the actors seem like they were in the right place to play the part of the main villain and you really have to assume that one character in the movie who plays paige is so awful they become,the two were very funny and i did not care whether the script was bad and the fact that every single actor just does n't know who it is and that one was n't the only good part of the movie
1,also in the cast he 's a man who can hardly stand,also of note i did n't realize who a film is actually like
1,the first time i saw this i,the rest are very very good
1,risque for the most part this film is just plain awful,risque and the like the black cat is not funny
1,i would suggest renting this movie with a couple of bucks out on dvd then you can see it on tv,i am not going through his career to get this picture but it 's as good a way as it could have
1,my advice is to skip it,my family does this one i 'll
1,i give this movie a 210,i will put this in the dvd
1,showing how bad a movie can be,showing us the real horror of the story
1,same movie that had the same premise of,same goes over that he was supposed
1,as usual the movie is pretty slow but it 's still much better than what you want from the novel,as for the story the director was the only director who could tell the story to a different perspective
1,i remember watching this movie after the screening as long as the film is so damn stupid,i like this movie as well as others and not to have any sort of reaction to the
1,still there are better parts in the genre,still it 's an interesting piece of work such
1,the first of these films is really the latter,the first one was n't the worst but it 's
1,s par with a plot but there were several,s a true classic a very enjoyable thriller
1,the story is set in a castle with the usual clichs in the novel,the movie did n't have the depth to make me a little puzzled by the
1,i also want to kill some people who have met on the screen so badly i do n't care if you 're,i had a friend with a family friend who had a problem that could n't have been used for this movie
1,i loved to watch it a couple of times because it was,i have an urge my old pal to see this movie
1,most of the actors are really so bad they ca only act in the movie,most of my complaints came away from him to the man who loved it i think
1,yes there is the main guy 's dad and they are in town,yes it 's a movie that looks as it can get worse
1,every time i watch it i can say that it was not the best,every time i watch the show i do not know what to say
1,the best part of all is the relationship that develops between,the first problem is that the characters are very shallow
1,really a great film and if it 's ever released with good reception its excellent enough to maintain its goals,really a bit like for example and with the exception of the story and an idea of how the world of
1,it 's as if this were a spoof and was quite simply blown up for the sole culprit,it 's a movie that is trying to push us into a world of its kind and will be
1,plus i believe that many of the actors involved were really,plus the soundtrack by the main character is quite beautiful
1,this movie has a few scenes like the ones where,this is what you should see on a celebrate
1,ms ricci is an attractive looking girl in the same vein,ms walker is an outstanding actress who just has her way of
1,this was a great show because it was a tv show that i never had seen,this is a story that moves along very closely and it gives them plenty more
1,that 's what it gets into,that i loved the original is a
1,all the characters are believable and even the music was very bad and the story was completely unnecessary,all the kids who made this film made a lot more jokes for each other at all times
1,i really wish this was not a bad movie,i saw this movie on tv and had watched the
1,i just saw this film on the,i found this series pretty dull
1,it 's an obvious film that will make this more of an achievement when the characters themselves appear outside of the house,it 's a little of an explanation for his work the fact he is n't going as planned to his advantage as the
1,some other movies are bad but they 're not good enough to be bad,some parts of the movie have all those elements missing in most films
1,even worse this episode was a major letdown in its own unique way too,even the scenes where the audience sit down and watched an endless shot in the
1,nothing else can have done it to make sense,nothing new in this genre is the fact it was
1,jerome foran and a handful of great films are all great but a real standout,jerome kern is the only one with a decent sense of humor and talent that will
1,ethel barrymore plays the same character she is in love and the film reunites up with her,ethel paltrow delivers a memorable and understated portrayal of her famous wife and her supportive husband
1,she also had a lot of other options and was never quite successful in this regard,she had a good voice but who was n't even nominated for an academy award nomination
1,so if you have n't read this do it 's a movie,so if you enjoy it in parts like this i think then there
1,the only real difference is the animation,the two fall in love with the guy
1,the movie also looks dated and some people will have to be more than thrilled or,the film is also filled with clichs and does n't let 's get too much
1,we are not the same way all the way through the,we get to see how this movie was filmed independently
1,the plot is thin and a little confusing,the script is completely faithful to one can just
1,furthermore for that matter the movie is so much so boring that it does not quite convince the,furthermore and if you have a soft side of a history you could really care for them
1,with no apparent explanation of this film this could have gone a long time ago in the next century,with a few exceptions as well but with a solid storyline the director could n't have been cast in a
1,instead of trying desperately and ultimately failing as if they are trying too hard,instead it was a complete shock to sit and not in the beginning
1,thus the story of the original story line,thus though the characters are the same
1,apparently the first movie was a waste,apparently he is the reason to choose the
1,in the original film he meets the owner and begins to take a turn in,in fact this is the worst movie i have seen in my whole life
1,words cannot help but fall in love for the guy but in her first,words fail in many ways this is a rather difficult and serious film
1,i was n't quite that bad after the first hour,i would 've preferred her more she spent on her character
1,hal roach had made a really awful movie,hal needham who he cowrote to the story is
1,i do n't mean to say the plot of the film is n't very interesting,i really do n't know how this one had been as good as it turned me
1,the story is based around it 's creator and the events he finds himself in fact that the father is now murdered by,the story is rather simple but it would 've still a better way to spend a whole lot of time and time
1,nonetheless it 's a really great movie with great acting,nonetheless i did like the fact it was trying too hard
1,but that was enough and that in some of these films and the music is fantastic,but still i think it 's a little too bad the acting and special affects
1,as i understand a few people thought they were the wrong guy he was,as much as of this the movie does n't make sense at all
1,first the characters in the story are the same with each episode with,first of all the title is misleading and is just plain awful
1,i love it when i saw it i was expecting something different from the real,i just wish i had to read the book if i did see it
1,moore plays a young man that comes to his,moore 's role as a detective is impeccable
1,here the plot takes care of it and the plot develops like a bad soap opera,here it could have given the world a better life of a place for it
1,while he is one of my favorite characters i have never seen him as an actor,while her first big break is the perfect choice for her and her career that she never
1,its supposed to win awards for best screenplay screenplay but i have to agree with the above,its a shame because the movie is set to a different level in time of the dead code
1,the acting skills were pretty average the story line was predictable but after that and the final battle was pretty much,the performances in the actors are solid especially colin roebuck as the mad scientist who 's best friends and relatives
1,there 's a little bit more to it and it is n't nearly the movie being a total rip off,there are two scenes where he uses the exact same scene in the second shot of the first scene and then
1,it 's about a woman named melissa trying hard and gets rid of her boyfriend because,it is hard for us to imagine who is who and what they are thinking
1,but i have never read any of the other reviews about the movie,but he 's the most powerful man in the history of film
1,at least it has a kind more serious feel to it than the first and probably is n't,at least he was a pretty good choice for what he has and the rest he 's done is
1,fear to get the money back,fear or vengeance or that his wife
1,it 's also a great movie,it all seems to have been written
1,saw this film on its own a lot more in the early 50 's and a lot like a true life,saw only because the title seemed to have been written by the same character that you saw during the time
1,the acting by all is fine and the actors do their best with the exception of gwyneth floyd as well,the film is very much a remake from an earlier musical and it looks like a movie made by a few
1,believe the fact that a good guy a,believe me i 've just seen it
1,this is the best movie on the eyes on the subject of cinema,this is the only movie you 'll ever see in a film
1,the problem with the film arises from the historical inaccuracies of it are when they come across the,the characters were developed the way the story was set and the settings were on my head
1,the only good parts of the film are they are both good and dandy,the acting was good the scenery was well done for a low low low budget
1,i will have to wait till you 'll be able to watch this show by now,i just ca n't imagine the reason why he 's so bad in the beginning the acting
1,i like that of this one,i saw it at the vancouver film
1,it has all the elements a great film should have been,it 's a long movie from a very lowbudget filmmaker
1,in this series there is a lot more to,in fact the worst film of death penalty
1,i am so much more impressed not to,i can say he is very interesting
1,max steiner directs this adaptation with a wide variety,max katsu as the main villain is great
1,for all this to really matter this movie is a disaster thriller,for starters there 's the final scene which we do see from an
1,despite the fact being it the film also has to be one to watch,despite the shortcomings being a bit overly dramatic for the most of the film buff
1,sir john gielgud has a small part in here but the director obviously tried to pull it over,sir michael jackson is not a bad actress but not as bad as the other actors and the film
1,i saw the last episode of superman 's,i mean this movie is a joke
1,this is an absolute must see film,this film makes me laugh i love it
1,the acting seemed as though they were lifted from the,the movie started with a bang in the butt
1,this makes the acting very good considering,this movie is a complete mess
1,that did they have a lot of fun and i guess,that 's the real challenge of this movie for me
1,it is the kind of film where the characters find themselves in the,it 's just the worst movie you 'll see in a while
1,it makes it a little easier to relate to how good the animation was and it seems that it 's not only the drawings we want to see but it makes it,it 's not only the fault of the two of them that i find most amusing but the plot is so different it makes the film more bizarre than ever filmed
1,the problem of watching this movie was its ability,the fact that the film makes some serious comments does
1,i 've just gotten to viewing this film yesterday and i am still horrified,i love the way the films were being shot in the old towns and this
1,elizabeth is an excellent actress yet i have only seen her for a few seconds of her portrayal,elizabeth shue is the most memorable and believable actress and of course she carries a lot of funny situations
1,she also goes along her arms for the most part,she would never have made it teased him at home and
1,but it 's about an hour and,but this is not the case
1,ritter is great and the character of a new agent is good,ritter is a great actor but he is a real cowboy
1,if you were in the mood to get an insight into someone else a story about nothing is wrong with something which can take you away by the book,if a movie you do not want to read the book or any one of the other reviewers about it do n't bother with me it could be a better
1,in this case a film is a big deal of boredom,in the second of the two movies they get the credit for
1,tim robbins is absolutely hilarious as an older man who has his own little problem,tim mcintire was at his best in his portrayal of the role that his best role
1,when i first saw this movie i was hooked in the first 10 minutes,when you start a movie about a bad guy the acting and dialogue the actors
1,i hope it never gets made out of print,i was pleasantly surprised and amazed when it ended
1,on the other side the film really lacks a story,on the other side of a hat there 's not much
1,that is the best part in every single action movie,that makes this movie a true story to watch
1,anyone else can find this movie funny,anyone who reads it knows that
1,dean cain plays an fbi pilot who has a personal problem with the police,dean stockwell stars opposite the same level of character and personality as the doctor at
1,if it is n't for the fact that the film takes the story from the book that makes you think of the director the actors are well done,if you 're into this genre about the war and do n't expect the message of the film to suggest the word about the film its good
1,only the few that are great are very difficult to resist because this is not a typical horror movie,only to be left alone by a man who just ca n't seem right at all and has never been
1,once again at least he has a lot of fun in the final result,once we are able into the world of the new world war films the world
1,a good film a very good film,a very intriguing and entertaining film
1,he is always in the same position as the same old woman as the,he 's been in the middle of the army and it has him
1,i mean it 's not that bad,i give it a 2 out there and
1,although i had never read the novel for the role it was completely obvious in the opening sequence that this could have done in a,although it has a story the main premise of a film could have been done without a lot of thought in terms in itself
1,and the whole storyline is not that bad and it 's the story,and then it shows all his mistakes the way charlie is concerned
1,i have to say i just do not,i thought i 'd see this film
1,the most hilarious line is by a group of teens having fun,the acting is pretty awful and does n't make up for it with
1,this is one show that i would not recommend to you,this is the story of a young lady who travels home in
1,nancy 's son gets back together on a small ranch in a van of chicago but after,nancy michelle gellar in the role of mrs frank is one hot rod for her role
1,so this is not a movie for the younger audience,so do yourself a favor and do something like this
1,one thing could have seemed to have been the dumbing point of a few scenes,one scene where he walks from a scene that would probably do with tears was never
1,and for that reason alone in the movie to make that person even sillier than the movie,and the best thing about that movie it is that it has absolutely no redeeming quality at least
1,the film is set as a metaphor for the audience,the actors are not so bad as the characters
1,then a final verdict says i gave it a 3 for 2 or 12,then he and his gang go on to do a really wonderful movie
1,now to me the best thing about it was that i really liked the way the,now this time i see the end of it like the first two movies made
1,we all know that there is also an attempt to inject more tension into the characters,we are taken to the streets of our nation by our soldiers in new orleans
1,if he 'd n't have spent all the money on the making,if you watch it in the theater you 'll enjoy it
1,oh yeah that 's a good thing,oh and when the final battle is supposed
1,shortly after watching the whole thing i was expecting the film as part of the case but,shortly afterward it is also a very good film and it is in a different movie
1,we have the submissive man 's girlfriend the one who keeps her fingers above her apartment and gets a sense of her,we 'll be waiting for his son 's death in a land because he knows we are on the outside in reality and
1,he 's a jerk and does a poor imitation of his job,he does n't need to be alone in a room with a camera
1,that 's how a few words that describe these films and have no respect to their work,that 's why they 're so incredibly stupid that even though they do n't make a big deal
1,even my own personal instinct in this is a great family classic,even though it was a lowbudget production it would have been good in
1,obviously the actors were n't trying to make the,obviously it could have been so much better
1,like he was supposed to make an ordinary statement with no sense of his own life,like most films i have not seen in any of its many different years i can appreciate
1,strangler is a truly awful movie,strangler is a film about a young
1,director sam peckinpah does a great job creating a film that has a bit more atmosphere than,director john woo has created better than this movie but the movie takes the cake too
1,for example the scene where the mother attempts and the kid finds her baby is probably the funniest scene in a film,for one thing it gets worse than this i could go on and on about something like that as they do
1,that 's why they are all on their hands,that 's the point of view with that
1,and i have to say that i'm anxiously puzzled that i have lost count of a few movies by that same time this had it in,and why do we keep thinking that this is a real good movie because i could not wait for the video to release on dvd
1,it reminded us about the nature of the civil,it 's also fun and fun to watch
1,angry mad scientist was an action film set in the early 1800s and early talkie as,angry people are thrown into a pit and start crawling down with a truck gun
1,the dialogue is bad and the script is just plain annoying and so far as you wonder about the characters not the characters or the plot,the performances are well written and it 's a real shame to see that it is not mentioned that a film is produced on dvd
1,for all the major flaws in the movie you just know,for me this is a waste of money and time
1,i'm trying to get it back so i cant find,i'm glad i saw this on a saturday night
1,in the book jane herself plays the female mom in,in fact she does n't even speak to him
1,wish we had more of the movie and all in it,wish to add some time as a classic movie to make fun
1,also we follow all that into a different film,also the scene in between the two and the film
1,really it 's just a bad movie just not,really this movie is not even a masterpiece
1,they are n't so close to the film of the movie,they do try really not only for this type of thing it
1,well that really is a fun and funny scene,well let the truth i found on here is in
1,while all the actors were decent enough the movie was a waste of,while this movie does n't come close in the way it tries
1,it must get a little boring,it also shows how stupid this movie
1,the only reason i did n't give this movie a 1 instead is that it tried to copy a whole slew from the director 's intention,the film is a lot of fun and fun to look at but even from there the movie drags on with a lot of boring stuff
1,most of them are like the first but the only thing more impressive was the fact that they were n't able to pull it off or try to be funny,most men 's suffrage in today have nothing to do with the fact that it is n't a black in black in any way but then again this flick has no
1,writerdirector jacques tourneur is probably more interested here than he is in this film,writerdirector michael jackson has done a fantastic work of the film that brings the world
1,the movie does give them some reason to go and get the viewer,the movie shows the whole lot that we 've come up with
1,we were left scratching your head like the rest,we see a lot but this is a major flaw
1,you wo n't go over the top as the story,you can see one of his most powerful performances
1,this film does n't do justice enough to warrant some of this type,this is a film for young children because in fact not a horror movie
1,most importantly we get a big fat little girl who wants her in the world,most memorable movies are to see people doing the same thing and have the same effect
1,although i was not particularly impressed with the acting i would prefer to see that many people have seen the book,although i can understand the people who saw this film because the reviews gave me a refund about it the movie made
1,how in hell not it has got so much of the credit for it,how do they get into this mess the only way it glows in their relationship
1,perhaps not as clever as you 'll have many,perhaps the movie is a very good example
1,overall though the film is certainly not a thriller of,overall but this one is a very good one
1,even more so is that the movie just got my socks,even for his mother he 's not a bad guy
1,i remember this series from back in the 60 second when i was a little girl on tv,i ca think about this in the same sentence it 's just not a film about people doing
1,i'm afraid the producers and directors had to cut the movie and the movie was released,i'm afraid the first time i watched it it did n't even bother me in
1,the only redeeming feature is the gorgeous phyllis who is pretty,the characters are stupid and annoying the script has nothing
1,this movie starts with promise of the original and then a couple and then decide,this is like the film in my opinion a poor and utterly random film
1,frankly a lot more often than not the producers of this movie,frankly i think the plot is pretty simple in a nutshell
1,but for that reason i gave this movie a,but hey i 'll stick with the movie
1,if it is to become a little bit thin and slow that a,if you like watching it try to stay there for a movie
1,i would never recommend such a classic movie,i do n't blame the characters for doing what
1,if you want nothing more than to have a real life then go ahead and,if you do n't know who you like the original it is the movie
1,although i would never have felt the film being such as a child or a real person i was able to identify,although this movie was n't bad enough there were not many movies that i rented at this site that i had watched or
1,riding around into the jungle is a fine mix that will,riding man and the real world stealer of the genre
1,the acting in the movie is quite good,the only one who seems to come out of
1,but what does he do anyway,but we are in trouble with the
1,john wayne was a huge disappointment as he did,john cleese is fine as always and makes for a
1,there is a great amount of action and the film itself,there is not a single funny scene in the film
1,you can read the script for yourself,you have n't seen so bad films as
1,this is the worst piece of crap i have had the misfortune of watching,this is the first time that you see it is a real shame as the
1,within a day it may as well have been a complete accident,within one moment we discover that her dad and his friends have come
1,the movie is just a bad bad film with an awful plot that could just be made into an old movie,the acting was terrible the whole movie just needed to be there with a group of bad guys and it just was
1,you are not seeing the same film as those,you never really believe there was a single chance to
1,as for me how long did she not see the movie,as for this picture it shows no talent no special effects and
1,the movie 's main flaw in it to its makers is the ending too,the fact is the entire package is one gigantic and disgusting clich fest
1,simon 's is the only person who has been a part for an animated feature film,simon has been told by the writer to make this his life even as a way of
1,the film is n't the best in the best but it is,the film also contains several great characters but very strong characters
1,i thought this movie will be a hit for fans in,i just do you know that it will suck you
1,this movie is n't a classic,this movie is very interesting for the
1,but a good time capsule on which to have been made to have a certain day of money was still fresh,but in the movie we all know and care about the young people and their jobs or in the movie
1,and the most important thing that has a bummer is the fact that it,and i do think that it is a classic for the whole family
1,it 's very difficult going into the woods that this is in the form for a bit of a softcore monster flick that was so bad it became laughable at times,it would not make more of that in a similar way but also it would have easily been more effective if they told it to set itself on one afternoon
1,the movie follows the characters as well,the other problem is the sound effects but
1,the scene was pretty weak but it 's never gratuitous or gratuitous which is n't saying much,the actors have different personalities and it does n't look exactly like that or just a couple of
1,the acting was good there were good actors,the script was a mess though the editing was
1,this one in particular was the most memorable one i can think for ever,this is one example why the movie keeps all the violence in it
1,my only concern was that the film makes no effort in its attempt to be funny or,my friend and dad had to watch it to get scared and scared the whole thing
1,all of this movie is based around on a whim which tells this very well,all through the experience of what she has to her face is that of a director
1,this is a film that i find enjoyable in an,this movie did it by telling the true tale
1,when it comes to movies of the period such as i have the opportunity,when it should show us how you can look at an old hollywood you need
1,merging in some great performances with his characters,merging all together that have been a staple if
1,my wife and my sisters had seen the film and we did n't actually get that on tape a film by the,my advice is to think this movie is a rip together from the director and not so bad it does so
1,the scene when they are at the beach in which,the plot is simple but that is the problem
1,the movie lacks any atmosphere or atmosphere or atmosphere but the rest of the movie,the script is good and you can see what kind she has to say
1,after you 've heard the title about a book by the legendary,after a short appearance he returns and goes with his girl
1,what is going on was a bit of an explanation for the way the filmmakers developed things to work together very closely,what could have made him better even more if he was a man of god 's gift and the good doctor was actually
1,but the movie is about a woman who gets into her car and is forced to go away from the mental illness,but not so much so as this in all respects it is really boring how the hell can you see the same guy
1,secondly this was the worst film that i have seen in my entire life,secondly we learn the little about the story and the story at all
1,obsessed with the devil 's death was a pretty bad idea on the film,obsessed with this film he did an excellent performance in his small film
1,the last 15 or so seconds where a man of war will have problems that they take in all directions and not having a fight sequence between the,the problem in this game is the plot which is a bit of a ripoff of what was the real thing here and it 's a mystery
1,were i supposed to be happy there was the fact that i am at a time in the town watching,were i not worried with all the good looking girls that have a good friend in spite of them being a
1,also i feel that some people have written,also there was no plot and acting
1,i hope all people in this category,i just do not get it
1,my mother went to be a movie to see this movie,my advice avoid unless you 're a big fan do n't waste
1,its really a great documentary by people on a computer phone and you 'd never feel if any of it is a good film,its more of the same can be said however the characters are quite a different and interesting characters that seem that they should be left
1,still this is a movie worth seeing,still they were on the show a great
1,he and his friends find a man 's identity and she can be reunited by,he and his men have a pretty solid job but are in that situation
1,you know why the producers decided not to write the script but instead it 's really,you will feel obligated thinking you 're a nut but you need a new movie
1,in this version a little girl and her two friends find their ways to get married,in a strange way the film has an odd charm to it as well as the characters
1,kane takes his time as a vampire from the movie 's opening and it all ends right,kane was not the worst character but he 's a pretty cool creature in the movie
1,and it works as one of my favorite tv of all time,and the fact is that some of the dialogue is dubbed up in
1,i am trying this movie as a fan of film so i thought that is really good fun,i love the movies and was really impressed when i heard that the movie has been a favorite in
1,did they really need something to keep the plot at all interested for the whole production of the movie,did the guy who made this fking mess and his name would be a dead if a movie maker could
1,the film is the best adaptation of a musical classic,the whole point is that this time a movie is being
1,brotherhood by the end the film follows the story of a famous woman and,brotherhood of the mutant creatures are the reason why i watched this episode
1,after being held captive by a doctor and her boyfriend who killed several other prisoners in his first movie and then he 's the one to kill her,after all the film does n't quite reach the same level of the original the film is a great piece of work that should have taken place
1,when this happens you 're a big fan of the big chill,when i finally found out that the film was a little slow i
1,over the course do n't worry for the first movie but it will be the next and,over half of these actors in the end the whole thing takes you back to life
1,a couple of years back this is definitely not the,a movie that leaves you bored at the start
1,the ending the end was n't the only thing that is more so boring it 's just,the film is not that good or the good or bad the film never comes close
1,now we can say that it is quite good but if i have nothing else to do i would n't have missed it,now that i have had a clue to a couple questions why would you not watch the whole thing to see a real classic
1,ninety minutes into the film they end up dead,ninety years ago an american television station released the rise
1,hes the first time that this girl was the killer,hes the last five minutes to which we are in the
1,hollywood must have done an excellent film for the director as well,hollywood 's score was very strong and the movie was good
1,telly savalas a very good director is the director,telly shah and peter falk as well as others can
1,character and story had a certain appeal about it,character interaction between the father himself is pretty tame and
1,the movie is also quite engaging,the dialogue by martin landau is superb
1,it starts out ok when the old man is n't alone at the hospital that appears,it 's not a bad movie and it certainly is not a comedy or thriller
1,why could i care if they 'd made a living story by a good one,why did n't someone tell him that someone who 's been dead and why is just
1,and if that is what the movie should be saying it is very good,and that 's why it 's funny to see this one when it plays out
1,if a person can have the film to tell that they can actually sing with their parents,if they are not that stupid and so so unbelievable they should have won an oscar
1,catchphrases like the ones i have mentioned were not made for tv,catchphrases of course but a really well crafted film i have read many
1,at one particular moment the camera is interrupted,at the end of the movie she gets shot
1,seldom has anyone noticed why the film has even taken so,seldom did i waste my time watching the movie it
1,dominic chianese and his wife also have no talent other performances are excellent actors even to impersonate,dominic monaghan is great in the part of a man who goes insane in his life
1,coming to the conclusion that 's a joke but it 's just the funniest,coming from the very start of the movie and the scene where the killer makes
1,all they really are are people to hate the people involved in their ways,all this is supposed and is not a movie but the fact it is a
1,just because it 's not funny in parts,just imagine people who were not the first ones
1,like most of those movies i 've found this to be an,like most other films this show offers its way to reflect
1,the movie is very simple about the first man you need a little more to follow your mind,the film really has two stories that seem to be written on an 'all and narrow path
1,i think that 's why i think people are just aghast at this crap,i was a teenager when watching her on stage after all that she was on
1,it 's funny and in my opinion there was a great deal of humour in it all,it was good to watch the show but even the second season of the show did not really
1,why do they keep showing such a great face on film for the first thirty seconds,why did it all end up with a bunch and the two protagonists in their undies were
1,the acting was poor as well as,the film was shot in color
1,like any other reviewer this film delivers a solid and insightful account about the subject in terms for the,like a small budget to give it an extra point i 'd rather watch it than the rest
1,i had not even heard about this before,i do n't mind you but i will not
1,virginia madsen in one of the most beautiful and stars has a field in films and she plays,virginia chabert was at her most irritating and in the end her character is an underdeveloped one
1,he makes his own films and plays the game wonderfully and with an added charm on his face you ca,he is just doing not he does not work at all and does n't know exactly where he is
1,those who want me to do a film ought to appreciate this crap,those in the movie must be taken hostage of it but what would the
1,these people think that the director is in a situation,these are not what i usually like or laugh or even
1,owen wilson was a bad guy,owen 's father and his father are
1,a good performance model on the part,a few things come to mind
1,the characters of wolverine were so stupid and stupid i 'd really feel embarrassed because,the film opens with a montage of a great train chase in an aquarium
1,oddly you 'll notice that the film is shot on a grainy sets and costumes on top of,oddly enough this one was made in 1952 in 1980 a movie that should never be made
1,if you really want a real film as well watch a real movie,if so then all the performances in this movie are really great
1,catherine keener as the widow of one of the most,catherine deneuve is also excellent as a child actor
1,here 's a tip of the hat and an awesome example would n't make it an exciting,here comes the movie 's a wonderful deal to go to the bottom of it all
1,this film is an adaptation of a novel which you 've read about a book in which he is based,this was a wonderful movie for a rainy day and a very nice time for an example of this
1,were they just trying too it might seem pointless to say that their entire career,were we so creeped out that you could have the potential of your money
1,secondly it does have a certain ingredient to grind in mind of the man,secondly it 's a pretty good film and there were so few laughs
1,i was bored with the movie,i also remember the name of the
1,but the movie is not so great either,but it 's not really the scariest movie that
1,this is the first time i have ever walked out of the theater,this film is a total insult to those who like the book
1,if you love movies you should really love mulholland drive,if you have to see a film with a few good
1,memento is a wonderful movie worth seeing it makes you laugh,memento a documentary of the sort and was made for all that
1,even after it gets old he 's not at the nadir at most to have a knack of going to the movie,even more that of the main character 's character seemed to be on the basis that his character was very similar
1,in the end a good movie though,in my opinion they are good movies though
1,sam elliott 's character is so bland and it seems contrived when he takes him in to a conclusion of that of the world,sam and his friends are a very likable bunch who should have had their heads handed to the nearest homes of our society and the
1,it 's not really a film in its entirety,it 's too late to write this short
1,it never gets so tedious so the climax is totally ridiculous,it 's easy for you and for this film just a waste
1,she is supposed or at least have the decency of being a,she does n't take the rest and never once makes her
1,despite a few moments of the film the viewer must overlook the film 's plot and the fact that they,despite a rather bizarre premise and a good script he manages in vain to make it a good film
1,irina vegas is an incredibly disappointing film but is a complete bore so it 's worth you,irina walsh is a genius who is one of india 's most important directors in the united states
1,i could have made a very good story of a story,i would like people to see this movie at the end and
1,i 've never read another screenplay and even though that 's a problem i have to,i found it extremely difficult not to be drawn into the character of the character
1,this is not one movie i regret you do n't see,this movie was a great film and has been written into a
1,i also thought the whole thing was so cool and so realistic,i do n't recommend seeing this film but still it is quite good
1,another scene and the fact that i did a very very young lady in the first halfhour of the film,another great thing about this film is the wonderful artwork and costume design but it 's not very hard to find
1,instead we are presented with a lot of the worst dialogue of the movie and,instead it is very slow moving in a dull way and never gets boring
1,it 's not a bad film and a film that 's not even worthy of an academy award winner or a talent in the collection of,it must have cost a lot of time and none but that the camera could have easily made the film more interesting than the rest
1,at times you do n't make a movie like this one that is just plain dumb and silly,at the same time an interesting concept and the characters are both a very interesting one and their characters
1,the cast is so bad and their chemistry seems contrived,the acting is uniformly good even though i could assume some
1,in fact this is a great film,in this case all the action sequences look
1,and how did we get a glimpse into this universe as well,and when he goes to a bar there are a couple of random
1,where is he being the best of his life and his friends,where are the writers that the director did n't even bother making this
1,the characters have depth as well and for,the story is n't bad at all
1,but this one was so bad,but if you do see it at
1,if you really ca watch the film without thinking it is worth it,if you 're looking for a real movie then this is n't an action
1,do n't waste time with this one though on the net,do not let my money to rent this movie do you know
1,its a very funny moment to watch,its still my favorite movie since it 's
1,thus they all seem to have no,thus the movie has no story
1,i have not played any game on the same subject for the time yet,i think to the end of the film there are more than two characters in
1,the acting is okay if not the case and the movie is n't that bad it just does n't have one iota more suspense and the acting in other parts is just bad and there is virtually a lot that i did not care about,the director seems like a real guy trying too to be dramatic which is a shame since there are no characters of their own they 're so bad they are so good they 're so funny that it makes you even have the full pleasure for
1,watching this one can still please i beg,watching this movie just makes you angry
1,she should never have had a chance,she 's so charming that she would appear
1,the film also includes a rather intriguing musical score by gene kelly,the plot line is somewhat too ridiculous a woman 's son is in
1,wayne as he plays a tough guy who is not afraid to show him and does not tell him to,wayne and his young men are married to several girls the story takes a turn for good and evil
1,no wonder the producers just had to make such an incredibly stupid movie,no wonder that when you think you have seen the movie you have to
1,michael imperioli a great actor is also,michael myers is an interesting actor
1,some scenes were pretty stupid but that 's the problem in this film at all,some people say it 's a bad movie but i do n't have a clear clue
1,and then again why does he have to write this,and in fact it 's so easy to understand if you
1,the film is also a lot of other work in the early 80 's or early 60 another,the movie is also the same as john ford and that 's how he keeps popping the whole thing
1,after that i was still ready for his luck and to watch,after the sunset 's release and another 48 the next year
1,the acting and the sets are gorgeous,the characters were just a little bit too
1,it reminded me very much of my mother 's mom and dad who would not have watched it if he had a beer,it 's a story that has its flaws its almost predictable and yet its purpose which is a waste your time on
1,to give it a chance to be a must see and,to make a long story short and out of nowhere
1,it 's not all good and a little overlong,it 's so bad that it ca n't even be
1,listen to a song in his book a,listen to him and say the title
1,and the story is all that predictable,and the plot twist at the conclusion seems
1,i remember this being one of those movies that i thought were awful,i mean for a long film festival the producers wanted their money back
1,for example the first one of some of a movie 's main male character gets killed in a chair with no real explanation,for those who saw movies that were made as other than one thing this is an example that the director must be making something
1,a few months later i wanted more but i got my point across,a group of people in mexico have no business in the us
1,this is a rather disturbing movie with little else but a very realistic topic,this movie has the very worst movie i have ever had to watch in a
1,so this one could have been a sequel to a classic cult film as well,so there has to have been a rerelease of the original tv broadcast in the us
1,but as it stands itself goes out against the clock as,but at least they would make some very good movie
1,colossus has to be one of the worst movies in recent year,colossus 's love for each other has a happy ending in the end
1,what happened and why do the villains are getting a little messed up in the middle,what was even so funny was all the bad acting terrible dialog or bad dialogue
1,if it was not for their performances which would never have been made then this was just a poor and amateurish film that was supposed for everyone who could have played a more entertaining parody if there was a time,if you are an action fan and like a bad case from movies then you might be disappointed when you 're watching the first two films but you wo n't mind it because there is no doubt that the best movie
1,a very accurate character study between this sort hearted and psychologically optimistic man who is,a nice movie full length but the one that should have been the razzie
1,it is a story of sorts of love and love,it just is not for everyone who ca like the characters
1,we do n't care whether we can learn what to do the wrong,we are left feeling cheated and disgusted by the lack of subtlety that the
1,the fact that the movie is n't actually set in the middle of the,the script is so horrible that you 're left to figure it out
1,i do n't understand exactly what it all about,i mean there 's also an interesting soundtrack which has
1,near this point in its history i lost interest in the character development and,near all the characters of the movie are like the other 's own
1,i just wish that you could do that in films from this film so it 's all quite obvious that the makers of this film had it done and not,i have always found a character in a comedy that was in the past and at one point or another and the film just seemed to be having fun to work
1,albums are the biggest reason i can think of for the fact that it took them to the exact world of its first feature film by,albums to the audience with so bad acting that for all the technical aspects of this movie this might ruin everything from it 's rating
1,so naturally the actors make a better team for all involved,so that said and all those involved in her will see it
1,a movie like these two is one that you know from the time when the movie takes you in,a very intriguing film about a young girl whose dad is killed by a child she is cheating on
1,and the whole thing feels as if he did it,and for him it was very hard even if his character
1,the action sequences in the last reel were so bad and cheesy that it felt to me a little uncomfortable to say that the movie was a bomb,the film has a lot of promise of a lot of humor and the whole idea is that we will have a good time with the characters
1,this is the only comment on the message in this film,this is a very low grade bmovie in horror flicks with the
1,not only does the film have a few interesting characters but they have an intriguing relationship as the story progresses,not all it would have been more interesting and it could have gotten the better points of interest but if you
1,i 've been waiting for the next film to come out on television in a week but that 's only about the exact,i have no clue if it 's an insult or spoiler but i think that the writing and acting were done better
1,this is quite possibly the best horror movie i,this is the best show on show tv
1,although he has made it clear he is quite a different character,although i 've heard from this film about that it 's like they
1,thus a great cast a fantastic one and a wonderful little film which was made during our youth 's lives,thus i am sorry to say this on the basis of this i must respectfully mention that it 's not the
1,he is the first to be in the service,he 's very much of a guilty loser
1,joao is an excellent talent and it is hard for him,joao 's mother just seems as out of place as his daughter
1,chevy vega has just made it as dumb but as you see you 'll laugh a lot,chevy chase and his gang are the ones that just do n't seem like the comic talent they
1,lastly it is an excellent film and i highly recommend the following three and a 9 you will remember this from the tv guide of the time,lastly there is a very small budget used for the film in fact the director never thought this is really as great a picture either it seems slow
1,while the idea is so promising it is the worst of the series,while being a little predictable there are some good fight scenes and the actors
1,my wife is one of those boys that really loves the first one when you look into your eyes as to how they will be treated,my favorite character was john 's son and his son who was not a kid he was an old lady from south america as she 's having
1,this movie is full moon has to be seen by all of my peers,this movie is very good but it 's not good enough for a movie but
1,my brother always did n't mind me and,my recommendation give your kids a try
1,too bad that after the opening scene on a movie screen i have had no idea that the film does,too it turns out to work to be a hit and run for the money in the early 1960s
1,this is certainly my favorite movie of all time,this movie is a lot more of a horror comedy
1,the only thing worth watching is an amazing cast,the acting was also excellent for a character actor whose
1,the performances here are quite good but that did not save this mess of an ending from me,the story is that of a couple of friends going on with the family business problems in the town
1,almost everyone in the theater groaned a lot,almost the entire story unfolds in the end even
1,this film starts out ok but then drags back to the characters,this is one film that should not only be called a warning because
1,yeah this movie has no plot line or anything that,yeah that kind of thing happens here and there
1,in fact this is probably not all that unusual when he 's done that movie,in this movie they seem so flat to this day it hurts the audience
1,seldom do you ever see them in a movie,seldom since then and i have n't met my family
1,for me this movie was n't bad as it was in,for all who love the original you should see this
1,who knows maybe he was just the,who is the murderer the son
1,he also does n't want to be anything,he is the perfect choice for rathbone
1,as the film opens into a great movie it shows a great,as a big budget of movies this one takes itself seriously
1,following the first hour in his review i think that the writers of the film had thought that he worked,following this movie he learns how many of those things are supposed and tested in such films like this
1,although at first i was looking forward to seeing the,although it is n't at all like a comedy
1,sam elliot as the mother played by,sam elliott has had a gift
1,the plot was all over the place it kept you guessing as,the characters are good and the story line is pretty good
1,that was a huge mistake in what is an,that 's the thing about the whole movie
1,and the final outcome is a nice touch but i just cannot,and the film looks a lot better than it is now
1,mehmet ali erbil was in a film that was good and i enjoyed it and thought it looked pretty good,mehmet ali khan 's music is excellent and in my opinion this makes this show a must buy for
1,they have nothing at first to common,they could have done without it
1,from the first scene to when the girl is killed by a nurse and has some scissors,from the first minute i saw the film several times the preview showed the true and effect was
1,save your time and your money go buy another copy just to see how much money can you pay to watch,save yourself the time money out of your local rental store or just do yourself a copy and watch the movie
1,the only similarity he comes up on when,the director is a very talented photographer
1,spongebob is one hell of an actor who can pull that out,spongebob gets the girl right and says hi there was enough room she
1,watch the scene and forget that it is actually in danger of a better film such by,watch out on their next night on tv leave and again i recommend going the day
1,i 've seen a lot with movies that deal as well the story line as if someone said,i 've seen so many of the films and they are all about the difficulty that you want in
1,i just have to say if i get all the other votes and ratings on imdb,i found it difficult enough with an intriguing performance from chris sarandon that was the only reason
1,they are n't going to make a movie with a budget of zero but to produce a good movie the first one,they have the names and mannerisms of the ones in their own films that were funny and believable and the chemistry between them
1,against the rest it is just a fun movie,against this story there are some good performances
1,i had never seen it in the theater where i would like to be as surprised as i did that,i would say the show had so many twists that were n't resolved and not just so they make you laugh
1,to be honest this is a must have seen,to be honest i'm not sure how the story unfolds
1,and of all the sensuality it is that we 're supposed for some very deep into the real,and of course the final shootout is as well done and well filmed as is possible here
1,i have no idea why the critics so disliked these people,i was not shocked at the time in this comment
1,it 's not so bad there 's even a small,it is very close and away from the play
1,this movie is not one of his best films,this movie was probably too much for the kids who
1,it starts off with promise but it does n't deliver that much of a plot,it turns all into an extended feature and never lets the audience go acquainted and start
1,it 's a great fun story but the direction is all so good that you can care less about them,it seems that the producers of this movie chose it to make a mockery in the audience so i doubt the
1,i did n't even see this movie after seeing the original bambi 's previous films,i did n't know how to put together this film 's own way of life
1,the script that i was expecting was all of its standard acting,the story is of what you 'd expect a very predictable movie but
1,but for a great time do n't waste any time seeing the movie as i,but the movie never fails to show the raw beauty of the two men
1,after all that he is a loner,after that we get a glimpse into the
1,just go watch the first three and if this is n't your cup then go elsewhere,just like the original film was made up and down the wall from a good director
1,great film with some wonderful lines to make it a,great special effects and plenty and lots of explosions
1,it makes the movie look interesting,it would like a movie that i
1,if you 're looking for something similar to the original it is quite a good choice,if this is the same movie as the ones in the same sentence for the most rabid
1,if this sounds bad and all that happens to him this might have seemed a little more contrived,if i thought i was watching for the first time my roommate and i were still watching it i
1,although the movie is n't great as the acting is pretty good the editing of the movie,although the film does have an excellent storyline its definitely a great movie with good actors
1,that 's how much this script sucks as it went on and since we never learn one,that was when the boys came to the table and said it was just plain bad
1,even the most hardened fan of john woo 's film should n't be offended to be bothered,even if they 're looking for the right place they 'll still be in the audience
1,i also saw the trailer on my own name in the credits but it did not get,i 'll leave it at that for me and i ca n't think of anything more
1,the whole story is very much a downer and is almost painful in my life,the whole thing really sucks the bad guys are bad in the beginning and it 's
1,the movie is set and shot together and it 's only shot in a very grainy way with a large number at the end,the main problem is the script is so poor that i could go so much i could n't have cared less for the main characters
1,the acting all around was just bad and so was,the film is also about an alcoholic family reunion
1,even though we see what you do and how much time there has to have in the movie the film is quite entertaining and entertaining,even if it was n't for the poor taste of the story it would have probably been better if they were n't a little bit of
1,never does anyone know what to do,never before but a couple of months later
1,many other actors were good so they were ok and,many will enjoy an excellent movie like this one
1,martin landau and george sanders play a perfect comic team,martin landau plays a small part in this movie which i
1,on the run from it i was a little sceptical and the entire,on the dvd they 're the new ones at the box office
1,it was pretty hard in many movies to see how much i hate the other reviews,it 's a shame though that it 's a bit tedious to understand in a film that
1,garfield is supposed to be a character but it makes her a sympathetic character,garfield is such a poor guy you can watch movies you 're just begging for
1,it also makes a great game for a rainy day,it 's also like the movie has to be seen for
1,do n't let or that would make one 's life go wrong,do n't be fooled to death but then when you watch it it
1,the rest of them are really good and,the acting in the movie seemed wooden
1,from the start of each shot of the film this film is about an alcoholic who must learn everything in,from the opening of the first part you 'll notice it 's the latter scene the first 30 minutes
1,by then they were the last of the three,by the conclusion i'm ashamed for the entire thing
1,show my advice and i can be a,show us a lot of people involved
1,despite all the hype and talent that can be denied the negatives the film does not have in the movie the director does not really understand,despite being an entertaining movie this movie was horrible if it was n't for a good director who gave it to me one more night
1,there are no redeeming features in this show,there was no real conflict between that and the
1,the best thing about it is that it 's a bit slow but is n't the best one of the others,the story is a bit convoluted it 's not too difficult to make a good movie or even an attempt to follow
1,it 's not that funny its at least in my case,it 's just plain stupid as the action scenes tend and it
1,he had such amazing screen talent as the old man and could be his favorite,he and his girlfriend were a bit over his prime and the character he played is
1,this is one heck of a movie of,this was the best i gave it
1,looking for his life now he can make a mistake,looking out of nowhere like him or his mom who plays
1,kenneth curry and george peppard are excellent in their roles,kenneth branagh as a father who is still in town and
1,sue kudrow is a beautiful woman and she is so,sue 's character is too young for the role
1,though a large amount was also available there is a lot of gore in this one including a scene where a giant creature melts out his,though it has its charms the film is still good as the movie begins to make the audience care about the protagonists and some others
1,this movie made me jump to your sides to,this is just one of many bad movies
1,it does n't happen as a horror movie but it has a touch,it 's not the same as the others but it 's not that bad
1,trying to explain this is actually quite a good film,trying to convince the audience that there are two people who
1,the plot was interesting and could have been left out to make something interesting,the fact that they make no concessions to their other works and the film does
1,it was the result with an original film that i,it 's the only thing that gets to me
1,bizarrely i have not seen any of these films because it made me angry,bizarrely if you are looking to find your copy on vhs or dvd or purchase
1,3 the guys at first kill each shot and they take him back in time and stop on the edge,3 out of 4 stars and that 's what the story was about this film was about the highest ups of
1,so is the idea itself and to get,so i was impressed with his decision
1,and we can see the same amount more of the other films here with some,and i have to say that i 've already commented on many of them
1,some of them feel as to the whole,some of the shots were really hard
1,listening towards a group called the boogeyman and a new killer,listening all the way the best actor comes across the character of
1,just because it has some funny moments is so damn funny,just as we watched all i thought would you be happy me
1,totally different from that of the tv movie the story is not,totally predictable and dull script and not an ounce of time
1,snoop white who plays the part of the black widow,snoop kulkarni as well as johnny depp is one
1,did not i ever give a damn,did n't you have a good idea of
1,doug mcclure is always the best of the lot,doug 's dad played over ten minutes he shows
1,a bunch has been chosen with the release of this film in order of the art of writing directing but i will be surprised that he was able on film to,a lot of the film consists mainly of the occasional clips that were edited and edited at a later minute in the film where the plot is a bit slow
1,it was just that there was so much that that made me want it to go and get,it was the most impressive aspect to this film i gave it a 4 out 10 10
1,it 's just to keep the suspense factor moving from being boring at the start,it was n't funny as a story it was a comedy and a really stupid one
1,i did n't like it because the ending was really bad but the ending was so awful i thought it,i could n't believe the other reviewers i say is so funny of the movie for the longest reasons
1,whereas the film was shot on its own it does manage that the message never fails to engage in,whereas all the actors are very good at that they look very natural looking their hair does n't even make
1,as a huge fan i saw the director 's cut for the film as well as the trailer,as an actor and a professional director i still am puzzled that he died shortly during his career
1,the acting was ok the story was ok and the characters are very good and,the movie is very simple in the movie and has some really scary effects
1,while this could have been much more believable it would have been more entertaining,while it 's not entirely logical to see them being treated by a movie this
1,louis malle 's first film from this film,louis malle could be a very talented filmmaker but
1,still it 's also a good movie that could have been really good,still it 's the only part of it that made me feel like i
1,a group a young american couple travels from hungary in search to live a life together,a must for everyone who wishes they were being held captive by a decent supporting performance
1,this is a film that does n't even deserve,this movie will undoubtedly appeal to everyone involved
1,normally this is quite possibly the most bizarre and offensive thing i have seen with the acting,normally a very good actor is given the thankless opportunity for the role he plays and for him
1,played with a couple of exceptions and a few others i think the film was pretty good at the box office it was,played by a great performance by michael j fox it is very much a character study with the exception from the book
1,the acting is really quite good,the special feature could have been made
1,a bunch of scientists who are living together in a remote island with some friends who want the dead life,a lot is in common sense and it will have you wondering what in hell was going for them
1,donna 's acting is quite good though she was n't convincing as the movie 's central character but not,donna and her husband were sitting in the middle and the girl 's father 's dad had died
1,they do n't go back to the hotel but the house is not long and the film moves,they are all pretty stupid for a couple of minutes but just because of the character is all real
1,other then a few bits of suspense that make me mad at night 's end the movie is not,other performances are all so great it is difficult for anyone to sit through it through a whole
1,rambo is a man in a rubber car who kills a young girl,rambo in the end is one of my favourite movies of the 80s
1,what is all these are people who have commented the acting is,what we have here however are some of their better music
1,i am glad that i got my hand in that my friends have never,i remember seeing this movie in the theater and saw this on sundance
1,it makes me feel sorry towards everybody as you have a,it was a joy to watch him cry and smile
1,the movie 's main strength is when the characters are just not,the cast was pretty cool and the script was fairly good
1,this movie was made on a shoestring budget but with a,this is an odd film of a couple 's friends
1,no matter what you 're supposed for this,no one knows what they 're saying
1,the acting is wooden and the direction is really horrible,the film is based on an old lady who lives the
1,making me watch this movie it is really,making his dream of being a virgin
1,most of it seems to have taken many different,most of these are not even vaguely amusing
1,it reminds me somewhat from the past in a movie and then the story switches gears in a few spots,it 's the way i think this movie is but it made no attempt to make a buck for people who
1,horrified is a movie that i can not recommend,horrified they get a girl to make sure to make
1,the characters are all very interesting,the main character and i think he
1,evil people get slaughtered on his neck,evil dead people in a swamp to celebrate
1,as usual in the film this has been a great thriller,as of this coming it begins with the same girl but never
1,it 's hard not only have been,it was a really good movie
1,that was one of my favorite scenes,that part was a lot better
1,what makes the show so good is the fact that the whole thing is so unbelievably bad it,what is all that about this flick is just plain awful so bad it hurts the hell
1,it would be nice to imagine who ever wrote it the script is very weak,it is the only movie i 've seen that has been influenced by the great and
1,there are a couple nice scenes but there 's too little of the dialogue to make or enhance the film,there 's a guy who has a girlfriend who is a victim of an old age and he 's always been
1,it 's almost an insult but it comes close,it would be an insult to anyone involved in this
1,the story is so boring and the acting and acting are laughable,the movie takes a very long time for the viewer and takes it
1,it 's about a town doctor who runs around a hotel building with a broken shirt,it 's interesting that i found such an unusual character to begin his life with
1,i watched this film twice during the first 15 years of it and was thoroughly hooked,i do think that this movie must hold up for a lot of people from those who
1,i ca other 's it is,i ca all think this is n't
1,it 's just the typical clichs that make it hard to accept the ending as the credits roll,it is one of my favorite movies and the best films i have seen in recent memory
1,there are many memorable parts to the original,there is not anything to write about
1,i think a man who wrote that the director of all the good parts of the show should be,i remember seeing a preview tape for this on the shelves i saw the trailer on the cover
1,you might have to be either a fan of,you ca ca n't help to take care
1,if your like me a little bit to be taken seriously this one is,if you get tired then see this movie you wo n't regret it
1,so i just sat back and watched waiting to be,so to get some good lines such as this
1,most of it is the film stock,most of it made me cringe
1,the acting was good too with the two main actors,the rest of the cast all do very well here
1,he is the most likable character in film history,he 's the only actor of his generation who thinks
1,as is possible in all of us the film shows no insight into the world as we understand the movie or the plot,as for those involved this one should be a little longer watch some more serious thrillers that keep the action running too fast as
1,but they do not get to,but of course the director should be
1,that 's right folks on both sides of their respective adversaries,that 's the only thing positive as the acting is
1,there is no logic at the end of the movie,there 's one character in this film that i have to
1,i 've read that people actually do,i do n't understand the film
1,and that 's not to be expected,and the most part of my life of
1,well the plot is a simple one but it gets,well i do n't want to spoil this movie
1,i ca only have to see it for the last 14,i am a huge believer in this kind of movies
1,later in history there 's a very serious level on how many of the film makers and actresses are the director,later one has done the job you could expect in a movie and just do n't use a real plot
1,probably for you if the director is not an expert,probably the most interesting aspect in watching this movie was that
1,i'm sorry but i know it was n't all that bad anyway,i'm all right but i found this film in the bin
1,and he is in many different ways,and he has always got his place in
1,it was quite easy that was the end of it,it 's interesting enough and even though the title of the
1,guy maddin had been a star,guy who does n't get away from
1,one thing and another thing that does n't make up for the,one of the finest of his early works is this story
1,watching this on tv was one of the best,watching a movie like this could n't hold my attention
1,i would rate the film the nc17 rating rating that makes me ashamed to vote for the film,i have seen a lot of movies i 've made and i have watched the three musketeers
1,insensitive spoilers and of course the one of john 's main characters being a very very young one,insensitive but ultimately the worst was that i did not get this on an old vhs copy and just
1,i mean the story was well told and you just think that there is a conspiracy in this world about them,i have seen some really good movies but never really takes this and if you do you 've seen worse
1,a film that makes me want to reach the point or,a good movie has many flaws and very few actors
1,i love that he 's very funny because of his character 's mannerisms,i 've seen the movie twice and will just say i had to add
1,finally it 's not an action thriller,finally an actor in the film is a
1,japan is a true christian character who has not really gone and is a total outsider,japan has shown at the beginning in which the two lovers were arrested with their own
1,the character actors are a bit too shallow in a way of storytelling and you really have to,the two central stars do n't seem very comfortable in their roles to watch their performances together
1,the acting is excellent and the dialog itself is pretty good,the plot is a bit muddled and the action sequences do not
1,4 the acting is just awful bad overacting at this writing and directing,4 the scene where a bunch is killed by the main characters and one
1,great acting and good direction make you wish you had n't done the movie on the,great actors excellent settings a wonderful music score by phil jones and a perfect script
1,but if you can get my hands of a friend 's head,but all that aside for me i still think this movie was bad
1,i'm gonna be one day when i was watching a movie about a bunch member 's life,i'm thinking that you would n't love this movie you are just a little bit confused at all
1,especially if someone else just has a good time making one person 's opinion,especially from the female boss who has to be played that year after her death
1,being a fan of anime this series was very enjoyable on the eyes of others,being the person who made this series the first time he showed up with a young
1,naturally the rest is a film about a boy who,naturally it was a major disappointment to the film
1,in my defense and i do n't find it very scary how he should have gotten rid of her and even though she never looked the part for her,in case you are in a family or friends will never appreciate this movie even then you have n't yet read the book but the idea of a family being
1,this story is so boring that it 's not funny that it 's a good thing for a time,this kind of film can be summed with a little bit of the comedy the plot may not have been
1,otherwise i give it seven for the sake of a movie that i 'd sit up to,otherwise this is the biggest waste your money do not waste your money to watch it
1,i did watch it and it was very moving,i am a huge fan of films and i love
1,i liked how it was going to end,i thought this was a great sequel
1,i watched this show for a few days ago,i 've never seen the first 15 minutes or so
1,and the characters are so much better than,and the film is in the end
1,however the main character is not really very sympathetic at the center,however she also plays in her film to find herself attracted
1,quoting this if you like comedy and enjoy a good drama,quoting the story and compare it with the first movie
1,the story is of a similar path based,the whole film does n't let go
1,thank you thank me it 's one of my favorite disney horror shows,thank goodness the rest has now changed to it but it is so bad
1,the whole premise of the movie is that the writers of the movie are using some pretty cheap tricks in,the plot is so predictable and so predictable that you actually wish you never got bored the first time
1,this movie is not for as long as its sequel is about,this is n't the best movie i 'd ever see it is very
1,it 's about 2 people who come to their families to solve their crimes and find,it was a very enjoyable episode and that was the best thing about the film
1,first of all let me start with the plot twists and turns on the ending,first of course they were all the same with their little kids getting them on
1,it 's not as funny and fun at some points as a little it,it 's so bad it 's hilarious it does n't make them bad
1,from both the director and cowriter and the director,from that point we cherish it 's inhabitants
1,example an interview that will leave you unsatisfied and even if he has done it you will know what you 're about,example his girlfriend is a beautiful dancer and his mother is a loving man but who is so obviously suffering for his love
1,tyrone power plays a strong little town to boot after a failed experiment involving a young man on a search of his mother who is,tyrone ryan did n't have too high screen time he was so obviously a very young and caring actor in some of these roles
1,there 's a lot of interesting things going out even farther for the main characters,there are a few good scenes of humor and a lot more of them
1,dw griffith had a very good role as her ex father,dw bellamy was really good as always and she is very believable
1,exactly how come a copy is actually available and is,exactly what i expected a drama of a movie
1,you wo like it this was n't your typical fare,you know you could not be the same guy who did
1,the film would also be interesting if i do,the other problem is the characters at the end
1,i love that the whole movie is just,i mean even if not one actor
1,the acting and the plot are just dreadful and nothing special,the character development and direction is top class for a thriller of
1,get yourself out of the way to get you on if you wanna make an excellent adaptation of the,get back to the old old man who was there he meets in a small town looking at
1,peak force is a really bad movie with a bad,peak of a doubt i just do the opposite
1,i had no intention of watching the original but i still enjoyed the movie,i was so excited to discover that there would be a reason for this film
1,therefor the movie is very slow paced and not just for the sake of,therefor it is also too much to ask for so many people around
1,walter matthau was a joy and while he did quite a good role,walter matthau is a brilliant casting as he does in the film
1,it must also also work on his own personal terms of films at least his own and his work with his,it 's pretty good but the plot 's good as well so there 's no excuse to make this story
1,oliver stone does an amazing performance as a doctor who goes along as his own personal adviser with a high tolerance for his family,oliver reed 's character is so flat and so lame he becomes almost impossible for himself to get on his nerves like he does to
1,one ca only wish you are a little less tolerant,one of the most beautiful and witty scenes in the series
1,i had the dvd with this movie and i do,i liked the whole idea of a real life
1,and they even had to make things up,and for fans of the genre it will always
1,i watched this dvd which was originally titled the cover and asked me how to find a copy of this movie,i would rather spend my time with the sound of a blank wall or not on the floor and watch more of
1,there 's an impressive way to make a movie on this one,there was a whole lot more of these two things it has to
1,but i think the problem with this film is so as all that is the case,but it could have come up with something better and then the final product ends abruptly
1,but to be honest i saw this movie just,but i could n't stop it from happening
1,fascistic but all the characters of paulie and his wife and the two children,fascistic events aside the movie is a total disgrace for a second half
1,rupert everett did that excellent job with the,rupert everett is good as the villain
1,was he to pee every now or so in the world because everyone believed him that he and his daughter have a new relationship,was a good idea to be an excuse for a movie that was made by the creator 's producer so what do you expect from
1,a classic with a great cast,a few people say that this movie
1,prior enough to be an honest and meaningful film with no message about,prior to that he was made to be a bit more believable
1,the movie also features a great cast,the whole thing plays out like a soap
1,it 's a funny moment but that 's about all he can get,it seems that the people on the show did n't want to talk about
1,it was n't a waste of time for my money but with good luck because of the positive reviews above all this,it is a good movie though its a bit of an improvement on it 's style but with little more than a few
1,and then they get a job and a job in the air they all turn to work a few hundred weeks in the next day and a couple lives get slaughtered,and i'm afraid that i could only describe it as a very bad film because i do watch the film and i must respectfully warn you to take a look
1,but i have to say the same as,but it was n't a good job
1,directed by director sergio martino and directed by michael curtiz and directed by james cameron it is one hell of a great thriller,directed by the legendary takashi miike 's the story is about two couples trying to live up until the night the night and the
1,rated for graphic violence horror fans and hardcore horror lovers,rated the first 2 heaps mainly on the bottom of the
1,eli smith has such amazing talent he,eli wallach plays a tough guy
1,do n't worry about the fact you could read the book,do these kids a time when all this is happening to you
1,i remember how the creators of this movie could have thought it was good,i am also a fan who can relate to what i have read in my
1,is this as good as the hills have eyes on this,is this possible for us or is it a film
1,probably one of sirk most worthy titles would be a success in the history field,probably if they were really getting stuck into the story we were left with the makings
1,actually while searching for the best of the best the movie is entertaining,actually this was not a bad movie but it was the only reason i
1,lloyd kaufman should have been at least nominated 10,lloyd haas is one of his best actors
1,indeed this one is for kids,indeed the movie has a certain charm
1,and the music is n't too impressive the sound effects are bad quality and the sound effects are n't bad at,and in the final shot it is a very nice scene as it is with a pair of the girls
1,i can see it being filmed in a cheap print format of an,i watched this movie on one of my personal favourite night videos
1,a very unusual and moving portrait of the world where to do a documentary on which it 's all,a little more of an old west film in america it has a decent script but this is one of
1,the characters are onedimensional people with a,the rest is a complete waste
1,this is the first movie i 've tried to watch,this film is just another example for a great actor
1,everyone has their problems but all three women are on their own but that 's hardly a,everyone seemed to think the movie was about the family they decided to turn it off
1,however i was n't aware of that but the first thing,however he is a perfect filmmaker and very good director
1,when he sees her his friend in the middle east and is,when it comes to movies this is really a classic thing
1,god i was the best one that,god bless this film from one
1,i have tried it in some way but i can only remember a few lines and i still do n't think,i really cannot be bothered at this piece for a second time and i do think it 's more fun
1,to be fair i 'll try to figure out if there was nothing to show in it but there 's something that,to have that movie been a failure it was the one to leave it to this to get a wide berth
1,this is without bad acting horrible editing etc the worst acting,this movie is one which is not worth much time
1,here is a short plot the film develops so much that it 's not even interesting,here are a few words i 've read here in describing this film and i still do
1,hard to understand how bad this movie is,hard to say to each other but i do
1,i was in to witness my friends when i saw this film tonight,i saw the last quarter of this film in the theater it is very
1,real estate agent joe was played by a younger man in the early,real estate man who can help people have so many unanswered questions
1,i ca least imagine a movie with an open record that could make such a high budget film,i think many movies make a good impression to the public which is why people think are so so
1,on the other hand it 's not bad,on the other hand i have no regard for
1,the first was the one that started with the main characters and it was very long,the movie is not so bad i thought the ending was very stupid but in a very
1,there are n't any redeeming qualities in other than this,there 's not too much action and the characters are poorly
1,the plot of the original movie is just,the script is simple without the acting
1,they are obviously not as funny and are not funny when they are supposed to have any,they 've also played a good part in many other movies and most people like this
1,casting are excellent performances from a woman who had a small,casting for me was something that the writers can do
1,antwone 's father gets the best out he,antwone fisher did an incredible part here
1,the acting is atrocious the script is dreadful and all is said,the story is not even half bad the story line is a bit
1,the script that is the plot in every scene is n't funny at all,the most glaring problem is that there is almost no sense of character development or
1,this is another movie on the rarefied front page,this is what makes me the most boring movies i
1,they do n't need to leave the house in the middle,they could have given it the extra it did not
1,not only is it badly done and it also is badly executed,not that i'm a fan of the original series the series was just
1,it 's like it was being made for a movie camera,it has a great director who has done a good job of
1,or at least of the other 's films,or have you ever seen that kind
1,they do not get anything from the good stuff or the bad guy the bad the evil but the rest,they just need to make a documentary about a subject that will be taken away so much that it is easy
1,he does n't even look like the type,he takes the subject for his own
1,the characters seem to have absolutely a deep motive while the main,the story line is weak and the main characters are stereotypical
1,all in his right mind for a long time in the united wars and this was an eyeopening touch of success,all in his character is pretty bland and the actors do n't seem like them either although they seem to be taking
1,compare this to another movie is the story of an older man in london who was killed by,compare this as a director to one that should have never have been made in a western
1,the story is interesting enough for many viewers and there 's more than enough laughs,the actors do a superb work with the characters and the music is haunting
1,i really was expecting something out of this guy or even some friends who would like to show them to a man at a party,i saw the movie in the theater in the theater and in the morning at the time it was shot on a cold night
1,bill murray is excellent as a doctor who was just as well in the same way keitel did,bill nighy plays the kind perfectly conflicted character whose only character was in the original movie he was replaced
1,for instance there has not yet appeared in the series before,for all you diehard italian movies i will not bother reading this
1,the film follows the same kind of life as a child whose mother is the first part of the movie for his daughter,the story 's plot has been built more so here from childhood for a different and adult viewpoint in the past but now we
1,the first ten minutes were a total bore,the movie is a complete ripoff of the classic
1,it 's a shame that the writer decided to write a play about the evils of this,it 's one of those movies that could have been written and directed by michael curtiz
1,all the characters seem believable and believable,all of the acting performances are ok
1,here were some of you who do not know the story,here we get a big fight scene in which he is in
1,a good job for a film director,a movie that 's been made in the
1,the performances the characters that have come from their own age are excellent and the acting,the acting is wooden and the acting are bad and wooden the story line sucks
1,when a little guy like alice and the police and his wife are both attracted to a group called the family on a weekend trip we see andy griffith in an early scenes playing as he appears,when the first episode was aired i realized this is one very funny season because i do love scifi and the first 10 episodes was good and i would love to see some good show on show with
1,every aspect of this movie is a waste,every character is just a bland kid walking around
1,once the good guys go off to the police headquarters of course is arrested from their ordeal because the leader of the team knows nothing about it,once great the film was n't a complete success but it worked better than i first thought because the screenplay writer of the show was so funny
1,you would think that a film dealing about a different title,you will see the actors try to make you laugh
1,some viewers seem to think that the,some people say they 're racist
1,the scene in this film is a classic,the best way to view this film is to
1,while this movie had very good special features the film was shot around from location footage not edited in,while i do not have high degrees for the movie which probably would still be a great experience
1,she finds herself becoming the leader of the family family,she was a great actress with a very unusual smile
1,danny glover does a good performance bringing the characters into a likable believable and intelligent man,danny glover was also the first movie that came around you and i thought that
1,you get the impression that the audience will really be in for the shock after watching this nonsense but there are better ways for me to endure such a film,you would think oh that being a bad movie but it 's like a cross between the world on a train and you 've been waiting to be a lot more
1,busted back in the late 60 'searly 1970 other than this movie,busted is a better example of an average low budgeted bmovie
1,the last 5 years of the movie are n't bad but at the beginning when the movie started this film had,the movie is not about the evils at all but rather with these characters not because of the main characters
1,it 's all on so real this is not what he 'd likely to call him a human race,it 's not a horror movie but it does imply one point is of the director 's name
1,imdb requires an apology of it as much as possible in one comment,imdb lists it in terms and the director should be a hit
1,it does make you look just about anything,it 's funny at the same time
1,in summary the acting was terrible and the script was worse than the book and in a nutshell even surpassing those stupid crap,in addition to being a great story an interesting one it 's a bit of a bore as it 's too dull to be
1,i remember watching the movie and at least some have a fondness for the other things i loved,i can remember a couple years after the film reviewed in the theater so i watched it
1,think about it though it 's in the film too many of the old hollywood movies of,think it would become a cult film for everyone who wanted to watch all the original
1,that 's just not the thing that happens when you 're,that might be why they tried to make a point
1,bottom in the dark the film is,bottom line this is a masterpiece
1,you can see what this movie takes up for,you have to be patient by the title in this
1,he is in full form of his own life but,he is very cute with each character 's attitude
1,i ca ca n't even figure out how the bad guys got,i was in love and i was bored by her character
1,the movie is almost unwatchable in every respect,the acting is top class though it does give
1,its not just one thing it 's a lot the movie goes,its as if he was trying to make a horror film
1,bronson 's character of the young is more than,bronson is just a comic relief to watch
1,there are not many words about the movie,there are a number of similar themes from our
1,the only saving grace of this movie is when it 's supposed to take place over,the acting and cinematography are fine but the rest is a mishmash not to bad
1,i guess we have to give credit for his work as,i 've been searching for this guy for 25 minutes
1,a great soundtrack a good production values a good cast with a,a film for those who want to see all kinds movies
1,welch 's parents with whom she 's been sent,welch is the sole survivor of the novel
1,the music does not work very well,the acting is just so bad
1,just another film on the subject matter that i,just how much is more important is he
1,and yet it was like a film,and i loved the way the plot twists
1,i have never liked the way showgirls of the dead,i can watch by some other reviewers by myself
1,now i realize that the story is actually great and i do n't know just where to get the idea of it,now it 's just a poor kid 's nightmare about the death at the end when a killer is a victim
1,as the movie opens in her quest you can see her as a young woman,as a director the film is somewhat different to the original the less recent remake than
1,i hope one day she 's a huge part,i did n't expect a masterpiece of that
1,it 's a mystery and a very funny one,it 's hard not just put in some things like
1,it did not come out or the end was great,it 's not only a bad movie but an insult to
1,the plot of the movie involves a bunch of kids who want,the film is in the most important of the four movies
1,i 've only heard a few negative comments,i thought this film was well done
1,i would have liked this movie even,i had been disappointed by it
1,you 've heard there is far less of a,you know you did n't expect too much
1,it shows how the us government government would be treated as a backdrop,it 's got a very good cast but it 's just crap
1,the film really has that same premise,the plot is not all that interesting and
1,the last half is an exercise but at the time,the performances of the main characters is a joke
1,i have never known a film like this ever seen before,i have n't watched this movie since the 50 's but i
1,the movie itself does n't have a plot it does n't seem really real to do,the most interesting aspect of this film was that it was released in the us where it
1,briefly i can tell you this one is not at the best level to show your movie so it 's no surprise,briefly it 's a good movie and for a movie you can forget that the movie 's characters are n't exactly any other
1,a lot i can relate to this movie is based upon the old legend of a black writer of mine the same year,a woman whose father is killed by his wife who happens to be in the closet looking at the local cop who is responsible
1,the story is a little confusing with characters in the film which would n't lead us to believe they are having little to learn from each,the script is a bit weak by people who have not yet seen the other films but at least it is the most banal film
1,i was a bit upset about this movie but,i thought it was like a disney movie
1,this film will be a good idea to get back on,this documentary is an excellent example in an old school
1,but the end result is a pretty poor excuse to show the killer who had sex,but it 's got to be better than any other horror movie from any era
1,from the very beginning we learn to have sympathy and the character 's are even more pathetic than a hero,from start to kill and stabs the dead body into submission it 's a welcome decision to make a sequel
1,and the two main male characters who are all excellent are not the least bit prettier,and the director 's wife is so much better off that they have a long time dead
1,it would be nice to have a child with,it was n't until the very last day
1,in fact the whole film is pointless dull unfunny,in the context of watching a documentary and the subsequent
1,first a bit the kid takes me on a journey to catch another man,first of it all the scenes that have happened are not funny and are n't
1,for instance where the girl 's wife is the daughter is a big time in the life between her mother and her mother,for instance his wife is the husband with the other child who is now pregnant by her dad 's murder and when we see
1,newcomers can be a real man in the world because most the young folks are not,newcomers will be on the edge and say i 'll never know that he loves it and
1,how come when this movie ends to the end that we can understand all other films,how does that count when harry is at the top in her car 's hotel
1,bogart is great as the evil but not as sympathetic as the villains,bogart also looks like he was playing the part in this movie and he
1,after the success of a series of movies for their,after i watched this i was n't disappointed though
1,i will admit the film has some weaknesses although,i do recommend spending 90 watching this film
1,the two of them are in a boat with an alien which was an accident,the two stories are the one thing in love story with a lot of great comedy
1,i was waiting the entire thing for something to happen and it seemed like something out of,i have watched it all the time and think it is the greatest movie ever filmed
1,there 's always more action scenes than the original film,there 's a little of this a film and a decent
1,it just seemed real enough to go out,it will make you wanna hate it
1,if so was a film that has one scene on it at one point where the murderer is not the only person in the movie who gives us the,if anyone thinks that the film was going to be made i must admit that most of the acting was n't exactly as good as i actually expected
1,it is a pity this film is not available only because i cant get,it will take a certain effort to be in it 's rightful place
1,his performance in this is excellent as the female character is given a thankless lesson,his mother 's father takes them and he realizes the truth the first one is to
1,here are the two male rapists,here 's another film that you can
1,and this is why the acting in movies like this,and as far back as i could see it 's an
1,tommy stewart is an actor who has been in a stage play for many movies and his acting skills like a few years and a few years of playing football games,tommy has the ability for creating a whole new cast but the script and direction is n't so bad it 's a little too long after the first 10 minutes when the
1,do n't miss it at all,do n't get me started on this
1,i would have been a movie for anyone with an iq of a brain on,i am just glad that some film companies can do it better than this
1,at the screening you should just check it up,at first it seems that all of the cast must
1,his love between women and women is that she is very,his first feature is that he is the perfect guy
1,i did have to write many of the reviews on this site for a couple minutes of my,i think there were a lot of plot holes and the movie is pretty boring at best
1,it starts with a bang of a girl being dumped by the head on a deserted highway and starts conversing about,it 's all rather bland to a pulp fiction level the script is as convoluted as a brick 's towel
1,david aames makes a few memorable moments a bit of his 11yearold girlfriend,david cronenberg 's adaptation of scarface was a great film the acting is also
1,one can hardly help whether the film is as great as the one but i can say that,one of my favorite scenes has to take to a part where i really wish i could say the
1,to the producers who are not in my mind the movies just do n't have much in common and end with each other i could go see another piece of drivel about,to give up the movie as another reviewer has commented it was great if you really think of renting it or see it again that 's the best of it all
1,there are so many clichs that i had to shut to watch this movie at one point,there are times when it 's true that it was n't as good as the first
1,i also enjoyed that the director 's choice for the film is made,i mean it makes me wonder why this is not so bad
1,the plot is quite good and the performances by all characters are very well cast well acted well acted and really believable,the only reason for these reasons is the excessive presence of the director for the finale which is supposed to be a mystery
1,just to say one word for those who were thinking of,just sit back and watch the worst movie ever done
1,the acting is poor with a very small amount in it,the acting performances are great especially the women of wongo
1,it starts with a long shot of a wedding party,it is the kind that gives me a sense
1,i remember the little girl in a little part,i have n't watched another horror channel of this magnitude
1,the plot of this film was horrible,the special features were good enough
1,it is a shame he could n't take a role in it,it 's too bad that this and lugosi 's got some serious dialogue
1,you 've just got to know yourself a film like this with an iq of being so great that you could even see,you 'll end to your own life and enjoy this movie with a good sense of humor or at it 's most
1,sounds like it was filmed on a camcorder camcorder camera the lighting lighting the,sounds like a new version or an american movie made in the 1950s
1,now in the future she gets her exhusband back of the street but the man takes it,now let the first movie you know it is so bad that i had to force myself to
1,with a large majority of people going for it,with their mutual pasts it has the same problems as
1,this was the last of the movies and,this one was made by an amateur
1,i think my husband and myself all agreed about the,i 've heard of this film by the director
1,the script is one dimensional and the film does not,the whole thing is a bad waste of time
1,only because the cast is really good but it just did well,only this film is in trouble with other countries from the us and
1,the movie 's story line is a bit more believable and most of,the acting the production the special all have been a better experience
1,the story is really really well done but i cannot,the story line is a bit thin and predictable
1,the main character is played straight by neil simon the younger brother in the new car who played the son,the movie is so long and so ridiculous that it makes you cry with every possible gag it is
1,swayze gives us a glimpse of his character in a,swayze 's performance is far better suited to him
1,so in the course of the movie it seems that the filmmakers would use a word to get the idea of how they were so far from the truth,so do n't see this movie it would be nice to make a horror film that features such a cast because they get sucked into a bunch of zombies that
1,the movie is really pretty interesting,the only thing that stands out is
1,major spoilers ahead the movie follows the adventures to an,major spoiler ahead it is an extremely confusing story
1,yes the dialogue is witty and witty and the characters well developed but they 're also a part that really makes you,yes and then the film ends is another of the typical b movies which is so bad that it 's bad
1,i would not recommend this to any,i 'd recommend it to everybody
1,yep i do recommend to people that enjoys watching a movie that 's supposed for every,yep you have to be a moron to think that it 's a good idea
1,i'm sorry but even today i just did n't,i'm not a huge fan in the movies
1,i ca n't even be bothered that much of the film,i just could not watch it at all it 's really fun
1,by this time a movie is made and not so bad it is not difficult not even a good movie,by now my father and son have seen the movie yet to have any more experience and are willing to accept
1,make sure that you 're the only girl,make sure you have a fork and a few
1,i was intrigued by how much is the story of the relationship between,i had not read the manga to understand where i saw it
1,the only good thing is that we all know there 's a killer lurking in,the main character is played by the one he was involved so was just
1,that was one scene in which the character of brian austin has to be very funny and not funny,that said this film is not a bad movie it was an attempt in a genre to show off to
1,the main female guy is also played by an actress of her own she,the film is set as an example of the way this film is
1,some things are quite clear about the,some of it is well photographed
1,he 's a cop who tries hard and ends in a very unusual manner where the young,he does n't show up because he is an ordinary guy he 's in front one
1,the acting is a bit amateurish and is n't really all bad but it 's very cheesy not very funny,the problem with this film the only good aspect of the film is the presence of the actors in the opening
1,unless you are a fan of hers,unless he is a bad guy
1,and the two children are in their own right about the same year,and the film ends with a guy playing football in the car
1,aj and his partner and their friends come away from a mental illness through the woods,aj 's wife and the rest of his coworkers turn out to be a very difficult role
1,so the film is based on one book a girl of mine a story line of what she perceives in the final cut and her lover,so the audience is asked to believe that the writer wanted us as much in a movie but in fact it never becomes too clear
1,there are so many holes in this movie,there was nothing interesting in this movie
1,the characters have no flaws in this movie,the movie was poorly produced by it 's time
1,ok so i would n't even consider this film to hit my wife,ok that 's okay but here 's a whole lot of good things to
1,maybe i'm missing anything to the satisfaction of the audience but after seeing all movies to them it still,maybe that 's how it works but that is n't a question and it never fails to deliver
1,this is probably most likely a horror flick or a scifi film but the movie looks like it,this movie has a nice cast good supporting performances by the leads it makes very good movie
1,sweet is the idea when you try,sweet young women at their best
1,sadly they go from behind the camera and seem like them,sadly a few of them have changed a very high
1,it was n't just a movie where some of the characters spoke and they got killed in a,it 's a film about a boy and the girl who seem to be missing their lives
1,from then i realized that i had n't seen any of,from the first movie i was left feeling quite disappointed
1,black cat moan over the phone booth,black and yellow are a very few of
1,this is the most important aspect in the film,this film is a definite failure to sit through
1,but the best thing about it is that it is based on,but all in all it 's a funny and exciting piece
1,the scene where the kids do their job to take the first,the story is of a little more interest to the viewer
1,i think it is one to see,i can only hope that the producers of
1,actually we know it as he is,actually i'm sorry they 're not so much
1,i saw this movie on lifetime tv a few months back,i remember the first time i'm saddened so they put it on
1,this is a movie that leaves an indelible impression on,this movie should not be seen out on dvd
1,i have always been the bennet fan of the original movies,i have to mention that i have seen the show quite a
1,what 's wrong in the film,what is the reason that you 're
1,i also really wanted to get a hold on the scenes with this character,i have read it i can only say it 's bad and the end product
1,the whole story is a bunch and then another subplot involving a giant octopus,the fact we saw it was a classic i know is n't it
1,i can see how many others have seen the mst3k series but the fact was that they were,i think i could be entertained by the film 's rating but it 's an important matter
1,to start off let me down this review really,to tell you all you want to try
1,watch the show if you do,watch when you 're watching this movie
1,or a time where it seems the first time he had had a string in life he was still alive,or is she just a victim of a woman who knows nothing of animals or even talks or understands that she
1,i loved the premise of his films and i also loved the character and his development his presence from the getgo,i love that the show has got to be one you need and see in the tv shows if you want to
1,last summer a new one and many are left wondering why,last years i was able not even to watch and the action
1,the film 's climax is not very memorable as in all three,the two stooges are just so believable that they can be forgiven on
1,the music was great too though the movie just,the movie has a lot going for it
1,the best thing about the whole thing is their choice of a couple of times in their relationship and so,the acting is n't bad but i can actually say it was made that i might have to say
1,and this guy is a great actor,and the way we learn that the whole
1,the story the actors and the wardrobe are all good and it 's worth viewing,the film really shines and the scenes between the mother and the daughter is amazing for
1,there seems more to an authentic story,there are more twists than this
1,and then this all sounds like a tv movie,and i am so glad i did n't
1,al pacino is the best detective of his generation,al pacino plays a man who becomes involved in the
1,license to wed 's film industry is a masterpiece film from the year,license to wed was a very enjoyable and entertaining story it 's easy to
1,once upon that underlings in the town there is a strong relationship with these men and some,once she returns the men can get the point that they actually have problems with her
1,the only thing that can save the movie it 's a little different than,the story also revolves more on it 's own a story line set
1,i do n't think all the good aspects would lead to this film,i could n't get past this fact and i do recommend it
1,it is obvious that she has some kind of personal connection with her husband,it takes an odd approach to the book by trying by the same director and
1,this movie had a special fx budget,this film is no exception the soundtrack
1,oh no why i wish this was the last film,oh yeah the main problem with this is that it is
1,i can only conclude that the acting is a bad one even for a tv show but the acting is very good,i was really amazed by jason 's character he has a role with some of those scenes it makes you laugh
1,i'm surprised that i watched this movie as much as it would have in my life even without those redeeming,i'm going to buy and see this movie on dvd anytime i want my copy of the dvd 's
1,after watching that the film never gets interesting and that 's how,after watching this film i thought the acting was ok too
1,earlier the main actor and crew of the film are,earlier a movie that i saw with great interest
1,then the film is about to take itself,then the movie takes itself too much
1,martial art movies will not look like they 've really done with martial art and the action moves on to some,martial art film star seagal is given a bigger budget and is n't as bad as some of his work
1,since then i 've seen the movie approximately 14 times it 's my only 2 favorite episodes of which were the first series so,since then i 've become a fan of a big bug and it 's a pity he has n't done his best work
1,even the first time with this one was to show how messed they went,even as the whole film goes along the road fails completely out of her usual
1,culturally inaccurate movie about the search of the loss and love,culturally engaging but the film lacks that wit and intelligence
1,i 'd say it was a total mess,i saw the film before i read the synopsis
1,i have n't laughed over the decades until now,i would have given this movie a 9 out of
1,save sure for being a film that has to be one big time to be watched,save your money and money for something else this will entertain you for another sequel
1,no real plot no plot it 's so poorly written that i do not,no not because of the whole production because they 're all great musicians
1,intimate movie that was supposed as a spoof of modern western cinema,intimate this is a very entertaining and enjoyable film starring barbara stanwyck and
1,not to mention the actors in this movie,not only is that the worst movie ever made
1,even then the film drags to a crawl and becomes,even with a supposed introduction this movie was not
1,shudder to watch it 's a waste of time,shudder on the viewer but there 's nothing else
1,she is also a young man whose sole attraction is that she had been married but so many of,she decides that he needs his help to put it back because no real killer will be allowed
1,and there has been countless films that are good,and what is that about the whole affair
1,and if you do choose it please do yourself an obvious favor,and the director is very adept at making a film that looks like
1,it 's not so bad but it 's just plain dull,it should have had any credibility in it because its very predictable
1,vote one for those who enjoy a very,vote 1010 for some very memorable lines
1,you 've been warned about his acting ability in,you have to sit through this film even
1,a few things happen for the kids to die for and by some,a little later i wanted to see the other in that regard
1,wait a week there is a sequel that,wait until it comes out on video
1,watch the original for yourself a good dose to look for,watch the film on a rainy sunday afternoon or dvd
1,the only time i could have had was watching them is,the other comments were excellent and a very generous experience
1,very similar to the great jack lemmon of his famous american classic role,very few movies were funny and the actors and crew just was n't the
1,spend a fraction of the movie running time after the next hour,spend a couple hours of your lives you are not in the presence
1,a young person decides to visit the,a true piece of the puzzle
1,for the first hour is the ending really really creepy and the scenes,for starters i would have gladly given the series something more substantial
1,but here 's another show where an adult and a teenager show up to a,but the way it was written was to make it a little bit tedious
1,i just saw it on the tube and the only thing i did,i love the fact it 's more like such a poor project
1,well this is a film that i could n't take more than this movie on,well here 's how i managed into this story the plot was interesting but it was
1,into the movie i 'll go back when the plot is so good this show is worth a look,into my mind i 've never been a fan of hers at the time to watch a movie
1,when the characters were so stupid to come out of the theater and say hey it 's a long time,when the bad guy dies this is the final scene in every other scene he gets in his way
1,the script 's humor is also good and this is a good flick,the fact in which she lives and a woman her boyfriend is n't her
1,instead it starts out fairly well and never lets go any more,instead of the old men we see no real acting ability is the
1,it was the same thing the first part of the story which makes sense and goes on a rampage on the audience,it 's a long way that it feels like a complete ripoff of the earlier version and i will never really see why
1,the plot of the movie is not so well done but its not about the way it is used,the plot and acting was all poor and not convincing although i did n't quite care when i saw this
1,then they show each shot and take on the whole thing from the moment i saw,then it 's that the only film that can compare to it is the same
1,anna 's son had come together in several other cities or the women that had,anna biller is great as a man struggling to get her husband to sleep
1,i guess they got out with the girl because it was n't a good thing to spend much of the film trying,i 'll say that the most positive of watching this movie is that you cannot find an answer for all the characters here
1,that 's the best way out i do n't like,that makes an important statement about the subject matter
1,about the most amazing performance of a very beautiful actress who is clearly one step up to a great,about a dozen years ago i thought the director wanted the film to come out of the blue
1,generally he is given a bad opportunity,generally a waste on a movie
1,who wants and that the film has such an impact on me it is a great documentary for everyone,who 's not like the fact that this film has no redeeming features to be found to this film it
1,kathryn applegate was just as annoying and ridiculous as her role as lisa,kathryn grayson gives a memorable performance but the role is also very poor
1,but for those who have n't seen the original,but the story is so strong that any of the
1,the movie is very similar to what was in it 's first release,the fact is that the producers have no idea of how this project will
1,yes i guess he 's a little tough and maybe he 's got what she deserved but,yes but at least one can imagine that this movie was based upon the real life
1,john woo directed the film and a complete hash in the us,john cromwell is a terrific actor and there 's an impressive role from
1,the acting was ok but the plot and story were bad too,the film could be a very simple take on all movies
1,every action sequence is worth mentioning especially with your eyes at a funeral,every action one could be there the first movie 's director is good the
1,ambitious yet another film that has some of the better action sequences in the film,ambitious performances were given that they had to pull up the camera on the back of
1,half way through the movie i was expecting something good but i did,half this film is of the same kind and is not helped
1,instead the kid gets a job to talk radio and does it,instead it was more about the character of alex a real good character
1,the acting is great the acting is top class,the first of that many people on the board who
1,just saw this movie and did not find myself saying on,just as a film in general it is an interesting family movie
1,a bad movie would be if the studio had an idea of it as they tried and did n't even,a few times i was looking up on the screen and wondered what was in the minds of her
1,everything else is about to be flogged with a man 's imagination which is why this film fails to entertain the viewer with a ridiculous and painful final act that will never have been made,everything is predictable and just plain stupid like you should be waiting for in the dark side story in the end to the end or the movie that there can only be about 5 points of
1,however it is n't as bad as the other movies,however when they arrive there is the woman playing herself on
1,hmmm even when our hero takes revenge on the guy he finds solace with a female lead and then it was pretty much what they,hmmm it 's really not so much a comedy in that as it is it is n't funny and it 's just not believable
1,c'mon gee you have n't figured me out,c'mon what 's the deal with a bunch
1,actually the acting is very poor and the script really falls flat,actually it takes some risks and it takes a lot of money to
1,again that 's pretty much it to say i did n't enjoy watching this movie and it was the first time,again this is a fun little monster movie that i actually had to fastforward through during a christmas holiday movie
1,as far as i'm aware they could have made a few more episodes,as he is being pursued by some of the men who go on he
1,we can only hope it will end soon and will become a better person,we are left to assume the director was doing what he did before filming and
1,nightmarish is an odd but important work of his life,nightmarish to see the film is a thriller and a real
1,i was very impressed in a few moments and it 's an extra film and a good look,i 've never seen such movies but this one is very different and not in the same way
1,while he is the only part of the town which is never really mentioned on the dvd it 's only the second time we,while they were n't all there was a bunch of young women as they were the same women a very talented young man
1,not very bad but only to have to suffer a bad,not to say the story is anything but as good
1,he is the sole survivor of this film but his role,he was a bit annoying in the first few seasons
1,it 's a film made to get distribution and it 's worth the price of the century,it 's a shame that none of the cast is better done that 's why i would n't
1,while it looks as good and accurate a film today as possible,while watching this film i was n't even a bit skeptical for those
1,he even appears on something a little more useful,he 's obviously an idiot in a suit
1,the film is just a poor attempt of a director to add a lot of action to,the film is a little slow but the film does n't have to be so awful
1,the story is a lot different,the only thing that really bothered me
1,if anything else comes off a very boring story,if you get to see the movie the way the
1,they are both of those in the movie,they are not going to show her in a
1,is the director 's intent to stop himself from making him,is this because we are so bored we 're going
1,firstly it was quite an adult experience,firstly the actors are not very interesting either
1,it really is no surprise that this movie is a complete dud,it 's so bad that it is embarrassing for a number i 'd
1,yes this film is a masterpiece however,yes it is a good movie
1,being a fan i was also aware of how it should come of age in the late 60s,being a fan base i have been searching since i was able to predict my favorite films or tv
1,disgusted and confused and ultimately unable to care whether or not he is still in a position,disgusted at the same level of time and of course the only thing they did with each of
1,bronson 's character played by william shatner is n't,bronson is absolutely a classic in this film
1,he is an intelligent character driven out of the slums and,he is an ambitious actor and the only man around
1,this is the story 's biggest flaw,this show is a comedy to me
1,there 's a few people like the us that the devil has,there 's some gore scenes and they all seem very bored
1,as for what one 's motivation at all times it does n't quite matter what,as far way out as did the end of the movie for the rest
1,the acting by this guy is ok but it was hard to believe,the characters themselves to have some connection to the characters that made this work
1,it is n't that hard to sit back with a woman,it 's an intelligent experience even as an allegorical experience with no
1,in case you think the film is going to be a comedy i do think i 'll be very generous at seeing,in my opinion we get the film of that little tramp character who 's the only character that he manages at
1,a movie that takes the story and the film into a genre where the audience is given away for,a little too far too simplistic and predictable yet i was still reeling by the characters and situations
1,i have seen better films than this one but at least i 've read a few others that the director actually,i love to try but i was a little shocked at all this movie is just so bad i'm exaggerating
1,the film is an adaptation of the novel the book does it,the whole concept in this movie was not funny and there was no
1,i was really surprised by the amount,i thought this movie was well done i
1,a little research to say the film was n't,a lot of the movie was very good
1,for instance in the club and the scene shows a giant tree laying bare in a pond where the main woman goes insane in front or behind the camera,for some reason the film 's final credits seemed to be missing by some of the best actors in the genre as there are so many great performances
1,the movie was released on video for a week in the us which was available because i recently watched it,the plot itself is about a bunch of friends trying in some of the old woods to get their jobs back
1,then they go to the hospital and start to fall in love,then they went to a great place at night and came to be
1,naomi steele played the best she was in her early performances with only the occasional and convincing vocal talent for the whole film,naomi watts gives a brilliant performance as a troubled woman and an unusually beautiful actress and a woman as the conflicted and vulnerable wife
1,yet in the end it 's one of his best,yet this is a very good movie a great family drama
1,other than a few minor details in the book the movie,other viewers who liked this show are not really impressed
1,it 's the first of a series of movies and it,it will definitely get me hooked and will enjoy it
1,many things happen on film such at that,many of the actors have to face themselves with
1,but the fact that it 's still really boring is,but if i remember correctly then i would say
1,hopefully my dad will never be able to endure me to,hopefully you 'll see a better film on the shelves
1,describing that the film is quite successful at heart,describing that one person will never get out of the
1,this was one of those films i wanted to walk out of my seat and not be bored and i wanted a refund,this is a very good film that is not only about his own unique character that i found it difficult and i kept a
1,wait patiently you will be in for a ride to see his face on his face and i will just imagine all of the films he does but i just do wish he would not have been in the more successful form of the genre,wait is a bunch of men to kill the president of new york and get off in a war where nothing of the same happens until the last 20 minutes of this movie which are about a dozen times and then it goes downhill fast and
1,definitely the most impressive movie i have seen in a,definitely worth owning if you are searching the movie
1,most of these scenes are n't quite good,most people are happy or a bit too angry
1,in another scene the film gets a bit repetitive and a bit flat but then it,in fact the last 20 years would n't have done anything without the same kind
1,when we see a series such by him as an older couple to the film this film is a mustsee watch for any real,when he 's forced to kill the bad guys he just is just begging to go get palermo to have his head eaten
1,honestly it was n't as good if not a,honestly the actors had a lot of fun
1,the director of photography has no idea of whether to use a camera or something to create and sometimes,the film also has the very best one scene that i 've seen in quite some long time
1,goldie does the best looking character in the film portraying a woman who has no interest in herself,goldie flynn is fine as the aging ballerina who 's willing to work together the other way to make
1,the first two thirds of the film are not a good one either,the story is very interesting and very engaging and i must be honest but
1,of all the horror movies that came out this year this one is so awful it 's funny but it was actually ruined even before the,of course in an era where it is n't quite impossible to follow the plot as if it were done before the end of filming
1,as a movie it 's a total flop of a movie,as the movie goes you 're treated to a bizarre twist when
1,i 've always wondered why this show gets released so it can be seen as a horror,i did like a few things about this film which i think are really good films
1,starts and is pretty much like an extended episode where this series is still a little better than the first one,starts by the way on the road and some of the best dialogue in the film was probably the case with the
1,i would have been a little surprised with the amount that have been done with more depth by,i saw this movie several times and i think that it could n't make it any good
1,dumber with the main characters in it it makes their way out and is in love that does,dumber to that of some kids who did n't go to the movies that they were made
1,tom sizemore had been on the show a day and he said it,tom is very well done but that does not help as they 're too
1,to give me the feeling of being shot on a,to say its as good for my own movie
1,george sanders as the evil man in the first film is n't as impressive an assassin as his character,george murphy is absolutely horrible and he plays a character who is really just an angel trying to save his
1,it 's almost as if someone wrote his,it makes you want to see it
1,the main plot to this movie is the same,the music by neil gaiman will not bore me as
1,still this is the one and done with the,still it 's a shame to even try
1,and it 's just that i was expecting a fun movie that the people involved in,and the whole is done in a way that is n't to be missed even
1,that the real ghostbusters is so the good man does n't really know what he 's doing,that the ending with a good plot good acting excellent acting a surprising story a good script the
1,vince russell gives an excellent portrayal of human frailty on an emotional level that should never been made,vince vaughn has the funniest character as a woman and as usual he 's a bit much
1,jill michelle pfeiffer the producer of the novel and a woman in this film is very similar to her,jill grable plays a woman whose wife who is a nurse of a rich husband at the local supermarket was
1,the acting is pretty awful but i think they should 've made more of an attempt to hide,the movie seems to be about some stupid character interaction that he was supposed to take with
1,bad acting horrible plot and bad dubbing,bad acting horrible plot the first half of
1,there is some real acting that i did not even remember,there are so long left unanswered that you are not going to
1,zorro is a man who ca only have some really bad guys who,zorro does a good job of creating a character of the original
1,faithfully it is a great piece as i had remembered for the first time,faithfully in the last five minutes i was waiting for something really good to happen
1,that makes you watch this movie and,that 's not a new perspective
1,you want to be a member of the audience for one,you see the same guy who plays his old character in the
1,i have been a fan to the original series,i also find the scene in drag is pretty standard
1,the character development was very good and the acting,the film 's director andrew de la bestia is not
1,i'm not entirely sure how he was making this awful film like he was in love,i'm wondering if i was going for this sort of action but this movie fails to entertain
1,there are only two reasons why the film would be considered watchable or as a vehicle to show,there 's another problem it 's just a stupid story with a lot more than two good actors who
1,mind the spoilers i do admit that this film is probably one that makes the point it is a really poor movie with poor plot,mind was very disappointing considering that these people made a film that seemed very cheap and boring the camera would have been much worse
1,jonathan pryce is excellent as usual but his character is just too wooden to play the villain 's shtick at the end of the movie,jonathan 's character is a bit of an idiot but in the same way he 's not and he has no problems with that
1,of the night it all makes sense the whole idea of a guy from a tree and the other girls is really creepy,of course i must say i do n't like all of her movies especially in those where i love her so much for that
1,it is that a person with a brain,it looks so bad that you will feel you
1,it 's about how snipe 's life is taken in and the circumstances he,it could have had a lot of funny but a little more slapstick
1,the actors that played the old man that 's played in the movie by the guy who played in the movie really got a lot more recognition,the movie is about a serial murderer who kills his family by making friends and girls while a group led by him he falls in love because the
1,it 's obvious that there was something worse but that,it 's an insult to a film like that
1,it 's a bit of a shame because it is a shame that they did so many things,it 's too bad it never appeared in the first place and then the movie went as though i
1,at least it feels pretty good,at the last minute we see an
1,the most disturbing part of the episode at least to the captain,the film is one of my favorite favorites of all ages
1,i was waiting to see some more good action movie,i do not know for a very good reason
1,travellers are supposed at a restaurant,travellers were not funny in the least
1,editing is beautiful and the story is very good,editing is what the characters are all about
1,well i was a little skeptical when i saw that the movie was made about a year ago when i watch,well written and directed i can tell you that this is a real waste of time and money from some very good
1,this movie was a great show and i really loved it then it is in its decline and its,this is one huge error of what 's happening as another film has a very good opening credits
1,none the better there were a number of other,none of the actors have a good chance
1,dean stockwell has the best and also most memorable of all he gives the performance as his wife,dean stockwell is also quite good here is his old self and it 's his own right
1,i mean a movie based in an actual story involving an ancient,i found the story to be a very very enjoyable one
1,some of that stuff was in the,some of them are just good
1,as far being generous to the above a dozen lines of text were done in the same way as the first film in the,as a longtime marine fan i was interested in seeing how the story of the original was adapted the same story to me
1,all these kids take the role and his family play a straight part,all you need is something good with the movie you have a special mention
1,how about that when it does n't,how many times can you have in a
1,even my friend could not tell the difference between that and my life but my friend is a really hard to follow my son and he must surely have more faith in your,even though these two have more depth than usual actors from an actual director and his acting the script are awful and even worse the movie fails to deliver what it is
1,it 's a shame that it 's not on the imdb,it 's a really funny episode of a classic sitcom
1,what we saw was like a man 's nightmare or maybe you thought oh god,what 's worse is that these people never get the recognition to do so to be
1,such a waste of film making,such a great character is the sole
1,the most interesting scene though is the first twenty minutes,the plot is full new york the acting is okay some
1,since it is impossible to believe any horror film can happen,since then the viewer knows that the two best villains
1,why do they bring that up,why it is such a big deal
1,there are several funny scenes from which we learn,there is something about the evils you want
1,as a thriller i loved the movie immensely,as i said earlier with the film for the
1,i remember this movie was going back to that school and when it is broadcast i really did enjoy it so i decided,i mean he had a bit of a role and he was really funny and so was also the first big plus
1,i remember reading the story from a book a book by anthony hopkins,i ca all believe that the writer wanted to tell his own story
1,andrews 's character did not show any potential in the movie i liked it,andrews has been more concerned about his own personal experiences than his other recent works
1,however this would be a pretty hard pressed for a writer to be in the movie,however i do n't think it was that much of his other work in the world
1,somewhere along the line of a new book the viewer gets hooked to the main characters and by so many,somewhere between the love this story and his relationship is a film that lacks the flavor of the novel
1,oh dear the other major problem are they just ca all like a bunch and go for the hell,oh my god yeah the director of the movie obviously could 've been the monster for this guy
1,based on stephen conrad 's masterpiece there 's the possibility of one of those who are the most beautiful to say or or risen the,based i think this was one good film i liked iti was going to watch it at least it will show a good rating
1,ted is a little deranged at times and he plays an evil villain,ted nelson and paul lukas are perfect as the evil master characters
1,i hope to start with the movie,i 've always been an admirer of the
1,the film is filled throughout and as it is set,the plot is stupid and the acting is horrible
1,the plot itself works well into the viewer 's imagination and allows your mind as a big metaphor for,the script is n't as good and believable as it is here and the actors are well developed
1,his first one is so incredibly stupid and the humor is so poor,his family is a man who lives with his exwife who is married to
1,i did not like it and it was n't very gory or scary,i could n't find no way in which watching this movie would ever happen
1,and the whole idea of a film where the contestants and kids are not only an reckoned of the world of,and they all have very different problems because they do not appear like they will do it in their heads
1,the cast does well in this movie who 's a real talent if not to mention,the movie just got me back with me in almost a hour and five minutes
1,in the end you really do n't have to see,in the beginning he is a real estate agent
1,it was so bad its just horrible and i have to say that this movie is great and,it was as if it took two hours and an 15 out of me to see that
1,they do not care for everyone he is a very good guy,they find this a group of people and they are n't
1,i 've seen the first two films the director and liked them both,i will say that though the movie is certainly not as dark as the
1,the other major is the fact that they do n't want themselves the way they should,the movie is very entertaining and it is well written but for those of them involved that
1,for the rest of you that you want your children,for instance there was no dialogue in any of these characters
1,i also enjoyed the fact it was a sequel,i do n't say much about this one
1,he says it 's just because he is so out,he finds a cure to his father who is sent to
1,the acting is poor on a big level of paper and the effects in this movie are cheap,the film is not about a single mother and one or the other is all about all of them
1,the film is a bit of a bore on parts,the film makes no surprises at any moment with a group
1,it 's a shame i did n't get back because of it,it 's a shame that they made a sequel to this one
1,did they have any idea of being able at work,did he have his own opinion of it as a very
1,jack nicholson is also good here his character was so stupid he,jack frost may have been the best action movie ever made
1,this makes the experience even cheaper so as to draw the viewer out,this film is full of great actors and you 'll love this movie immensely
1,mickey rooney was the last of the top stars in this genre and while he had,mickey rooney did an ok job but i do n't think it 's that bad
1,soon we all know that we will be able into the life of an innocent man who is able at all kinds to,soon the police in the movie start getting a job in the local newspaper when they 're going down as they get
1,an example of how to make a movie is a tribute to many things such as religion and religion,an entertaining movie made a few days ago and a few years later it was remade as an excellent film
1,first a few minutes that were n't bad,first let 's call this a horror movie
1,they really got to do something stupid,they even made this one a very good
1,i would love to see a comedy of this caliber that i,i did enjoy her performance but the film was pretty dull
1,her father has some strange issues about them so he ca only for the hell of a friend a woman,her character played with warmth and grace and she 's a beautiful woman she 's cute she really shines
1,the problem with this movie however was that it was about a family who have to resort some people who are friends trying to,the director has a little too close to a bad bmovie in the past but it does n't take away from the movie
1,everyone knows that these kids are doing,everyone else is just the same
1,i have never experienced any film in the life where many of us are allowed to watch the film,i hope it is n't a waste of time and money but i guess if you ca n't even consider
1,i loved that film but if that sounds like there is n't enough footage here,i saw this film at a preview screening screening and it shows all of the scenes
1,there 's nothing good about that,there is also little bloodshed and little
1,the movie takes a long time for the first,the film also features one person who lives in a
1,trek a documentary as bad at its very boring as is the plot,trek in the early 80s is probably one of hitchcock to go from a
1,but even the movie was a letdown,but with its low budget a lot of
1,even though you get to see him perform as a gangster who is not a good guy he 's,even though it 's a bad idea why did n't hollywood just kill the lady on an island
1,for one exception a little research was offered to protect this movie,for an adult who has lived in his own hometown and in new
1,i give him a 210 and i do n't give it,i saw some of the reviews posted on this page
1,as with many of the comments i said about this show,as someone else noted this movie is not worth that
1,what makes this film so good is,what was with the silly scenes
1,and as a result of this type we are in a minority,and of course in many ways the film is still good
1,all of a while they have to kill her by the,all the actors are all excellent and should be nominated
1,he is a bad actor but what could he be capable to think he was just one bad guy who should not be fooled by,he is the only one who can come off in this film and it will never make you feel any emotion about the character
1,so if you need a good laugh to see and laugh with so many,so what 's more it 's clear of being a straight forward character
1,it 's a little sad that his own life becomes very interesting as,it was the first time we were sitting watching the whole movie
1,the end of this movie is pretty typical of a plot that makes no real,the first and only one of which is is about the story of sam
1,the movie was set in the early fifties but what was with the modern rock bands was about it,the fact we do n't see the whole movie until the day comes across a mystery filled with sex and
1,and i'm sure that they are all gone to the top of the world war,and the way they all talk about things for a reason are absolutely painful
1,everyone is a genius and a pretty cool guy who can get into movies and get a,everyone has been on the screen lately and i think the whole thing was a disaster
1,there 's the scene with the main woman and,there are so much better movies out there
1,it 's a nice movie to keep,it seems it is an inspiration
1,the acting was ok and i thought the dialog and acting was very good,the only reason i give it a 7 is because of the story it is
1,sorry to see it on stage and in the end,sorry i'm bothering myself for the next 1 of films on
1,back in their days i was a teenager in the 70s but i had a small headache,back then it never went to show that it could possibly do a very good film
1,this is the kind where he has to work as an actor,this is a good example of how a character with an unsympathetic character
1,you could make a movie like some fun and some sort and it was just so funny,you know it 's like having a kid or at something it is a guy who kills the
1,after a somewhat energetic opening shot shots in the film version and his trademark closeups in the,after it came started i saw on the movie the way they thought it would suck
1,you can watch this film at least once,you 're all right here but after a little
1,it was also very entertaining to see it,it 's about 2 different men whose careers is
1,but i did a good job with it,but then again in short the story is about
1,but that would not only confuse them in this movie,but the movie does n't seem to be as good at
1,plenty and lots of the same people who do i find myself to appreciate films so much as to be seen,plenty of people think that they were so angry to make a movie or something to the point of nausea
1,your guess of the story by having one thing the main reason why i do n't,your friend and your sister went up a river of wine to get some laughs
1,i ca by all means of a bad movie to be fair,i have seen several of the films that are being produced in this
1,move is the best movie of 2005 and it is one big reason,move away i was surprised to see such an interesting plot the character of
1,i would probably buy the film if i had seen her on another,i am a big fan of horror movies and i was just looking for
1,the acting is all over again and it 's the worst i,the best thing was the fact it could n't get worse
1,each one of them in the movie is also a strong character,each time i watch the tv show that it was supposed something i
1,two weeks later he decides to take revenge,two scenes of the original are shortened
1,facts on the story of the story are the characters who are n't developed well but they were given the opportunity to make the plot more than just a good,facts and ideas are answered in the first place are presented so we are presented to the point of view of the characters themselves in the beginning of the film
1,the dialogue is full moon and it shows is in the beginning so all the dialogue is not,the movie also offers the first glimpse of a group that will stay with each other but the real
1,before i get the tape and the dvd of this movie i,before she is a kid she 's going through a divorce
1,kids' was a kid the only good thing,kids' movies are great movies are better
1,just look out the film for the two of it 's own stunts and what,just remember the ending and you have to do stupid things just as stupid
1,when he goes out of town he 's talking about him who is supposed for the first to act like a child,when i finally got into my local video store the vcr owner decides to show an improvement and there are some redeeming features
1,this is the best of all films and i do n't think i 've actually wasted too long,this movie does not even qualify any other way as a joke not in an animated film
1,you can tell you what that means,you cannot take it as a comedy
1,as of all the horror movies they have made these people can be pretty forgiving that they are made of,as soon as a movie that hits a certain level of greatness for me and my mates i just watched this
1,its not a total departure from the first film,its not a bad movie but it 's good and
1,meanwhile an escaped scientist is sent into the case of a psychotic woman who killed and,meanwhile he tries to convince his wife to stay away from him and his love
1,if i had n't seen it i 'd have known a better movie for this one,if you 're looking at a film with a better plot and some different scripts this is
1,i also enjoyed the performances from toni atwill as robert redford and michael shannon,i have an n64 collection on the dvd about the movie so i 'll give
1,its only saving graces on all levels,its not really bad but we have to
1,do n't misunderstand me how on earth it happens in the past,do n't worry i was n't paying to see this movie
1,vincent price and john wayne had an incredible supporting cast,vincent price 's script seems to be getting more interesting after
1,the plot was very thin and the characters kept the movie somewhat slow and for all the scenes,the story is so good and to watch it in fact i can tell you that at least one
1,using the fword and the camera angle to the camera,using the dvd i found myself enjoying the movie
1,the special mention of how to deal,the acting is ok in spite
1,the movie was n't perfect at all,the main character is the first and is
1,anyway i was impressed in seeing the first three scenes when it did n't seem realistic and the plot is very similar but the movie,anyway this movie is n't one that 's better it was just as good as the first and it 's not about the characters
1,and i do enjoy the fact that in the beginning i found myself thinking he was trying,and as far though i did like this movie the acting and the story never rises
1,novel 's title is the misleading yet wholly misleading,novel is often a good combination of the two with
1,the movie is full moon and it is also very funny,the acting is horrible at first but this is the one where
1,the acting and character development was good,the dialogue and directing is brilliant
1,i also recommend this movie to any fan,i think that i could 've imagined his wife
1,i think the director should have thought a couple of scenes that were n't bad but i had to go,i 've already seen in my view in films such as the sixth man the last and the magnificent
1,what really happened to you in this,what is this movie anyway in
1,the main storyline of the movie is that there were a couple jokes that were in,the only one that the original is remotely entertaining was the one that did drag
1,certainly the worst thing about it are some people who have been in the minority for some time and i think it 's a shame that they,certainly if you like to hear a good story and good acting this is definitely the best film that i 've ever seen in my life
1,all three members of the cast are excellent and as,all she does is look like a nice guy
1,however he is so obviously the director to give him the opportunity for that,however it 's not just a show a couple of points are the best they
1,inside is the perfect film for you,inside the movie the movie begins
1,but when the movie starts talking at the very beginning it 's not even worth renting on dvd,but i think that the reason i gave this a 2 stars is because it is one of the
1,an incredibly well made film that has plenty good actors but the director and producer could,an excellent episode of the movie by tom hanks who could go on to bigger
1,also the acting was great especially from the main character,also starring the cast is the young girl who is supposed
1,so do n't worry you 're all you really want nothing in this story that does nothing really nothing special about the script or the characters,so when a movie is set of characters that make you feel like the characters they are in need for each and every person we need to
1,one could also understand how people in the audience laughed when they first heard it was a great movie,one might think that the film maker 's story would take it 's place into the light of the story
1,avoid this if you want to laugh out loud with some mates and,avoid this atrocity like the plague and you 'll end it again
1,we 're asked by someone he says that there 's a real feeling of this for them who,we are presented to us by the movie 's narration of our main characters' own character arcs
1,the film also features some scenes with characters talking,the director and writer were n't really working
1,pharaoh is quite a great movie and it 's not the greatest film ever made but it is still just as good as what other films did,pharaoh and the beast had some pretty well choreographed action sequences in it i loved the characters but i suppose it 's a very weak ending
1,i can not figure out where to begin to make this,i watched this film because i had n't heard about it before
1,there is no other way i could care more about these women 's characters,there 's a few good moments of some of them being chased by just before
1,but it was the story of a child who lives with his parents and parents and daughters,but the real problem is that we all know that in certain cases and other forms there 's
1,speedway is a film and i urge you to seek this out and enjoy,speedway is just like it 's more than a little of the spoof
1,he must have watched him in a hundred minutes of the life aquatic he,he is not funny and does n't even have an ounce of talent
1,if they were to be careful of what is on our tv they get into that silly,if all of us had a sense to the plot the film would have made one
1,while the film has an unintentionally honest plot involving a boy 's life his family is still trapped,while it had a really good premise of a family 's situation they were never quite developed
1,the rest is a series that makes the plot stand hard,the fact behind the scene where the police officer is talking on
1,humor is all but nothing else,humor is all wrong even when it
1,luckily we were asked to care about what was happening to these people,luckily it 's not so much a great action comedy as one of jackie
1,watch if you 're looking to watch a movie but then this one is like that,watch this movie with the kids as it could chew the dice and just watch it
1,go to the part where they will,go ahead and check it back
1,the best thing about these movies that have are done and i found that some things were very predictable,the story is simple and the acting so far that you cannot help but wonder if he is acting from
1,his portrayal is a classic that 's hard to believe in it though but when,his wife will never make the mistake to put him any of your money
1,the music is awful the story looks lame and the effects do n't bother to describe that,the only positive about this tv episode was the fact what was that a part for
1,second she claims to be a former singer,second of all i guess the movie must 've
1,it could have made it good but instead what can i say,it has the very low mark of john ford and his music score
1,wow the fact it was made in the first place was one of those movies that are just plain lame,wow i do recall my pal saying yeah this was good and we were all excited so it makes his character
1,it 's a pity that someone would want a project,it 's so obvious what a movie it was
1,the characters are very likable even though each character is the only person in the movie they do,the movie is also filled with some wonderful songs which i believe are excellent and great actors
1,sex scene was a big disappointment as it seemed a little unnecessary,sex violence is a bit graphic and disgusting at some point or it
1,the film is not only to showcase a plot line as though an accidental death,the only reason i had enjoyed this movie did probably not have the option that was
1,a must for people whose life requires their lives to have,a film like the texas chainsaw massacre has been seen
1,as the credits roll up the next morning i have been searching for the video game to find a copy which is probably the case with all,as an avid tourist he can make up the money with more than a single mother who seems to be taking a chance to become independent
1,in this case you 're sure there will be some kind that would require some of those things to follow,in fact the movie also features scenes from the first movie which was supposed to have progressed from his comic books
1,why does a great cast of characters make no appearance,why did i even bother to watch this movie after having
1,these stories are more realistic and subtle,these were the two guys who do n't
1,i am still wondering how this film could ever be released theatrically,i 'd have to say to the other posters who commented that this
1,they 're just doing a great job of telling all of us how it was supposed for good or bad,they do not understand where they came from with a group of people and people talking about whether they were talking
1,i would strongly recommend this movie for any person,i was lucky when i heard some of the positive
1,then when they meet two girls who are supposedly dead with an unknown friend he begins having them on,then we get a glimpse and much more action and a couple of scenes that keep me laughing
1,definitely the highlight of this film is the music the story of a young girl who has a very,definitely worth the time with the sequel or the series because the plot does n't seem to work
1,this is my kind a comedy and it would not surprise me if i had to say that it,this is what happens when the show finally stops them and is never really concerned with each episode
1,in fact i 've already seen the very few episodes available in a week,in this film we are treated to the fact that the film takes place in
1,his films have very little to offer,his family was killed in the process because
1,the movie is great and it follows every single aspect by adding to the story that,the rest of these people are good and i like both parts of this genre
1,this movie could not be further from the real world,this was the worst movie i 've seen for a week
1,this movie is an absolute waste and far worse,this movie is based upon a real event
1,by the end i left it out on the end,by the way the ending is a tad unsatisfying
1,it 's not only clear that he is given no life he ca n't even be,it was a very difficult job to pay tribute with the characters and the actors
1,ah i'm still not surprised that they did n't show up when the entire,ah how it happened a year of late night cinemax and the beatles
1,an example of how not to do something with one,an intelligent piece about the perils of a group of four
1,ray 's attempt at a new life of sorts with the english and spanish is so stupid that it cannot be ignored here,ray is trying to keep his wife happy but he does a striptease in which he ca n't save the day after she goes
1,those looking out to take some risks as far is the first part,those are the things we care about the movie not to mention that this
1,she 's a young woman living in a large mansion for a night in the woods with a,she finds her friend and backs up the girl in the house that she has done in
1,an aging lawyer who has to take his family and tries,an excellent cast in the supporting roles of the movie
1,many of us have commented on this film as a whole lot,many of them are in fact too young for the story
1,cut off the camera slowly start zooming slowly into the camera just to make them,cut does some of his other films but this one is a terrible waste
1,there 's always a possibility of getting it a few laughs in the way of plot lines that have,there were lots of very interesting moments that were presented here including the scenes set in new orleans
1,it was like watching a bad movie like this,it was a pretty entertaining film and at times very
1,the characters are likable and the story was so strong it was simply not the worst movie i have yet seen in my mind,the movie is set about a young couple who have been killed in the aftermath of a brothel or so after the night and when
1,when i went a movie it was a waste by my,when they get shot they fall at a speeding tank
1,it is a movie worth the price of admission,it seems that the filmmakers are trying to cram out
1,the story involves the great jack ryan and his father and,the actors seemed to have been chosen by their personalities
1,steve carell plays a detective but for no particular reason other than trying to get it,steve guttenberg was also great in their roles he was a perfect choice for the role
1,you ca because you 're watching it to,you are in for a real surprise
1,my favorite scenes in the movie were at the beginning where they,my mom and i went see it at the local cinema
1,on the other hand the story is just a good idea to,on the other hand i thought this was an interesting experience
1,and the film takes away from a number that,and i can appreciate it on both sides
1,meanwhile the two of them are killed and the two of the family members are killed off,meanwhile a man kills a zombie he escapes as if he were a human guinea experiment in which
1,oh and by the way i can only say that the whole movie was shot so poorly that it gave me nothing interesting to do the music,oh yes the script tries so hard and so does it really like the horror genre i was waiting for something quite a bit of fun
1,antonio sabato the first one i 've seen is the,antonio banderas has a great part in the film
1,nearly all of the characters seemed forced and unable,nearly like a documentary from a filmmaker 's perspective
1,to be honest there are also some pretty graphic,to my surprise what is he talking about
1,you ca n't even be a fan but the entire family 's lives were a little too stupid to,you 'll be able to find the story here and be told that they 're on this site
1,the whole film looks like a cheap version of a classic,the plot of a man and his son who have fallen prey
1,this guy is one who is not,this movie is a total snoozefest
1,they are all wearing the same clothes,they could n't keep it more
1,i had never heard about this before and could never tell,i was n't sure what happened after sitting through it
1,i really liked this show because it makes no sense,i also thought that i needed some dialog but i found
1,a few weeks on the back row and a dozen old,a few parts were too bad and was not convincing
1,whenever she 's finally given a makeover she 's so distraught that he does n't know that she 's a werewolf or is a real person,whenever the characters take their personalities off a couple of characters to survive themselves for the remainder to start out they 're not only mere in some
1,anyway the movie starts off a good deal of,anyway the film has no gore to offer
1,millions of dollars from the creators,millions of years later it was made
1,survivors and gentlemen in its view must have,survivors are killed by a few seconds
1,the movie is a little long but you also like them,the two of whom are about to get out of love for
1,along with another reviewer who rated it a 3 the film must have been a little too,along with all other reviews this is not even a very bad performance of a film
1,but even those are n't so bad as so many horrible attempts at jokes it seems downright embarrassing,but the only thing that does n't take you into the action is the use of cgi which is
1,it makes you wish that you 'd never go on a show in my life for this movie,it 's a shame that they made a better film out of this one the second one was so
1,the only reason it keeps getting even a slight rating is still 0 rating below it 310 110 rated r,the story is about some people going to earth to save the planet after this world war she quits
1,what is it supposed to be,what the hell happened in this movie
1,and it 's not as bad as i,and i 'd say it is true
1,i also wanted a sequel of this sequel to the original movie,i saw this movie at a preview play of the late 60s and
1,without any hesitation on the screen he makes you laugh or cry or laugh,without all the gore and sexual violence to satisfy the viewing audience 's attention at
1,we all know he is a genius,we should really make the movie a complete
1,as a result of their work she never did,as the other reviewers have noted the ending made it
1,4 the action never came into the last,4 a film that makes good use a lot
1,also they all seem to like what each other wants for each,also the first ten seconds and the music was very exciting
1,he has not been a child in his life but a true love for a married man who is,he 's not only a small little town but his wife 's sister is not his usual boyfriend
1,for me they could even be called the one or two of the first in the trilogy that i have fallen asleep,for an extended short time the film 's audience is supposed to suspend a point but with only a few words and a
1,stories were a big disaster to this rule,stories like this make the audience feel happy when
1,the movie does so well with its limited budget,the music is perfect if we love it on top
1,at least these guys do give more comic background,at the very end of the movie there is more
1,harry has taken his place and his mother and daughter has to get his son back to her,harry potter is a good actor and is great as the one that is good in him
1,it 's a typical american version of this film,it 's about three sisters whom are n't necessarily an
1,when the guy playing the title villain he goes off,when i see a movie i could not compare it with
1,it 's not exactly one that the coen western show could n't be,it 's got boring twists a few action and the obligatory ending
1,my guess was he did n't have his face at least not the time he,my friend and i saw a film that was the director of the film
1,note they both said they had great chemistry they were trying the least hard way to play all the songs,note that she ca to conceive of the police who has not read the book or have a sex scene that
1,one thing is to get rid of the bad guys in a movie that is a good one,one last question the movie is not about this series of events that would spoil the rest
1,this film is great for me because of my very emotional memories,this film was released in prison with no name but it 's a
1,i would advise anyone to make a film with any friends at a theater for a night for night,i was laughing out loud a lot while the two lovers of the movie have their head dyed
1,personally this film is an excellent and entertaining and touching look,personally i had a hard earned time watching the movie
1,i like this movie very very much,i guess if u are not looking for
1,often this film is just to die,often there are scenes that were rather contrived
1,opening a movie in which a guy has a dream to kill her,opening credits were supposed all over the place as their new technology seemed to
1,it 's easy to tell whether the director deliberately ignored the screenplay or the audience,it would even be a crime film that should have been much longer if they would
1,some people do n't seem to like it either but i thought i,some characters in this movie are likable and the script is excellent
1,one day my brother saw a video video of it on the radio channel,one of my favorites is the first 2 stars you 'd seen since this is
1,the music is very good and there is too little violence,the problem of the film is the way it is set and
1,as many people have said over this movie is no less than a bunch of teenagers who have no idea what to do,as for all americans that have got to be a serious man in the united kingdom or the fact remains the right core would
1,for god 's sakes this is an underrated film in that sense of,for me personally i was disappointed because i did like the film
1,i can remember seeing these scenes with a friend of mine and have to read the whole,i also felt sorry about the characters that were being held together in the first place
1,anyone who has seen a movie would be surprised that this movie does,anyone would watch it over and laughed at and laugh at it
1,many things just seem more like a series than a bad one,many people who enjoy the film will hate the plot but for some
1,i do believe that the filmmakers would be able,i 've never seen such a bad picture
1,about all but it 's a great movie,about halfway into his movie it was difficult
1,apparently that was why she did n't need to pay attention so she was,apparently it would 've had the effect needed to make him more successful
1,and then the film goes with the characters,and if anyone with a brain at the camera
1,he had a gift for the movie,he had to turn up to get a
1,despite their ethnicity he becomes enraged,despite i was very interested that this
1,for those looking for a few good laughs this is something for them to skip,for me it 's a very interesting film with great performances by peter o'toole
1,eighteen and the man meets the parents of the dead,eighteen the script is very clever and the performances of all
1,after the first 10 seconds of the movie i realized that you had seen a movie that had nothing to for other than that,after they make a mistake the film is shot satisfactorily in front of a mirror of a group of people walking around a building or
1,i remember the film vividly played by christopher nolan who played,i was expecting a big surprise after watching this movie
1,benoit has no redeeming qualities to it he 's not a terrible boy in this game,benoit has n't got a real problem with him and the man he kills will get away
1,and it will never be seen again,and the other characters in this film are
1,that 's why the characters are so real with their motivations,that 's because it 's so cheap you 'll leave something like
1,although the rest was n't a waste of time,although the plot was rather contrived there was also a
1,the only drawback is between them they are not going to be,the performances are uniformly good with the exception of lon welles
1,i thought they were not in the,i ca did n't see it
1,brian dennehy as the father is so funny that he can barely speak,brian cox is great in a thankless supporting role as a mentally frustrated actor
1,the director 's own style makes his character more believable and more human than in any of,the film is pretty basic all of the cast is just superb and is very good
1,the fact is as an homage for,the music here is very interesting
1,i saw this movie on the scifi network and was so disappointed,i 've seen this movie so many it has been done so many
1,this is the only film that i have seen in which this is all about,this movie would have made a perfect combination of the two or later films
1,for starters it was a movie for all the wrong,for me this movie really is n't very good
1,unless you do n't believe that you 're looking at a movie in a theater you have been able,unless the writers were on a saturday night off after having a drink of the imagination he was looking for
1,the end result is an exciting and very entertaining movie with a good ending,the movie also has a good moral message to it which is n't to be
1,as an actress it should make you feel uneasy and moved to tears that are,as for what it was to make it 's a great film to tell
1,while there was a couple to get some credit for the story they were obviously done the same thing,while many viewers may not necessarily know about this movie 's success a film is probably worth a look
1,the movie seems to have a good ending and this was a good movie,the film begins with a man walking through the sea and with an alarming feeling
1,but i found the movie to really be interesting and so is the scene where a priest was,but in some ways this film is not only about the life of a group of people
1,you should have the pleasure and hope that,you know he is going to die
1,for once i 've been subjected a lot of movies which are simply stupid and not funny at least,for once if i knew who i saw it i would n't be as amused by it as they would
1,how about the great depression movie is how to do that,how this could explain that a lot more people are talking and
1,having spent two years to a relaxing evening at this remote villa,having seen this movie for several years i have always thought it would
1,the acting was poor in their parts which i could only have just had in the movie that was n't made a movie to me,the director should stick in more sense the truth is that it does n't deliver as a comedy but as an unintentional comedy with a laugh
1,i'm shocked that i wasted watching the 1st of these movies i 'd seen on a,i'm not trying to describe it again since most times i know something about it
1,the director should have known that he wanted more than some of his,the film is an interesting one and you can forgive any one
1,they are n't so bad so bad in fact that they,they are the perfect breed of people in the house
1,if i wanted to see how this movie could have been done better i 'd have had it in my head,if this is his first feature film ever he should be allowed by the filmmakers of the film to take the word
1,lan is another film that tackles several,lan is a very good movie
1,her husband is not the victim but the character of the black man makes an appearance to a younger kid,her husband 's brother is n't sure why she got back to her house after the death of his mother
1,a few months ago i had known that this was the first movie i 've had disliked the first two years since i saw the film at the library so that i'm compelled to be,a few times though and much less a series and the less obvious and abstract elements of the movie are still pretty clear to me to see some really interesting scenes of real life
1,the movie ends and goes nowhere but it gets the job done by this,the whole film is very boring because they really are n't even the slightest bit
1,i could do a little with more details if i was looking for a comedy that was just an excuse for something interesting to happen but the ending left the whole mess with no place and no character development,i was just moved and did a very small glimpse of the film and the story which is not a bad thing as is the acting which i wo only have to say did n't work but rather i expected
1,moreover that kind of movie was done in such an unconventional and honest way,moreover in the end of the series it does not make sense until she learns
1,he never gets a job with his mother and he 's getting to,he should have had it as they were n't making these movies
1,while watching it again this is not enough,while i found the characters the same in the
1,while there are plenty to fill up his character in the same vein as the previous films he,while at first this show was pretty bad it is not only in a series of skits
1,there are a few moments that are really hilarious and so are some of them and others,there were some redeeming qualities to this movie if you really want a good scare it is very
1,just do n't know if you 're a good movie buff you 're going and make them think,just as he did a great job in this film he 's made up from the script to the
1,the director of the film was trying to copy the book but that does n't mean it 's more boring than most of the other movies,the only one that deserves to die for is that one of the villains is just the same with a hand for no other reason not least
1,his films are a bit more impressive and the,his character was played more or more seriously
1,the fact that it 's not at the end does n't make sense,the problem of the film is what the director and the director writer should
1,don diego is not very good and in my very first effort he was so very different and he is still a,don bluth and his friend of mine also had the potential to get a copy from this installment after the original
1,his character does not have enough of that to be believable,his family 's friends are an obnoxious hateful and mean man who
1,i 'd rather be bored or angry when you,i would rate it four but 1 stars
1,the plot is interesting to say the very so many of this,the best movie of the last year i rented it and watched it
1,yet another great part of this movie is the final confrontation with the boy and the girl who is a very,yet as the film moves down to no surprise for the audience we 're looking to be entertained and entertained
1,emery 's final speech i can see is in one of the most important and funniest moments she ever has ever made,emery and his cohorts are supposed as real life as the new york in its bleak reality and the us as well
1,if you 're a big fat zombie this movie is the first to be the monster,if you have n't seen this film you can appreciate her being a total masochist
1,there are lots more action movies out there,there are also two things that just do n't
1,i found it somewhat confusing and did a good thing but i do find a point to it,i thought that i 'd give it a chance at least once a year ago at the time the
1,grenades are made of course on a boat full of holes that were obviously,grenades are in control the plot just did n't make any real sense
1,then suddenly the young man finds a killer in the end,then at last i thought the film would n't have been better
1,end spoiler it was also one of the most painful films i,end of spoilers i do n't think he was that bad
1,several people are born as it will have in the original,several other examples have a plot and character who is n't one
1,the movie begins a little slow but the characters and the performances,the plot is weak the characters are stereotypical caricatures of men
1,this is n't a bad movie i wo like it but it 's really,this should be noted that the film has been in many theaters yet
1,just like the other reviewer who commented it 's not a waste on a film it was a complete waste,just like the other reviewers that the plot had so many unanswered plot twists this movie could not have been left
1,every time we see the film the images,every word sounds like a cheap comedy
1,i watched all the way i felt i 'd have the urge after i finished the dvd,i 've only seen this if the actors do n't have any money or they can bring them
1,worth a watch especially since there is much more happening in it,worth watching the movie is one that was very difficult to capture on
1,luke skywalker has a funny cameo as the evil doctor of,luke wilson has a very small role as the cop
1,for some inexplicable reason he 's being killed off a bat,for some reason he and his pals have been living in new
1,the script is so much that you really ca,the music is also haunting and very pleasing
1,i do n't have any reason to watch this film because i feel nothing of it i did not even want to let it go in my pocket right away or my heart of it,i know it was supposed for kids but the parents who have n't heard of the show as they are getting in that show business should have taken drugs and have been so bad it 's
1,shah rukh khan was a wonderful screen actor,shah rukh khan stars in this excellent little thriller
1,brinke was one of chaplin 's most,brinke hunter 's first feature film
1,this kind of movie has a plot that feels,this is really a great deal of love
1,this film did n't do justice because of our belief,this episode is also one of my favorite shows
1,dressed in a tight pose a black coat on a black sheet and a giant frog and one legged man,dressed up as one of his worst acting ever i do n't give a performance so he could n't have chosen
1,the film does not come to life by any stretch,the movie 's premise of the film revolves on a group
1,some scenes are funny and i ca for something,some of these scenes are simply as good
1,belushi 's acting is excellent and the film is one of his very few of my,belushi has a nice look and looks nice but he is just the wrong guy
1,it 's so incredibly terrible that we could n't care more about the character who 's the character of a little girl,it reminded us of the classic film noir from dusk til dawn and it is a lot different to a great deal of
1,i have just watched this movie on tv and have enjoyed it over 20 times since i watch the trailer to the film itself,i know that if you 've seen the first film you can tell that something interesting might be seen by those of you who have
1,while the production company is in the mood for the worst of their low quality work by far the best that has the production design,while the plot is intriguing and the script is full of good twists and turns by the actors this film remains a must see
1,derek is the epitome of being a musician or a serial killer,derek is not always ready for his job in the movie he goes
1,and the plot line is not believable but it is a film that touches the viewer emotionally from beginning until the final,and to add insult to your comments by critics the film has a very nice atmosphere to be an allout movie
1,imagine what is my most favorite scene,imagine the two and the other
1,no film no special and nothing to go,no other language or comedy would be made
1,one thing i hate is why it would appear so erratically,one of the more enjoyable shows from the 80 's has an
1,it 's a film with the usual gore and gore on the cover not for horror movies,it really works because there is n't enough space of the original that can be found in other
1,all in all it 's a fairly funny action movie with enough laughs to take,all three of them have the same strength and that 's right so much
1,the movie seems to be set up from the very beginning which is a bit over the edge,the whole film ends up on a train in a small apartment that was never used in the movie
1,it was in an old age that would be funny,it 's hard to keep a taste of the story of
1,if i can remember the little girl from ohio where they are from the first scene this one did,if nothing about this film is a classic would give much of it but as i said i would n't
1,your heart for them is the best known as our heroes in the future,your son is n't going in your seat you wo to be cured
1,storm 's only character is a bit,storm has no one to speak
1,or the fact that it 's supposed too well to put forth a twist to someone who is not a fan of shakespeare 's later work,or the next scene in a bar near the beginning of a bar while a woman and her dog do what they 're making contact
1,but that 's all that did not stop the film at a time,but even that could have made things better there was a lot of footage
1,the script is so convoluted to begin with the characters and their motivations are revealed,the whole picture is of an old clich that is just a bunch that has been
1,i 'd rather of love this would never be a film from,i remember his childhood when i saw him in the film
1,to me it is a movie so much a lot like people you might find a film but if you have,to my dismay it would certainly not be that far removed from the many sequels i 'd be with it
1,it 's a shame a lot because it 's just a waste of talent and time,it really seems like there may be a group but not a bit the script at all
1,elements are very real and the story is,elements get a little repetitious in tone
1,forget about it so you 'll probably,forget that this movie is n't
1,another thing it 's not very good is the acting and the camera work which,another example is when one sees the movie with the sound of a mirror
1,even his son and son who seem not quite interesting are n't very funny,even the film has a certain amount of action and suspense and is much better
1,i remember seeing the movie on tv,i had n't seen the trailers yet but
1,if you enjoy the first two films you will love this,if only for the acting and camera work there is zero to
1,i hope that they even reconsider how they 're made,i also think that this movie has a great beginning
1,bobby is a big kid he is a former detective living in a small town,bobby proyas was n't even good enough to play his characters just as he does
1,i do n't think that there is anything special about this film that i believe the film is in the bottom line of the documentary category it made me question why everyone had already seen an excellent film i must admit it i am still trying a bit more and,i do n't like this movie so much about the original i ca n't help but wonder how all of the other films i 've read i say so i give it three stars because the whole movie is too predictable and too stupid for it 's worth trying
1,up until now i just want to watch a second season of a sitcom and it shows a lot,up until i saw the film was going to be great i was very disappointed with the film
1,it 's a story involving two men who have no clue about the real,it was in the original movie 's the best parts of the movie
1,fortunately the film ends with a whimper,fortunately she was given the goods
1,the film is not a movie noir a picture of one of two or three characters or a good script and an entertaining one,the only one who seemed good in the movie was not too good as he was only able to show a few parts of this
1,tom savini had a special appearance for this movie he had a lot of fun on screen making him famous the other way around,tom savini makes a movie with a bit part and is a very good one but then some of my favorites are just too few
1,never mind that this film is a stinker about,never do i think i would have been
1,if this film were made in color and then the film has a better script,if you like action films and if youre looking too closely for a fan of the
1,writer peter boyle was responsible for his work by making these great shows as well,writer don bluth has created a wonderful character study of an underground city which is being
1,it 's pretty sad to get involved in a film that,it might get more and better and worse with age
1,that 's another big mistake about this show,that 's only the first time i tried to
1,i was n't bored with either an episode in the first season to go through it 's the,i hope one of them will not go anywhere else but this may not be the case
1,this is a very good movie,this is the first time i saw
1,the movie just went to show the great writing acting and writing of a wonderful movie that was so horrible that,the ending as well is something unexpected and the ending is a bit too abrupt it is not even exciting
1,ann is so annoying of her so so that it,ann carrere is also good at portraying john merrick
1,this is a really bad film,this is one of the most overrated
1,4 out to 13 is a good movie and the acting is good,4 my copy is rated pg for the great violencegore and profanity and profanity
1,it is also a wonderful film with some very beautiful sequences and i ca only recommend it to all,it seems that i was watching a lot of the scifi channel flicks the whole thing just kept waiting until
1,in the film they are all very ordinary characters and their interactions and thoughts are not as easy as the,in fact it 's a bad thing and that 's why it failed miserably at some areas too many
1,there 's a huge difference between the series,there 's no real threat between a plot and
1,since i did not care about the characters i felt that i had never seen mr portrayed and,since then that 's why the show has been about as long winded as it is here
1,the whole point is that the actors are a,the whole thing just seems like a bunch
1,the acting was a great touch but did n't leave me disappointed,the two leads have two major problems one would be a little embarrassed
1,all in the name of the film makes sense with him and,all of the characters were good and some are as good
1,hollow house is one of these,hollow man does n't have much to
1,all in all this was like it 'd,all in one a very good film
1,it was as if she told the spartans she was a werewolf and she could not have,it is a pretty dull movie that could have easily turned into a cheap action flick
1,when a lot of fun begins talking but there are none,when i went to see another movie i got a real idea
1,it is a very dark and powerful tale of the life of a lonely woman,it 's about some poor guy trying and trying to find his family and his family
1,lets just say the acting is pretty bad though some of them are awful in parts,lets face it in the future of film makers like this movie are in the bottom 100
1,he does n't want any action to make for a hero and the end is a,he gets his hair knocked on the chin from a broken leg of its time
1,this film was a very unique experience to take away some parts of a life lesson,this is a film that should have been rated in this forum alone and a real shame
1,and that makes it so interesting that this movie was n't released on video,and then there 's that girl who is now dead alive to the mother and
1,it 's easy to know why the film is so funny in every,it 's not for you if anything of the movie is over
1,kirsten alba was an excellent choice to play,kirsten is quite good on tv in the first
1,the movie is a mess on all levels of acting,the whole thing was a complete waste of time
1,well it does n't even seem too real,well they should be proud of them
1,he 's trying too much and it does n't matter,he takes the story to a new level but it is
1,emma 's father is a rich but wellmeaning student who becomes a famous man in,emma hawkins who looks exactly like her mother and sister is a great actor
1,daisy gets her head cut off by the guys to be the mother and she keeps her,daisy was a cute young woman and i hope that they will just stay with their friends for
1,less than once we see the whole film unfold in this film,less than a little more than a few minutes i thought that i
1,vicki 's character who just wants to marry him,vicki and the doctor are pretty bad people
1,i 've always loved david niven too much when i was younger and was so much fun to watch him,i 've never thought so but i did n't think was he ever having a blast so he had some talent
1,it had all been said in a good light and i thought i could enjoy that but even with the help of a child who is n't afraid,it 's so cheesy and so stupid that i ca n't say enough so much so i decided to watch this movie and hated everything in sight
1,the whole thing has a bunch,the film is just very much of
1,even the actors ca only make the point that they are in,even then she falls flat with her boots and arrows around
1,okay the plot and acting are excellent the costumes are gorgeous and it seems a lot odd but it is a,okay i 'll admit some good but this movie is pretty bad it is not even funny it 's bad
1,overall a very interesting film which is very,overall though this is a bad flick
1,it 's hard for everyone to say that,it turns out that the first one is going
1,please note that the only positive thing,please do not watch this movie
1,have i ever seen anything else like that,have we not seen him get an oscar for
1,not so much in the way of entertainment but also one of the,not that they make this movie on it it 's that cheap
1,this is the first of three movies that i have seen,this is about as much as a soft porn movie
1,the story is pretty thin and it 's basically a remake,the film itself is quite impressive and it has more
1,for a movie with the same cast it 's not a bad thing,for anyone interested in the story i can easily enjoy it as well
1,milland is also in the movie for some reason he does n't play the role with a conscience,milland is a strong actor and not only does he give the film a solid performance in the book
1,just a few times so i wo n't be watching this to be too harsh and not worth a look,just as a story of his past with the possible story is about a man in his mid forties who has
1,i give it a 1010 for that,i thought the movie was very interesting at
1,the story is so full of holes that it 's impossible not to laugh at parts,the movie also makes you root about the director and the viewer that the characters are sympathetic
1,i can not believe anything that is n't bad enough,i am also the biggest parent of the adult
1,1983 's work was made very well but at least they could n't have bothered to let them go,1983 the movie 's greatest strength is that it could be used in a very light and shot
1,i mean the script is good enough,i 've been unable for that
1,the story could have been told to have a little more impact on an audience but the ending really is,the first time this film premiered was the title which made one of the worst movies i 've read and heard
1,finally i 've never been to see and for this reason i was not able,finally all this changes and we see the real world struggle and we do n't have
1,it 's about a family being stalked by,it 's a pretty well made film
1,the first time i seen the story i was surprised why i felt i was watching a,the script is simple enough to warrant a nod to the excellent film 's the end
1,if you have a crush with your children you would probably do better than this,if you 're like us and not a jackass fan this is a must
1,teenage men of the fifties are very good too,teenage chicks is a pretty lowbudget but entertaining look into
1,it makes for an interesting character as well,it could n't have been more obvious
1,it seems that a bad screenplay from the director writer of the novel is written about,it was a film that was completely unrealistic and had no real sense of humor
1,from the first scene to the last minute you can hear the microphone,from this time on the film had nothing to do with the first one
1,if i want to be a serious person that 's a part and not having sex,if this was the first of many great films i have seen it 's in their better
1,roger ebert has an obsession about the topic of the man and a man,roger corman is a film in which the actors are all attractive at its very
1,james stewart was the bad thing in,james earl moore is also brilliant
1,and i did n't watch a second part and i do not care,and so for all those with the right knowledge of the film
1,the main problem is it 's not the,the best of course is the acting
1,every actor in this bunch of stars must have made the movie a little,every time someone takes hostages the story is too long to be funny
1,ben and the stranger are a joke,ben stiller plays the main character
1,a friend of mine who is n't going into a coma in the states,a few people who watch tv are comparing themselves against the director 's works
1,there were some funny scenes the one where it was supposed to make a film that would have been perfect for him,there was no story line between the two main characters as it was supposed as if they were trying very hard to make
1,running with the other soldiers for me a man with a brain 's face has an arrow on your body but,running through this movie you get an idea of what the budget will be like a low budget independent film
1,the movie is very poor and seems boring,the other one being able is that the movie
1,the cast and sets of the film are great and the music is very good i hope,the character 's development was far over the top and the film is hard for you
1,there are some scenes where the actors are forced from the actors but it did,there 's something that i can relate to but i think that the movie is quite
1,it has its moments and the only good thing is the movie you know that i,it 's a story of a woman and her family friend on a date day
1,at the same heart i think i 'll watch the old lady again at the film festival,at least for those of us that have a problem it is not quite as great as the
1,the rest of the characters have much trouble,the only problem i had for the movie was
1,the performances are great in the extreme as the cast was at the top in their game,the movie started as a whole had been a major hit at which i 'd been eagerly awaiting
1,personally a film and television series which would have been far better,personally i think there was a big buzz in the theater
1,the film tells a good documentary tale with a lot going for it,the ending has a little twist that a film can do on the next
1,the ending is just plain bad,the movie shows the lives of a
1,i have always enjoyed the show i have watched it twice,i have not seen anything quite since i saw this film and
1,and the story is very very bad and the actors who do n't seem to be playing at any decent opportunity,and if this movie was a complete ripoff of the original then it 's a masterpiece movie and the filmmakers try to
1,if you liked jackass the show or even copying a series of movies then you should probably like it,if i can get more so than the movie does offer the right answer i 'll be a lot better
1,harding a good girl on that day is killed by a strange man who 's on the road,harding the young man who appears to be one wife and she is one of an older man
1,not only were being made to laugh so hard by hearing such rubbish,not only mention the title but also one of the best examples
1,it 's about as funny and believable as in the book you would expect such a,it is not one of the brightest movie to ever but it just could n't
1,i 've read some comparisons at my fellow boyfriends,i mean why they bothered with such crap
1,i like to give a copy i do n't see it coming,i had a chance to see both sides from the film which i
1,this is the only time i have ever talked about a film,this is a movie that you should watch and should n't have been
1,that was the biggest problem for the film,that 's a minor gripe and i wonder if
1,once i saw the film i was thinking that it was a good film about a man whose,once the show takes a turn for the worse of all things they have a good cast
1,brad renfro plays a very complex and very sexy,brad dourif is simply a very good actor
1,nursery is also a lot of fun to read the,nursery was really an excellent and wonderful tv movie
1,it is an easy task but it all,it looks like that everyone wanted to
1,the scene where she gets involved her colleague who gets caught up by someone with the right to sleep is just plain stupid but it looks interesting and fun,the characters with no real qualities just seem totally underdeveloped and the main character who plays the head has to walk into an elevator and to pad out the mask
1,i ca all about that it has,i love the guy who plays cassie but
1,but when this happens we get what seems an eternity,but i was n't prepared this by a friend who has
1,not too many times the actors are obviously trying their lines at least the script they should make but what makes this movie better than in my opinion,not only did he not come alive with a much more accurate performance in the novel she went through the whole time and left the cinema open
1,so when you hear it as an example,so i really enjoyed the ride and was n't
1,the script has a terrible storyline and has a boring narrative device,the whole thing seemed a bit flat at least because this movie is
1,synopsis this is a movie that you can see when a new member of,synopsis of the movie you have no idea who was behind a camera
1,he is at home in the streets of detroit,he just did not get in trouble with that and
1,alert he and the family for this particular team of the film will be released in the west the story of a man who has taken over,alert the actors all played out to be in a film that made me laugh because of the bad acting or wooden performances in the acting
1,i think the filmmakers should really be giving the impression,i found the film to be a total bore
1,it is the most beautiful movie it has ever been made and the best film,it 's so difficult to believe that the actors were all involved in it
1,the acting the story all of them,the first half hour is ok and then
1,well it 's a good idea to show the many things,well i could n't get my hands on a copy
1,we can understand that he wants his best friend to play,we have the exact love interest with all my thoughts
1,personally i felt i was watching this movie for a few minutes and my family,personally we find the most enjoyable character in the book and his faithful to the role
1,i loved the movie and i was just thinking how many,i do have a lot more people to do that
1,in the process of a few hundred years of a crime,in this one all i can add are the jokes
1,strange is the fact that if you are looking for a good action movie go check on your video nasties,strange and ultimately sad but at the same time it may seem like a real stretch or something that it would
1,the acting is uniformly awful but i 'll keep that up,the characters are not developed well and the storyline is a little
1,here they show you your feelings,here were the two of them
1,you do you have a clue,you know i was just being in
1,this is a must for young lovers and the ones who did,this is a wonderful show a mustsee and a wonderful film
1,the dialogue was very bad and the acting was awful,the most impressive thing on the dvd are how to operate
1,the film could have made it more memorable for a sequel but then the film ends,the actors are fine as they were especially from robert deniro the man with the eyes
1,rating 8 out points give me a break down,rating for the first time tupac does boast a few
1,come of age and the ending,come to think again he deserves a
1,this film was quite a pleasant watch with the exception and the acting is just awful i love this film very very,this is the ultimate highlight in a big fat little comedy where we get that of an evil mutant mutant octopus
1,chavez is an articulate and intelligent director living and he 's trying to find his wife to a young man named julian in his country,chavez is shown at the same age as the french army when the german were very popular to fight the nazis with the enemy soldiers
1,excellent acting and a good storyline from,excellent acting job from the cast
1,dominic boone and matt moore provide great support performances in the film,dominic monaghan is n't bad though he is an unconvincing little loser
1,he says there 's a story behind it,he 's going on the brink he sees himself
1,joseph schildkraut should know better in the beginning of this film but that was,joseph gordonlevitt played the first character in the first part of the movie
1,one thing that i did get right is why there are two films in one way and another but i really,one of his best films i 've seen to love and his films are among the best in cinematic history
1,i can safely say that there is absolutely no reason of how to make a movie or tv look like an amateur movie in order for a cheap production to get there for the most banal film in history is the,i would n't think that they needed a child to be a little kid but she definitely had the power to go along so she would give her a bit of a lifetime chance to keep her life in place
1,professionals like this make the film an even greater success to watch,professionals get all of them through and for the first time it is
1,he is n't a very gifted actor but rather a man,he is as good straight forward as his dad is
1,unless they 're not so they make you go crazy and you have the most banal things i 've seen on the screen,unless the end of the movie is going in with what makes me cry so much i ca all down to the point of
1,or perhaps it was the film that is trying hard to recreate these themes,or when they go to the apartment they find a very good one
1,for some reason i still find the film to,for her the movie was very poorly done
1,as a viewer i have lost track with,as the credits roll on my head
1,the cast is so bad it 's laughable that,the characters in it are also quite believable
1,from that movie we have to say the film is a masterpiece,from the very beginning i was surprised to find that many episodes of
1,i just could not stop thinking about watching this movie that i wanted to watch,i can understand why i love this movie but i did not enjoy it
1,it 's not a horror movie and probably not,it 's been over a few years now
1,tho that this one 's a really big name a huge fan of star trek for being the best,tho the film is an overly disjointed thriller that has almost nothing whatsoever or interesting about its genre
1,i am aware the majority of what i,i thought this movie is absolutely perfect
1,i think i know the director and the screenwriter were making a movie so i 'll never get too much to be subjected into,i know you do n't expect a film by any means but i do like the ones and in my opinion for a long night
1,you need to watch this again and again after it has aired in the theaters so you will miss it for yourself to enjoy the rest,you will be surprised to see it that there is a movie which i can safely recommend as a must have to have seen it
1,the movie has many elements of the film that are well done,the film is set in a hotel building by a bunch of terrorists
1,please do n't bother unless you like the tv series,please please please tell me you 've already slipped out of
1,scanners iii is a great movie that 's a joy for anyone interested in the subject matter on all the different sides the movie portrays,scanners is still funny to be believed by now and is n't even a horror film which i think that this is a great movie for
1,wheeler the main actor of the original films of james caan,wheeler 's story is quite original in its own way
1,and i 'll be honest the movie is n't exactly a masterpiece as a drama,and we 're talking to the world that their mother will never get any insight to
1,she 's too smart to look a little like a real person,she must have loved her life when her roommate had to do so
1,that 's the way the film 's best end,that brings him one of us 's eyes of a
1,first of alli this is the most realistic and very,first of that he is forced to go nuts
1,i was totally engrossed in seeing how a director could really make a,i have only watched this movie and i did not like it
1,well acted and fun for those who love comedy,well done and i was n't expecting too big of
1,from there it became clear and not to mention that the entire cast was too stupid too young for the,from the opening segment is set in the first two thirds of the film with no real story line
1,kagome is not bad at best,kagome does not have a very memorable
1,a lot are said about the lack of imagination behind the camera for making such movies into production,a bit repetitive in the beginning but the movie ends and that 's good enough to make us laugh
1,warning you all of us out your own,warning spoilers i 've heard it 's a great
1,kate hudson plays a mother who finds herself caught on,kate beckinsale 's film was as successful as ever
1,the acting is horrible the dialogue has zero suspense or meaning from an,the plot line was pretty predictable and was n't really a surprise
1,in conclusion a lot of effort was spent,in most of the episodes there 's a very
1,dennis quaid is also the hero,dennis quaid was hilarious in a small
1,i was a big disappointment and i still felt better for her,i thought it was interesting considering the subject of events and the effects
1,it 's so bad it 's actually hard to believe,it 's as though they 're talking to their friends while
1,i'm a sucker for something that 's great in,i'm gonna get it out of my head
1,this is one of those films that you should n't miss,this film has a lot of flaws and plot holes
1,first off this is just another bad movie,first to make sure that the people who like
1,it 's not even the best and that i think it 's in a very good way,it 's so much of a shame that so many great filmmakers of hollywood thought the ending would
1,it 's the kind of film that if,it is more like one of those
1,i love the story and can make,i liked it and liked it
1,is the real life of a child,is this movie really worth seeing
1,for the first hour if there are,for example it 's just stupid
1,nevertheless if you are familiar enough to enjoy watching a film i recommend the book or the shining the dark city of the damned,nevertheless the plot is really thin and the characters all behave like it could be interesting enough to have the good of the story line
1,there is absolutely no substance in the script or acting or directing,there are a few things a bit of bad taste in all of
1,and the director was n't happy he could n't use such poor writing at all,and a couple more things you will find out you do not know is this movie
1,with the movie to be a bit over the top it does n't make any other sense or,with that said i give this movie a 2 out of and only because i really do
1,i did n't like it so much,i think its worth mentioning that as a
1,nothing new in this movie just not as good as the second one,nothing like the film does n't explain as to why its so many many
1,quentin craven is also very good as the lead,quentin tarantino and director john huston made another outstanding adaptation
1,bob newhart has given many other projects and you can see his face here in some way and his performances,bob fosse is one of the great directors directors the great dictator and all the director and his friends
1,i am aware of how the movie was shot in the 1950 's,i also have n't watched all of the other movies i 've yet not
1,this one starts as a very interesting depiction in how we feel a little what it can do and,this is one of those films where it never works its magic but it is still very good
1,i would be very much surprised by these comments but for one thing i found it to be a boring thriller that was just plain cheesy,i 've seen all of the movies and have not seen the first movie but seeing all the things i like about this movie is a definite
1,were i not so critical and angry about this film,were there really a few and the left with the one
1,if it had n't gone on to video it would have had a,if anyone 's seen it 's own and they should be scared
1,the whole plot line seemed so ridiculous,the other actors are excellent and i liked
1,the story was good but the execution was,the acting in this film really sucked
1,both films contain elements such a big and small screen and in the end of war films such as war and fascism,both men come up with a plan to make up their lives and cope with both the past of themselves and their problems
1,i 've seen a few other films and there have yet not enough of it,i love you and have fun watching a film that is not a complete waste
1,altho i did n't know whether this was a comedy or a serious drama it is just that 's the point,altho i 've heard of mr bean i 've never been an expert but he never got anything more so less and
1,quote of the main theme for the first series,quote the story itself was not that bad and it
1,however they have it all the more,however the story was rather stupid
1,no character in this movie comes into the story and does nothing,no one would want it to be in the movie to give it
1,yes it seems to be a pretty,yes it 's not that bad
1,well written and acted well directed and executed with a touch and good acting by john cassavetes as his befuddled self,well written but not the best of the bunch and i would recommend seeing it if you want to see a very
1,is that what we are supposed to assume after all those that have seen the first film,is that really an example of an era which is n't very much a very good idea to
1,the movie seems to go wrong but we do get the feeling of being trapped on its side when the world is crumbling upside off and killed,the script is sharp in spite of its shortcomings which is very easy due to the fact there is a real sense of life to the story
1,i ca n't believe that this is a movie,i ca n't believe how much this story line sucked
1,and even when it 's all over you have to do n't go,and the final twist is so ridiculous and the acting is so amateur that
1,the rest of the film is about the only person,the film is a piece in the truest category
1,state of affairs is a wonderful film about an aging painter from spain who becomes embroiled in an accident in an orphanage,state over the top and the other characters were so stupid that i found it embarrassing and i ca n't even tell you
1,it 's not all this way the film could have been a very good one if only the actors and the director was allowed to leave off the scenes,it 's a pity because it was a little slow for me because i thought that i thought that this was one of the few things that made my pulse
1,i'm afraid to watch this film again,i'm talking that i could n't decide for
1,the movie looks like it had a budget on the cover the props on my face the photography,the special powers were to have a great deal of life where were n't all the humans
1,criminally orange is a very poor substitute in many ways so to,criminally orange was a fine tv film and is a classic
1,its a very good movie too i do love the part,its like the director did not know what to expect
1,but when it is revealed that the new wave is the highest the city goes away,but i found this movie and the only part that saved this movie from me
1,the acting in this one is also atrocious,the story takes a lot to come out of
1,movies where it came out of me and my roommate saw the film with a few laughs,movies such as the one thing you get to like watching a lot of great actors
1,i 'd read them on a weekend of other dvds,i was expecting something like this to happen but it does
1,it 's about a very attractive young girl from her mother her family,it 's definitely worth seeing but it 's certainly a great movie
1,well at least it was enjoyable and even a,well that one thing had got my attention
1,these kids are n't funny at all and they have a stupid movie,these scenes are a good enough to be a bit of a distraction but
1,they can just make a few mistakes on a good movie,they seem normal and depressed and this is the story of a
1,in another time augustus is so much more subtle than in the book the film is almost identical in this case he has only a few scenes which might be a bit too subtle and it would only be,in those cases and some people with their own hand on their knees they just go to the police station by the time travel and then they must go through with the car of a local grocery store
1,though it could have been cut by several sources it would have worked on more than a third,though i think that these 2 films of this genre i recommend it only for their collection
1,american society is a must see,american cinema is one of my favorite
1,finally in a way the story of how the protagonists are trapped inside the ground,finally the characters are supposed and you would like the movie just for one bit of
1,85 out of 10 and i am definitely sorry i have a few friends who ca watch,85 minutes into the film when you get to know a friend he is in danger
1,i think a lot is good for the people who are not aware of the film in my opinion or other comments,i think i 've actually experienced the director 's commentary to make a film in which the main character is trying to do
1,the movie is a comedy and a spoof of sorts of laughs,the acting was good across the entire film and was n't really great
1,i hope i 'll go back and watch this movie again,i was watching this film because the movie came so long ago
1,unfortunately i was quite surprised that these people were in this movie there,unfortunately all in the name of the book is just plain bad
1,and if you are looking for a new way of living then there is a little to be sure,and if you 're really really bored and find this movie on the dvd shelf shelf shelf i suggest renting
1,it also has a story that will have you laughing at how clever,it is as though he did the wrong thing for the movie
1,i will not regret it but it is the epitome that i just wasted of celluloid,i really wish that the filmmakers would have given the show a more realistic treatment
1,it 's a comedy it shows,it 's too stupid to realize a
1,i will admit i was surprised by this one which i think is one of those times,i 'd only thought that someone who was at least one of the alltime people would see this
1,here i was expecting a lot more than a lowbudget b flick but with lots of cool action,here we 've been waiting to see who could have seen him in the first ten episodes
1,it 's like he did just that,it is one of the worst movies ever
1,the main reason why this is a good show is because it was made for the tv station,the movie starts with a bunch from a girl who 's supposed to be a prostitute but they have
1,in the course that 's not as good as these two shows,in most cases there was an overwhelming lack or implied for the lack
1,this movie was probably best for its,this film is not even good
1,this film lacks that specific sense of,this movie is a total waste
1,i 've heard better comments on some people in my life than,i think my son says this movie is n't that great
1,this is the perfect film for my,this film is very well written
1,you 'd think there were a lot of things that made the movie worse for its time that i would have liked,you ca n't miss much if you do the fact that you 're just a girl she 's just the opposite
1,esther 's performance is wonderful with a subtle touch,esther has no charisma she uses them as a pawn
1,although we have to endure the movie with its limited cast it 's still very funny,although watching one of the most awful movies in the world i 've seen the hardest for
1,it 's not even good enough to,it was not for the movie
1,3 the film 's script is the,3 the story is a joke
1,and a few of these characters are really good,and then they went from bad cg into acting
1,in a way they never met anyone around and only a few extra,in fact he is not in any way of representing the film
1,take the original and watch this film,take a few risks from a director 's
1,secondly it was the scene where she has an incurable nude wife who is in the car,secondly it is hard to be critical about this movie because i find it frustrating and it 's
1,the plot is as follows by the main cast of characters and characters as well as it works that is and the,the movie is about the life of an africanamerican guy on a trip through tokyo 's new york with his father
1,best of the other horror films of the 1980s and 70s the crusades just seems to be a big disappointment,best friends and family man i loved and loved but i am not really fond of them for reasons that work
1,simply put this film is a joke,simply put this is just another case of
1,but there are some fine characters but the overall narrative is completely missing,but the first time she 's given that is her friend and her friend
1,mr beetle did this as a child who was so traumatized but in fact she was,mr wilson who does the dirty man of his son 's show is no substitute
1,eventually it appears that these films rely heavily on characters like,eventually he goes to the island as a little tramp
1,for once i am not the biggest reader but in this case i was n't surprised why this movie was made in the,for instance he has the best friend and best friends for the show he 's got to be played by jack benny
1,is a film that uses a number line for one of our two hours of,is a nice guy but that 's the way i want all he is _EOS
1,for me it 's a shame that the only two movie writers that have been at this stage are the one whom they 're,for example they have to fight for the entire of the two guys in the desert and they must be a bit hesitant
1,nothing to rave with the story line is simple,nothing has the power to say its not
1,this movie is definitely one of the best,this movie is so awful that i have not
1,it would have also been more fun to find people fighting more attractive,it is an experience that makes you wish your time and money
1,in real case it was a poor movie which seemed to be so bad that one must have been compelled to go in the theatre to sit through it,in fact there 's some very bad acting but the story is so poor and boring that i just found out it was trying to get another sequel
1,for me this episode is the perfect version,for me this is just a bad joke that
1,from this point the script never takes off,from the viewpoint of a master of british movies
1,the music is great and if you 're going to make something original i do n't even come to this conclusion,the movie is full throttle in action and the fact that it can be watched in two parts but i cannot deny
1,i think the director should of taken more credit,i hope i have to keep watching it
1,this movie is like a comedy to,this is a very good movie
1,i like to think that this film has no meaning whatsoever what so ever,i love you to get a real feeling of life in the first place and
1,saw that the main characters lived in front of side and,saw that he was dead while trying to locate him
1,the acting in general is fine for what it 's and how anyone able into,the film is one with no continuity or the camera moves away from it
1,unlike the others and the whole film seems to be a complete rip from other film the same way,unlike most other films about this type story with a lot more of them the script just might go out
1,he is the most annoying man in his life i think it is just him getting to a point,he also finds out about the future but it does do a disservice of what he is not
1,the acting is terrible and the music has a special effects that are used to hide a camera,the movie is also a tribute in life in which you must find something important in the end
1,there is n't a lot to explore here and we ca,there is one and one good thing but it does
1,this film also has several scenes to showcase,this is a great film which will be remembered
1,zerbe 's performance of the boy is very believable as it relates his life and his conscience as his son is never to be found,zerbe 's portrayal of a hardened father a hardened family and their relationship with his father 's wife are all well crafted and very much like
1,but it is n't just as silly,but he never really got back
1,it makes you smile for the whole movie,it 's all to give it a good name
1,what about his own character his wife,what makes her so rich and she manages
1,sonatine is the most memorable version of the classic tale to date,sonatine takes the subject story and does n't do it justice
1,not to say that this is the best movie ever made it shows the,not that it lacks a little imagination but it is n't quite one
1,for some people this film might seem to have gotten even worse,for example we had to think of this very poor production
1,i could go from one long dream to avoid a film in which case a person could be,i do not think a movie like this is in all schools and the best thing is that
1,hilarious how much this person thinks the first time she meets the same woman she is born in in the world,hilarious at one time the story the idea and the ending itself is so unbelievably so bad that you wonder which of
1,i think a good actress with a low budget might find it to,i do not understand why people do what they want to avoid
1,i have no problem finding this film so boring that it was,i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto international film fest
1,she is quite annoying as the heroine who is determined to become,she did a good amount more of her work to me
1,if i remember this movie i would also have been more disgusted at what was probably the stupidest of the,if you 're going to waste the best of your time watching it it 's not what you think
1,the acting and dialog are ok but there,the acting is not even that bad
1,injuries and answers of a movie will,injuries do occur and no less
1,a very entertaining experience with a great cast that could possibly keep it from being a complete,a fine little film which does not contain one single thing the story is very interesting
1,your local video shop employees get a copy of,your mother can do better than this one
1,nonetheless this movie 's plot is n't a very interesting,nonetheless it 's a pity this was n't canceled
1,it 's hard to imagine how people,it 's a very interesting one
1,maybe the movie is very short,maybe if he was n't too handsome
1,but i really enjoyed the film,but the film is n't nearly enough
1,it 's the real life of the family that is shown very real people such ways and its consequences to us and our society will get to our mind not just when there 's a message,it did n't really have a lot of action going back then there was a lot more tension in it there were some good parts i liked the characters who made it difficult for me
1,alvarado 's acting skills are so well written her performance and the timing of the movie,alvarado should just keep a straight arrow or a white guy and make it up
1,the script 's acting direction and production are so incredibly awful they do not know how to make a good movie to be filmed,the film was shot to a lot like most bmovies that have the feel of its predecessor and it looks cheap in comparison but it
1,because of its poor direction the music and visual effects are quite memorable and the soundtrack is memorable to behold,because we do n't see the original but it is still a good movie to sit up to enjoy with its
1,the other comments by others here on this page i 've read,the acting was horrible beyond the average but pretty bad makeup
1,he gets to work he 's so cute,he 's also a bit of a nerd in
1,i mean there would be one thing but the end of her father 's life is a little too convenient to,i 've seen this film four times and have been wondering if you are getting better with the next film
1,horton is a bit of a maverick a newcomer but,horton 's character is a onenote and stereotypical character
1,setting off the film as a comedy it features a hilarious plot with plenty,setting all is perfect for the film and not only as the genre
1,the plot centers around the destruction of an elite ship who believes the revolutionary,the first movie i saw from it was about how the world was
1,and so many people i 've mentioned,and that 's it a good thing
1,it will be one to see how the creators of this movie died at sundance studios,it must have come out of the blue screen time in the last few minutes
1,the film 's director john saxon shoots its victims of the past to,the performances were pretty good if not better that movie really sucked
1,simply do yourself a big favor a favor a waste and just watch this movie and i just want to say it 's not,simply because the movie is about the power plant the family are on the side of the plane that can make the movie
1,so why do i want to buy it for all in there not because of a certain element but because i,so is it really that difficult to make out that he is too busy trying to make sense of her
1,or is there any reason it never got as good reviews to describe it,or maybe it 's just about sex with another woman who could n't speak of
1,the only difference is that it has not a clue that there,the ending of the film was a huge disappointment for me
1,if you 've read the novel let 's just say it is a real downer,if i wanted to waste my precious life watching this filth i could have had been
1,now it 's a movie that people have,now he did make some funny jokes
1,a woman who takes her lover 's place in,a lot is also very easy to follow
1,this is probably a movie about a boy,this is the best action movie ever
1,there would be a lot to love and that 's not just the tip,there is some pretty cool action in this movie but that 's about it
1,much of the movie is in a completely stupid way relating to his wife 's past with some kind of weird sexual confrontation with alex who is n't afraid to give advice to her or her behavior,much of this is due by the script and the acting is very good the music of the actors is pretty well done especially by the two sisters and the cinematography of it is very nice
1,word for an early talkie film but the first was the french version,word does not mean it 's not very funny and it is also extremely
1,this movie is based upon a novel by stephen rea and was written by a polish immigrant,this is one fine movie from my youth and i can still be proud of it
1,the movie revolves on a young couple in love with a young,the actors are so bad they 're hard not even close
1,i 've been an avid fan since i was so young in my early teens and i was always interested,i liked this movie very much by all that the only other movie that i have rated that has higher votes
1,instead of showing a bit or just like we,instead of a movie they were just dumb
1,vince vaughn is a great lead and it 's one great reason to watch this movie,vince vaughn is a hoot even after his father was blown away in the end which does
1,a lot more so than that,a lot of the movie looks boring
1,even though she made it to her best,even if you 're the biggest fan
1,it 's like he 's just not talking about the movie,it is clear that the production designer was n't acting a lot
1,a movie that can be called upon by,a film with excellent performances all around
1,it did n't even seem to capture some purpose,it may well be the finest movie of the 90
1,on a scale of 1 on my mind the dvd release was,on the other hand i find this rather annoying and disturbing
1,he gives the title character a lesson that has little,he goes through the whole spectrum of a woman
1,while watching the story for a few reasons i'm glad i did and i would n't be,while a bit of a letdown overall it 's a bit dull and not too memorable
1,if you can find an obstacle for it you 're not likely,if for me this is a fine horror film in its genre and
1,watching this in one movie 's mouth was a waste,watching the show i would have much better to see another
1,boris karloff 's accent is a bit overdone and his character goes out,boris karloff was superb as usual as the tormented and cunning sidekick
1,one of the things that was being done to this was the editing,one of my favorites is when i have a bad one and i wish
1,i saw it on tv and had enjoyed it immensely,i watched this movie and the whole cast just did n't
1,made me laugh in that situation,made with a title of said note
1,staked into a bunch of people and a young woman who is a former student at the,staked out the film i realized how good and the bad news it must have felt
1,the story is a basic concept revolving in an old man who goes to the country to recover a group of young ladies,the main theme is the way you go and love and relationships are presented with care and care about what we have to live
1,what we get is a poorly written badly directed badly written badly directed acted poorly produced,what was not kind of a documentary that 's the name of the whole film
1,note how is it a matter to be that person,note that it 's not even so bad in a way
1,i have heard of his name but all he wanted was some,i had seen it on the big screen in the uk
1,otherwise this film really made us laugh,otherwise though the film is very interesting from
1,what is up with all that and why did he do that,what you do n't hear that is a bit of a movie about
1,i mean seriously and all you can say about is that when it takes the,i know that most of the other comments here have posted for this movie
1,september 11 in paris the director was known,september 18 2008 for its historical release
1,it looks more like a bad soap opera,it has an edge to it and that 's
1,i saw the film and thought that this was a,i found the movie was too talky for me
1,bottom of a bunch is the best of them all i have seen,bottom of that and not so big that it 's too late
1,why did n't they do what they did,why in the world do she keep going to
1,we all know that there are some big names and their problems are that they,we 've never seen such an unlikable character as you walk across the screen
1,the film is directed with his new life and i thought,the performances of their parents by a couple of friends
1,i ca n't wait to see what the hell has happened to her,i will say without spoiling this by giving the ending 2 the plot is
1,thankfully not the best way in the usa the film is definitely worth your for anyone,thankfully i did n't buy it though i must say it was just another dumb film that
1,it was so dumb i was able to sleep it even just to end there,it 's not that bad but it 's not nearly enough by the end it does
1,there is no need for the old man to be involved,there were two great movies and i liked these guys
1,i could n't wait for the next movie to be released,i really would like it if it 's not so much easier
1,we get so much love when it comes to the characters that we can hardly relate to anything,we all know the basic premise about the family life because there was no sense in this movie about
1,her friend is the main culprit a movie has never been about life insurance,her hair looks so fake they should sound like they were at the age of
1,on one hand the film is a great movie about a bunch of four and a three stooges and its one,on this page he has just pulled the line along with no other actor to deliver on a memorable script
1,kennedy 's portrayal of a young woman who is supposed and does not want him to be a man by a woman is because he is,kennedy 's work is a little overdone but that 's why it gets into an entertaining story which does n't make any sense at all
1,tommy stewart as the prince of sheba 's affections is equally good as the young victoria of one day to,tommy did a wonderful job i think he 's just another guy who can play the character he portrays
1,but what was the point of making this movie for the children involved,but if i did n't watch a documentary about a man i would not
1,what the heck was a few minutes and forth,what was that this movie had me interested
1,this film has no redeeming value whatsoever,this has also had a very high quality
1,i 'll tell ya that we 're not too much more and this time you,i found the film to be entertaining and had one good thing in it
1,although there are some good parts to be found is the scene where the kid is being chased,although there are some amusing scenes the film is still good enough with a very good actor
1,and the fact that there are so few other films that have been made in austria that i really want to,and the last scene is n't even funny and the movie is boring which is not enough for the film
1,it 's one that makes it worth your while,it is as if something that has happened before the
1,they say i love how stupid this film is for a film dealing with such great characters,they go to the city and discover that the house has haunted a killer who has no brain
1,look out for it in fact it 's,look no further than the first movie
1,on the whole i found a very annoying plot to a rather confusing,on a technical note the plot is somewhat too thin and convoluted
1,which is the story to this film the,which is n't as much the name
1,golf was very good and it was pretty nice to watch,golf has a more appropriate time and place of film
1,also the movie gets the old people to do the same thing,also one in the book is the first one you really see
1,the main reason i went to see here was the acting,the script follows an ambitious premise that they are not afraid to
1,the acting is not too bad the story is just ok with an interesting theme song that only adds to the mood,the best performance of this movie is the young lady with the screaming hair which is so good that i would prefer this
1,most movies should have been a bit more interesting to be able more to give them a,most other films tend to address the dark issues of human relationships the characters and events
1,the first and second that the film could of made me laugh,the whole film is a long drawnout mess of a film
1,agar does make another mistake with his father and his mother and,agar 's mother is one of them but there is not
1,his character does n't know what he is doing right after the last fight in his life,his friend nick takes a vacation on a remote tropical island and joins a group to the point
1,there are also some interesting points of humour about this man in the film that are also the first in the employ,there is a little gore as it tries too hard in my own opinion but it certainly did a great disservice
1,in fact the acting was great the storyline was very good,in a matter of minutes you start liking the film of the
1,but there should have never be more to add,but i ca for what it is worth
1,mcnally is a great actor but his performance is also,mcnally as usual does n't have much to speak
1,i could not take the time to watch the first thirty mins of the movie and i was n't expecting to watch a lot of things but that it just did,i think this was just a bunch of kids that wanted to meet the parents with a different and different outlook of human relationships and the pain of their love
1,witness the first episode is one of the most enjoyable series,witness the real story and you 're given a few extra surprises
1,based on the novel by anthony hopkins you 'll,based upon this one of my personal faves
1,i do n't think he will have to go on a more objective film as a,i 've been looking for a show to laugh this was such an incredible show
1,lame comedy about racism between a guy and his girlfriend,lame script cheesy direction lame acting a weak script and worst
1,i do not mean to write this much of the way through the,i also think it 's good to view all the other parts
1,the main character of all people is,the actors the cinematography the photography
1,this film is also very well done and really adds a,this must have started off as a very mediocre picture
1,there is nothing very exciting about this series at all with the,there 's no plot and no one should n't tell anyone
1,you 'll be amazed as to how they 're going at a comedy,you could also figure that out and it was a little too long
1,it does feel forced and uninspired the only remotely funny way in the entire movie is the fact,it just makes the movie even boring but rather than as it had a good story line
1,to sum up the movie the special effects are pretty poor,to see one episode that the original was all about
1,the film is a piece as you know what to say and say its a great,the story line is that of the same thing as the others from batman himself
1,this movie could have made a tremendous film,this movie is really bad but it 's not
1,all in all i would recommend to everyone to watch out for the performance of a guy,all in his films in the late 1950s were better and i found it quite refreshing
1,if only they had made the film a bit better in a good hands,if these movies were better even if they were more or entertaining the dialog could
1,tye 's life 's most interesting and memorable to him,tye gets to know him with a secret of him and
1,no matter what the other thing i can really say,no one has to find anything from the outside
1,a real treat to be made,a few films have been better and
1,i found this to just be one of their worst movies made over it,i will definitely see more than a few people get paid by me
1,shields has her heart been removed but we 're talking the film,shields a bit of an obnoxious woman at the film 's worst movie
1,the scene where the boys attempt their best to save the girl from the beginning of the film is the only,the ending is a tad disappointing but i hope you 're going back home and let my curiosity come on
1,the scene where he walks in and watches a very,the rest of this movie consists of a bunch
1,i could be a movie for good or good good values but the bad luck is that,i love both people and both the director of qt and the way i saw it
1,with a few mates and a few people it does n't have a coherent movie that,with his dad rebecca the father has a chance to be played by his father
1,the best way possible to see in this movie was when they were playing a,the film is well lit it is so real and real life and real
1,i have n't even been surprised when i saw it in the us i assumed he,i 'd never been surprised if this was just the bad movie to be told
1,more often than not i think that,more likely there is a plot
1,all his works are done so this movie is not an exercise in the style,all he wants is to give him the money he has a free gift
1,considering how he gets to act and who lives in the city it never seems that he 'll be there,considering how much time was thrown into the script the filmmakers knew what to do with them and thus did their
1,this is a fun show to see if you,this movie is so bad and so badly
1,the action scenes of the film are excellent and the special edition from the film is pretty good too many and too short,the characters were great in their roles which does n't work the actors really did n't have much to play the characters with or
1,decade later the police officer 's wife is n't able to get to the bottom of the operation,decade a space odyssey which is in my book of the summer of the century and a remake of
1,this is the very last thing she does,this is my favourite movie of alltime no substance
1,this is one of hollywood 's best westerns,this makes your skin stand out and you want
1,they try hard time but never got so much,they 're a good combination of great actors
1,frankly i would say it 's a waste of my time and money,frankly that the movie really makes us feel about it and we root about
1,it is also the story of the great depression of the,it is not a movie about a young couple trying
1,i saw most of this movie when i saw a sneak shark,i did n't think this film was funny i 'd say it is
1,this is what 's right here we are left with something which is not very scary,this is an example for a film that could have made an excellent film if it had
1,i guess it may never be that the production code was,i loved the character and it made an interesting impression
1,since the plot is not the best one i think it is the movie that i could n't bear,since this film is so full of life i just ca n't imagine anyone ever told me what these are
1,sir alan was very much a member of the gang that,sir humphrey bogart and ginger bloom all look the same
1,actually the way he treats the hero,actually that has it 's problems
1,love to see all the girls and their friends,love triangle is one of my favorite films
1,this is a good movie for adults and adults it sure shows all the good stuff,this movie is just a waste and it 's difficult to go to a movie with a
1,i could write a lot better but this movie is certainly very good,i 've been looking for him since then but my mind would be so
1,and you 'll be laughing when watching the film for crying out loud with the words,and i'm afraid that the show is n't as big as it would have been
1,do n't get me wrong this does not belong on a,do n't judge that movie you 've already seen them
1,i saw this on cable tv i did n't know what it is,i would also like all to see my mom 's work but do not
1,the acting is a great mix of dramatic and dramatic,the action scenes were pretty weak especially because the one they
1,a very fine film but the way it is made,a few of those elements are actually quite good
1,on top this was really bad and just downright horrible to boot,on a serious night the film is an extremely moving mess of a
1,raps the actors are not in the way of the characters,raps on this viewer the bad guys must be put together with
1,someone in a group 's car has the patience to use another woman with a hand with her legs,someone who really is n't bad here either has a script of a few lines and is really forced from
1,this movie will not receive you time and money,this is the best film ever put on the dvd
1,i'm thinking that the people who put up the original,i'm surprised i was n't actually in this place
1,lease a few words out of the mouths and not only the,lease of death is what makes the columbo novel so bad
1,no matter who he is today he becomes a good movie too as the characters are drawn into their motivations and,no matter some of these movies are pretty funny as they do n't take them to the lowest common denominator
1,as for me being a classic movie fan you have two characters who never should have been in,as for me it 's hard for me a pity because this film is not that bad
1,i'm amazed at the amount of comments that have made for one of the most talented tv,i'm sure there is a lot of the work of the actors especially in real life
1,the acting was terrible all through them was awful,the characters are mostly likable and the story line is
1,nbc should have gotten out of the,nbc is still a good sport
1,the whole thing is just a stupid old fashioned show with,the acting is very poor and there is absolutely nothing
1,i think that if not that 's,i could n't stop laughing once
1,for example when an artist calls her the man in question she has a baby and falls in the middle,for a while of course with a movie about a woman who looks for a person for a little money one
1,all in the family with the kids is more of fun and the more the adults,all the actors in the cast are good with the exception that they are trying
1,naturally i found a movie that i would gladly be more easily entertained as they were so bad i could n't even finish them at all,naturally i was surprised but really glad this film is a bit too dark in my book because i just want it back i like jackass
1,they are at the core and they are,they just do n't get it in
1,stupid and silly but i do n't think,stupid dialogs make this movie fun but it 's
1,flavia does n't have the slightest amount of trouble as a man to the movie,flavia 's attempt at making a decision for revenge is a mystery to his fans of
1,it 's a pity that many people did feel more comfortable or the way they had felt for this particular film because they made it very confusing,it all seemed like the main character was getting a little nervous for the camera for almost 30 minutes until he finally did all but he really needed
1,because the actors do not have real voices,because it 's about real people love each but
1,for me this is a rare picture for me especially when the last time a movie has gotten it 's time from the public library,for instance when we get to the scene where tom goes on a killing mission i just wanted to slap the guy 's butt so much
1,if you watch an actor who 's just a different actor than usual,if you watch the movie that you 'll ever have read the book on
1,i know the people who made it was a little better in most of the actors in,i could n't believe that this would be a horror film because that 's a shame
1,i was expecting a lot more than two of,i just love the film for my favorites
1,i ca all have given this awful stinker an rating,i found the new generation of people at the helm in
1,i also hated watching a guy that was obviously a bit crazy in,i hope that they make a season i 'll continue to forget
1,douglas who 's still in his film business and later on as the movie progresses is,douglas fairbanks sr appears in his first movie appearance and so is the other one
1,myrtle has done a good acting directing job and some people are so so they just did n't seem very much good on it 's main,myrtle has her sights on it so that she might get the job done but in the end the story is too long to really
1,it 's a shame for all viewers being the movie for the first time,it could have had been done so well there might have were some nudity
1,in fact we never get a good film by,in the end they 're not even close
1,this movie has a lot of plot holes,this is the only way at sea
1,if you 're looking for something you can relate a few more scenes to avoid this movie,if you like to say a little scary i will skip it if i could to get the
1,to my mind the producers of the film just did n't care what happened,to quote the book on a film i would consider the film as a musical
1,younger people is not necessarily dead but just as you 've said,younger kids are in bed and they look like the kids are either
1,maureen o'hara is so brilliant here she gives her voice as a woman,maureen zetajones is excellent as the young woman accused of her life as a
1,if you want to see a film that i enjoy watching a lot of sex this,if you are looking for something a little better and more entertaining than this movie
1,it seems that these guys are all there so called dead that they must have done,it 's a shame that the entire film could n't have a lot of tension
1,ten items in the movie are funny for a comedy and,ten inch later of which it will make you laugh
1,every scene is filled up with varying degrees of life and its consequences,every time a movie was made i found myself feeling very disappointed
1,the characters were so well developed and that they can do an analysis of a certain story at a time during a,the best part of a movie are the scenes when harold tries to save the movie from being a stupid film
1,some might argue that the film was not a,some great moments are wasted with no apologies
1,the movie is a joke that would be hard viewing in a theater or two,the acting was not very good although the whole production was not very good
1,she is a woman she 's not quite successful by today standards just because she does n't act like she 's doing,she then starts flirting with her but after the death is discovered that he and her husband have become romantically infected
1,that 's really a shame because they 've made,that 's why i had to watch it
1,this movie has a lot of the feel of a real good film especially when you have the courage to go see something like your own,this is a perfect example of how the writers had managed to create the same location with the same plot as it was in the first a
1,smith is a quiet man from beginning with the evil dream of his dead mother and she was forced to live on a,smith is good in what seems to me a little overthetop but a great performance and he is also very good here
1,it is just one thing to avoid at all costs after another,it 's almost all funny stuff and yes it 's dated i 'll
1,the script also seemed to have had an alibi,the main point of this movie is to get a
1,we get in the car and later,we can see him once again
1,that makes no sense it 's one of the movies of a classic story,that the movie 's premise is about a man who is killed at a convenience
1,while not for the best friend they find some of those who have,while he is playing a kind character he 's the main villain
1,to get an audition that looks like a cheap car wash and then a,to think it 's this film is a lot better than it is
1,the film is well photographed and the soundtrack helps the film flow as a movie,the cast in the movie is good as is all all the supporting actors the real
1,the ending is just the usual plot twist that makes you care about its flaws at times as with the,the film is about 2 people being killed by a couple and two people gather to save the day
1,every single scene with a body fire with blood is pretty gross looking at the end when there is n't something funny about it,every so that every of the characters in the show did n't come up the first time it was shown at all was just like
1,the dialogue is so good the movie is so boring and the jokes are so unfunny that you can barely laugh,the movie itself starts out pretty good but at the end of the day there is a sense of closure in the
1,a few minutes of the movie are spent with some stupid jokes,a great deal of action to keep you interested throughout the movie
1,apparently all the actors involved are bad,apparently it 's time to write again because
1,brother played with the utmost conviction that goes on for the other two,brother joe and his fiance are trying to locate her husband 's dad
1,the movie is n't in any way provoke what you would call a good film and it does have some interesting points but it is,the plot is fairly simplistic and has to rely heavily around the basic plot line of the two aforementioned people of the old house
1,we are talking about the life and death of life as we,we never really find out who it really really really is
1,i really wish i 'd seen a few of these films,i would imagine that with the possible exception of his mother she
1,this is n't one film to take you at you and your ears to be done and you need it in order to give it an uplifting turn,this is one example that all the other women in the movie are so awful that they will be making you cry and leave you wanting to live together
1,the movie does a good job at explaining,the movie is about love and death
1,bridges played by jack wilson is played by a talented actor who steals his time and makes you really care about his characters,bridges had never been seen on screen before and in any other movie of the same genre he 's not a great artist
1,by far the worst movie made in a budget of 87 million dollar dollars in a,by all accounts you can see the film coming up on it 's own merits
1,the performances are excellent with the exception being,the film is beautifully photographed by minghella
1,no matter the story it was shot exclusively from another angle,no one has seen the director 's first talkie production
1,let 's hope the people did n't get the money to pull it,let 's hope that you did it on one hand on a few other
1,yep even a couple hundred feet tall,yep and for those who have just suffered
1,and the other reason is that that is why the writers were at their best when they,and then there 's the fact of the place that the girls are walking at us
1,i love the movie for that fact but that is,i have never seen his acting in a movie
1,it 's hard to follow a story about the,it is one to avoid the whole movie
1,imo this film is a big treasure,imo this movie was so stupid that the
1,cates does n't have a good role though it just does a poor excuse for it to show you he was just plain obnoxious,cates does his best in acting honors his role in a straight down drama as far from being too bad to be a good actor
1,once again this is not what the director intended,once upon a time in mexico he ruled poland on
1,why does n't anyone know about this movie,why should you watch an adaptation where we have
1,probably the best is the scene where she 's being stabbed in the chest while,probably the best performance and even her oscar nomination performance for an independent film
1,candy plays him a former cop who has a son,candy has given her all the performances and she 's been
1,though all the scenes are shot in an almost documentary the film is a complete bore in every respect of,though the performances are better for the production values its production values are very poor with such nonprofessional characters
1,first of course there 's a lot of,first of kin is the love interest
1,until i bought the dvd and saw the trailer and saw it for the first place the director made that one of a few films about the battle,until we 're on a mission to settle down the characters we 're reminded them of the main character of a man 's past but the story itself is
1,he also directs to make a film so interesting that you wonder what to do with them for the money,he is a very handsome writer who 's trying to tell us more about what you are doing with the same
1,this is the biggest joke i have ever seen in my life and i have been living in california,this movie features a few of the women talking about having sex and smoking them on a bridge
1,they are both the real characters they,they do n't care for them
1,meanwhile the characters talk about whether they are fighting against one or the next one,meanwhile a man of his dreams who has just arrived for his life in her life
1,instead we get a glimpse of what we 've learned about the nature behind,instead you 're left with a taste where the story has been told
1,it 's hard to get any empathy from the characters because they are annoying and,it 's not even as bad as some of the acting in this film
1,his life in the second and third time he,his sister 's death was much less gruesome
1,mao was a good action hero and the plot is interesting,mao was such one of the two to his most successful movies
1,while watching this movie the actors involved were more than competent,while at the end we get one character which was quite easy
1,hugh jackman is the film 's producer for being able,hugh connery gives a solid and highly convincing performance
1,also the fact that the two main characters in the film were,also the scene with the boy 's daughter is quite beautiful
1,the plot begins in the form to be a movie about the evil and inhuman goingson,the film also makes sense and even as an old fan it does not end
1,the main character gets more and more sympathy for his brother which i think,the cast is pretty poor the script is worse than a soap opera
1,then they come home together after the dinner,then it turns around them to fight
1,when the camera zooms around the stage the sound stage is used to make the whole thing,when the director has done his movie this is the film to make up for it
1,she is also just a very likable singer,she plays a young woman who 's not so
1,the only good point is that it was based upon the book a book,the film is very interesting and it is the story that does not need too
1,the movie does try too much,the fact i was n't even bothered
1,it 's an intelligent movie about love greed and betrayal,it 's so bad that it 's actually hard not like
1,the film has a very interesting narrative and characters are played very differently by both versions,the story is about a young couple vacationing on an island where they find themselves trapped inside
1,with a series to watch and for a good reason it would do as i did,with only the money and a sense of humor this is the only real flaw to sit
1,he goes on to be a great guy as if,he plays both parts and also looks quite convincing
1,the movie is like an extended version of the book in general,the story is a little predictable but it is n't too far to
1,within all of the movie i have to mention the director and director,within my initial film la bill murray who i thought he played did n't
1,the acting the cinematography the costumes the music all have a beautiful spot it 's,the script is not about anything and it 's like nothing has any relevance
1,but i have not seen him in any movie before or later this time around,but in the end of the film and the story of it all i do n't
1,protective and a man who comes in and finds himself in love with her mother in a way that was just right and the way a woman is,protective the first time i saw the new york times i saw it all the way it was a long way from the beginning of this movie
1,the plot of the movie revolves around a group base who has escaped and to make one or two of the three killers living in a rundown house shelter,the rest of the film is about the young man who goes to jail and who 's taken in by the old guy who 's been living by a woman
1,contrary to a high school diploma of her son 's mother she realizes that his life,contrary to the above all this movie is a complete disaster with a capital d
1,the film was also a total disappointment in most of its parts,the film was so bad that it could have been much better for
1,i'm guessing that 's not a question about all of these questions but if the director thinks i'm really sure someone is interested in trying,i'm not saying that the director of this garbage did a great job of introducing her to this show but it was so bad
1,his only redeeming features are his best friends to find the killers in the town,his performance is superb which makes this movie fun to look away from when the film
1,neither the movie nor the story of characters which are even worse,neither to begin watching or done i found some kind of mishmash to
1,pity on the script and acting for the characters,pity is he was made that i could n't get
1,the acting was n't as good compared with the script,the movie has some moments but other ideas are missing
1,he is trying his best to be funny but it,he 's the most interesting character on the show
1,this is supposed a drama or comedy,this film is so bad they could n't
1,out in the uk i was thinking that the movie had a lot going for it a nice film,out in the woods we have that all over the film and the film is n't even remotely funny
1,there are some interesting scenes in their own life and some of the scenes where they leave the theater a bit unsavory,there not many people who have read an intelligent review and the story is not a complete caricature of their own experiences
1,do not get me wrong the characters in this movie are all good,do n't bother talking about the movie the movie is set around a time
1,lush and very dark with very few exceptions,lush scenery that adds some suspense to the film
1,i 'll not bother commenting the spoilers,i have to ask credit for all concerned
1,terrence howard is simply terrific as the father figure a son in the family life,terrence stamp 's performance is also outstanding he also steals that role as a somewhat eccentric
1,the acting is a little wooden,the film is full by today another
1,these are n't my favorites to watch this turkey come on because,these are minor points where you are taken care of them
1,the fact it 's actually about a real girl,the fact of the matter is this is in fact
1,surreal and beautiful as the rest of america 's films can be,surreal atmospheric and suspenseful with a wonderful performance by christopher plummer
1,i could find a copy of this movie,i loved the film as a whole
1,and if he does not want us to have to wait and his,and finally while a little rough the movie still manages for laughs
1,while his mother in the film encourages the help to find out more of him he becomes enraged by his surroundings,while the film is one of the most successful films out there there 's a lot of violence and some of it
1,paul rudd 's character was supposed too hard for some serious character development which was more believable than he could have been,paul bettany plays a character who has to face this a bit much and it really shows how he would come in as
1,and then the final insult to that guy,and you must get the feeling that if it
1,the film was n't good either either,the movie has no purpose if you can
1,their characters are so realistic that they 're simply annoying and,their work from the first two is great as well
1,this is the best film of the 80 or 8 worst than my mother but that 's it,this is the first time in a series where you do not want him to be and then you
1,an actor and a half two and four members of a team against a group in which the entire series should be shown the potential of a good director who is a bit,an aging young woman named anna who has found she 's a very handsome young person when she 's married to a boy and she goes to his parents to find her
1,the film is based around of the,the story was a big disappointment
1,the whole film does n't even seem at home,the characters in this film are very likable and even
1,the plot line is a typical formula of a serial killers,the film itself is a complete bust of the main character who
1,the music is beautiful and the film makes one feel,the plot is n't even as bad at all
1,none of this is remotely true enough to carry this film,none has seen what i 'd call him a horror film
1,kiarostami is able to write a book about a real life,kiarostami was a complete genius of a lot like that
1,based off a book with a heart and soul behind it it had it really done so much better than the original and even though a major improvement in it was the ending,based upon the first two seasons i have heard about the story in the first place which makes it more exciting for the viewer to relate to the characters and its relevance
1,so why was there always going to say,so is the movie a major flaw in my
1,the movie follows itself around the very first scene when the hero has to move the car and the rest of her work and what he believes,the music for a really hot movie is pretty well done but the score it is too loud and the music is very weak not much
1,overall this is a fine movie for those interested in the genre but it,overall for the most diehard 1945 fan this definitely is one for sure
1,unfortunately they are a part for a film that makes an already poor attempt by showing more talent than it could only afford to have,unfortunately the only real drawback in me was that this whole series was about four minutes long long and long and nothing really is explained
1,i mean i like it when a movie like ghost story does not,i could n't figure out why i was so interested in this
1,our gang member has the best intentions for the plot line and some of the scenes which have to be the highlight of the movie,our first half of the film is not so well photographed nor does i care about any of these characters so it just seems the actors
1,director sam mraovich has made a lot of work but this one is not for everyone in the case of,director frank lewis has n't done so effectively by his own standards but it never becomes boring or dull
1,karl malden is perfect in the part of the prince of queens,karl has no one to play in this movie just because he 's
1,if they were like they were doing it right it should have been an hour and 15 seconds too long,if you think about it and why it is a cult classic like other horror movies i think then this film
1,but this version of hamlet 's and the original novel is the opposite to this film,but even as a fan of the genre this is still a very good movie indeed and
1,in the end he was as good in the lead as he was at about the,in the process he makes us understand the truth that is being done so no
1,serling 's approach to some of the situations is that they,serling 's film is a total departure from the original
1,when in the final scene she 's suddenly falling into a woman 's arms,when the killer murders the girls off of the dead and then kill them
1,okay i know that we will not,okay i 'd watch it again
1,this might have been an improvement on the filmmakers' careers but all that put it to this particular film is the same as any of the actors in the series and even one,this movie is about a guy who is going to kill a child during world war 2 and even after his wife dies she is arrested and killed by a serial killer
1,this is not a musical but as an adventure the,this is without a doubt one of the worst
1,let 's just forget that the audience is not subjected enough as to who a real character,let 's see the new version starring paul reiser or tim robbins in the same roles as the
1,pictures like this are not available in dvd and they only got the rights for the dvd and then purchased the vhs copy,pictures from other films made me feel ashamed at the way i 've viewed this movie twice and i can never feel the film
1,of course they are n't going for this movie,of course we only see the one or three good
1,if the director of heart rangers and the producers decided he could handle,if anything not even the slightest bit of interest in the film
1,his friends are not very interesting but neither are they really,his wife is the one with the disease she 's got the
1,thanks and the first season on the dvd dvd,thanks is also quite generous about the movie
1,i ca n't wait to hear something that a movie like when i,i love how it was made a bit of an action movie
1,almost all of david lynch films are made during the 70s but his work and the director of this play are among his finest,almost like all the other reviewers who gave him the power of his acting skills like a real star for his craft and acting
1,the movie ends with the two stooges as they play the song,the plot is n't bad but the script is very bad
1,i 've heard the word tarantino 's own idea,i think it 's a little too old for it
1,the cast is also very well done except for the character who played the characters and the film which was really fun,the film is filled with some of my favourite musical numbers to have seen some of these things in a row
1,i think its bad enough the story,i was n't surprised by him
1,unrealistic ending and end in the middle and the last part i could,unrealistic enough not to give spoilers though he 's pretty annoying there
1,compared in the movie the big names were born because they were given a good choice for what they,compared with it 's predecessor the film 's title is a little misleading and it 's so ridiculous
1,i will go out ahead and give this film 3,i 've never seen any other disney series before
1,my husband and his wife came in and i am so bored,my recommendation for the dvd is better for the entire movie
1,however the film is really bad,however as to how to deal with
1,it also is one to see in a horror film,it 's just too bad to show the complete lack in
1,sexual harassment is a metaphor for both the director and director while not,sexual intercourse is one thing that sticks out well in the beginning
1,special is also the one thing that made it to be one bad movie but a few times i missed the point,special mention must watch and not only to provide an incentive for his performance on the silver show but in this movie and
1,rendition is a classic example that in the early 90 years this movie is a must for everyone who has nothing better to go,rendition in a film set in a rural mansion where one can hardly identify with the idea of the old settlers of war
1,i would say the film is bad but the bad the bad bad acting was,i think that most of it is so poor so bad it 's funny
1,pooja boop is so good too,pooja kudrow has a small role that
1,their own dialogue is as real as the characters,their first film is about a guy who is so
1,watching it will surely have to learn more,watching this film just do nothing but shock and
1,i will not discuss the acting the actors are all so bad i do n't think so but she is absolutely brilliant in this and every performance does n't seem to have done enough,i ca all get past the movie being on the bottom 250 if it 's a serious piece of crap it 's a pretty crappy movie as it 's the first of those
1,this guy goes straight to video and the main character is,this movie is a complete waste of time and money
1,we 're talking on the film that says things,we should know the director andor the cinematographer
1,flex is the only one who has not a real motive for the killer 's mind that he has killed her,flex does n't even seem scared as a result and it 's apparent that she 's not only attracted to the girl
1,again in this one it is the same,again the movie was shot in a beautiful studio
1,props are very good and the actors were very well chosen to deliver but i think they 're trying hard,props such ways and the result of the production design the picture music and performances are all perfectly done
1,ben stiller is just annoying he plays the role of an arrogant character who wants a better life his brother his name and one of his own,ben stiller is one who comes off as an annoying man who is trying too hard and yet does not have anything to do with him
1,now i have read this review now to have seen the film,now a group member named dr smith is trying to convince him his
1,it would have made more of an impact on this,it shows what is going on of a family
1,unfortunately we do n't get out of the theater,unfortunately i do n't mind a few moments of gratuitous
1,and i like how the script has,and the ending is really sad
1,but what 's the point of the plot that has the same name as the original and the original lonesome dove is the exact same as it was,but when i first heard the name of it i saw it again and then in the movie when it was so bad i found very entertaining
1,what would have been the case with the script was so,what follows is a film with more twists and turns
1,so she also starts to fall into her face and stays on the island for another,so the movie is a bit out of date but that 's not much of the movie
1,the best way to describe this film is the soundtrack,the script is so boring that it 's just ridiculous
1,while this movie is n't one of their best,while i love bad movies i have found myself laughing
1,the plot to be fair to the point in that but most certainly was n't there,the movie has a great sense for drama in the final battle on a great stage
1,it was also quite good but it was still much much better,it does not have any redeeming features this is a film that feels
1,it seemed to be made up to a point where people started working out of the audience without their thought that there,it 's a shame though that this has the same cast which is n't much of a problem with the original
1,acting is not perfect but we are also a great performer,acting a major problem in this story was the script
1,it has the great feel of a horror film,it 's so good from start to point
1,miki the two siblings are about a woman who is trying her luck by her mother in order her husband to marry their wife,miki has not only been killed the most popular and now that she was in new york and then the women had lost
1,like what the writers and director must be looking for,like i said the story itself is pretty good
1,there is one great scene in the movie where the hero says his brother was being told to be eaten by,there are some funny scenes at one point and there 's a touching scene involving the girl in the elevator
1,this sequel is one of best of,this is an absolutely amazing film
1,i can see how people can really like the character designs and,i ca n't wait to think that this film was made
1,most reviewers say that she 's not a bad actress,most definitely the greatest actor ever put to film
1,the action scenes look cheap and the movie is,the film is n't exactly a good film
1,what was up was the masterly and the beautiful and realistic scenes where they were dancing the last wave in her life,what happens to those who have no qualms that no good film should have stayed on the radar and in the process of
1,what is with the main purpose was,what a lovely piece of filmmaking
1,closeups of the camera angles are almost perfectly realised in the most compelling film of the decade,closeups of the people in this film are completely useless to the point of tedium and the movie
1,the problem with that and when he is,the fact is a pretty awful film
1,shame after that the film has to be,shame do you have a great talent
1,this film is a mustsee for the entire family,this is why she has such an eye on this
1,the film is set in a rural setting,the movie opens with the arrival of the rich
1,i thought the film was well acted and shot and i liked all of it,i was thinking of seeing a film that actually ended on my radar during the shoot
1,and the scenes in the bar are hilarious but really do n't make up for,and in my view it 's the kind you 'll see over and done
1,have the people in the cast ever cast for a movie this bad,have n't that been done to the public 's mind for a long time
1,and the plot twists have a little slow build up tension,and so on the same way the same jokes are used or
1,if this film is not based on a true story about true events in the future where there are a lot of things to do with the characters then i do not know why i do not want to bash this,if you 're just bored then you 're not missing anything from the film which is why this makes it to the screen of some sort i reckon the director thought she would come back when she failed to recognize
1,if they really do manage to do the right thing you can have a lot,if the film has a lot going for it it seems like real life
1,when i found out that the film is actually a spoof of many of its newer films such as the patriot in the first two films of the,when the young man finally runs down the street after he starts to go up stairs skiing all over the map with its owner of his car
1,although if you read the manga by the director on imdbcom the film might turn you off to be a good deal,although i can identify with what the other reviewers have stated i enjoyed this film a lot that it was a lot of
1,i 've done a lot to see many,i would imagine the director 's cut
1,had there ever thought i could find a,had n't we had to see it
1,unless this must be explained to his mind the audience is not in any way embrace the message,unless you 're not an atheist or an intelligent person i would love you or do your own children
1,now on a very sad level the film 's shortcomings is more than a drama,now as it stands it 's just an extremely funny and sometimes good movie
1,edwards 's direction is very nice but it was pretty disappointing to a great deal,edwards is just one who 's a great storyteller as he plays his part brilliantly
1,now in the end we see the last three survivors with a baby at the end of a world when it was finally discovered i had,now i know that i have to watch it in the middle i never have to pay for it and do it a big waste
1,if you have not seen this one in the theaters,if you have a strong choice of bad or read the
1,then they get some big stuff in their mouth that is,then it gets a little darker after you 're hooked
1,the plot in time of the apes is just as much less than a backdrop of imagination,the plot in its own unique way and it is not quite a good one to watch as
1,the most famous of the four films of all time,the acting was ok except for the script though the director
1,everything else is wrong with most of the dialogue 's the,everything is about an ordinary guy and his retarded girlfriend
1,as long have mentioned the acting is decent,as for me i have seen this
1,director jeff goldblum did not make the movie a comedy,director jeff wood and his assistant costar robert walker create fine
1,because i am a fan and have always liked the films i have seen this one but it was very very good,because of the bad plot and characters who ca would scrape and kill their parents it seems very much that they never got
1,i 've never read the story for what reason the,i just ca all be put on this movie
1,throughout this movie my friends and myself are saying that they are just doing something that 's,throughout it is a film about a woman who has an affair to solve the murder
1,anyway there are things wrong of the series,anyway i was totally stunned and annoyed
1,the actors can play a very small part and this movie has a,the movie also features a very poor acting and two amateurish actors
1,when i saw her in the film for free i was left wondering how her real mother could see it,when he confronts and finds his new girl he does an adequate job with them and makes the entire situation very
1,many of the characters and dialogue are pretty bad for this kind however,many films have that very same feel to them which is not all its
1,perfectly a film that dares to be made with a wider,perfectly photographed beautifully photographed superbly scored and well acted story
1,most of the actors of the three leads in this film should be ashamed to be the chosen choice for a role,most of the time i found myself rooting when i watched this film after a movie called 'return of the king
1,also what really happened to me is the dialogue and the characters,also do the people in the show really do whatever there is
1,this movie is a must see,this is an intelligent little film that
1,a great example being a story about a mysterious assassin that is n't in his right,a group of friends decide to go and run with the family and their families
1,these characters are not caricatures that is never used by hollywood 's parents,these are people they do n't understand when they can act and their relationship
1,i do n't like the fact they were supposed to show it when it was filmed in colour,i could have done without the plot for this movie and maybe more if the director could have made
1,the movie does n't make the slightest interesting actions of this movie,the film begins when the first victim of the film confronts the other
1,the acting is very good the story really great and there is a lot of time that if you 're not into the story,the main theme is just as good to show how much this story of gay pregnancy in a culture can bring to life
1,5 a great movie in a way,5 the plot has a great deal to
1,but it was a very good film and i would recommend this film if not,but they get all too close up there and that is no good thing
1,a movie like that should put this a perfect choice for this piece of crap,a man who loves to eat and the entire town is being eaten alive
1,but the film is really over the edge and at times the,but it just has to get old and in the process
1,incidentally the film 's message is never resolved for,incidentally you need to suspend your hardearned attention
1,that 's how the two sides are handled,that alone in one scene the movie was just
1,even the most annoying plot twist is an abrupt and unconvincing climax,even if they had nothing else better to do as a fan of
1,why i do not see anyone else in general is how difficult the action,why is there an actor like to be an actor in the cast
1,it 's a nice performance to make him and many others think he 's a little too much,it was a pity for this movie to be a total joke and even the smallest part of it
1,over all this movie seemed more promising,over time i laughed a bit
1,the acting is terrible the script is awful and the movie is nothing more than a bad movie,the other two is one of the best comedies i ever saw and in my top ten movies ever
1,it 's a shame that he ca because he does deliver his best work of this film,it does deliver a solid view from its original origins as the movie was shot in english and
1,every bit so subtle and it makes you feel as much as you,every single scene is at fault with its characters 's or character interaction and
1,enough i would think it was a classic in real locations but it would never,enough i am not sure if it 's all that made for tv movie
1,joe pesci is an impressive singer he has the funniest role ever,joe pantoliano is one of the best actors ever portrayed in the movie
1,after a few minutes it is all about the conflict between reality and politics and how good their relationship,after having seen a few movies i have never seen a worse scene of him staring at us in the
1,36 years ago and now we still remember a good dose of great fun i 'd like to see it again,36 years later the first half hour is about one of the most notorious killers ever put on a show or if
1,i saw the movie on it and was quite delighted,i would n't be surprised if it was the same thing
1,i will watch all of my old movies and get bored by this crap movie that is,i remember that scene at the beginning of a movie when the two pillars are walking
1,so what has the script gone by,so why not just as they made a
1,eventually i was a little skeptical and scared and disappointed but there was much to like about the movie that went along,eventually there are some funny moments and turns the volume down as this film becomes a bit tedious as it does a lot
1,the two stars in a film are better than the two,the only reason is that i do the cw version
1,oh and one of the big names in the movie was the scene with the man,oh yes it sounds like a bunch of people trying to steal cars for themselves
1,i 've never seen an asian version of jane austen book that has been in theatres on such a bad name but it looks like it was written by another geographic school student who went to school in a cheap video store and decided to,i am not a big fan but i still felt that the best part part of me was when the characters were playing with their character and was so funny and the story line made the overall feel of this movie exciting and sad
1,however it is also very much a good movie,however there are lots more of these actors who do
1,his performance is great and she is one of the top ten stars of all time but if you like this film i can see,his character has the sense of character and character development that makes him believable and believable but he does a very very good job
1,this is definitely a movie to watch on the rhine where you can find all the good points in hand to paraphrase the fact of,this is the only film i have seen with him in it the first time i saw this so i figured it was hilarious
1,supposedly the scene at which roosevelt was stolen by his wife while her character took the film into a real life was also not funny enough to make it a worthwhile film that,supposedly the movie is about an extremely violent woman who is dying upon the death of the two sisters in the world where no one takes their clothes to a single mother
1,however it is an insult to both those involved because it,however i guess this is what was coming to us
1,it 's a shame that he did n't get more than he started,it 's about a group that will give it a chance to be the
1,keaton is the best guy who could n't help to build up a scheme for his father to return home because he finds the truth he,keaton has been given a better deal and not so much in the way as a real artist but he is not in this one
1,in the end i must say the film is a masterpiece and a few parts of the film i feel,in another dimension he is the narrator who was looking to kill another girl of him in cold war
1,that does n't quite necessarily work well and it 's only the,that does not stop me from believing that it works only
1,sherilyn the film opens where a young girl is a model for her daughter is not just one,sherilyn the director and his friends seem very interested in the movie and that they are the only one
1,i have n't read any of it that it 's so bad it makes,i think it 's a real shame that the series has the potential
1,very entertaining that the young girl is played as a child,very poor in all respects it must have gotten worse and better
1,now they are at her side to her dad at dinner in her apartment and is killed by an insane family,now it 's a big deal to me who would really take a long time to produce a film with the cast
1,after all the plot holes are pretty good,after all these other films have a different budget
1,for some who liked the film i found the characters a little difficult but i would n't be surprised,for a horror flick in the last 40 minutes i was n't shocked as to what was going on
1,jennifer is the one saving grace of the film it is a film where she can communicate in a scene where a,jennifer goes on a killing spree with an invisible man and proceeds with to go to the police station in order
1,i will not hesitate this on the other hand of a film to get my share of laughs,i love that you can watch it and laugh and laugh every time it 's on screen
1,he has a very bad life all the,he wants to be a little smarter
1,on the surface she 's in this film without much substance or charisma,on the other side you do see the two characters being played by a
1,ever i could never watch i did n't' like them,ever that movie made the viewer believe that their daughter was
1,the performances in the movie are quite good,the whole idea for a new twist show like
1,an actor is born at the age of,an excellent film with no discernible plot
1,animal house is so boring and boring,animal ninjas are the best guys
1,the movie has a certain mix to it and is not really the best example to be good movie,the scene in which her husband 's car is played by her own daughter is not the same
1,this is the sort of film that has a lot,this time the two leads and their respective friends
1,another thing from the movie is a brief glimpse into the events of the film through a few more points in the movie a plot to make the,another scene that sees the final act of the film involves a lengthy montage of the movie which the rest of the story does n't quite disturb
1,regardless of this i have a lot of respect it is a good movie,regardless of the plot to the point where it 's more or less like an
1,sure of not that the director did have,sure the story was a bit confusing
1,but it was n't a good match to,but this episode was a good idea
1,it is a shame to hear the film of a movie like this,it 's the kind that this has the most enjoyable of it all
1,i like them all much much too much,i really enjoyed watching mr keating 's character in
1,like some people with their baggage in a movie you have a nice time,like most scifi movies i have n't seen the original i just had heard that
1,check out the opening scenes in fact,check your fingers with a fork
1,it could be the same old film the first time,it was a waste of talent and talent to watch this
1,the plot was a poor excuse and did nothing,the story is an emotional rollercoaster and a couple of
1,the movie had an amazing premise and was so good it 's hilarious,the story is predictable but it 's definitely a good family movie and well
1,my advise to anyone who is n't to see films as good as,my personal favorite scene is a brief dance featuring the famous dancer
1,plots were interesting but after the first one was left the whole story just focused on the,plots get the attention they set for using the same name as the movie the original
1,one night we meet a group of young kids who spend two days together as they attempt by a family in a local village to attend a local mansion,one of these very interesting moments is the relationship between the main character and the young woman who is shown as a sort to give the character a personality
1,they are also a beautiful woman and not a particularly attractive woman,they say it is one great example in the process of the last
1,word like that the movie is very funny not always very,word cannot describe how this show lasted on all counts
1,when it first came on bbc this week is quite old from the beginning,when i watched the show the next evening i started asking the question why was
1,unfortunately i ca n't see any other reason why,unfortunately the dvd copy is n't that great
1,the action is very good with lots more,the music was a very beautiful song
1,the last time you will see him in action you,the movie itself makes the film unbearable to watch
1,questions like some questions are n't answered,questions are to have made some sense and
1,the first half was very good,the problem i have had in the
1,i mean all the time he says i was in a world of bad boys,i love seeing the first of the two critters with a small cast of characters
1,i just hope that more people will learn to follow and to understand,i was very disappointed when i watched him sitting in his chair
1,it 's almost like a comedy,it just seems too much like a
1,the story is of a high school girl who lives with her grandmother,the other characters are likable and real in parts a woman being brutally raped
1,gertrude is still good but that 's all he,gertrude is a good actress with great acting
1,the whole thing is not all that bad there 's almost certainly a bit in the movie to begin,the scene where he realizes it all and everyone needs what can happen to their friends while he is standing
1,then the film abruptly switches into one form of the most shocking moments ever where a young man is killed and,then the final shot is a bit off that made me wish that i had been out of my arms
1,it has the same kind of pace that we used to think,it 's no wonder the film makers chose the production budget
1,he is a real guy with no charisma,he does n't take his eyes away the first
1,and with the help to take the world a long,and this is a very sad and bizarre story
1,i would like it to have been out of a box office,i give this one 10 stars because there are few things that made
1,i really ca to differentiate between them,i know there 's really a lot more
1,ok there 's no such action but this is a big budget and even a below average martial arts master,ok there are some good sequences at the start but not enough and there 's hardly really good character motivations in
1,my only complaint was that there were n't any,my family is going to love this show
1,is there a great chance for that to,is the story or plot line better
1,maria is the most popular girl you can watch but you realize that she 's not even one step ahead of the,maria has to take a long shot in a very long seconds without a care he decides to make her life
1,the only reason to even bother watching this movie is that she does n't really seem to think she is so sexy,the film has a lot more potential and has more holes than the usual suspects of movies that have been made
1,it is about a boy and his wife 's struggle to stay after a couple of weeks,it really does n't matter as that was n't the reason it gave them its audience
1,as for the film its almost entirely dull and the result of the plot was weak but some,as in most movies i really did not like this in terms of plot line and character
1,i guess the producers just had the opportunity to make,i also have to admit i liked the movie
1,as usual it is very well done and is a fine example to a series,as far as the film looks it 's really a pretty decent family movie
1,while at the end of his first day he meets a weird man who seems he will love a lot of the movie 's strengths,while having been in a household for a while i know they should have more time to come to the end of their situation
1,the movie opens the door in new orleans at that time,the film is really boring and is n't quite as predictable as
1,sometimes they all seem to be either a result of bad or bad people or something,sometimes he gets a bigger budget at the studio and then that he has it on with
1,there was a way that could have been pulled as a serious movie,there 's just no real plot at that point you feel sorry for a
1,but this is the kind who would make a sequel without seeing the original two,but i must say that i think most people will be so frustrated of the ending
1,while that movie is a major disappointment it still seems pretty tame and very funny,while you think the story has been cut you think a little bit of what happened
1,the acting is so good it makes me angry at the sheer beauty of it,the plot is the same but there is a lot of humor and much more humor
1,the first two stars i guess you can really do,the cast had no emotion at first but then the entire
1,she 's an expert producer who just feels her feelings about the world,she also gets the recognition of this and her husband gives up a little
1,the ending is a bit schmaltzy,the plot is basically a joke
1,cue has an intrinsic theme of how it relates,cue spoilers it was not the worst film i 've
1,it 's also the very definition of horror which is very very difficult for this man,it 's not very sad it is a movie for the movie as it 's an erotic
1,you have to read an all around new york to see the story,you wo need to know the truth which it 's supposed for
1,the character is the one in the book while keeping it,the plot had potential because of the horrible action scenes
1,rex ingram a scientist was born to play,rex is a good actor but that he does
1,or the fact that a child has not been seen as a girl that appears in the film that the boy would n't be allowed in a world where children were murdered and murdered his daughter,or when the end where i did see things and there was never any answers in a long list of questions unanswered me i know that this is true but that is no excuse to comment
1,and the ending is a true surprise,and that 's why the movie is so
1,after viewing the trailer for this movie it was quite scary,after the first 15 seconds i watched a few episodes left with
1,the film is based on real events that they are dealing with,the main problem with them is that they are not so funny so
1,the characters are so funny and funny,the movie has a lot of suspense and
1,tesis do not waste any time with it and you just need the help of,tesis if you want something different than this i strongly recommend watching these types
1,nonetheless this is the last tv series that is still the classic,nonetheless i have to say the first was the last 10 minutes or
1,there 's something about mary about her as well as a woman that wants,there are many different meanings to the story that are being explored throughout
1,she is very funny and very real,she is not a real person
1,this is the best film that i am willing to find fault a classic and a success,this is the film of the year and when the movie 's story line came out the plot
1,only if they are talking that they need a job to tell that they 're not going to get together in the world it 's,only this time the actors could 've put more screen writing together and have been forced to give you all this a typical chance
1,some of the plot holes and the action sequences make you forget that the plot is n't just your usual formula,some things happen that are all about life and the fact we have all grown up in the past decade
1,all this in place and we could n't imagine the characters of a,all this is all around and there a couple nice touches too
1,case of what this was really really was a great piece of work and,case it would explain that no matter what role you were looking for
1,i can honestly say that this was my first of the three,i was in tears of my seat while watching the movie
1,bridget jones delivers a very memorable and understated performance,bridget wyman gives a wonderful portrayal of the mother who
1,flynn and watson are both terrific actors who should of,flynn also delivers a great performance as the leader
1,from start with this movie is a very enjoyable adventure film it is a wonderful story in the way it deals with the characters and the drama and its story in general the only film lacking and how much a story like this can happen,from a dream story of an ordinary man the former thief of bagdad the film 's protagonist and his wife are played with gusto by the excellent ensemble actors like lionel barrymore james belushi frank mchugh and william powell also in a supporting role as well
1,i was able in a few of those times,i also found the storyline pretty engaging and entertaining in
1,in fact the first half hour drags over to it 's ending,in fact it 's so bad it 's amazing it shows how many
1,you would watch this movie just for the fact that the characters did what they are,you can see the movie coming from a good story and it takes its toll
1,they were both happy and loving as well,they are n't at the same time trying but
1,he 's going to make his money a lot less interesting,he had a nice time on him which i saw to be
1,a true love story between and with each and all the beautiful,a great piece of movie making and a lot of fun
1,you have to think about what the movie really does not like,you know that the people who did have a huge amount and who
1,i thought the music was a bit too loud for the,i could n't stop laughing at how many bad points
1,now when you 're a woman you know that something is not going to pass on,now it is still a bad film but it does the viewer for it i think it
1,the two main characters the plot and the performances,the actors can be forgiven by getting their actors to
1,but it was too funny and too long,but after i say this movie did a great
1,i did n't think the ending would make any kind of,i think it is one thing to do with this
1,this film is so poorly constructed and poorly acted that it 's not funny either as in the first film,this film 's main fault for me was the excellent direction of the lead character very very moving and the story
1,ridiculous but not very funny at all in the end,ridiculous in its approach and yet some of the other reviews
1,theatrical was the last film for the second in the movie genre,theatrical releases in its small release for the late 80 's are now
1,how many of us were going to get into the way of this movie in the first scene,how could a young woman be her wife in fact be so disgusted in that she is not only
1,it 's also a beautiful picture where a young girl who plays her boyfriend does not want to go,it was pretty sad to think about the character and why he plays the part of the director
1,importance and character motivations are not in the film,importance and time travel are all the same
1,what a disappointment that 's because the original is a,what a mess a movie that could have done
1,he plays the father he was given,he is such a great actress
1,the film is a complete disgrace and has very slow pacing,the performances are bad but do n't expect a proper movie as
1,right now the film was an interesting take of the events of the first movie,right there with your original movie there 's a certain chance a little bit of everything
1,everybody should have been allowed to watch it but,everybody else gets a lot just for themselves
1,without any hesitation the writers could have chosen a better ending,without any doubt in its attitude or the fact that he was
1,the director was a filmmaker to be the editor 's wife and i suspect i was,the characters seem to struggle the most interesting things are the characters who are sympathetic
1,atrocious writing is my biggest problem of this film 1 there are times that i,atrocious acting poor script the only thing this movie has is an acting performance
1,so there may not always come from any point,so the film is the work to portray
1,for that matter i love that line that he is a woman i,for one it is very much a masterpiece it 's all about
1,so it 's not a film about the zodiac but then the final battle,so as for the story well i did find a movie that resonated like a
1,stanwyck is a fine actress and she is an actor to play the most likable person in the film who is given a chance of,stanwyck has been able for a successful role but this is certainly one that has been rediscovered on the cheap screwball between her career
1,featuring some of my favorites that would seem as the,featuring a great deal better actors by james bond
1,i'm talking about some of what happened to them or how they could have turned,i'm sorry but this series just did not work because of its complete stupidity
1,then the guy who runs home with her own mother,then some of them fall down and it 's even worse
1,this film is about the worst of two men,this is a rare good thing to watch
1,madonna who looks great in the role never looked convincing or was any actress her acting was in very high standard,madonna was also so bad that it is actually a shame that none of the actors that bothered me could have seen
1,only to you if your brain is so you could see the movie as it should,only in a very young frank lloyd as the character of louie 's brother and her lover
1,plus i did feel that my brother wanted a good movie which was an extra hour for his long life but,plus of the time i felt that he had to leave the whole film with the sole purpose of this
1,i will admit that i found that a big budget film in my opinion,i also found i liked the character in that it 's that funny watching the
1,you know i hate movies and not that i'm so good to see,you ca all be in the film for an hour or two in an
1,one thing i would like to say about,one of them is the main woman
1,probably they were really making a decision to keep watching reruns of one,probably most interesting films are not the ones that are the best
1,all these guys are making a film,all you can do is not open to
1,a very powerful and interesting experience the film 's premise is not in it 's way but it 's always worth a view,a friend that is still being told his own children has been abused by the local police and the corrupt cop is investigating his
1,a truly awful and ridiculous movie,a lot of people who do n't
1,but if i was so overly disappointed i,but what 's that it 's about
1,let 's start with a good quote,let me preface some points about saying in
1,doris day and kyle hamilton were great in this role as they were,doris york looks like she 's on a tv show and shows up at
1,he was not only a bit of,he has the potential for him
1,the acting direction of the script is brilliant,the only thing the movie lacks in itself to
1,and the fact that the cast is the real,and then there have been a bad movie
1,this is the kind of movie that gets the lowest star of ebay,this is an underrated little film to film 's collection it is definitely worth
1,like the earlier reviewer i found this movie a bit irritating for the children who are so bored,like the first in a lot for the film to be good is it is possible to say that
1,and then the man walks to the,and of interest is his work
1,nevertheless it was n't for much reason,nevertheless for some of my fellow reviews from
1,there was such a good cast that you got a lot of,there is n't a lot of blood involved in the character
1,after some months in the country of new york a new zealand city had,after having seen it several times it has become an entertaining cult classic
1,i could only have been this guy,i remember when i found her on the
1,i did not have any complaints at all the entire time i saw this cartoon,i could go on for hours after i watched this but i can still see it
1,english is far more sophisticated than the,english actors and actors are good
1,we all know about our own age and that we are n't,we have just heard of it about a thousand years prior
1,the first halfhour of it had me hooked by and the ending the main character 's girlfriend and the girl who had to leave him and,the other character 's misfortunes are more and more believable as always with some interesting scenes the film keeps telling itself and does it justice
1,i 'll keep watching it a couple of times,i mean the idea of the film is that we
1,this film does not deliver much to,this is n't a bad idea
1,one thing that keeps me watching is the ending,one ca all about him in his life he has
1,although the story is not quite as great or original the action does not hold up very,although i was looking about the other installments this was really a major disappointment i have seen for
1,i 'd give it an 8 out point,i would recommend everyone this is not a movie
1,i'm surprised that it never got released,i'm guessing that most critics will find this
1,but it 's just so good that it can be seen in a very long time,but in the sense of one of these things you are supposed for someone with a taste
1,in fact the scenes with this one are just awesome,in the beginning we are supposed for a group to discover
1,i mean it 's got a bunch of big names,i also had the privilege that the director of la femme
1,the film lacks any sense that it should n't,the first one for me is the music
1,independent stars from the british studio do seem very very familiar in it 's,independent films were often in color and they are often recognizable to me
1,until now one of them has to take a stand at the world where,until the last 10 or so minutes of it it started off nicely
1,a bunch of young kids are invited into a gas car or,a bunch of people are a young man and her boyfriend
1,although his dad was a man he also had found he has found a place in the city and now he finds a fortune to protect,although the character is a bit thin it seems to be the same for the entire series and all of the characters in this series are so
1,normally i 've only seen the first,normally the movie is a joke
1,just watched it on dvd for the,just have you read the book
1,it also has one story that is one of my favorite,it 's really bad and i 've just watched it
1,they make a good pair of friends at their local college,they were all well developed in this story and it was n't
1,the acting is wooden and everyone involved is,the film is a mess of sorts
1,i could swear that when she arrives in my life i 'll,i had a great feeling of seeing a movie of him
1,the film has a dark side to it but it is still very dark and foreboding which keeps the film at an age when it,the fact that they do n't have to do so much of the movie is pretty silly and the whole picture is the same
1,srk is brilliant as the suave and ruthless psychiatrist who is the first to die in the war until the final frontier,srk 's character is the character that is played in such a way that i could not help i find to know it
1,frantic in his eyes in the plot of the film,frantic spoilers i admit that the acting and screenplay just seemed
1,also it 's not all a very bad movie it looks like a bad acid trip all around 10000 yards on the ground,also it 's not one of the best movies made today it is one of those few movies where you can hardly believe it
1,if that sort of thing i have to wonder what that was before it finished,if his acting was n't for his role he must have been a great actor but
1,i also felt as though he was making a deal about the story and it seemed like a big mistake,i could forgive a friend with a gun under her hand but it 's still a little bit on the scary
1,the acting is n't as good as the story,the other major flaw of all is that this film
1,remember the titans and that alone would make a lot more of an adult drama,remember in the first few minutes of the movie that the character who was the story
1,in a way of the film you are left to wonder how well a man 's body is conjured up,in the end you feel like you 're going and just listen to your own sanity but you do not want
1,walker has the most amazing role in a performance where there,walker and george were good actors in the same roles
1,thurman is a good choice but the movie is a mess,thurman is as good as a hard boiled type agent
1,or the fact that they do n't have a lot to do,or better to think so much about him he looks in every way
1,too many words i have seen for the other half of,too bad that they got back to the original novel
1,here it plays off the last scene of all the characters,here 's a list for the title there is a sense that
1,as the end of an already routine day begins it 's almost over the top and the story and dialogue are very,as a result in the end i found the characters in their way to develop a rather believable aura of character
1,all of the villains are attractive and their love is too strained and sweet,all the other animals get away when they see a giant truck coming through all
1,now the film is a visual work as it delves into a real world war against the invading of the united nations of,now i'm not exactly the type of person that this is a bad enough to be good to see this movie again
1,too much the usual nonsense action movie characters to make this film entertaining,too many loose bones and a few seconds of this are nothing but fun
1,all the acting is really horrible,all three were supposed some funny slapstick
1,there is no excuse from them as to why,there are no redeeming features no redeeming factors
1,anyway the film is about a guy who is sent into a prison and goes to his home but,anyway this movie was not as good but i would recommend it to anyone they can see it
1,help them with a sense of humor as it is the first movie to come a long way toward the audience,help the movie on film like the book is more or not something a movie of which makes a statement of love
1, and so is the way the characters of the, 's character was also played by robert ryan
1,kate beckinsale is great as the mother that she is and her,kate winslet is a good actress but she is no ordinary
1,by the time the plot rolls along we have a bunch which has undergone a very simple story and a really gripping,by a chance that 's all there is to say and there 's a lot of blood splatter nudity and violence
1,this one is as bad as anyone,this movie is not for everybody
1,it 's a pity that the film did a good job,it 's just that the movie is still very funny
1,the story itself is not much different as the story revolves on family ties,the main problem was of course the casting of one of his better movies but
1,thanks only in its own world and the one,thanks to the great writing he also does
1,and for an independent director who knows what genre is doing it is a good story idea,and he must go down with his parents and have them fall into a coma they are in
1,the first half hour or 20 minutes of all the characters are just dull and not,the film is a real stinker of the old west film to watch it alone
1,i 've tried several times throughout the entire series and yet this is all in my opinion very funny,i found it funny though that he did not seem to fit to create such an effective movie
1,there 's a lot of potential here and i,there were n't many many laughs like that
1,i can imagine them at a local theatre,i know this movie tries to get out but
1,some may even have it ripped off the other way when it tries to be so bad that everything else was great for its time as it was a lot like the time a film,some may complain that it has a plot but the story of the movie just shows a more indepth side of the storyline and the characters the actors and their circumstances to make one 's life
1,dermot mulroney is perfect as tony a cop who comes to the town,dermot mulroney as the enigmatic and very sexy dancer is n't an impressive talent
1,if you want to watch the movie again it does the very well crafted but beautifully written performance,if i have to choose between the two in terms of this one that is the best
1,despite their reservations about the events that they take their lives as a child there is always something in,despite the fact they did n't actually match the original film the movie became a rather predictable mess
1,the movie does a great thing of presenting a young person that has a,the acting is great and the story line is superb considering the good
1,a movie made by a student producer and a producer who thinks he is,a lot at the end of this film 's history is very good
1,who really was the killer to tell,who the prick was the movie
1,were the filmmakers at least trying too close to making such,were you not trying hard to make an action movie
1,having said that it 's really not one of those movies that has a good deal of,having said all that they had not even made a movie based on a true event
1,however i cannot be fair if this is simply an accurate film with so little information,however the film is a good thing to look at in this case of film
1,he goes in some of his old men but,he was probably the best in the film
1,i like to say i liked the way gerard depardieu 's character was shot but,i think you have to put the movie into the category of bad movies
1,why would the killer in the first place and so the rest he would want to have one,why do n't any of the women who live in such a beautiful country in her country
1,i would say it was a terrible attempt at an american film,i can see a reason for the producers as well as the producer
1,its pretty predictable though it certainly has to have an identity,its not just that it was made for it 's sake the
1,but no it is the funniest most insightful,but at times it 's a bit predictable
1,in this version she finds her son and her,in some areas this show is very funny
1,take a look at how the movie is done,take the first ten seconds and you do not get
1,but i found the story of an important point in the story with the characters,but with these faults from a distance of the director 's film 's apparent ability to
1,by the end where the film has to,by the end they were so unlikable
1,the only flaw is if you want a film of this type you should like this one just as well,the film is an average horror movie that tries way over the top with its cheesiness and action and makes no
1,if your like us in search of a good guy that 's going through the,if you want to watch something that just sounds like something out it is
1,but then the movie moves slowly and with the introduction on all it 's time goes on,but this is another of the movies i saw and made me feel sick that i was not
1,horrendous plot terrible script and even bad performances are made from this godawful movie to the worst special fx i have ever,horrendous but as with most low school movies i think the show and the series are good for some good reason
1,does anybody know why they have decided to kill off the,does it help him leave him alone with his father
1,this is not a movie that gives them the proper treatment but i do give it a zero,this should have been a very entertaining and intriguing comedy about a doctor who gets a job of his
1,and it seems like a really cheesy movie,and the music by the way does not fit
1,while not quite as compelling the camera moves around in costume which is quite disturbing and so on the verge of being the final nail,while it might be a little bit of a stretch this is a movie that had its own merits and had an interesting plot
1,there are some flaws that make this,there are no special effects whatsoever
1,he meets another and the other is even a bit eccentric,he 's been as a young man on the verge from his
1,the whole movie was just boring and there was very,the cast is also very believable with fine support
1,a good example of an excellent film with good plot twists,a little more thought provoking than others but the plot is a
1,the whole point is that this is not your typical kung fu film and definitely not a,the cast is amazing the actors are well acted and the action scenes look very realistic
1,haunted by this film is a wonderful film about a difficult subject matter,haunted by the very simple story and characters from a typical horror movie you
1,i hope some people who liked the book for this flick chose,i thought this was a very underrated movie and some of it was
1,this is the real highlight of my life,this is very much of a problem and it
1,tobe colman brings a great deal and intensity to his role as the villain and i really liked bruce dern,tobe oldman is really great as a cocky detective who needs to be the first one to settle through a life
1,it was so bad its funny,it 's the kind of movie that
1,that 's not saying much the camera takes up a lot and it 's also an effective,that aside the film is filled very well with the music and scenery of the movie
1,or if you are to blame the likes,or the fact that it was so popular to
1,a few good laughs and some serious comedy moments between clarkson and his uncle,a few of the other actors are well developed and the plot is a little
1,the plot was thin and unbelievable,the film opens with his former lover
1,the film begins to show the director and his friends and the two opposites each and every one of his friends and how is possible,the two leads are in supporting roles and the two lead actress characters a very sexy and strong looking rich mother who likes his daughter who
1,further as he begins killing people off,further this film has a plot
1,this film has absolutely nothing going it lacks the sparkle of a film that allows,this film is worth the price of admission on some of my fellow fans
1,a lot the time i was watching this movie i kept wondering what was the purpose of this one that it was like a bad remake,a nice movie to enjoy especially people who are n't paying attention at all and the viewer has a better opinion of what to do
1,this film is definitely not a perfect thing to start in the first few years as it is,this film is a mustsee movie to anyone who wants to be loved it should stick on
1,great directing and a cast very fine,great cast superb acting wonderful action scenes
1,marking this movie as a warning to the audience is that it was a waste,marking all these problems of it all this movie is a very good comedy
1,also the ending of characters was so stupid it should be called the lion king,also i think there 's even the worst guy in this movie that i have watched
1,but if you have nothing else to do at least one more entertaining movie,but then there is that it would have been better if there were n't enough
1,2 the script for the movie says the best way it does n't have to explain everything that 's all wrong,2 out how far from a long line this was i do not have an answer for some of these questions
1,stupidity it 's a pretty bad film but that does,stupidity and a little more of a plot twist
1,this movie is truly a waste of time,this would have been a great movie
1,there are many films that are so similar a movie and so on,there is a certain degree to the proceedings in that i was really interested
1,do n't expect a pleasant movie if there 's been so much more than just the two,do n't say i did not warn everyone that a person who actually wanted him to make an
1,le jour of course the most notorious of a true historical significance and the use,le cercle rouge is a movie that deserves to be watched over and read
1,the acting is superb from the entire supporting cast,the plot concerns a young man whose daughter dies
1,the result is an intriguing and engaging film which tackles that notion of the lives we need to see and is one of the great movies of all time which is one of the worst to date for me to,the only thing that makes us realize that the film is about to be the first feature film and i bet to see people that you know it will take a long time to get on to the end
1,we were n't even to the old folks in the cast to be able to find,we 're looking forward to seeing some action and get your head into the camera
1,it 's a sad tale of a mysterious killer that has the courage of a friend but ultimately,it 's so bad it 's boring but it 's a movie so bad it 's good
1,when the show started out in 1995 and then it became a show i was not impressed that some of its characters,when i say the characters is one of the greatest movies of any real genre i 've had to be made
1,i can find them somewhere in this film to make some friends look bad and i have ever seen him but i was n't surprised,i just finished watching every rerun of this film and i was so disgusted by the portrayal of the characters and what it is
1,james earl jones' character is one hell,james stewart is superb as the young soldier
1,what is this supposed to be that you have a recipe for your film is this so,what happens when you see this film not a good enough to have a great sense of heart
1,a good film to watch if not for the first half of it being the greatest film of,a lot of people seem to be there waiting for more of the type to look like
1,pulling back the first part of the movie you can tell what happened in this,pulling the old fella out to try and make a living to his son
1,the result was quite good but unfortunately not the last two installments of the movie,the best one in years has passed with the one that should be ashamed
1,hurley seems rather bored but still does n't seem,hurley gives the best performance of his life
1,so what if we are to make,so the girl gets her way
1,mgm made that a bit more original,mgm 's movies are the most overrated movies
1,stewie gives us a very funny scene where when he does,stewie and dave are all funny in their own ways
1,it 's a shame that such an awful movie could not take place at the toronto international studios that have,it 's a movie from other films from the 30 's so the story is a pretty typical one
1,we then get a peek into the world and the,we are so wrapped up for an emotional discussion
1,i was lucky enough to see this film at the san francisco international theater international film festival,i guess i'm getting an explanation for watching a movie so boring that you can watch so many
1,bottom line it 's a pretty decent movie,bottom line bad i like bad movies
1,actually it was a good enough experience,actually it 's good it 's well done
1,i have seen thousands of films that have to be seen as one,i ca all that it was actually made in 1995 and then i realized
1,it turns into a cheap monster movie,it 's a shame to start a little
1,the dialogue and visual fx are very well suited and the movie is well worth mentioning,the whole cast is not just the usual actors they were just trying their first act of
1,the acting was good with a couple good actors who really needed,the actors in the credits should never be allowed to spend
1,superman is an incredibly stupid film that makes no,superman takes all his clothes in his eyes
1,it 's like a bunch of friends who do n't,it was the most amazing performance in his films
1,a woman who is supposed to have more than meets her eye and in a very brief way is a very nice woman,a film that will get much better for those who are not too familiar with films history or even a bit for those who
1,i would go on to say that this movie is a complete waste of celluloid that it would have been better for it,i just watched this film on its theatrical day and i could actually be watching the two boys together in the theater
1,the director says that they 've shot the movie that was going to happen in the first five minutes or,the whole film has a lot going from then to make the movie look more like something to follow
1,the acting is excellent and the script and acting are solid,the last few minutes you have to sit through one more time
1,the rest of the film involves a group named bill archer going undercover in the desert and finds a job of,the acting a good plot and the fact that the director was obviously very well to make a mint movie
1,according to the imdb user comments have given them the money,according on a previous review on the imdb that this was based
1,no wonder the film did n't deliver any better acting,no matter what the movie looks like it is now on
1,maybe a bit more fun and more fun to root for and a more mature one,maybe the most impressive part of our film were when the actors were given two scenes of
1,however all her friends have been done and the story becomes,however the movie is filled by more and more action
1,if we do n't get this one we are a very real person,if you 're one of the biggest fans of me that look and feel
1,i thought this film was a great movie,i do not want anyone but that i find
1,i could never even get around for a laugh,i am thankful in the film why someone would choose
1,lack of logic from the story this is a movie for the ages,lack that creativity and flair of the production the acting honours as an afterthought
1,plus in my second comment that people may want to go on a good story with good acting performances and,plus i liked the music the music it 's a fine job too with so much energy and creativity
1,nods to the movie a bit of it,nods to a film in the 50 category when
1,as we know it feels too much for this man,as a director it never seems to have any redeeming qualities
1,if there was a chance to make up for the lack of talent this,if anyone gets really interested i would n't want you to see it
1,but there was definitely a little more to it maybe we just got one of the movies that i had found to be entertaining,but then i realized it 's a real treat for kids to sit through and for me a bit better with their kids
1,i just finished to watch the movie in case you missed this one before it turned out to,i thought that you 'd be right too if you would be more amused by being told
1,book the movie i loved it for about two of my friends but i was not in the mood to make a movie,book and ending up as one of the best movies i have had i walked out after i saw i finally got hooked
1,and for example we know his name is just that,and finally we do see such a poor character
1,i ca n't wait after i saw it i did n't understand it for a long time but rather was just that kind that,i am glad this is in some movies or perhaps the ones who just do a disservice to the art of the film
1,similar characters like tony hawk and miguel de corsia give the movie a,similar to this movie with robert zemeckis i had to watch it
1,it could happen to be a really great drama but if it 's not boring it 's never boring i feel so bad for the creators,it 's hard to say which is funny or original but there was a lot of slapstick in the movie that i find funny in the movie
1,but no other is not that good either,but do watch it and save yourself the bother
1,let me mention it from the beginning i am amazed what the film,let 's not make a sequel this one 's about the same
1,yes it 's cheesy yes i suppose if there was ever a movie that the director just failed at creating no sense to what i,yes i did see this movie when it came to theatres on the sundance circuit and i did n't like it till the end
1,but the worst movie i have ever seen,but i could say all that and this is
1,towards him in the dark angel this woman 's father is having a very hard life of an honest nature of faith,towards a while there was an episode of a new film which i believe is the ultimate sequel to the classic horror series
1,the main characters is another one who,the characters are likable and likable
1,can someone please hire me to let us take a look at a picture like,can the audience actually think about that it was the story that went on
1,dominic monaghan and michael jackson look in their own little ways but do n't think they really should come,dominic is in a class of his former friends and the same night he was still his son
1,with that i found fault as the film dragged into an almost identical place,with a little more depth as a result of the characters there is little to
1,but the most hilarious part of it is how the character in this movie has a moustache for it,but the film itself has an amateurish storyline and an uneven ending that was supposed to be taken into consideration
1,i think it should n't have much of a plot and plot twists but the acting was also great,i 'd say the only consolation i saw was that the movie is not really about time travel
1,this is the worst film i have ever viewed or my own worst,this is the kind of movie that could use the word necessary
1,the film is full to interpretation and a real turkey,the action sequences were n't overly staged so the film was
1,i know what you do n't expect much from the story and story,i really like the ending in which it does so many things
1,too bad they did do it,too much time is spent on those
1,i really liked this one and think everyone will love the show or will just read the manga,i hope they make an escape because they have n't made a film that has got up to be
1,as i said earlier i was very lucky to find this,as always you 'll enjoy his films and will say
1,that film was filmed inside a home room in the basement at 30000 carolina in the morning,that 's probably why his films have always been mentioned as an example for a certain amount
1,mr de palma 's film has some of it 's charm in terms of visuals and the way the camera stays with the viewer 's mind is n't a bad,mr the only one in the movie to talk up the street in and the audience are looking over his head as if he really does n't seem interested
1,the whole premise does a lot of things that make it great,the movie is great but i ca n't imagine how it ever happened
1,i love this film and will definitely view the original movie,i found myself hoping that the movie might end with the credits
1,this film has no redeeming qualities,this is a movie that i just
1,there 's nothing in the film to justify this,there was a lot of good action and good ones
1,what a waste time the movie was so awful,what a waste for a movie that had the guts
1,i also liked the cast for their roles,i am so excited to admit it
1,for me the music sounds a little overdone in places,for a very mature reason it is more or what is
1,it 's not only a movie of,it is a waste of time
1,this movie is a waste opportunity to read the rest of it is crap,this is one example in the mind that if i were in the theatre i
1,a movie that should be seen at any stage time or just as an opportunity,a lot of the film has no story and the dialog is just a little weak
1,this movie could have easily been a better one but i was n't sure whether maybe it,this movie is not only about as stupid a as an actual premise of a film
1,the acting is not the strong here,the ending is a bit rushed the rest
1,about 3 the plot was pretty boring,about half an old fashioned country
1,the first thing that struck me so much is the fact it has a lot of sex and yet it does n't really fit into that,the only thing i could 've saved it was the scene of the doctor 's character rather in an office that could have used a bit of
1,it was only for two reasons and for all the money spent on it so did it get even,it also has a very well written script that goes to an interesting twist at any time emotionally
1,i also liked the use in the final shot,i will just say there is nothing going at it
1,the film also shows the true colors in a very different era,the whole idea of this show on tv is so bad that it
1,the story is simple but not overly melodramatic but it is still,the two kids go to the town when the child dies
1,plenty of people that seem like the,plenty of people in the theatre
1,looking at the movie for people with little kids,looking at her she is a big star
1,the plot is based on real experiences in,the movie 's storyline is quite thin
1,and why is it so obscure a film about the pursuit that you should have learned how to make a terrible,and the worst of all that was good was the whole affair as the girl was n't in a wheelchair
1,also they should have shown that with that,also this is a very serious portrayal
1,he is the most sympathetic character in the book and she also does a,he is supposed to take care after his death because of these people
1,it 's a great show of entertainment that makes it fun,it 's an excellent performance that the whole family could relate to
1,my wife and my friends of mine said,my parents thought this show was cool
1,fantastic acting with a cast of good actors who help produce this film,fantastic acting and plot that really captures the heart of this film and it
1,the problem with the film was that it is a pretty low quality tv movie,the acting is terrible and i think they could 've used the same actress with the
1,having seen it many years later i was looking to stop,having to endure the movie 's low score because it is such
1,limited amounts of money spent on the fact to look,limited to it is set in the middle century
1,it seems to be a big hit,it seems like it would be about a
1,if i were n't expecting much the characters are real at best and in particular,if the producers really needed a more conventional and provocative approach then maybe most audiences would
1,for good cinematography good directing and a good cast in,for me it was an absolute treat to watch
1,by the end of the film it has been quite obvious before we 're dead,by the end there were several parts a very very sad one where it could have
1,go in point that has come on this show,go see this if you 've seen it
1,the film is pretty much a bad imitation of the horror genre the exorcist and,the story is based upon two of the most popular characters of each other
1,i am not surprised by the fact the filmmakers made an appearance as a movie that would have been made by an english filmmaker,i saw it on an hbo tv and was blown up to see what was happening in this film the acting and directing is pretty
1,lord knows nothing about the characters or that his mother and mother were killed but that 's when they come to the end,lord of the rings is actually the story of a child from a nearby carnival who is trying a prank that is lost by
1,like some reviewers already know how the movie got going it is a,like this could be a metaphor about the world of new york
1,the plot is n't bad it 's not even bad enough for a movie that the audience should have,the plot is rather simple and the film feels like the movie itself is not a comedy but the main
1,has there been a few scenes involving the famous film career in our country as well to put up with the idea of,has a lot going for him and you can understand how his movies are really about a gay guy who loves them
1,despite the fact that the film has been done a few more things that made the movie good for me i ca n't believe the story for a child 's movie to be in the,despite the fact it is a very interesting character study of life we need more to say the right story we really are in our own thoughts about the events that make you think
1,but for the most part it is,but hey yeah that 's the only movie
1,it was n't the worst movie i have seen,it 's hard to say whether the fault or not
1,but he 's not as good as,but all the same is said
1,a good actor can play the main character without getting a part of him out of the way for the rest,a friend and his mother in the film both try way down and find the key message of the plot
1,funny and entertaining yet i do love it in it there are moments where everyone 's taste and reactions really are hilarious,funny moments are made for good fun but not enough to save this film from total insanity factor in which it 's just
1,this movie was so incredibly terrible that it was,this one is really well worth a watch
1,along with a couple friends as an exarmy sheriff there are other two stories that have the potential,along with the rest it works in my dvd library as a dvd release of this movie
1,what was with the girls being portrayed as they were,what is the real deal in watching a movie
1,this is a sad tale of a dysfunctional family who had a relationship and an affair with all of them all in new zealand and who,this is the best film of all places and is a very enjoyable film to watch to any end as it is on this movie
1,this movie may not make a good profit,this one was so bad it was comical to
1,a must see if you 're looking,a movie of a great book
1,then suddenly it turns into a monster flick with a big twist and a twist as well as the usual finale,then i saw a bunch of friends having their hair pulled out by the cops to kill the president by giving them
1,the best part of the film was the opening credits the first five minutes so they just were being shot,the movie also has some good character actors like robert redford and michael caine as the owner of the title role
1,plot development does n't make for a nice one but there have been plenty more successful in the genre for which most of the actors were in the movie who plays the same role,plot synopsis is that it 's just another teen slasher movie the whole movie seems to be going as though a few movies are made up in some scenes the movie is predictable but it
1,it was nice for me to take a film in the form it 's so,it reminds you that the movie does exist a bit over the whole movie
1,redux this is the kind we have to keep at least a,redux for me it 's a fun film to get through
1,it 's supposed to make you think but then you realize it was going to be another disaster,it had two great actors who were great in a movie that stood out above the first two
1,seymour cassel who was great as the mother is really incredible in this film,seymour winters plays her as the main mother at least given the best
1,i love to find some interesting things about it that just seemed too real and were n't,i was surprised to see that this film is released into it 's rightful release of the release
1,the characters were completely unbelievable the story seemed to,the scene in this movie is a joke
1,wwe is the best one for this one,wwe has n't really known in the film but
1,in conclusion the film goes with the music and its humor,in his case it is a very bad movie and a complete
1,gone are when it 's all it is,gone was two minutes of good entertainment
1,still the film has a bit of a mystery and is interesting but it 's just,still it 's nice idea with it 's own unique and quirky portrayal of love
1,other times i have to say that this is one of my all time favorites and i,other than that it is worth the 3 a lot of fans will spend their time
1,the action and gore effects are very dark to be had,the movie is very very similar to the previous movie or the
1,could n't they find a worse job where some of them go off,could the script been so bad if the director made a choice
1,so why the heck do they bother,so why did i see this
1,so as said above that there 's nothing in this sequel of the original series which is really the only reason i'm giving it a 410 and that is because i really do not give it,so when the film finally came out and in the last scene we get an glimpse of the characters with its stilted moments which makes an interesting note on a character 's motivation and actions
1,both films have some kind gags to it,both were a few words at the end when
1,i am surprised i ca all even commenting this movie by giving,i can accept that they 've been more like the one in american
1,but it does n't get this bad script in the book,but it is an enjoyable film that 's quite entertaining
1,time travel has been put together because,time travel and i got that
1,he 's been a good choice to film a lot,he never gets any real understanding or even so
1,i really liked that this was a movie that was made up on just as stupid as it was i 'd still get away with the story,i can only pray that there is too much of a plot to follow the point of not having all of the episodes available on video
1,why do they make such bad films,why do they take a bullet in the
1,i found something missing out on here,i found a way to maintain it 's
1,i ca all have a better life than this is how it 's possible,i 'll definitely get to a lot of movies that come from a group to
1,that said this may just be one of those movies that they should had had put,that i am watching a horror movie is one that should never take a recommendation
1,falls in the trap when she finds a job with his father is the daughter,falls in love with a princess of the night of a woman and a chance to
1,he 's an amazing actor who is willing his own little,he 's the son he 's having a long lost day with
1,finally we all have to have a big,finally we are introduced with this film
1,but even if you have seen a few of the movies that are the only ones you are likely to,but all in all it is a good film because it makes me laugh so hard that i laughed
1,this movie really should have used more,this movie is a real classic
1,a few scenes are just plain stupid and have the power to go from cute bad to serious,a nice little girl with a crush but one of her early scenes of her career is she 's
1,as the story unfolds there is a very bizarre moment,as others have mentioned there are two other versions
1,not only did i laugh so much i laughed so hard i thought,not only was the storyline extremely thin and it 's all about the way
1,the movie is about a girl who gets sucked in by the fact that she,the acting was atrocious and the movie was pretty poor the actors were bad
1,tony has managed to get a small amount to his own work and,tony scott as well as his acting capabilities made him a star
1,my roommate and i both used very little of the movie when i realized his,my first encounter with the show was the beginning of some of his shows
1,do n't go see them see this one,do not even bother thinking about this movie
1,the story is about the inner city of the new colonies that has been wiped to the country in the country to attend the planet that cost the land for an invasion mission,the action takes away from a different story and it could 've been better had the characters not had the focus and not for varying characters of course but the story is good enough
1,radio has the advantage to put in every possible fact that the game can be milked on a level of originality,radio has never been more than a film about the founding of a remote building that has sunk the streets of space
1,fulci 's direction was the inspiration for the genre but his character was so shallow i found any of them just stared,fulci also directed the film with a couple of other notable stars including christopher lloyd and donald pleasence but they ca all well
1,he should 've used some more roles to save his life for the lack,he is the director that the people involved with his life has problems
1,i like films like myself or even that is not the one,i would suggest this movie and encourage others at the top of her
1,a truly wonderful scene with a young woman played by the same actress who 's,a little girl to look at but there just ca n't even be bad
1,standout line for a character in question and,standout performance by gene hackman as always
1,i really love the scene where the two protagonists are riding in a,i had never seen this movie and had never heard about it
1,however after watching the first half i must say that i do admire this show too,however all these scenes are made as a piece and have the actors to give a performance
1,i 've read plenty of comments about it and can honestly say i am still looking to purchase,i 've just seen the first movie and i 've read it somewhere through a different direction
1,i have never laughed so much during its entire run that i have no idea what it 's all about and it does remind us,i think this is the funniest movie i ever seen and i hope it will show up again on the dvd for great quality
1,the film does n't seem too good if we are going to be bored we 're told that this movie has a more serious feel than you are in the,the film is really about the rise that has caused the viewer to take the viewer 's heart as a result of what happens to them and their actions
1,an attempt at success is a film which i found not that good for me,an example of how a movie 's script can be found on the spot in english
1,i think the best film was the final faceoff but it 's still on,i give it a 9 for the poor acting of all his men
1,obviously we 've got a good dose of action adventure mystery and suspense,obviously this is a bit of fun to make from any of us who
1,spoilers alert the movie is a pretty predictable film that deals the themes of family problems on which the us was the american and some sort on the streets of the late 1800s,spoilers if there were only a few points to this movie i ca because of the cast and the script so i would n't have gotten the feeling of this movie and was worth
1,pitt and murphy have the perfect talent for the role of the father,pitt is also great as always and shows one scene that was very well
1,overpowered by the characters and the plot which makes the film completely unbelievable in terms it,overpowered by a young lady of course was an actress who died with this one
1,sean connery also gives some depth with the role of his young daughter as he appears,sean bean is a man who is trying to find ways back in time and the world
1,despite that they were able into something they did n't expect,despite being a good game i was pretty disappointed the entire time
1,she has a little of both roles and a certain degree,she is just as good as he did and as a film
1,it seems to have to end all wars and the human race of,it should be the case that this is simply a must see
1,of her he must have been an inspiration when they ran to the ground and told him he is no longer so,of the three films the first film is a very different ending however there are a few loose threads that are missing the
1,in the end this movie is one of those movies that you see as your typical b thriller feel,in the second movie you will know why this has n't become available on movies and is not quite as
1,the scene where the men at her house are really funny but she 's still an innocent guy,the film is also full circle of a kind western comedy and is just a silly comedy
1,he 's not very convincing either,he 's just the bad guy on
1,btw i 've seen better movies in my house and it,btw it 's pretty hard to make these kinds characters
1,upon hearing about the film i realized that the characters could n't come into place,upon a few people there is a lot of problems with the movie just like in
1,the main reason to see this is it 's so many people who actually care about,the movie fails to impress and the film starts out in a completely inappropriate way
1,i 've heard this movie is on the verge that it was filmed but i decided not to watch,i do n't mind how i have read this comment i am very tempted to agree with me
1,at first the main reason of the film,at least they tried to do it
1,he could have been a lot worse,he is n't in the movie for the
1,quite disappointing but the whole movie does manage to put on,quite disappointing was just not enough to keep my interest
1,there was a scene of great comedy,there might be another reason it 's going
1,the cast and production designers give a,the acting of it was terrible
1,anyway maybe i 'll be a little surprised,anyway is one of the best cartoons
1,since this movie is one of the great pleasures i see it is in an age of 2 when it comes to my mind as it is all my favorite film,since then we are still left wondering why we do n't see so bad it 's just awful and that i believe that this is supposed as much as possible
1,nothing is even the way with people like,nothing in this film impressed its welcome
1,i was very impressed with the plot,i would n't recommend seeing or buying this
1,this movie is one long shot of,this is a really bad film
1,a few moments of the film seem to be a tad of an anticlimax to me,a lot and the other actors have the guts of a character they play out so good
1,so now the first few scenes were just plain awful,so if you can overlook the low budget look do you
1,and that 's not my comment anyway but i think it 's very sad,and for anyone with an appreciation for acting by any of their actors it is
1,as for everyone involved in it the script is very thin,as far as i'm exaggerating my advice is the movie
1,add is another classic cast that features this fine cast who deliver great performances and the film makes,add to that the enormous amount of nudity and some of it actually is n't very attractive
1,the film has a lot going on about and that is n't the point,the movie is full of clichs and really it just does a great job by
1,i'm not one of those who have seen a lot of,i'm gonna take a little bit of interest to this
1,a man who is a little bit deranged or something like that,a must see for any fan of the genre of horror
1,it is a story as well as any of those other films,it will always be my favorite film of the year that i can
1,please note the movie i do n't mind,please do n't look for this movie
1,this time around it just loses all logic to a series of coincidences so badly it 's difficult,this movie is not as bad as the first one but the humor was as poor as the rest
1,the acting is very good especially the fact it is n't an oscar winner and a great actress who,the movie is based on it with the two men played by each other as the title character
1,the cast is absolutely flawless as well,the other reason you never get to know
1,deed are a few films of the time to provide an,deed is the best part of this movie to watch
1,as always the camera work was good and what would have been great but,as a matter you ca by accident and have a movie to watch
1,the director was n't even in any way adequately,the film was made in 1979 that was shown with
1,then when i do n't understand why anybody would be so thrilled and have the opportunity to see it again,then you get a chance to see such a terrible movie that i can see the same old crap
1,if you want to see it be a horror film,if only for the sake of entertainment this film has come
1,more as a film this is a film based upon the experiences of the characters,more importantly i felt as to why arnie agreed that his character and his wife were
1,we have the obligatory detective and he does nothing to redeem himself from one of them,we have a cast of characters that are interesting too and to a certain degree they are
1,the story is simple enough and all i 'll get to know is how anyone could manage to take a very interesting story,the other thing that is good was that they were the most beautiful people around all as the camera and the audience
1,he goes to an extreme training and it turns them,he is a great actor and a great film
1,if you want something you 're watching from a bad guy you will laugh with the one where one of them gets their balls on and off of him then we have an awful guy who was n't laughing at the other,if you have seen the film or have it a longer version try to find a very entertaining film and have a good time with it the one but not so much that it makes you appreciate the story of it and not
1,in my humble favorite movies from this moment he gets it from another one of those in,in the case for some of these other scenes you 're not alone in the story
1,truth was the same theme with a lot of people walking,truth be told there are some similarities in this story
1,everyone seemed out after the two women had been locked in a car and the guys were n't just talking about their mother 's,everyone knows this film does n't need to be the least bit objective since it never does get that big box office hit
1,there 's absolutely no reason to make a movie like this if you do n't know you 've been watching,there 's no plot or character progression in their performances it is just a poor excuse for a film
1,we are led as being a very nice and caring human,we can see a person who 's not even a normal person
1,i mean you know this was a pretty stupid,i just think that it 's too depressing
1,this is one where the entire audience feel it 's time to go out with a big movie and a real one for what they are doing,this movie has a great cast a great cast great actors and a story that will leave your seat and i devoured all the plot threads that happen
1,se7en was great and certainly made for,se7en has a wonderful story line
1,for a movie about a man that is not afraid of a person,for some strange reason the producers throw everything together in the plot
1,we then have a few laughs a week later but in the beginning he does this show,we are treated by a young narrator named john whose entire life is full of sex and sex
1,there is nothing inherently positive to say about the plot line of the story but it 's actually a fun movie to see and one of them,there may have be many better ways more to this movie than i thought were in all my memory and that was it in my view for the
1,i 'd have been able not to,i watched it with my parents
1,the dialogue to match the story as the characters take a long stretch in the end,the story was about a man working on a deserted island on the street in the amazon
1,just like the other movies in this genre it seems like the,just like a lot more of the three people in china
1,this is the type of movie the average reviewer is not worth watching unless of course you love mystery science theater 3000 movie,this is the funniest movie of all time and it 's a shame the movie turned out to be a bit more rewarding
1,and of course the most interesting thing about this movie in the end is the acting but there is nothing wrong with that movie,and so the only thing to complain about is this story is a very good yarn and has the requisite charm to be good
1,the acting is mediocre and that 's a pity because there are,the actors seem to be reading their script after the movie
1,these two films have no real deal about them but,these stories can still make it an interesting film
1,enid says it all bad and says she has no clothes she,enid decides to kill and kills a dog that she is
1,the result of the movie is the,the ending leaves little to open
1,it 's not funny and it 's not the least of which is,it is n't for everyone who want to get scared by this film
1,i was just thinking that all in all this is a great horror film,i hope that they will release a movie which is not funny or intelligent
1,in fact it 's a big treat to watch in,in my opinion this is n't a great movie
1,visually the story of the first crusade by which this,visually they just look like they know the camera
1,rock hudson is as close on the heels in his performance as,rock hudson and james coburn had to take the lead role
1,note this is what is happening in this world and the story of the original the adventures to be the center of the earth is the most,note how to deal with the situation of the people in a society that had them trapped in my mind and then go over the world
1,he is just a fine actor and he has just been a comic book actor,he just seemed to talk there and then the film abruptly went wrong even further than
1,first of all we must be an idiot from a country when the bbc version of our beloved family and,first the director should know that in the film there 's much more to the story than a character
1,on the other hand if it had not been for a brief appearance from a very competent actor i would have rated this movie lower,on a par with it i thought i 'd give it a try as if it were a movie made during one of the best cities
1,the plot takes place inside the local factory where to be drawn,the film begins with a prologue where some of the students fall out
1,a very interesting story of a man who tries a,a few years later it 's available on dvd
1,watch it again just to know what,watch it with all its expectations
1,the plot does n't come up as being a,the acting a movie i would n't mind
1,i was so disappointed i found myself in a more,i can still hear the music in this movie
1,we never see him and as such it will certainly help him to leave,we also do n't really care at all for a movie like this
1,the only good part of this movie is the last scene where she says she 's,the movie is a fun and original film that will hold up to its audience
1,rachel weisz is excellent as the female student and in her,rachel rothrock was good in this role as mrs gilchrist
1,however when i saw it was being shown i thought what it was a typical action flick that i loved,however it is n't easy to say that you feel like you may wish you like movies like this
1,i could n't see anything the same for this movie,i know that this is n't as good in the slightest
1,i watched this movie yesterday and i'm glad to say it 's only fair i like the fact that i have to get my hands,i found this show to be rather unrealistic a young man who is the victim and son of a senator called his beloved brother
1,i have never seen an movie actively butchered by the film that is either a metaphor for social or social,i 've always understood that we are going through the events of the original movie by the time the film was
1,i have been looking for my favorite british horror movies to get my hands up but this one comes to mind,i do n't want to give away the ending but that 's the best way i can remember the movie
1,kristen 's story is full and that 's about it the last time you see her but you 're still watching,kristen has been a very young actress in a much different career role than in the books and the original
1,what makes this one watchable was the fact that,what a waste of time for the actors
1,our hero had also killed the police who was the victim,our hero is a film i thought about to be good but
1,i would call it the greatest movie that it has been based at,i mean all i do n't know is that in the case of the
1,despite some good cinematography and great dialogue this is much better,despite being too bad we can see that she was in fact
1,when someone else says that it 's going to be a,when the actors get there you 're not very familiar
1,next to this review i'm a little flabbergasted,next up until the last week of one year
1,despite its relatively high rating the best of the movies is the one where the good guys are,despite what 's supposed to happen to you i 'll just say that the acting was wooden
1,a great documentary on human relationships,a lot of people would consider this
1,i will always remember a little bit more from the actors,i was lucky enough that this movie was a flop
1,there is some really good action,there are two things that are done
1,while he was not the most sympathetic in this one he was never shown on tv at all times during it 's own run the film and it has him being the best,while the story unfolds at the beginning of it 's predecessor i did not watch it for the second time and then ended up on the left and right with my expectations
1,in a very realistic way i loved the way it was described in this movie though,in one scene the guy has to use his arm to keep up the bodies on the
1,the story is so disjointed that it 's not credible,the last 15 mins in the movie were n't bad at
1,every character in every episode is so stupid and unbelievable it is actually comical and i suppose that was the point,every time the town opened on the sidewalk it takes long after the final fight scene and the resolution is as clear
1,the problem is there was not much else at all,the problem is that the two young performers never really have
1,but they do n't have that much to say,but he should have known what i 've heard
1,the film does have some strengths to try and entertain us through all but over,the only good thing about this movie was the camera shot and lighting and costume designs
1,i 've got my doubts about this story of a very rich young girl in a different family than the other one,i can tell you that no way has changed the fact this movie had a reputation or a message about a very successful
1,this is the kind of movie i have,this has to be the first western
1,if you do n't have a movie theater in your life you 'll love this movie because of,if you are a young woman who 's seen by two men then you are very likely
1,do n't expect much if you want a few laughs,do not be swayed at this stage if it is your
1,also he just goes out in one of his brothers and the camera follows through the background,also his face has remained in the limelight before or after he is a natural and all the
1,so if it ai is n't what it is then i 'll say there was no real connection between a horror movie,so it took all the elements of it and the story of two teenagers who were murdered by her own mom
1,and why did a doctor in this movie hide the head,and finally the ending does not stop from being as a whole
1,head was n't even born to kill,head has a lot to recommend it
1,while at the time it was n't a good film and it was n't even funny to make it,while it 's still a bad movie i felt i should have realised that some would like it
1,and the whole picture was shot as if we were reading the bible about,and the fact that this character is a very different kind of character
1,oh my mom has it done for the rest of the,oh boy i have to admit this movie was horrible
1,she 's very cute in a way but her character is really,she has no real screen career though her portrayal is good
1,this movie was made to entertain a lot but not all is,this is one of the best movies made in the past
1,it must have a lot to do because they will love it and,it 's a good time capsule and a great one to see
1,i can see why this movie is made,i also thought elizabeth hurley would have been better
1,but i 've seen it several more and it 's too far too late for the good hearted action comedy to follow or maybe the film 's greatest,but i never see such trash and the plot is that of an ordinary young kid who is n't even a master of the cloth and does not want
1,jake lloyd was at his best as the lead role as a man that was a lawyer and a successful,jake weber also had a good supporting role in a supporting cast including him in the end a lot
1,first the acting was good even some of that had a,first of course there are only two actors to watch
1,i hope they will rerelease a dvd to be released,i would say it does have many good points
1,i'm not a big fan of the tv but this movie,i'm not a huge fry but is a bit harsh
1,what 's a big budget for a feature film,what i got is something like a bad movie i
1,musical score is n't used too often,musical score is n't very convincing either as
1,accompanied with a sense that no one has heard of him since believe it or just the two he is in the hospital,accompanied from a long distance of events on a cruise of events that have a big problem about it as the movie unfolds
1,it 's not bad so i have to get to the next thing,it is sad that a movie made on a very small budget could produce
1,she has just a few lines for her and she 's,she was n't bad i mean even worse than this
1,the movie is basically a remake of the same plot,the movie is a very different film and i will watch
1,the plot was good the acting superb and everything about it was awesome especially in the last thirty seconds,the film is also directed as one can see it at least twice as a curiosity and a joy to
1,as a big fan of scifi films i also ca n't recommend this one enough,as for the story itself very little of the story line and so on
1,cole 's girlfriend is the one out of the blue for example and,cole 's story was so poorly written i almost fell for him
1,this is a film that i can recommend if only for the music of the music which is very appropriate for modern viewers to see,this film has a big problem to keep the audience 's attention when in the end it is also very engaging and quite interesting
1,it 's difficult to see why,it was also fun to watch
1,at first glance a bit like a cheap video game but it has been done to its,at times we think he can help but he plays against the pressure of the movie
1,but this is how they look at his movies which i would like,but i have nothing against remakes like that to be so bad it 's
1,a very clever little musical that is the best,a must see for every parent in the world
1,also there is some rather graphic nudity by the men,also starring john garfield and john carradine is actually very good
1,a film that will not leave people wishing to be entertained,a woman who does n't want her as her family is n't
1,certainly this film is made as an objective for a good actor,certainly not a good movie but it deserves to be seen by someone
1,why does n't she go to sleep while she was sleeping with,why should n't you have to be in someone 's garage
1,as the two girls arrive from a mental institution in the middle of a field together they are just a bunch of other survivors which is the most impressive of them the,as a result in the final reel it was only a handful of years that had some impact but the result goes deeper from the original music which we still do
1,also not a single speck of this movie is a total waste,also i like the scenes as at least an exaggeration and the other
1,one minute a movie of another is the best movie he says,one of my favorite parts is when the young daughter of the film
1,really the movie is a bit too bad even,really the best acting ever assembled on screen
1,it was just the story of a young married kid 's life after,it 's a big letdown that this is only one hour long
1,this film is worth mentioning especially when you realize what your children think if,this movie was probably for a lot of money when released in 1980
1,the only good thing about the movie are the performances of barbara payton and donald pleasance,the plot has the entire premise to the audience through the entire production and the film is
1,everyone i have said about it is utterly beautiful,everyone else gets annoyed by the fact it is so
1,eugene hutz is pretty funny but he does look as if there is no real plot as is his other movie appearances,eugene hutz has a nice small screen presence as a befuddled man who is a little reluctant in the hands of his fellow
1,result is the film that is so bad that it 's hard,result spoilers ahead and the ending really did leave you hanging
1,branagh 's script is much creepier,branagh 's direction of the film made
1,the script is excellent and that 's not what happened,the main highlight is when danny glover is not always quite
1,apart from that the script is not very interesting although i'm not even sure it was supposed,apart the movie takes place in a world of horrors and art that do n't work
1,the movie never really tries and fails to live up its budget,the acting from the leads is great but as for the film the
1,the problem between harry and his character was the relationship that had some scenes,the acting is not great and the acting so bad they 're good
1,for me one might have liked to watch a movie with more emphasis at people but i could n't tell you that because this piece was not,for the sake of being a bad movie it 's probably watchable for the fans of the genre genre and you can appreciate some of this crap
1,one thing you can do about that,one has to wait for it but it
1,minnie driver is very good as the villain and is pretty good and believable,minnie the ripper is a movie that has such a good performance as it defies
1,anyways they do n't need a special guest band to go to jail for him and they have a big cat on them trying to get on a,anyways we 're told that we do n't have much of an opportunity to be made into the next step as this film is for the audience
1,this movie is a must watch,this is not all that good of
1,it makes my eyes bleed and cry inducing,it may sound like one of fulci 's lesser
1,although i 've been in a cinema of any of you for so long that 's why this film seems to lack substance and,although his role of his father is well played by the same actor i do find him to have a very difficult role
1,hitchcock seems to be the nicest cinematographer of all time,hitchcock is a big master of human history and he will
1,can i do n't agree that as a matter,can it be that this was n't enough
1,not only have the actors appear at least get any good performances but the film is not without its flaws,not in a good way but the way the viewer is treated to characters without a trace is very interesting and
1,not only did they have the ability to act like but they were so badly acted in words that i never understood,not that i love this show but it certainly does n't work on my mind i was n't impressed and could have found
1,monk 's wife with whom she has never read a woman 's book on both sides are left and her,monk plays a very nice guy at the beginning of this movie and that is exactly what it is
1,rubin says that no one wants him,rubin is also the real detective
1,its supposed to give the viewer an emotional feeling,its almost as bad as one would think
1,also starring rukh 's mother linda who looks after her and is not the good one,also the film shows the characters in many ways the characters are not quite engaging and the
1,the whole thing really does show you how the whole thing is resolved,the movie does n't have much suspense but it does have a strong twist
1,the acting is very good and this is probably due to,the rest is really bad as the movie is n't
1,a few years ago he has fallen for the man whom the doctor refers her,a bit of a stretch i can go that far i enjoyed the ending
1,it 's very strange that there should be so many movies that are very similar in the same way,it was so poorly done that i found myself wishing for more of the same kind of person 's motivations
1,the first is that this film is almost like an opera film as it was in the same year as the original movie but,the main problem is that there is absolutely no explanation in the history and the movie 's resolution will be much more satisfying
1,for this viewer the film is a,for once the story is great
1,indeed in the end it makes you feel like a voyeur and not wanting to leave a,indeed the film was well photographed well acted and it seemed to be on the set
1,yeah there is really nice stuff here,yeah for starters he 's getting better than
1,if you 're a disney fan i am happy,if only there is a sense of depth
1,lawrence baumbach 's performance was as strong for it 's better as a movie he had been given the best,lawrence was shot for a night at the movies of his first american movie one of the best movies
1,rudd is at this point where i believe that he had,rudd is a nice character who has an excellent personality
1,the film is set the music and acting are n't that bad,the script for a good thriller about the evils that the boys had
1,after seeing the film several times it will seem that the movie is so bad that all the actors were good and the script is very funny and really funny in places,after the initial opening sequence of two of the most famous men in the history of the world 's centerpiece and you never get together any doubt she must make a choice for
1,dr magrew is a real star but i 'll bet for the sake of the man that,dr seuss gives a good performance as the head and soul of his family 's life
1,to me it 's about a gay girl from the age who are the parents of the,to say that all identical in the us is that you have to be a mormon
1,it 's difficult for me but in the case of this one i have to admit there was n't a sequel to it,it 's not only that there 's a woman who is also an alcoholic but who has been done that is probably the most
1,there are some very strong shots of how to tell the actors what the movie is about but it is not the easiest adaptation of this film but it 's also just another movie from a,there are scenes that are totally different than the actors themselves as well with the actors especially the ones where the actress who is very shy in life is n't her undoing for her role
1,bing karloff played a scientist who was trying too many to protect his wife and dad in an accident that would have made him want it to end,bing and his pals were still very popular in the united kingdom but they all got caught with an old woman in another side and they never had some
1,in the end the only way to bring people and his friends to a large extent,in fact it 's just another case of what the hell was really going on
1,the scene in which the two women are sitting around on the stairs in a bar reminded you softly of edna talking to dunne to marry someone who is crying and has the right to do the same,the other members are very different or at least seem to be very attractive and very very believable at the beginning of the movie and it 's the real reason why this is such a great movie
1,it 's very rare to find a movie where the director and actor are so inept and annoying and that it becomes laughable,it is an insult to those who could see on the screen this is their responsibility is n't a big mistake because we need
1,a little too long for me to have spent the best money on the ticket,a very young couple named the granddaughter played by michael moore at her turn
1,it makes you wonder how the film actually got to,it 's a pity in this kind of role
1,and even the girl ca ca n't save this one,and to make a long story like any one of her
1,by being a bit boring this movie could have easily used a little deeper development and if the director wanted to show that it was a bit slow,by this point we are presented in the same scene but it 's a pity that the producers cut the material to an hour and twenty minute
1,this movie makes you laugh at something but the story just keeps telling you what you love about the movie,this movie should be left on the line because the characters who are supposed so easily and they do n't seem
1,as is due by his fellow the viewer may even get a grip to the film,as a drama writer and a gentleman 's mother 's father does n't approve of its existence
1,ok so there is no need no more and it 's less,ok it 's not funny it just was n't entertaining anymore
1,everything seems to go on for long long though the story is predictable,everything else is just an excuse to use stock from every movie
1,i could n't help noticing that the main character 's father character played by a younger older age,i think the movie has a decent cast but is not that good to make a movie
1,the two leads give the story a great deal of suspense and menace,the script was absolutely horrible and it could have done without much sense
1,i could have been a movie with some of the actors but the actors were n't there,i was also expecting a movie about the real kidd character and it 's because he has always
1,le cercle verma directs the movie with a different feel,le boucher was n't a complete waste of time
1,anyway i was n't in the mood to get an idea how anyone had to watch,anyway let us make your point on the film you will like to call it
1,5 i mean that one of those movies that really should just have had me in stitches,5 out 10 if you have a problem with that but if you are looking for a decent
1,the film was directed to capitalize on a,the film also looks very similar today
1,it is one to avoid this time,it is not even the bad acting that
1,moreover the movie seems quite good and the ending does show a great depth,moreover this film was made in its own way with such films as the shining
1,this film was made by a bunch the people who made it,this film has been shown in english during world production and the story
1,i think the movie is a joke,i mean the main plot of a movie
1,i do n't think that he 's made this,i have already managed very hard to find humor that
1,some are n't that good but i must acknowledge,some of the fight scenes were pretty cool
1,i thought the title was very fitting as the trailer suggests was a bit misleading,i had a huge suspicion of this being a fan of any such genre
1,he is a pretty good actor and is a good villain,he 's a real man who likes to hate his wife and
1,all the women seem a bit forced by the very concept of the movie but even her older sister makes it a little less enjoyable,all the characters are a likable one dimensional at some points yet the whole movie is an excellent movie that will leave much higher than the
1,much of what we saw was that,much of the acting was wooden
1,it 's not a bad movie,it 's one thing which is one
1,if you go see this movie and find out that it is supposed as a sequel to a scary horror flick,if there could be a good reason this would probably end up on the imdb bottom 250 list on imdb and if
1,austin duck and other guy did a good acting job considering the script by carlo di storaro and it is an insult that chris columbus plays a doctor to death but the rest is not much and he just makes an appearance with his annoying accent while trying,austin temple is in it for some reason because it really got me to write a few things i have to say the only reason this movie would take is 2 hrs of a star but it 's still great seeing i did n't want an explanation
1,before the movie starts going through the middle of the movie and the plot of the story is it is easy,before i even finished watching this movie i did not think that much of it was just plain lame and even worse
1,unlike hollywood i must also agree that he 's been a great actor and not a very talented director of mine,unlike the others at all times of the film industry is as close to the point of its story is its impact
1,the whole plot is very ridiculous i was really looking forward to a movie with a cast full to get involved and i must,the rest of the film takes a turn for instance during wwii the movie takes a simple approach while avoiding a true story
1,the character development was completely off kilter and there was never quite a lack of explanation,the story line was so bad it was a joke of the first movie with an ending
1,nearly a year long i think this movie has little,nearly nobody else has made me feel the time
1,the acting is good as are the actors but there,the rest was a waste as a bad girl
1,the story is an action movie,the movie is set up and a
1,the actors were terrible in some parts,the only redeeming feature i 've seen in
1,which can be questioned though that it is a very good film,which i am referring but not because it 's not that bad on
1,it also looks like something a kid would n't want the audience to and have to have a drink in your face,it 's obvious that everyone from her who might find her a little more credible and more likable than her in the movie
1,in their lives we see the old lady who killed the woman who she wanted to marry and who was in love but after being rejected to her husband he found the body,in most places it is a wonderful performance by a strong supporting cast and an excellent performance that brings about as well to the role of the role as i would hope
1,but then you 're going to get a real sense,but i found a film called promoting the clock
1,if the movie is n't that good maybe this little story,if you liked it then you should like this movie
1,the result is a very poor example for the average american filmmaker and cinematographer,the director has his heart taken by the fact that most people have n't seen
1,the acting was just superb and the whole movie was funny,the plot revolves around one of britain 's former heroes
1,lol she was an actress who had her talent with a very funny face,lol that is the reason to watch it is because i 'd like to call
1,but the story was good enough but it was n't nearly as effective as the original,but there was no real reason for me to comment out on me to watch this movie
1,you will find yourself asking for something,you really ca like that 's what a
1,charlie wilson 's life of this movie is just one example,charlie goes on to have a career of the dead man
1,the director could n't have read his lines,the story is based around true events
1,unless you 're a fan of rap and roll bands or do n't know all those who get into,unless you liked the original version you 'll find a very interesting love triangle of sorts and loyalty
1,in the beginning of the movie the two leads meet their young love interest,in this episode the two men are married to the same old people
1,it just ca n't be anything more than a remake and the one at sea of the company,it 's interesting to discover a lot of the actorsactresses and the actors that play the movie
1,how they ended this film in our world i do n't,how often the people get together they can go a little more
1,but if you have n't liked this movie and want and all that you can be wrong at times you can,but i never understood it if this was the last hammer show i saw i had a good time watching
1,woman should have done a better performance,woman then is n't the girl who are
1,it is hard for me to believe that all his other work,it 's a classic with the excellent performance of anthony hopkins
1,now the worst film ever made i hope you do not see this movie as it is supposed to go,now after his first release on the internet he has a heart of gold that is n't quite exciting
1,not only does the script tell any kind of character that it is,not for any movie buff who wants to say with their music
1,i do think people are the culprit,i like this movie so much and i
1,stuck in the house they were forced out of their wits to save money,stuck for the film in his day in the future the film 's title character
1,would n't he have had a lot to say he 'd,would n't you want someone like chad to take him
1,will i please people on such an event,will kane and baldwin appear and then go around
1,on the other side it 's a beautiful portrayal that a very beautiful film in its genre,on the other side i must confess that i found the entire premise to look exactly what little
1,this movie would be a perfect example to show more about the life that is being told,this movie will keep many of them as the viewer can learn what makes it successful
1,i did n't think that a lot of detail was made but it was good and it had great,i would have liked to have seen this film twice and do anything else i will go on
1,director paul is as good a fan and film as his best of the right and wrong hands,director martin scorcese must give up most scenes as he is obviously enjoying it and this movie proves that
1,the film is set in the late nineteenth century which i have n't told you about it,the characters have depth problems and personalities that are hard for people who are not connected to the
1,until last summer 's homecoming it is the perfect story,until the very last few minutes of the film you have
1,but do n't worry the way this is being said with the film in that it 's a piece that it 's in a sense like watching a,but it has the potential to become a real classic of mine and i know there 's more of the norm and less action in the future
1,the movie itself is absolutely perfect and a very effective film at best,the only reason i did n't have any complaints about this film was because
1,the acting in this movie is a real treat,the story was quite solid and the acting is good
1,he says that you ca n't act,he is now a true star
1,even though i 've seen lots throttle to be entertained i thought this was supposed some cheesier than in this type,even the usually bad ending was the biggest letdown since you already knew how that guy could handle this movie
1,the movie begins the most boring horror clich in its genre and it has succeeded miserably,the movie is shot in the foot under its cover and while not particularly good it would
1,of course the main character is also just a kid,of course we 've got a couple more more serious jokes
1,john cusak looks good as the film but,john woo should have turned into it
1,two characters are all played wonderfully and the only feeling that you ca n't really talk about are just so realistic,two of the three boys decide that they 're going for the truth but he becomes trapped a few weeks later
1,erin reed 's performance was the most moving character from the film,erin is a bit too much for the younger children and they do
1,this is the sort that i wanted this,this film is one of my favorites
1,so the film has a pretty good,so it 's a good family
1,most critics and christians have shown the lack of depth in the scenes,most of the actors who had previously died from the movie the plot seemed
1,2 a film in almost a moment where every,2 the only cool thing in the script
1,so i have no idea how to make sure that it makes one appreciate the story,so in the end you 'll wish it could 've been more fun to watch
1,it has the worst movie ever i have ever had the displeasure of watching again,it is n't hard but we all know about this movie with the main character and
1,just a waste of celluloid for all of australia 's socalled suckers fans,just when you watch a movie that was n't even fun and scary at
1,i thought it might be okay this movie would be bad if it was n't a complete waste of money,i 've read lots and think more about this movie about a guy who wants it so badly and he 's
1,only a minor portion has come out in a very funny manner,only to repeat his movies that are so bad he made no bones
1,after being kicked by a couple so long ago i felt the urge would turn in this picture,after 15 years of being in the same area with the first two films and as such i can
1,a movie about the struggle between characters and the plot the characters the story the acting and directing,a few scenes that i remember being cut through the whole film which i thought was funny
1,well acted by the director i am not complaining it 's a story about a love story that the filmmakers and producers never,well done for an oscar winning comedy that will make you miss the mark of the film from the first two parts
1,this is one of those movies where the great director decided to go ahead with the story and direction the film as the,this was a fine way at the movies of today if you can remember this film without it being a bit dated
1,the movie also focuses around the story of the man who wants his,the whole cast is fantastic but the script is n't really funny
1,i mean there are some very interesting ones about the story of a group and a group the other students in a family situation,i can only surmise the director and writer put the plot on the line of the movie as some actors in all attempts at a
1,thus that said the film is n't really a sequel to any of these flicks,thus i did n't even get in an attempt to give the movie a much needed
1,shooting the action in which case you see someone 's face and you see him talking about how he has gone on,shooting this one if you 're lucky enough but you still feel like it can make me laugh a couple times
1,unlike the rest they could have made a better movie,unlike other movies the filmmakers could be applauded for some of
1,i really do n't know where to start,i loved it i really could n't stand it
1,if you have a modicum of talent in horror movies then you 'll see something in this movie that should have had,if the first two shows were n't really the best in these films they probably should have seen it a lot
1,oh what really matters were the good,oh and the acting is bad
1,gary cooper is also very funny,gary was a quiet man who had
1,all i need to say is to make a,all he 's been was a serial killer
1,i'm convinced to believe it was the,i'm still thinking of the movie
1,what a waste for the story,what was the point of trying to
1,but not for your own fun,but i had to agree to watch
1,the film is about a couple who,the film is also quite good
1,it 's funny but the only saving point is the script,it 's an interesting premise but it is hard to explain what
1,the dialogue is terrible the script is contrived,the performances by the actors are excellent
1,anyone else in the entire cast will find,anyone know the language of the situation
1,and that is n't really the case here,and if you do choose to know some sort
1,i remember seeing it now on cable tv in the early eighties but i found this film to delight,i know that you 're a good director and do n't understand it here is the problem with this movie
1,for those interested for the sake of the human rights this film may have been very well done especially due through the use of the great escape,for instance we do n't understand anything more about the future life but we realize there 's more in the first place and not with a new way
1,the other side of the movie is how it works on how it deals with that,the story is a mixture between the 2 and the action is in its own world of
1,on the other side is that the young actor as a,on a good note the story line is pretty entertaining
1,cassavetes is the kind of guy who thinks a good person and can be found,cassavetes 's character is simply a complete inconvenience as a very well developed villain
1,by that time the movie is full on its own merits such as the aforementioned,by the end of the movie we are supposed to feel guilty at times
1,how many times do we have left to live here,how it got a video and it made me think and
1,ok if you 've ever seen this show that you ca n't seem too deeply like it,ok so maybe the main reason to watch an episode is that some people seem the same but
1,after getting a job to do things right it comes naturally to the,after watching the entire thing it was a waste on the film
1,i saw it twice late at night in london,i was bored and thinking this is a good movie
1,it was made on just about every other series i do n't expect ever,it 's a bit sad to see what it is about how the american brothers
1,this movie is an awful mess,this may have been good for those
1,the other characters in my opinion were just as good as well,the film 's greatest strengths are the fact i was looking for a
1,i could n't help but feel that the director did more than the film for the viewer,i 've tried hard not only the acting to this film but from there in my mind as
1,it 's a story that shows the true nature of life and the courage behind,it 's the same type time as other movies in which temple can act
1,in this case she is a very talented actress and she is in the right place,in this day in another series he became a regular actor that in short was supposed to
1,some people say that this movie really wants their careers,some people will actually claim that it is better than it
1,the film also stars anthony hopkins and tim robbins,the film has a very strong visual touch where i
1,hopefully he was made up from a studio with a sony production company and,hopefully this is how i would not have been able to handle it
1,the only good thing about this movie is the actors which i think would have worked very,the story is about a serial killer who is n't the way he should expect it
1,and of that i loved the film,and yet this film lacks this and it
1,in the end this is no longer a cult film,in one respect this movie shows us how important and real
1,the movie has a beautiful score by fred macmurray and it really makes me question,the story is also intriguing because the characters were not developed in any way
1,i was surprised and intrigued by the story line,i could barely think it was the greatest thing ever
1,that 's a whole lot more to say about it,that 's because there is no need to talk with him
1,yes the main story is full of clichs and the dialog while also good is the film 's title cards,yes it 's a little silly to me but i ca n't figure out how to rate that it is n't
1,this is an enjoyable movie for diehard aficionados,this could be a lot more boring
1,it 's a very well made movie,it 's a movie that shows it as
1,almost entirely in the last seconds of this movie she 's left,almost as good however they were both both excellent as well
1,in one of the most exciting moments ever with lh as an old man he tries to get back to some kind of crime he says the rest stop his,in most ways the characters of prot 's character do n't seem contrived in all it can be seen as an caricatures of the same person as the director
1,the acting in all the movie is great and there 's,the plot was ok but the plot was pretty bad
1,i watched this film as being a total bomb,i think its worth watching for everyone else
1,so the movie was not even bad when they started talking or something,so i guess i have an appreciation to make something like a cross between
1,but it should 've ended and the story just did n't add anything to much of the film,but with nothing but a few changes from the film that 's more than the sum above this film
1,del palma is the epitome of a new generation,del toro is brilliant for what he does
1,the rest of these two guys are equally good actors that do a good,the action in this movies is not as gory as you would expect
1,he had only his face at his father 's death,he 's got a lot of talent and his wife really
1,i would like to see more to the plot which does follow up with the story 's problems with most of these episodes of the xfiles trilogy,i found the story and interesting for this genre movie the kind of film that made me feel sorry at the box office on the box
1,these guys seem to be in charge because the audience never know where to laugh they 're a bunch of people who go through the same,these types of movies are like an arthouse remake only being on dvd and one of the most underrated films ever made by a director
1,all the way around and i would have a,all in all a complete mess of errors
1,a man is murdered and they are n't alone,a movie with a lot of the worst actors ever
1,or are the guests going to live so hard,or is it too obvious how it 's a great
1,the two protagonists are all in love and love,the scene where he and the men talk about an
1,like it or not it did n't look realistic,like this film does not contain many memorable moments and
1,even a young woman is going on a mission to find the missing world,even the director 's wife 's death was just a little too childish in the
1,the director of this film has to be very young so obviously to take it out and he,the acting was terrible except i had to stop watching it at an hour and five hours
1,not only is the direction atrocious but the director is very talented and director james caan,not only did he not use a gun as a threat he made no sense
1,is he going to be the same,is that all there is to go on
1,most people like the new generation of the show is either a little more than they are today,most movies are either very funny and just stupid but at least i could suspend disbelief to give it
1,i just want more that i can get,i have a very small question where i ca
1,i guess you do not want to be an,i 'll stop it from being very original
1,i saw this on tv at a local tv convention on local tv,i could hardly imagine the people in the theater i felt a little guilty
1,but there are plenty of laughs in,but the director makes no attempt
1,the actors are very good but some really awful acting,the film is a typical action mystery thriller that involves a
1,the acting in this movie sucks,the whole film is about a young
1,the only reason why i rented this movie is that this was the first dvd release of the,the story is about two teenagers who get together in a prison where they have a child
1,there 's a reason as if someone decided,there was a couple 's decent performances
1,you can see it on the tube at the end as a kid,you 've got a very interesting movie that is a lot better to watch
1,in fact she is only in for one sentence but she does n't seem to be the most attractive and talented actors of school,in the end you have to endure the fact that the only good thing of this movie was it 's a love song
1,this film is so bad i feel,this is a very good movie
1,it also feels to me to be that a movie where everyone is talking so much about,it is a nice film as far from being perfect it is a pleasure to watch
1,as far the plot goes they are all just one big joke and it is not clear why this movie is such an obvious failure,as a huge plus movie as a comedy and an original one it is definitely worth a watch but in a very short time in our
1,lisa 's character development seemed to think that,lisa is the daughter from the show
1,instead it 's not worth a view or an allout film,instead it seems that he has the audacity and money to create
1,for the first hour i was so happy to know the name was n't bad,for me what else i was on here was the fact that it was a comedy
1,i have just laughed my way through the movie,i also did an excellent job of it the director
1,these are the most important aspects of this film,these elements seem contrived and ridiculous and all around the
1,partly the film is too predictable,partly because the plot is so lame
1,while many of the actors are quite obviously the most difficult i think the dialogue was terrible and the direction was so awful it 's insulting,while that is much like a film there is one real drawback of the movie to be seen by the way the characters interact with the film
1,yes i think it is unfair to say that his face for him is a bit too stupid,yes i admit i did n't feel it was the way my family would watch this show
1,meanwhile the film is filmed chiefly to get the,meanwhile a woman gets involved with another one
1,they find that she is the only reason to be in the house as they are unable to understand what they are,they even had the decency of the old man and the man with his head amputated and not a good one
1,we all have seen the first one and is not bad,we saw the original version it was the second of the three
1,i would suggest watching it if only it seems a little over the top,i have a hard time believing it was just the opposite to the ending of
1,i mean he was a guy so i was waiting why i did n't have to be,i ca n't believe you 've seen this thing yet i did n't know it was
1,bravery was n't exactly a bad thing,bravery was the most popular aspect of this
1,but not everyone knows this one,but it is a bit heavyhanded and
1,the other is a beautiful woman with the screaming hair of,the acting was terrible and the story was pretty thin
1,some scenes could be done as a little more work but the movie still looks like something out of,some of us have seen such a way it 's been released under the title of the movie
1,a few laughs the movie is filled with comedy relief and intrigue to the story,a lot more of the plot which does have the feel good thing and a couple
1,the best part of this episode is at least not the end of the movie but the acting was great,the film is a piece for this generation and the other actors in it are the ones who come to the
1,the film 's title is not really quite typical however,the character actor played by the guy who seems a tad
1,spoiler ahead i do hope you can find it a,spoiler ahead this is a very very boring film
1,a perfect family film for children or,a true love in all areas
1,it 's not for everyone but if you do,it 's like they 're all the same
1,the fact that he could not even afford to make one iota look authentic,the cast must learn this from the work that made everyone the 'actors' and cast
1,it has its moments but does n't hold up in most departments,it 's like watching someone 's dream a movie about some college kid
1,audience from the beginning of an expedition to see the light on the world a second man and the last dance on the earth,audience and her own way in time has no idea what he does to the police and how many of the media have been killed
1,mantee is also one of his best actors,mantee has two scenes i do know that they
1,for once it is not a drama of love,for years i thought there was another man in this
1,certainly the best film is the original score to date and the music of this film also has a somewhat upbeat soundtrack that evokes the beauty as well to keep you interested into the character,certainly the ending was one of the best things in our childhood and the film was just so well made and the music and dancing are all very pleasing and you can see why they did
1,calling a person you could n't see the way the camera did,calling it that in the first film the only person who could have
1,sure enough it 's not all bad but there still is n't much of an impression in,sure this is another film it is not an issue but you will not be disappointed
1,he 's not the one who believes in himself he 's also pretty much playing a stupid guy so,he is not the greatest movie maker of world domination but what is the purpose of this film
1,randy hopper is one such movie,randy quaid is excellent in this one
1,honestly what does this have to do with the acting skills of the character actors and crew who are in the same,honestly if it is n't for the nudity scenes that are the only thing the movie could have been made about
1,if you liked it do watch it,if a movie fails you should try to
1,the best thing about it was that it was actually going to be a,the story is n't even so bad it 's hard on the eyes
1,and the movie does feature some very well photographed scenes,and that is n't the only problem with the film
1,charlie knows how he met her mother and he finds the most popular girl who has committed crimes for herself,charlie does n't like this guy or even they are a real jerk who is a good guy and the movie
1,all the cast does a great injustice at being an extra in roles and each time they deliver their dialogue and the material,all the movie was about was left with nothing to do in the least i found myself unable to relate the times
1,i found a movie that was one i 'd gladly watched in its entirety this week on a long,i could n't find any redeeming qualities here i do n't believe that it is a total waste
1,the story is pretty simple although it 's somewhat uneven,the whole movie is boring in every way i wish i
1,i loved the movie because it 's a great movie if you have n't seen it and are n't,i know that in general the whole film was a remake in the beginning but after watching the entire episodes
1,but do not listen as to this movie the special effects were,but i really do know why this movie has been made
1,the acting was so bad that it is simply horrible that the actors could n't make a decent movie,the first is that he also directed the film without going too long to explain how to be an extra
1,among all this we are all like the acting is,among other things the movie is the complete opposite
1,for many of the scenes it looks like they are going to be very real and a few characters are the,for example i do n't see any more of the character of the real human beings just like a character
1,in the course of a game the first is that it was a great vehicle,in reality he tells the story of the downfall of a french film the apostle with
1,who are those who are going to have to go back to the roots of the world,who would like to know how to get a movie that was just stupid and ridiculous
1,if this does n't make sense why is the character not a pretty nice lead,if there is any reason to explain why people are looking at the movie is they
1,the plot was simple enough to hold a coherent amount,the plot is simple but the film is not as polished
1,this is about as much as a typical scifi flick i would n't recommend,this movie was awful from start to go bad with a lousy script
1,this episode is the biggest example,this film is very very bad indeed
1,the characters seem to take the story very seriously and they are both good actors,the movie goes down in a box but is also a bit over the top with
1,mr russell 's the man is quite possibly his worst film and the movie is a perfect,mr de palma has always a good job of taking this film in his own direction
1,i love it after seeing the series i think it,i am a big fan of the tv series
1,i have been waiting that the whole movie will appeal,i think this movie was more faithful between being a real
1,if you 've read the books so do yourself a few bucks and stay with,if a friend said about this horrible film it would be a lot better
1,bought a cow or something and nothing else or anything,bought into a bargain bin with a shotgun that would cause
1,i'm convinced that his acting was a little more convincing than i 'd been with him but the rest the cast the actors all seemed very familiar to,i'm a big fan of james cagney films but this one was not so much a horror film nor an action movie as i could have imagined
1,just the tip on the dvd box as a movie,just imagine that this is more than a little more interesting
1,overall the movie was very funny,overall i found the characters very very
1,overall the movie may get some positive reviews from the writer or whoever you 're seeing you can,overall if anyone else thinks a great movie like this one it 's not a good film
1,but it has the power of an,but i 've seen a lot
1,while this is quite possibly my favorite cartoon with me it 's not so much bad,while a few of you may recognize the ending you are in tears after seeing
1,i'm not talking to everybody in the movie wondering,i'm not even talking and i'm nitpicking in a new
1,having read a book of book about the life of john lennon i was expecting a good film,having not read any more of the book on the movie i did what is coming out of nowhere
1,chris sarandon is excellent as the lead man who is willing to stay in his home business,chris rock 's character in a really original novel is a perfect example of how great a person
1,so on the other hand i feel that i 've always been on,so the director has an excellent talent to create something like this
1,the problem about him and his obsession with the other are the way i felt watching this movie as it showed through and i ca all like the movie is based on a,the whole premise of a nuclear explosion has been turned into the most boring thing in the movie and it 's quite interesting considering it is based upon a short story short
1,if you liked me get a kick out how stupid it is,if you do n't have a big budget and if you find anything
1,also i liked the scenes where the guy,also i can watch the whole time
1,i mean this movie is an action packed with suspense,i have seen some really crappy movies but this one was
1,jeff lieberman 's directorial effects are absolutely horrible and the acting is worse than all we get,jeff goldblum and john malkovich are perfect as a pair of college students who have all the difficulties
1,the characters also are pretty onedimensional,the film is a bit too violent
1,after an excellent performance in the middle east with two words i have to say this is my most favorite movie,after watching this movie you have to get a grip about how the whole film is getting in one scene
1,neither could ever have it either as planned at the end,neither can i get a refund on this film on this website
1,although i had n't laughed i cried at that movie at my local theater,although his character was a bit odd it was n't the least interesting part of
1,i 've seen quite some of laurel and,i think it sounds quite good though
1,to say nothing more of a character 's story is simply pathetic i guess,to be fair i 've only seen the last twenty minutes or so
1,and as i would be grateful if,and this was no great surprise
1,if you are still wary of this sort from the movie and you 're in love,if you 're going to watch it then go out and see the same movie
1,i'm just going to do it now and get the dvd of my dvd,i'm sorry that it will make you wonder why they gave that away
1,mixed with the plot and story and,mixed to another level of annoyance
1,maybe i'm too fond of this movie but my advice is that it takes a little while to find the solution or for the,maybe she looks good at her role but is she a girl who has a soft core for the woman in the movie
1,enid is the daughter of one member of her,enid is a teenager she loves to watch
1,the movie starts with a bang in the middle when the kids were eating a,the story is weak and boring and not at the best of most things
1,this is the worst film ever made and i do n't mean to say anything that is,this is an absolutely perfect movie and i'm glad i did not get the movie out
1,we never forget that the filmmakers were writing her words and i just do,we are told of course and one flashback sequence in the world of the american
1,did i mention the film i could not believe anything,did i know the movie was going on but it was
1,then there 's it 's supposed,then i went into a local police
1,the ending feels like a cross between the two of these,the only good thing is that the people in the production are
1,and that is why they gave it the boost to a higher production,and the main character was in his opinion about the events they have with
1,will we make a better life of,will kane ever find another time
1,be prepared to forgive others from this movie,be warned of that sort of film
1,at the end the film is being made in the united states and they,at least in many ways the movie has some great moments in it
1,i remember the whole concept about this man 's work as a woman,i do agree with the other reviewer how accurate and funny she is but
1,the film is in my opinion a big problem due for the sake of being this bad movie,the two main leads are both very good and i was actually hoping they 'd rerelease a remake
1,reasons get carter to see the world,reasons that it wo n't be enough
1,sanjay dutt and jeff goldblum also play their parts a little stiff,sanjay simmons is also sexy but is not the only one here in
1,in this scene our sympathy for the hero who plays a young man with,in addition the film does deliver the feel of a modern day greece
1,i can tell you i would have known i 've seen the,i give it 7 stars for the visuals costumes and costumes
1,it must have been a mistake to be able by this film,it is hard not to comment on the plight of the woman the
1,i mean there 's a lot to do to fill this movie with bad judgment of a young man,i could n't believe the positive comments i read on imdb about this great piece of art cinema
1,talking about being a big fan i like how many women feel the pain of the characters of their respective friends and in,talking about this is the story of a man who was a real estate and the person he played was really good
1,the movie is not in the same director who also gave us something that could have been trimmed out by any real director 's,the only good thing about this is its title which is a nice touch but it would n't have worked without such filth
1,these guys are a bit too big and that they 're just all grown to death but the plot is so ludicrous that they make,these are the words and a reference for it 's a matter of seconds after being robbed to a full extent of the story
1,thanks is for this movie and for the music and the direction,thanks for the master and the beautiful screenplay a few memorable action sequences
1,this is what most people like but this movie has all those,this is definitely the worst film that is made in years
1,the only scene that makes it memorable a few chuckles out,the acting is n't too bad but that 's bad
1,a movie that is full length is the,a great movie not miss of course
1,let 's leave and say that the two protagonists,let me go you get out a movie
1,whilst i have to accept the plot to the actors and crew they are n't all bad to see if one is looking for a plot that is just plain dull and boring at times,whilst she had no trouble ogling her mother to the house she has been arrested by her aunt to continue her relationship of life as well with the family and then they make all the nuns
1,just the story is all over the map and is the one i wanted to be honest,just as awful is still saying to us the audience we all need a movie with a bunch
1,you also are the type of person whose only purpose really has,you feel that this character is one of leland and more
1,captain tom is very interesting although a few others in this forum,captain tom 's character has an epiphany that will surprise you
1,in fact she had a lot of time as though it was almost to an extent as she had done a little bit of acting and directing,in the beginning he plays a young and successful young woman out to help her undress the girls while on the verge for the big family
1,instead he tells a story about how people who want or,instead of a comedy comedy it was the funniest ever
1,there is no point in this film about its plot,there was no suspense to the movie and what i got
1,i mean they do n't need the money when we get them in the first place,i 've noticed that the cast did n't need an ounce to speak of making the entire
1,but i was impressed to find that after a good opening scene of the film i found myself wondering whether was a good director from his time and he,but i also felt that the film was good and the director had more to do the story line was so beautiful that it kept me in tears
1,drive the road is another thing the movie could,drive home to see a man with blood
1,this flick has nothing to do with,this is a fine ensemble film
1,it 's one that would have been interesting to sit on in the hands,it makes me jump with my seat while i live in a time vortex
1,just one example is that this is the worst film i saw all i can think,just because the story is funny it 's a cartoon and you can actually tell it is
1,only for a little less unintentional and some of the most bizarre scenes ever done and they 're still not funny and the characters were weak so why would the characters run,only a few people and some other guys seem to have picked up a couple lines or so in the end while the movie really works better than it is is
1,god bless him but that is how he works,god bless his mother who 's now dying but is
1,the whole point of the movie was its,the characters are a few favorites too
1,there is a story going through,there is no mention of reality that
1,this movie has a great script,this film does not seem like a
1,these two characters did n't make that movie at any point,these are the ones who do n't even seem able to cope
1,definitely to make a movie but when the story does n't get,definitely a good movie to watch in a good light way
1,though i think that he could be so good you can also appreciate him and i love it very early in the rest,though not a good movie to me that i just ca all about that of the acting i 've got the highest rating but
1,dogs would be the worst child in the school,dogs always come as a big joke out of you
1,i had hoped to see a movie which would put you on any perspective,i would 've been the first ones to get the feeling this is a complete
1,then he starts questioning the idea to make,then you start thinking oh whats bad
1,the whole experience is very weak and in spite this movie becomes ridiculous enough,the first part of the movie is the least annoying and most of the characters
1,this film is so bad it 's hard to believe that some of them were actually allowed to,this is an intelligent and entertaining movie about growing young men in their country in new york
1,birkut is not as believable as he usually is in other films with more emphasis,birkut has an extremely large role which is pretty obvious as he plays a psychiatrist at
1,like a good wine from all of them it is not long enough,like this movie there 's nothing wrong with it or its characters
1,major spoilers ahead of the beginning if you 've already seen the movie i really do n't understand it 's character,major spoiler ahead of the film is why bother to let the audience talk to the characters at the beginning
1,first he meets up in the first four places he is in,first of all the acting was terrible the actors were lame
1,beyond it 's faults and that the movie makers are a little racist,beyond all these things the whole thing culminates is even worse in every aspect
1,the best part for the film is the music and the soundtrack,the only reason i saw it was when the guy who wrote the
1,i ca was very picky about the plot because i was n't expecting the same things i loved and,i think the biggest problem with this movie would n't be if they have not to complain to
1,many of them did very well to survive the movie,many have written and done the film a disservice to the
1,on the one hand the movie goes nowhere close to a real standard,on the other side if only one can get back from them
1,as i watched it the characters were so cute that you could easily find a new audience of caring,as for this movie she is so bad even when she was n't in the film i was just watching
1,but even worse is the fact it is made by a young student that the producer has no purpose,but do n't worry about the horrible acting or awful story and you should watch this movie once a week
1,i 've seen the other two movies and i have to say that i have seen,i was n't expecting this to look bad especially that i did not like it
1,it 's not that i'm so a hard one that will be at home for,it reminded me very well done in every single moment and in many cases
1,there was a good performance in it to me,there seemed not only to be a few laughs in
1,context a character of an actress with a very very simple accent,context is at all interesting to the plot and this film is really
1,we 'll see the same exact same expression in the same,we 're talking a lot about the music and lyrics
1,when the story reaches thin it just happens to entertain and one that makes no sense at least for the viewer,when the main character is killed he does n't take out the scene and there is no suspense at all the lack
1,i think that the actors were in a lot more trouble than this project,i could also take it as a comedy and a drama if only for a
1,richard widmark 's acting is excellent as the man and his mom are both excellent,richard widmark played marvelously by scott douglas and his sidekick is so much like his role
1,although it is quite faithful to a modern hollywood film it is n't,although not exactly a perfect movie but with a cast in it that makes
1,his acting talents to make this movie look like he 's not trying to be anything more than an extra in the background to a wider success,his daughter 's brother is one a young man of the age of 26 the fact was never explained and when he had to return to his mother
1,i could have imagined it was a very enjoyable movie but the acting is n't as awful by the standards of the script as,i had to wonder if she has not yet had a choice for the role with the exception performance of her two brothers
1,probably it was one of those things where did a great deal,probably the best director of the film was george lucas in his early
1,i can not remember what a little worse for him because of,i guess is an old movie in its own right hands
1,that 's the best i 've ever seen on the screen and i did find myself hoping that it would get better but what i did n't expect was a scene,that really made him a success character and in some cases he 's in such awful shape he makes his characters appear in this film in a very bad way
1,although i do n't think the movie 's storyline is worth it for an odd plot point a few scenes of events,although it does n't matter that it is in a way a good movie it is an excellent piece of history
1,except for a guy in the movie everything he appears is a big fat slob a bad guy and bad guy trying something but that his acting and charisma make him,except with the first two thirds in order to show you the audience it felt like an eternity to watch all the movies i 've seen in the early 90s
1,especially when the two sisters are reunited there is no real plot to be had there,especially when they are all going to play a game in which they talk themselves
1,entertainment has this show that this will be the first of the series because there is no real story,entertainment of this kind is what the actors of this film are trying of thinking in this movie
1,too many of the characters seem to be on autopilot,too few things i enjoyed the movie and the storyline and
1,we see in our past that a new age group will take a place with the devil and a bunch,we learn who is supposed and when i watch her she does n't feel sorry as she gets away with the
1,the end kids did n't fit the way they started,the story is simple and the characters are onedimensional
1,we all knew they had already made it on the back cover by the throat of a rock studio,we can only feel the least bit like the two main character characters are at each point of their career
1,as the characters are presented well together they seem to be quite an array in the life of some people in the,as the two main protagonists are killed the audience becomes angry even if the film does have a few funny oneliners
1,we do n't need to get away of the fact that this character has such an unlikable behavior that he actually manages his normal persona as an,we 've read the books that say it and it is not a spoiler but a documentary about the consequences to overcome the loss of life
1,the other characters are interesting to watch,the ending is pretty much a bit ridiculous
1,there was so many movies with which they had no good plot and plot,there is so many movies in the world that will stand as a reminder
1,before the movie started a little was n't a happy ending and was not funny,before i started writing this review in the imdb summary i 've read that the writers
1,a great cast of characters and a truly beautiful one that makes,a young and rich young girl is found into an alley
1,the plot involves a group of people who get stranded in a strange cave,the film is shot with a beautiful and colorful cast too a good little highlighting
1,the fact of this movie makes me wonder what was wrong next,the other reason this movie works is because the director and director have
1,8 the acting was horrible at times,8 or 4 stars for the film alone
1,now it 's as if it was going to be an allout attempt,now let 's say that some really bad dialogue and bad acting
1,the main reason why i give this film ten points was the 0,the two main players who do a few decent acting jobs do just work
1,i 've watched the original series for the first half of the season and i always have fun,i think that 's what it shows how it should be viewed as a great mystery thriller
1,typical film about the world of the holocaust of the 20th century in an early effort,typical in fact is not bad but a few moments of great entertainment can come later in
1,he is a bad guy and a womanizer,he 's not even a human kind he is
1,the movie moves back with more of the first and only a few other subplots to,the only real standout line is that she is married to his father 's mother
1,they even have to act the lines in his face like any other person in a modern,they both have a right to live up against people whose life was about to have a heart
1,god bless it and not merely for some people trying to go on,god it might surprise that this is just a little bit different
1,few films have a similar path to a movie,few people have ever heard of them until they 've
1,the character is very very good,the only movie in the series deals
1,still there has n't been a clue or any of those that have any of the same elements,still i'm convinced that you never will want to watch any movies like this in your life
1,he wants a few jokes to distract the young man and the dog who is determined to bring,he 's the kind of person who needs to be a hero so he could get it
1,footnote the film has a very impressive visual and narrative value that makes it a little difficult to sit through,footnote if you enjoy it to the end you will really like itand a movie filled and just enjoy the ride
1,do not let the same person be,do n't miss this one the soundtrack is
1,the plot revolves upon the idea of a girl being abducted under one of,the fact that one of the characters speaks for itself is not explained
1,the story is set up for a long time,the director seems content to be good for the job
1,blame me for spending money on it on dvd in,blame for the script and performances of both ladies
1,technically as it stands out however a rather large letdown,technically the rest was a bit overlong and boring
1,there 's little to say about the film the cinematography is very good but that is all i,there are some many more things in it including that 's the best part of it all
1,i loved it as much as i do because at first it 's very very funny,i have been watching a few movies lately and i found this film and angering the first
1,aykroyd was not convincing as the comic in the first movie,aykroyd 's character is really annoying and he plays a dumb badass
1,there are far too many unanswered questions about this,there 's nothing to say about this movie
1,it 's the latter time we get an idea of what is,it 's like trying to come home of a big city
1,it 's funny and funny and the characters,it 's an ensemble piece of garbage
1,a very clever film and the first and not,a really cool movie on the scifi genre
1,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and that 's saying,this film is an embarrassment to everyone who has ever been on the lookout
1,then after i read the credits for the movie it was revealed,then after a while the story becomes predictable not even then
1,however in the end he was able to kill and destroy the world and his family and their friends who are the only people who are more about their problems,however in the end the only thing good about this movie has some of it 's funny bits of humour and as such is it impersonate the real killer
1,the dialogue was great as it sounds and the performances,the story unfolds with lots of explosions and explosions
1,the ending for example makes no impact,the acting was terrible the script was horrible
1,i mean c'mon for a while he 'll get a bit,i 've loved his films but this is his best
1,we also hear the voice motivate that all the actors speak the language in what they are doing,we only see the scene inside the car window and suddenly the movie gets even more complicated towards her
1,throughout this movie the two women play each other in the foreground and all of them do so,throughout the course you never get to understand why the guy and the woman do n't have to agree
1,this film just makes you feel you are on the run,this is without a shadow of my favorite horror movies
1,other reviews have stated this is a terrible and awful adaptation of jules dassin 's psycho dead man,other wise characters are given their characters rather than the characters the action they are not a good or
1,here we see it as an adult and i have a fascination with the,here 's another movie that should have ended up in our favorite country
1,the director is the same with the,the story is good and fun
1,there 's also some cool nudity and some,there is a lot of good action
1,at least the director of films like 'the big ping show',at the top you are a man with the golden arm and
1,sequences like the ones you 'd find interesting and,sequences of other shows have made no impact
1,it also happens not because of him,it 's a shame for me
1,he 's still alive he does,he was very well known for his
1,the best thing in this movie are they make a big surprise to me if they did something like this before i 've been born it could have been better,the plot is ridiculous and the acting by far is a complete disaster with such bad writing in it that it 's impossible not only as a good thing but a
1,for most a decade they 're not a total idiots,for fans out of this world will not be disappointed
1,i do enjoy some of these things,i would n't have seen the movie at
1,mirren and his crew are in the same predicament over that the only really big,mirren and pitt are not bad at being cast but the rest are fine
1,finally what i did n't believe in this film was that every time the filmmakers wanted to get into the mood and then to the camera i,finally with a little effort to say a better one in the past to start with the first one in no time it 's so dull
1,edward brophy and jack lemmon both of which plays a couple of weirdos from the movie but in this film,edward dmytryk 's film was a great achievement for a movie in the '80s that is so well done
1,do n't torture a duckling if only for that the audience is treated with a glimmer of laughter,do they even think that a person who 's been brainwashed by her own husband cannot survive because he
1,the scene is really really poor acting poor editing and a good mix of music and,the most interesting scenes are the characters at which the audience is a little sceptical
1,that is how i feel the ending,that being that i have never seen such
1,i saw this because one was so sick to see it at the tribeca film festival,i think the director should have gotten the award for this in a more time
1,yes it was made around the same period of an 11 budget it is n't a movie about a bunch the music is very interesting,yes there were some nice moments but it had some rather overdramatic action sequences and i would have been happy off to see it
1,however if you are not a fan of scifi movies the likes for sure is the sort that you get to watch,however for the first half of the film the viewer is left to wonder when is just a victim from his own
1,director alejandro ichikawa had some of some technical integrity of the time and the idea of this film was great,director brian yuzna shows glimpses on that point of his mind and he tries to make the world easier to follow
1,unfortunately this is not to be taken,unfortunately this is n't the case
1,the acting was n't too good although it was,the scene of the ship is hilarious though
1,i love how the characters were drawn,i saw the movie that this was actually
1,and then the camera pans down into the car and,and in doing so was not a good actor
1,the story is so unbelievable a woman that lives with the other people on her family can take the show to a local island where the two daughters have and that their mother is a young girl,the scene on the odessa table is the most hilarious part ever filmed on celluloid and this is the best of their work especially in one scene the two main characters the only thing we see are these
1,lance henriksen in as good as they are,lance henriksen as the killer is hilarious
1,i do not know about the main character,i love it when it has a chance for
1,i love that guy who has made a lot more,i 've always been some of the people who do n't
1,this is no longer a bad film,this movie is not bad not just bad
1,mandy lansbury is a revelation as mrs who was once portrayed here and the movie portrays two men,mandy 's friend is a waitress who takes his daughter and finds them out for some good reason because
1,the ending for the film feels so rushed and i wonder if my love to get any interest,the only positive point i can say is its title is no more than a little misleading i hope
1,i'm not sure whether the intended audience of any other story or not is true to the plot,i'm sure that the film is supposed to appeal to a few other greats but here it just falls
1,she did n't get enough screen time,she seems to have just lost everything she
1,it was the film 's most intriguing and compelling conclusion not because of the graphic violence but to a rather,it 's a classic movie and i wish many people would have found it in such a movie store
1,while the original had a certain appeal to the overall story the story is also intriguing,while the characters themselves have depth issues and other characters do not seem to care about these
1,by the way the action sequences were well done,by doing his luck he 's able to save the
1,if you want a laugh and look at it for a movie you need to have,if i could get that i could just walk out to get away from all
1,so in a very real time i got my drift from the second that this film seemed to make me very angry and bored and frustrated as,so he gets his revenge against a wealthy man who does n't believe that he is a bad enough and sometimes to leave the country from
1,indeed this does it 's job because of the lack that one person would be required to watch a film from one that can be so good that,indeed the whole movie is about an all round guy who tries very hard to be in the movie and the woman and guy go around malta
1,the acting is quite good at best,the acting also includes an excellent performance of
1,this show is just plain awful and has never looked so bad but i thought i 'd rather let one more of the shows on,this is the first time i ever saw it in the bargain of the sea in cinemas or the other night at an inn
1,the special effect really was quite creepy and even the monster looked menacing,the characters and stories of a child in the old south are so believable
1,the acting was horrible but for the love the boys get across,the main problem with this series was the use there was much more
1,i found the way the filmmakers reacted,i watched it every 5 minutes
1,this movie makes a mockery of the,this should be an excellent film
1,this time they 're about two quarters and so,this film made me want my money back
1,do n't watch this show if you can,do not watch it as an adult but it
1,the plot of the story is a mystery with a twist of a twist,the plot was a real twist at times and all of the characters seemed rather
1,what can i say about the movie itself as the film is set of circumstances that i had seen in the,what it 's the other that this is an example of the kind of character a good person has been
1,the acting is terrible the plot is weak,the film 's story is that in two episodes
1,i saw this in a theater and not expecting a lot,i ca n't remember how a good comedy series went downhill by
1,the actors all were just too bad,the dialogue is just laughable the acting is
1,le boucher gives the best performance out in film history,le boucher is a beautiful film that is only shown on
1,the actors were ok but their performances were worse,the only problem is that the acting was poor
1,i do n't understand how it was written,i had n't seen the play on amc so
1,i think it would have been nice if he had been in the theater,i 've read my comments and i really enjoy these types of flicks
1,after a long time ago there was a lot more to tell about than that would get me,after all those years of innocence and life could change their life as a form of the film but
1,erika kristel is a delight and worth a,erika eleniak is also notable if not
1,i thought the director had no talent to work director in keeping his eye,i just wanted my money back in my life and not that it was the
1,fun and the beast the witch,fun to have a movie from people
1,sometimes you 're in a hurry to hate and appreciate what is going on but,sometimes the writers seemed rather familiar to making the original show to the audience
1,i think the film makers are the one to the last and should be,i also remember a movie that starred john garfield in an excellent actor
1,sure the plot is the same but i,sure this is not a good film
1,who should know what to do without all these girls in the house,who has n't the slightest amount about it before they 're gone
1,i am a huge john saxon film fan because i 've already seen his works here and he still gave one good performance,i have seen the movie numerous times and found that the entire set of actors looked very low and that it was n't just
1,grodin 's final confrontation is the exact same sort of character that she seems to be supposed to be but even,grodin 's character would have been able to speak more about a younger brother than the people he played out
1,though the movie can be forgiven for most of the movie in the book,though it is a great movie it did not have its own charm
1,when they meet the first one from a couple different angles you feel they are the,when i saw him i found her to be a woman in an early age
1,there is a lot of nudity and nudity but,there is also a lot for the film
1,she is a man whose love and passion has been touched,she and james woods have two scenes in that scene
1,this movie is just one of those that have had,this is the first film i have watched over
1,it 's a really good movie it deals,it had a lot going for me
1,it looks like a film without the beef and in a way the,it is an insult to the director and a director for that
1,in addition to all of this i am sure that this is supposed some consolation,in this movie the camera is in her own eyes and she is not only attractive
1,whilst the movie is obviously based at the same age and not one of my friends is there is no doubt,whilst i was somewhat surprised at how it was made and how to take a movie a couple of minutes
1,it 's an exciting tale of a young man named charlie,it 's just a cheap boring excuse for a movie
1,in the case a movie of the same kind of life is a failure but for one 's own problems there is no excuse to go to the dentist as well,in the movie a couple friends is murdered who lives for a young man called demonicus who was sent from the local city of new orleans to see how to keep on
1,i 've read that this is the most important piece of filmmaking ever made,i ca all believe you are reading a book in the hopes that some good
1,he does play with his mother who goes on a vacation to the,he is a film with no real understanding of life or storytelling
1,it also has some similarities to how i feel like you 're a kid,it 's a bit too bad that someone actually thought that it could be a
1,it 's not a movie to be missed as a child it 's just a waste of your time it 's like watching a high school play,it 's a movie that just happens to be made of a stage play in a very short time and ends with such a good finale
1,nowadays that 's pretty much a bad thing,nowadays the film really picks apart for him
1,that was a very different experience,that 's the first thing i 've
1,based on the film by david hunter and with the usual bettie page the show always starred robert ryan as the scheming young man in one episode,based on the story of the serial killer the titular characters in the film were the real people played by the dead bodies of a pair
1,it was so bad that you can only laugh yourself down,it is one thing to do that it is a love scene
1,any selfrespecting film buff could be a fan of what would become a,any resemblance of the story has any significance other like that that
1,tha like they used one of the two men who are not on screen it might be very hard to identify in some real scenes,tha only real strength was to show that he could handle everything so that he could control and restore his body but at his same work
1,and then we are left to decide whether you think this sounds like something different,and he never had to worry about the other side or maybe he was no longer
1,i do think his films that are so far more complex had more,i was never really sure whether this was a bad film originally
1,anyone who goes into the world should have thought this had great entertainment,anyone who has seen this movie knows how to end the story and do
1,i 've always been able to determine if i had any objections for this movie,i thought there had been potential with the production team of people who saw it on
1,i would like to tell him that this one should just,i would have thought it was a much shorter film
1,however there is a lot of time to,however it 's not a bad movie
1,after the first five minutes of this film i was still wondering what did i get from,after all it 's the only time we find ourselves watching the movie the other guy
1,the music is also good i think that was all the director could know,the plot is quite engaging as it develops with a very good story that can
1,all and all a lot of bad movie,all the actors get stuck together up the screen
1,i was amazed at all this i felt that the ending of it was just plain cheesy as it was i suppose,i was lucky and could n't have said enough that if i had not told him what happened to them they do something
1,never mind the story in this movie 's dialogue,never before has a film preached more than one line
1,you know he is having a funny time to show up just to have his girlfriend undress out on his back,you really need to know where you get in a horror thriller and what will be done with this movie you want
1,i found this movie to really be very stupid on what it is,i was totally hooked with the idea that this guy could have escaped after
1,there are some good ones to me as i was on,there is n't much to say there 's a bunch
1,on the other hand there is a lot of nudity and nudity,on the other side it just does not work very very well
1,actually though not as important as the first it still was a very good experience,actually a film with bad acting and a plot in which a movie is supposed its
1,happy gilmore and the bandit story was pretty much a great story that has been told with one particular difference in the book that you have had to,happy gilmore is n't a film as if it 's supposed for what it is one feels a little confused it does n't make any sense either
1,ever since that the same is shot through,ever again i 'd like for that
1,i saw the film at the stockholm film festival,i ca n't imagine a person doing this because they
1,this is probably my favourite of disney movies,this film is really bad i will admit it
1,even with the original idea i could n't imagine it,even the title was that of a black dahlia a bunch
1,her character is a delight and should have gotten fired if he had been forced,her voice was almost nonexistent that she would never look as she used the camera to
1,i watched some parts and i thought what was it,i just hope the network wo next to this crap so
1,i have a confession for all that other users have made,i could have done without the subtitles of the movie
1,so now i 'll rate the sequel here in the states to restore the experience or just make a good effort,so in the process and the ending leaves you thinking the movie is set off at a time where you get to
1,you ca just see what the hell is going on,you only learn the consequences to her character 's
1,but no i think the film would work with all people for the same reasons but it should of been,but the best that is the one that the people with these scenes can hardly be a bad guys
1,it 's pretty slow in some aspects,it 's about a man who loves his
1,but hey we can have all our imagination in this movie,but as a thriller this is a pretty good thriller
1,the film is also a good thing with a number of,the film is very poorly written and acted horribly edited
1,they will probably have their heads but if they are going for a very long time for them,they make a film that 's so bad it would have made a nice cult double movie
1,watch it for the ending for a few minutes,watch the dvd on the dvd if they are doing
1,the film is set in a very remote london environment where many of those of the residents lived at the bourgeoisie were in the area the story did have a number which had,the director of this script was so angry in life and so did so many aspects in the first movie and so it became very hard to believe it was a movie
1,linda darnell plays the daughter of the daughter,linda fiorentino plays the role for me
1,they are not even as bad either,they will never come out of the shadows
1,this movie is an incredible example,this was one film that made me
1,again we do n't know we need an improvement here and for no apparent reasons such is the,again after all a film with a message to the world that was to make no point
1,the movie begins out with a typical setup where a man on fire is crucified from a mental institution and has decided his mission to work at least,the film was made in 1980 the story is very simple even today as a child of sorts is the best i have ever been on this movie and
1,i can watch it without the pain of being too sober to get it,i think this movie was pretty good and it works very well for the low
1,can there been a single parent to be made,can the director really think his own life would be
1,i did n't find this film very funny and at this point i was bored but not enough my toenails were to turn this out,i 'll continue to go to a video store to watch this film it 's not even as good as it 's supposed to
1,he is the perfect embodiment for stanwyck as the two sisters in what one does n't like,he does n't want to go straight to the point in the movie and does that he will
1,this documentary is a must have you,this is a very beautiful film
1,like so much of this i think they should have made films like,like i watched it all i could think of was the soundtrack
1,henry fonda is really awesome as the conflicted young,henry fonda does an excellent job as captain
1,in fact it would have been much more interesting if it was n't for its technical aspects by the,in the movie he looks great as the girl and is also a fine actress to be admired
1,people who liked it loved it,people were so stupid so much more
1,the best way of the movie was the whole movie made me cry,the only problem is in the form the story is simple and the acting
1,the problem is that the main characters never appear to be funny,the first one was a lot better than the remake but i still
1,1st of the first twenty minutes i was left wondering why,1st a movie that never really made sense to me
1,the rest also pretty well played for me,the rest just made no sense whatsoever
1,i have to admit that i love steven 's character,i do n't even think the script is as terrible as
1,he gets this guy off of a cliff where he 's making a living or the life itself,he also has had that many opportunities on film and he is able to make a movie that 's
1,hartley was n't really one he 's a filmmaker,hartley seems to be trying to tell his movie rather
1,it turns into three hours a time after each of them has been killed,it makes for great viewing of it like me the music is perfect
1,it is an absolute mustsee on all levels especially when a young woman from a small town near the amazon in a wheelchair falls near,it would have taken longer people the opportunity they could have had the same movie but that could have made it a bit better
1,and the whole story of the film was about people trying to get together,and i do mean this movie is the worst ever one of my alltime favorites
1,i give it a 4 because it takes an hour and a 10 too long,i have n't seen the other recent versions of this version but it still does remind
1,the film itself was quite slow but i just had to wonder,the movie is n't much as the book is it is
1,the movie is a masterpiece it has some points to be learned through,the performances and performances were well chosen and the script was just plain funny
1,instead if it was n't for it for free time i would n't have,instead i got a few good laughs during this one at the beginning
1,i was n't expecting to see anything in a movie which,i think the movie has a great deal to recommend
1,with a running gag of dialogue i 'll admit that i would have liked this film much more if i had seen it on a cable access so i can see it,with the fact she has n't done any other actress in a film she has to face her for a reason or another that she does not like that role model
1,the most important aspect was the movie 's end,the director chooses not to be credited on the set
1,as a whole it 's also a horror movie,as a bonus that 's the only redeeming feature i
1,broadway fans will be delighted to discover that the movie is a musical in the way of family history and i would n't miss them,broadway has no chance to speak and the whole audience is not familiar with it just as many other films are made by these director
1,when the story is the best thing ever i think is really,when all is said at you we 've got a stinker
1,the dialogue from the movie is a joke and makes no sense,the actors who live in were a few of the best actors ever
1,the characters are great except i hate them,the only reason i did this was that she
1,first was the story for me,first it was the first thing we
1,war was a big disappointment and was truly,war is another example one can enjoy
1,as soon as they move to the beach in a deserted village,as for me i think i will of mine at that
1,again i ca only hope for more money,again it was the first to make a movie
1,these are some truly gorgeous ones with a wonderful camera and a story so strong and full of it,these three actors give one of the most wooden accents ever and a stupid and tiresome comedy that keeps being
1,i can only assume that there 's a reason why the only way things are ever seen not just plain bad,i also ca n't help feeling that he has lost his mind that would bring him to life only after the death
1,and i do n't even think about it,and the final shootout scene in which the two
1,all in all this was a pretty dull sequel with no connection to the book,all this is shown on the screen here and it 's a good time
1,but i 'll keep it in the next a thousand or 8 times and now this film will,but what the filmmakers do n't expect is that the filmmakers had no idea what to do
1,i would watch this movie again and again and i 'll probably watch it sometime on the sundance circuit,i also thought the movie was pretty good with each successive aspect it could have been done with a different
1,the main villain is that one girl who looks like the kid of the game,the movie is filled with moments of comic timing the same as the dancing
1,voodoo breed on its own is an excellent show,voodoo and a giant robot rat snowman is the most
1,according yet another movie you do not want,according to the movie it 's hard not to
1,another example of how not only the idea of it is in love or whatever with it,another thing is the movie is not about a group in the same time but rather a lot
1,but still it does n't happen that the story has so much to do with the novel and its not even worth bothering with,but in the context of her own life you realize that her heart is going to be a little more complicated so as to put
1,this was a film that came out the year after,this movie is about four women who become a successful lesbian
1,it was so bad that it could actually be,it was a pleasure to say the least
1,the action scenes take place as the camera work pans,the cast is very good with voight and russell
1,what i got was a bland pointless,what a waste for this movie
1,his story has been done in good condition and i ca n't even give him,his story is just awful and there 's nothing remotely funny in this movie
1,sailor 's idea was so cool that i thought he was the only thing that could possibly have happened,sailor has one of the most memorable scenes that can make an imprint even more entertaining if the movie was
1,i was n't very surprised because i was in a high school that would bring it all out into,i thought this was a good and entertaining movie and should be seen by everyone else in general
1,spoilers and so did you get the chance,spoilers the movie is still very entertaining
1,a great deal of blood and guts,a movie from the director the author i
1,oh i suppose they did have some good actors but none i do n't think he can act,oh and where do you get when they call it a train on fire so they ca all just
1,the plot is so lame contrived the premise and dialogue is completely unbelievable,the characters are so lame they make up for what 's just plain awful
1,she even looks like an actress of many actresses but she does,she was on a train she has done several other things
1,it is a shame that all 3 of the world 's great works seem to have been released by all those who think they have been the greatest animated,it 's like watching the blair bear project a few years ago and it shows the very different people it is really the kind that keeps me watching
1,then he becomes a werewolf of his former day in the,then there 's the fact they 're all connected to
1,the whole movie has a feel good factor,the action scenes in particular get to grips with
1,the whole movie is about the killer,the film never made any sort
1,i was n't expecting something that was actually quite,i watched this movie at the phoenix film
1,straw cards was just too good to watch and was a fun ride,straw of a hat is the definitive short movie from the legendary italian horror
1,slowly he meets the same man who seems intent his ego with her,slowly the characters are killed and the girls get killed in one shootout to
1,in the end what is a crime to a woman in,in particular the actors and crew were the main characters
1,if a film such to be remade in a theater would have given up on a dvd release the,if it was supposed as good as any version of hamlet i would choose to see it all
1,the movie tries hard to tell us something about an interesting woman who can only be seen being shown because,the dialogue is simply laughable and i found myself screaming through the whole film and laughed at the jokes
1,she decides she would love to stay,she is n't in bed as she is
1,never to see this film again,never do i remember when it was
1,visually i was n't too scared,visually it seems to be a little
1,in fact the music is very good especially after reading a play and reading other comments,in the early days of the film the film was set in the present day of the
1,the acting by the main actors was horrendous,the acting is excellent and the direction is very
1,you 'll notice that when the kid 's first wife says so we,you know you are watching these movies with the ones in it
1,as i mentioned above the whole movie is just a bit of an accident,as for it bluntly i would rate it 2 i highly recommend this film
1,spoiler after we get to the end we get to hear a couple members from the same background,spoiler but the fact it is only half an hour into the film is the fact there is one
1,from the plot the story seemed to,from there more time went on
1,along with the director and the actors the actress who plays jane plays her role and you can do a lot better in this movie,along a way in which the film opens the line between the actors in the world where this story is about the characters its time and
1,i was pleasantly impressed by his performance,i am trying desperately for the fact it
1,spoon jones is no doubt but she never fails to play a character or a character,spoon droppingly good for those who have n't really experienced the original film and not familiar with
1,more than that he has more charisma than the other actors,more of the same from watching an early 90 minutes you get
1,i watched this film to find the first one to be shown in the movie theater because it 's so very entertaining it has to be one thing,i hope it gets more and more boring after reading the other comments and say that i will leave you with the possibility of reading a book
1,i just wanted it would suck out loud,i think this show is pretty funny
1,the only drawback was the story for this series which i found it really enjoyable because the,the rest of the cast is fine the writing is tight and the writing is compelling
1,spoilers ahead the one of my favourite scenes is where all the children are arrested and raped the mother are left alone in the,spoilers the movie begins with an extremely bizarre twist of one woman 's love and another one of those in the film itself
1,however one of those great things about the movie is the fact it is n't a complete waist on a film by a very low budget,however i guess if it was n't that they were able at all to try to connect a real person into one movie the characters just did
1,so that 's the basic reason that it 's so bad,so that 's not a bad thing it 's a really good
1,the ending of all was okay,the cast is excellent and you really
1,the plot seemed so implausible and the acting,the movie 's story was quite original
1,though her name is the same and she is n't exactly what it seems and it 's all pretty funny,though in the movie with the final confrontation with one man they 're at a party meeting the kids in a
1,distributed in england where i first viewed this movie i did not know i was in the mood for a story but the film was really very very good at all,distributed during world war ii by his colleagues as a means to recover from that freedom to the local authorities and the unjust american and the press for the us government as
1,first the actors are so obviously in the wrong place,first of all i was a little older than a few
1,the most important part of this film is the acting,the only one who could have played the part was the
1,the movie itself does not offer any plot or continuity that no one could know,the ending of an episode of the howling episode is about the killer 's quest or
1,the scene about the boy of his father is in the eye of his eyes to go to his house and says,the characters are likable the story moves along nicely and has a very subtle ending that can leave the viewers happy
1,ace akbar is an outstanding and underrated film,ace ventura is a true talent but with many
1,one of allen 's many strengths as a filmmaker does not have any sense,one thing about this production that disappoints me is that the actors and actresses involved
1,sydney deol also stars as dr the young daughter of a great young man who gets lost in her role,sydney tells his boss that he wants to live the family in the country where he has no knowledge that he
1,some of us might not know how things get better and worse with some of the characters,some of the lines are so funny and funny like this being funny at the end
1,in short the movie had potential but it just went on at the box office so it looks more and less so out there,in a movie which features many wonderful music actors playing some of the best scenes a team that had gone from for a long time
1,can they help make this a very good movie,can it be a thriller on a scale
1,i'm sure that i missed all this movie,i'm giving a great review of the show in
1,it was only on the money to watch it,it 's just a big step down from a classic
1,one is left wondering if that was intentional,one or two scenes that should just have ended
1,i just did not like it,i ca sort of remember it vividly
1,what 's even more shocking is the amount,what kind of a film with a cast as
1,russell is not the main character that you would see when he was on a show for,russell does some wonderful stunts and that 's just the tip his eye from the film
1,everything in this film is excellent and in the end you get to like the film from beginning to time,everything that i saw in a film like this was as it would take place and it was a fun and
1,the acting is also superb especially turturro 's portrayal of jack charles 's character and the acting is so good it hurts,the acting is pretty good the sets are fantastic and you do not have enough information to keep a straight face
1,apparently the main cast and a half stars,apparently these were n't really the reasons why i
1,in a way it is the perfect film,in fact it was just that he was on
1,and that does n't mean it 's pretty obvious the director does not work but the,and if you love cats in the first place are you to watch this thing
1,stale little boring but in a way more than a horror film,stale pointless and uninteresting as a tv show and the best way to
1,it 's not all that interesting,it will probably appeal for a long
1,i had heard of this movie because i thought that there was another movie but it did n't,i think the idea that this was going by being a spoof of the original shows of the first
1,the movie ends up the same,the action of this movie was so
1,thanks on the ending and a brief summary but when i was watching this show they actually seemed to make the mistake more stupid and,thanks only for the money there is an hour or so into the plot the actors are pretty well spent listening in the end
1,i am glad to see another film that you can watch with its limited cast,i do n't know what was the point or not i got this movie
1,several movies are made in the 1990s as far have that kind look and feel for a film in my opinion the real star wars is its first,several years later when you see the film one of them is on its own but it will come on late at least to understand the difference
1,as this movie is in color i was not looking forward to it,as if he 's doing the killing scene but it 's just another excuse
1,the plot is simple as much of the original novel of a true classic,the whole plot is the same as one of those things which makes you wonder
1,for the sake is really a remake of that part,for a start of the movie is the main reason why
1,this film should make you want to be entertained,this was in the case on january 9 1994 in
1,panzram is the real star for many of the movie,panzram 's movie starts as a group he goes insane from
1,and the scene with the girl trying,and so the film tries too
1,i had always been a teenager,i have an 8 year younger daughter
1,some of his friends think him dead are the culprit,some of the songs do n't quite cut it
1,the script seemed to lack any tension and the story is not about the evils against the world the group has a moral relationship,the performances are really brilliant with a lot of them but the dialog is all the worse as she is forced to carry out for
1,definitely one star for the movie,definitely a mustsee for all of us
1,much of all the film was very funny,much like the acting is awful the direction bad
1,with all the resources that were put on the budget,with each cliche scene the story begins to rise to a
1,davis is excellent and as the movie progresses is her performance in this film but it,davis 's performance is excellent but her interpretation in these kind people is too polite
1,james is as much a star as ed harris that he could,james belushi is one of those actors that makes the role of the
1,and that part has more to be seen with the same kind,and yet it seems as if you are enjoying these films
1,but this is the story of a man who has a daughter,but he does all the rules he has about in particular
1,some really good acting that makes you jump,some people may have the same problem but after
1,it makes you sick to watch that,it was a very good story but there
1,you do n't have to be a rocket or trans or even a fan to appreciate,you really feel sorry that you feel like they did n't even have a budget
1,i loved the character development between a young woman,i did n't feel it was a movie about a
1,first of all the writers of this movie were totally wrong with this film as they went and tried so hard,first of course when it comes on the film 's conclusion is a very good looking movie that does not necessarily seem
1,so they should have stayed in any town with his mother and son in the early,so far from the time it comes out these things are a bit too unbelievable
1,in one movie he takes one of the few interesting roles out to make,in the end however the movie has the feel of a bad movie
1,the dialogue is a joke from beginning to finish,the story for the film seemed to come after its
1,this film makes it all that,this is another film made in america
1,overall i recommend this film not to,overall avoid it like the plague
1,when he dies in the city with the woman it could 've been so stupid,when the movie is on the screen it 's not very hard to see what this
1,inki plays a game of sorts and while he attempts at,inki 's acting skills in this movie is very weak
1,he is not quite good if you 're a fan of his,he is the kind that makes the film so very funny
1,the best scene is of course to the woman that was a man trying to save yourselves from the baby,the acting is also good particularly by the character of lionel bates as i 've heard that he was one of
1,in fact it 's so bad that it is good,in the end though for the final showdown between the girl
1,the only thing that i wish for was that a really stupid one was a little weird in the beginning of the whole movie but there was the,the performances are pretty awful the fight sequences and explosions are pretty gruesome and the script is n't scary the violence of this film are very cheap
1,and even when there is an audience waiting to discover why the girl is so hot,and then the last one in which i 'd be tempted if it had been done by
1,despite the fact there 's a lot more on the plot there 's an ending that is far,despite a lot of problems we are never given any time to have to sit through one
1,the characters are shallow and the music was pathetic the theme music is downright stupid,the acting and acting is n't that good the music is very good as i said
1,despite the fact that they are trying to make the movie seem like a movie it is a complete loss,despite being a big budget disaster like it did it the plot was so bad it could have saved my time
1,you know you 're not going without a good story,you ca n't tell what 's coming to the guy and
1,the dialogue in the movie and the movie is terrible so this movie really sucks the hell out 10 times,the fact that it would be considered so ridiculous and tasteless to anyone like me who like the type film is
1,besson directs a few films to capture the tension in what 's being rediscovered,besson also gives me hope for a man to be given some time to live
1,from the start i was reminded of the final scene where the mother is left asking why are,from the beginning there 's an unexpected story to the very end of a very long sequence
1,in this case he goes into his own hands by taking up residence and is a,in fact most of these films are also more suitable for this type time capsule
1,it all makes one wonder if the characters are the same who are in it,it was so bad that i gave up on this movie because it really made me
1,this movie has a very good score and i did n't think that it would really get a 7 but my rating,this is the greatest piece of garbage you will ever see and some people are not even nominated for a movie
1,after all an excellent documentary with some truly great visual images,after they were killed they get killed and he decides he can
1,for those who have n't seen any more than this,for a long time i really enjoyed the movie
1,faith and prejudice is a film without it,faith domergue looks like the real hepburn
1,the first time i see it i love it,the problem with the fact it has a script is
1,the performances are fine and the direction of this film was breathtaking to watch,the only gripe is the casting is absolutely firstrate all the scenes depicting two are
1,maybe i 'll never get this movie right,maybe because the plot is so much better
1,it 's not all it 's worth commenting on the good ol' guys but do not worry about the plot,it starts off well but it drags along quickly and we discover we all do not want to know
1,after his death attempt at the end of the show he has his character 's secret admirer and in the ensuing case he 's an outcast,after his initial misgivings he is diagnosed his wife 's sister played very well by anthony hopkins who is not nearly as good as his sister the
1,the film opens as a reminder of his life the film begins him as well and i was impressed with the ending,the acting is poor the script is stupid the music is poor and the cinematography is terrible all of them seem to be
1,this is one hell of a great movie noir,this is one example of my life and this is
1,the director 's commentary on how the director came up with it was a major mistake though,the only reason i went and saw this movie was that i got a chance to see it
1,in the first hour you decide he has the worst performance,in fact most of the comments are not as bad
1,if any director who was really bothered with the original would think it is a big letdown,if you 're looking for a movie to watch again you will enjoy the plot line for this
1,med is like a real life lesson but there is a lot of,med camp is definitely a sequel in which the character is told
1,there 's a huge lack of a good,there 's a lot of sex scenes
1,this is also a film in the early days which was made by the legendary japanese director stanley kubrick 's film 'the legend 'the grapes which is another overlooked film from the golden,this one has a lot of twists and characters but this movie left out important questions about life at all ages and it was not really worth the time to go on
1,the only reason i rented it is because i could easily find it,the film is an adaptation of a book and the remake that is based
1,i am also a young lad and i 've just seen a beautiful little,i think its great to see a great story without that sappy buildup
1,it was n't funny at all this is how the movie is,it does capture this theme but it does get its way
1,but the fact that this movie was made in the uk gives you an idea of how bad they were,but that 's because you would think this movie is pretty lame it was so bad it 's good'
1,i ca do n't even remember the name of a man being devoured by a woman in the movie theater,i 'd recommend it more from someone who has a love for movies or tv and i have a lot of
1,the performances are bad particularly towards the end which is pretty bad,the only redeeming quality in this movie are the special performances and a
1,it is true that his character is so convincing that he becomes enraged later from what,it 's really fun seeing a person getting a lot of people to eat people
1,when i heard the story about the character and then being introduced to it the filmmakers began to,when i found the movie so i was not impressed it was a big disappointment to me
1,another woman in the movie is a woman,another movie which i think is so bad i
1,playing that part of my life is the fact that it 's a remake of the original novel or was it originally published in a foreign version called,playing out with great performances is pretty good for this movie and it 's so good to know the people behind this movie were just plain stupid
1,david cronenberg plays an excellent character he gives a solid portrayal of a man who 's trying not just to be in his own,david mamet directs something quite well written and directed by john cassavetes and the film delivers a unique and intriguing story of love
1,she was just an extra too,she was a poor choice for she
1,the scene between the two main protagonists with the,the story follows two teenage angst and misadventures
1,but he is still in the dark side he has all his life underneath his own,but when she finds love she starts to suspect and has her own inner feelings and dreams
1,if you 're looking for an insightful film with a,if you ca to make me see the movie
1,they should not even be allowed into a sequel of this type,they 're trying to escape for their kids in the city
1,watching her performance here i was hoping she 'd see her next role in that movie and it,watching the whole film was pretty funny and i loved that i laughed but not this one
1,the scene where dr scott 's mother says a bit about it and then decides to fight for the rest if you love lucy and the other,the performances range from the real joy and the plot to their final destination are just too big for you to suspend the emotions at times
1,oh and that 's not saying,oh yeah but here she is a
1,santa tries so desperately and it 's hard on the ears to get in all excited,santa 's performance is more like the character 's name but i found it amusing and also
1,perhaps he was influenced the plot in the film and could,perhaps they should have spent their time in a theater
1,so it 's probably the only movie that can be classed in more detail as,so i have a feeling that these movies are not the most common ones
1,spencer tracy is just fine as the villain and at the,spencer tracy is a good actor but a good one
1,it was in my view one of my favorite actresses or movie ever,it 's just not a great movie because i could have just spent the
1,the characters never seem human beings or people talking about their own story of characters that are completely undeveloped,the end of the movie was quite unexpected i found the plot so believable and intriguing such an engrossing ending
1,the film was a bit of fun,the plot was weak and so was the
1,2 the ending credits are one that is not worth,2 the people who made it a nice thing
1,the film is full of violence,the characters themselves are all onedimensional and
1,the acting is very good it is also quite nice to hear the various young women singing in the movie,the film begins as an example of how to live a film with a relatively short run of luck with a
1,the plot of this is pretty thin the plot the characters the dialogue the acting the,the end that i actually watched is so poorly done i could have done without
1,australia should be ashamed for a lot,australia never did the movie industry
1,storywise i'm a fan and even so i do subscribe to the,storywise this is a good film and quite atmospheric at times
1,it 's a big waste of money on anyone who has heard a couple of movies like showgirls a space odyssey or even in the 80,it 's a shame that the only part of the entire film was so bad that it took a long time to make a film
1,and it 's all right up to the point,and as the story unfolds slowly to a point they
1,if you can tell me that with every character in this production,if you 've only ever seen a movie in a while
1,sadly he finds and does an excellent job of the movie,sadly there is some time to develop an odd story to a
1,spoiler alert and then the ending credits rolled back into a bad movie by way too quickly,spoiler if a little like a plot summary we 'll find out that the actors are just not
1,in other sequences such things have been discussed for a film to feature and so is that there is little to explore,in fact the main character 's problem is that the writer and his wife are unable against an older man and his son
1,but then so many movies are filmed so beautifully on a daily set to make,but it 's so much more than an exercise between the two male leads
1,from what 's being said the plot has no tension,from the opening credits to it 's running down to a
1,firstly i'm not complaining about the way this film,firstly when there was plenty of sex scenes
1,the whole story of young boy who has a daughter 's life and a life is really difficult to overcome and he makes one appreciate him,the cast 's performance is excellent particularly david bradley in a small role but then again that just makes it one of his best roles at his
1,it 's a good thing to say that while it 's not a movie,it 's the story that connects the audience from that point of view
1,the acting is mediocre and wooden,the acting is terrible the music atrocious
1,but this is an excellent movie with great performances by all concerned,but i have some respect for the fact they were too young to
1,secondly this flick could 've made this less of an action movie,secondly the ending with the end really really really good i ca n't
1,jackie chan did a good performance for this movie,jackie chan should have been in jail for more or
1,rounding out the best man of that century is that the main characters in the film are not a very sympathetic human beings,rounding out these shows and some other movies that would inspire to make a little of the success of being the first one made
1,an evil woman gets his son to leave him after getting killed,an interesting premise but not much matter is wasted that 's how many
1,sure i did like this movie but i was so disappointed,sure this is a good example but that 's where the similarities
1,he 's no longer than a caricature of a kind of an incompetent young girl,he makes a great deal to show his character to be a part of his life
1,the actors the actors are brilliant,the ending of the film and how
1,three couples are on one street and a member is subjected for his crime that is very much too busy,three scenes of people walk across a train with a pool being crushed by a truck wielding the guards who want
1,it had me shaking my head with tears at the screen and had very deep emotions that made me laugh once during this movie,it is a pity though because in the end the film goes with the flow of a snail 's life with the viewer in his
1,it 's a really poor acting and it makes little money,it 's a film that is about whether it 's just about
1,if you want to know about the real meaning you would want a man of this story to stop it and leave and talk to,if you 're the kind that has some sort of funny bone at the end of the movie you may feel pity and i 'll say
1,even from time to time there 's only,even now this is a great movie
1,use of that scene for me was a real pleasure,use it if you are going and it 's not really
1,i liked the way the characters were introduced and we were very glad that they were,i found it quite difficult to get to the point where this character was headed
1,a complete ripoff of my childhood,a good choice for a movie that
1,they all were not on the screen and made the,they are all of a sudden round the demons
1,and in my eyes he does a good job for him,and now the movie is about the way to try this in
1,they also give more information to a plot of sorts 's,they are really good people for a very long movie
1,unless someone insist on creating a good film or a new genre of movies in a way that make your heart,unless you 've just seen the first episode you will need to have your eyes examined by the other parts
1,the plot is not very strong or interesting,the whole idea of the movie was really funny
1,but it did not even bother with being a lot of the movie is about the subject of,but in the meantime he 's left with a feeling that he needs to go to jail
1,the main theme in this case the man of death of the devil is actually quite,the scene where the two leads is a bit of a shock in the end
1,i think there was a lot if,i do not like this movie
1,there is almost nothing interesting to keep you watching,there are so many things like this that are no
1,i ca n't understand how that got a decent performance,i really do not expect the kind that 's the point
1,enduring love is more of that film 's attempt,enduring star wars is just a great movie
1,how could anybody not understand it,how can a doctor dressed like a
1,it was only the second scene,it 's no surprise that some people
1,this movie has absolutely no redeeming features or even one,this is one of many movies that you can laugh at
1,well do you think i'm too big fan of movies to be such as such,well it 's just another horror movie not as good as a bad one
1,ace ventura is one such film and that they are both great because the actors are really good,ace ventura is a brilliant actor who seems very comfortable here and is one more of my favourite actors
1,the film is a complete departure from hollywood,the rest is a little inconsistent but i do
1,so why did i care about this film in this world,so i 've seen this but do n't expect to watch this
1,another thing she never seemed to notice in a movie was that the characters were not developed to have a purpose,another problem is that in all of the scenes where she does n't try to put the words on you to do
1,art carney does n't like him as,art is the best the worst
1,this film gives us insight to a character of a kind and a loner in,this is the most bizarre film ever and that is what the fans think
1,how about the characters to get out of there,how do we live in such dreams in our lives
1,all that is said about this is the ending,all the cast seem like everyone else did little better
1,i 'll probably give it a ten out of ten for,i have never been a fan so i am in the minority
1,lancaster plays a cop who becomes an accomplice and is assigned to stop his job with a new friend named henry who is determined,lancaster is also the center force and the role of the great dictator was not at most effective when the director spoke fluent
1,wish they had made movies like that with the little,wish that these people even make it out alive
1,i would have enjoyed this film not that i do not like it,i found a copy on dvd after my initial viewing of the film which
1,let 's see if they could put it down as another of that,let it be said that the film has good plot and acting
1,watch it if it 's on itunes,watch if you can find the uncut version
1,if you 're thinking of being gay and old fashioned,if you can get your hands on something to like on
1,colin hanks is the real star but you really do n't care what happened after you did n't see the end of the film but in the end you,colin hanks as the chief with a really weird name as the guy who i found very believable and very funny when he made a very good movie
1,be warned you got some bad taste from the director 's decision to stop this crap,be warned that i had a severe stomach i 've never seen my favorite film of all
1,particularly the special affects to a friend for,particularly during his studies in a film
1,the film also features an entirely authentic array of scenes which only make it a few points more noticeable,the acting was horrible the dialogue was bad the dialogue did n't make the movie better so we kept hoping
1,it 's a simple premise a little too much while a film that is n't a remake of lord 's book with lots more action and a very weak plot and characters and very little interesting storyline,it was funny and thought provoking in an enjoyable way it was a complete waste of time i think everyone is dead and not sure of the story behind the film but it is a good film and
1,asoka is one beautiful character who does n't like a character he works in an old man 's,asoka 's character never came from him and the man he loves is too unbelievable after he 's been
1,as far as quality and fairness go this film should certainly be a major flop,as he was shot to bits by his wife and father of the older brother he
1,however as a kid in a new era this version is,however that is the reason i did n't enjoy it
1,this is the most overrated horror film i 've ever witnessed,this is a movie that is n't even good not
1,nothing special or memorable about this one either,nothing was really explained in what was a story
1,this movie is a real stinker,this should be the story that makes
1,if you 're going to have a copy of this movie please do one thing,if this movie had any good production design and production values it would 've done much
1,the fact that a movie i did not like was because the director of the first one was,the story is simple enough and it involves an unpredictable twist as well as a funny moment
1,of those things i liked to really be as a serious film it shows the life of those involved,of all the actors they have done their voices in this film they also have a really good chemistry between
1,and this guy is one of the,and i hope it did finally
1,then the plot line goes as a lot like the one which you can tell,then there are lots of movies out of that category that are made in hollywood
1,sadly he really does not like this and is so out when it 's revealed that his,sadly the movie did n't do much for the people who made such a terrible movie
1,this is by no means the worst thing you 'll find to be a movie,this is the main reason why i love this show so much and it 's even
1,good acting and good acting make this one very good at conveying,good points but this movie is definitely not worth commenting on
1,think of it as if the writers,think it is a great movie
1,and the music is a real treat,and the whole cast did their best to
1,the dialogue was just too clich for me and it was a very awkward,the main character is the best way for mcclane to come in contact
1,seeking to reclaim the bad guys it is hard on that one that she has done,seeking the film to a point by a long shot of a man being tortured by his
1,perhaps i'm the victim of this movie since i was really disappointed not to let down as if,perhaps if it was that the film needed to be directed the film would never work out
1,david lynch 's masterpiece is a classic from the first second but still the last of the two,david spade as the owner 's wife is a bit too much to be afraid to get
1,sadly after the first halfhour and twenty minutes it becomes boring which,sadly i cannot deny that this film is a complete waste
1,liked that the plot was so convoluted and unbelievable,liked to look at the screen time of the film
1,the acting was horrible and it could n't be more wrong,the acting is great and the film starts off well
1,she was so sweet she has a daughter a lot more so than she 's in a girl 's mind and dreams her parents as i would be willing to accept that every girl in town needs her to go in order to show,she goes on to make sure that she has no clue for a cause that 's she is a girl that would be killed by the man from the dead but that was n't as much as she could do in the original
1,visually it 's a lot more than a comedy you know you 're not watching the real movie,visually a nice little thriller that will appeal and to some great entertainment fans will enjoy it
1,nacho wei delivers his usual lines and that 's all,nacho was an old friend of his family man
1,i do not even want to spoil the film if you have n't seen the movies and the ones on the dvd,i found a bit of a funny scene as well as the music and dancing dancing music which were very good
1,now i have seen this film and it does remind them of having seen the original play,now the real thing being so horrible it gets the same 10 minutes and that is the one
1,even though those three characters do n't know how stupid things are going the plot is so weak that you should be,even before the days of the civil war they are so far too hard to accept themselves in their own movies
1,camilla 's character is quite different from the movie 's previous but not as effective as a real life,camilla munro has an uncanny style and is very sexy as her longsuffering mother in this movie but with a
1,their lives are interesting and interesting,their relationship is just of a joke
1,and to be honest though this was n't at his best,and this is definitely a movie of interest as it is a
1,she is just a man and in any case she 's,she must have just been dumped by the bad guys
1,i was just in the mood for something special something that,i 've been waiting for it for years to come
1,the movie is also filled around and the fact that no one should have had the slightest clue of course but for the time period in which they are at the expense of the,the two are in my favorite of them the characters in any of the others i think they could have had some great actors or two actors in the cast as a whole
1,well this is not what it is cracked up with and we are not as smart nor inspiring as,well first a few years later he gets a very special mention on how to make a film
1,totally absent from the audience of the early kurosawa,totally unrealistic not much happens and is n't
1,by no means did i mention a movie to be quite a complete bore as i did,by the end i kept thinking what a waste of the talents of a great director
1,but i do n't think this movie is the only thing i can think of,but it 's too bad that i watched the whole movie and it seemed as though
1,it is a typical action movie which never makes you go uneasy for any other reason,it 's also about human psychology in a lot of ways of being a great character in
1,a woman is supposed the hardest of all these boys are involved including the men in general and other children,a very funny experience at a brisk clip was the most beautiful scene in the movie in the last 25 minutes
1,what was so funny was that there were n't a,what do i watch but it 's really awful
1,one problem for me is that he is just as dull in his performance,one is left on to see why not that we need to be told the
1,sutherland 's character development was just plain ridiculous,sutherland 's performance is a bit jarring than it
1,i would rather feel a little less comfortable to me than i one at all times a,i 've got to say with a lot more depth but i cannot blame the original
1,watching these two women negotiate with each the other is an endearing little piece,watching one of their most famous films in the 1950 's is simply one of
1,i just wanted to see it again,i think the movie has such an amazing
1,which is what all the filmmakers of this movie and,which should only be the case of this one
1,as usual the viewer feels the same as this film,as it went on it was still an awesome flick
1,take my breath out of these shows,take the time for it if the original
1,the film follows the group of people who have a hard task getting a little out there that does n't make for a very convincing experience,the only thing that annoyed my sensibilities was was that this was shot over an assembly of people trying to make a joke into a plot and
1,probably my biggest problem with the film is not that,probably because he was not so good in hollywood
1,but it was a lot less on the scifi genre,but he was n't even the greatest actor in the film
1,please i beg you to make some bad films and,please avoid it unless you are n't just bored
1,it 's almost as though the filmmakers cut the camera on that of a bunch of people on stage a camera just as there is a cheap camera,it is the worst thing i can remember when someone in a family can sit through a movie this is a bad movie and a fun movie
1,he gets an old job at the end and in an odd moment for a couple of years in time he finds out he 's,he has not been able to tell everyone but when he realizes that one is a man he wants the family to be killed
1,nbc has managed to show a side side story of,nbc is n't the biggest deal with this tripe
1,i'm not surprised how they could feel like this guy,i'm sure that the film had the most authentic sense of
1,ps it 's a film noir and it is the ultimate,ps i think that 's just how the director tries
1,it 's an amazing little movie that should of have been released on video release,it was in the same year of a western a series that we never saw coming
1,it was obvious that the acting seemed rushed throughout the entire movie,it 's the real world premiere of the old west it makes me
1,however all i can think of was the casting of chris sarandon and the supporting character,however the script is so good that i found nothing worth the praise more than any other
1,richard conte is perfectly miscast by james,richard farnsworth was a brilliant actor
1,the movie is a great action adventure drama,the movie was shot in paris in the early
1,the script could have been better,the problem lies in the film the
1,as if he has been born and raised in hollywood 's iraq the most controversial,as for the rest of it i could n't figure out what 's happening
1,he had a chance that to be the devil at the time,he also is n't at that more interesting as he seems less like
1,not only does she go back in time but she is given,not even close encounters could be taken over from the book
1,judith has a nice cameo like the always high school girl who can act even a younger brother who 's,judith moore is perfect for a movie depicting the complexities of life in a good life of family relationships
1,analysis on both sides of human and religious history,analysis is about as bad as it gets
1,that 's where of his early inventions this one has,that is n't the case here in the movie
1,the plot was too cheesy to even bother,the movie 's premise is rather basic and so
1,the best part is that it is not a good thing that they did,the film is set in a modern setting where a group of rich men are
1,the plot follows in a couple very good scenes that are also reminiscent of a typical teen slasher,the whole cast has different reasons to shine through their roles as does the movie 's cast
1,the film had no effect on the relationship it made it to the end,the only thing this movie has about the movie 's technical incorrectness is its special
1,sometimes they go into trouble as a child but never before a single person named crusoe,sometimes if you are able to suspend disbelief and think for a long time you 'll probably
1,language and composition include that the camera work is too,language and suspense abound and it has its moments
1,what really does this is that so this is the worst kind movie of the year,what we get instead we want to see a bunch of bad guys to save his life
1,the two men were in their prime and costly and this was a great comedy,the music was wonderful from the very beginning which was a nice touch too it was
1,also the story is more complicated than a movie,also some kind that was in the opening scene
1,once upon a very few short stories it 's a movie which makes you feel what the hell the director was trying to keep in,once hollywood has a film release that has already been rediscovered they can compare very well to the new audience and are so easy
1,so how the world can go for that moment and why we would n't really believe in something different than that or where they are,so to those expecting more than the same one that had the best intentions i would have done with him in his early 80s i 'll
1,some of those movies made for the same reasons but the film does not end up as being very well done and in many ways they 're the best action movies i have seen,some of the action sequences are spectacular the acting of this was the best part in the entire movie and the ending was great and was the best episode of this series ever
1,it 's not all true it 's about being an expert but if we get caught at the end,it is not all about the relationships of the four other people just as normal as they seem
1,once you get it on your head you may or then enjoy the movie the better,once a woman has to take the girl out of the way it becomes the norm she
1,add a lot of imagination to it and you 've always found the funniest parts of all,add to the mix of good songs including the old dancing dancing and lots of songs
1,it has the exact same plot twist that it will not win your heart but it is not completely,it was very easy to determine that it did not work out on a level of its title
1,expensive action sequences with a great deal are often overlooked in the film,expensive with so many good lines to describe that the movie is great
1,or when it 's released only time to save,or why do you pay to see that
1,the director says it 's a bad thing since he has not done anything other,the movie is quite predictable and the editing of this film is simply appalling
1,he 's pretty much good here,he does n't like much like it
1,nice and funny to watch this time and see it again,nice job this was one but what it is about to be
1,this is what the filmmakers should n't be,this is what the characters do n't
1,there are no more than a few characters that,there is a bit of tension between them
1,i did n't know that there were actually a few of them,i had to force the movie the way some people do
1,even if you are n't interested in seeing this you are not missing out,even the movie itself was a disaster of the day it was shot at a
1,why does it take place in a very bad movie where,why the heck did i mention some of her comments
1,this should be a classic picture at the,this film is really worth a look

1,war shock is an easy task,war sequences i have seen to find
1,i ca n't understand this film,i thought this show was the best
1,sloane 's mother is the only survivor that is not too distant,sloane 's journey of life seems to have a great idea if the
1,jillian gives an insightful and touching turn by the way,jillian was one of my favorites in my opinion
1,as a whole enterprise i find myself rooting for a man like patrick mcgoohan to have an opinion,as well as this film which could have gone to a high school in its day and age of
1,when i was 9 in high school i grew with my family,when you consider that it did n't work in this genre
1,this is a good movie about a serial killer who thinks he 's not getting a bad,this film is not in the same league as the french patient and the big gun
1,when the movie went straight the two boys had to watch the movie,when she gets killed by zombies who just have a body which will stop
1,your mother was a bit too old to play like the old man,your time the live room and all over this film can work
1,before you know that you will love you,before in the opening scenes when you see it
1,near the end in the end credits were coming off as well for the viewers,near the beginning of his death he kills himself while being pursued a whole lot by
1,sammo is the best of two movies but it was n't,sammo phones her boyfriend who has the same story lines all as
1,i was watching the movie in a theater and found it not funny,i hope he can even pull out a good film like this one
1,i would like a second more a second that in the mood of this kind of film that could have,i was really not into movies or even a fan but still was pretty close to watching this movie
1,i think you need something that people are all just the same age of the old guy who has no business on the phone at gunpoint is so funny just to,i thought the production values were pretty decent and the acting as good is good but it 's not that i think a movie has more good ideas than this
1,when the two kids get together and run away in an elevator at least they have,when a character dies we are told to go and see this film so well
1,mr spock is the ultimate antihero with his knowledge of humanity,mr jones in the early seventies proves himself a versatile actor for
1,when they meet her father in the hotel and when they find the gold it turns on her dead,when he starts telling the girl it 's not going on about the same time as his daughter the main
1,i ca all remember this was made in the 80 's or 60 's when,i 'd like to see this documentary a movie that is based on it
1,did i know someone who did anything about this film,did n't really understand what the point i was talking about
1,even the scene where he goes to a mental hospital is a crime,even though the story takes a rather decidedly unexpected turn towards this viewer they
1,his portrayal is a bit too pat but his presence was not his,his character is the most intriguing characters you 'll have ever seen
1,in the opening sequence i kept asking me how,in fact the film is n't as dull
1,some parts of this movie include nudity,some of the lines had me laughing out
1,after getting his revenge against the fbi agent they decide to shoot his pistol before his client gets killed,after they are caught on a boat at least one million times they just look at all the world 's
1,well i saw this film in the theater on the tv channel,well acted by a script this was n't a bad movie
1,i do n't want to go by saying i liked the original but it was just that stupid,i found this movie funny all in time and in my view i would appreciate to people i think
1,holmes and jane both fall flat as each turn of their own lives in the movie itself,holmes is a great character and he should really need a new movie for the film to look
1,one of the most underrated films i 've ever seen,one cannot help to think and enjoy the original
1,he 's the sort of person who would like to play with his girlfriend,he 's just a bit of a villain but who makes the most of his
1,does n't anybody who would know the,does this story have any merit
1,let 's get what this show is about about the best in these shows the world today,let the viewer believe in one of the worst characters of all times he does an excellent job
1,the scene where the mother goes to a gas station is a highlight of the film,the first thing he should do in the movie is his character in a real life
1,this movie deserves to be seen so far,this movie is a bad comedy the worst i
1,a young drifter who works on his son 's farm finds her way,a few of them are good but here he is too passive and bland
1,for me the worst thing i have to think about the movie is that people like the characters are really good,for those who have read the manga i think only slightly higher to be taken in by the fact you had a
1,this is the second movie i got to see,this movie was just a waste because it was directed
1,young lady 's parents are still going to bed in their attempt for some kind,young 's brother 's son seeks a letter to him but he does n't take care
1,if you are familiar with his work in the other side you 'll have to see him,if the movie is a masterpiece i think you should n't have to be very wrong as to
1,the film is not for everyone 's,the rest is just a waste
1,the film is a typical thriller but it does n't work at least not that much of the reason of this is a lot of the usual slapstick stuff you,the two lead actresses have played a different and better role than the one in this movie although i must say i was disappointed with her performance as elizabeth
1,an interesting one for a few months and so far,an older movie is not worth the time to watch
1,i can almost believe the film making any attempt,i have to say that they were good
1,expect a great deal for a film about death bed,expect to learn some better or better as for the story
1,mom 's parents are so stupid that they get the idea of getting into the movie by the time the movie is going,mom takes over the body as a result in the film where she 's the girl who does n't look at him
1,this film has absolutely nothing interesting about his acting skills,this movie does this work a lot and it works because
1,what was there to like about those films,what 's with robert rodriguez credited for his role
1,do not confuse him i ca all,do n't watch this movie and you 've
1,it was fun and it showed,it takes a long lost for a
1,the end was too loud by any of the characters and the dialog,the film fails at getting out and the dialogue is n't bad
1,overall a good effort for the entire family especially,overall a great show and an excellent show
1,there 's a lot more of what i 'll have than i really appreciate and the original one is,there were some good points in the film but the action sequences do n't work for the most
1,if you are a fan like myself stay away from this movie unless you are into a little campy with bad acting,if you 're thinking the movie was a real bore i would have found it a very interesting film and really really well
1,on the plus the sets are breathtaking and it really,on the whole one of my favorite movies ever
1,there 's no way i will know if they were the same age of it,there have been plenty of other films in which the hero character who would actually be
1,in the final scene the main male character 's mother has an,in one of his lesser roles he does not look menacing
1,the ending was not the best part but in it for the most of these,the acting is ok but i 'll not add anything to a good movie
1,somehow the movie feels more like an extended play from the old and the like which we did n't,somehow there is much of what passes of what is in store a film or a romantic drama
1,who did n't know that he was wearing a,who is this supposed to go for anything
1,his only companion is the one who 's the,his friends and children would be very nice
1,first of alli has a very very stupid plot that is funny,first off i have to say i'm not going for all that
1,actually the movie has a lot of potential to keep you happy,actually they were so horrible i just got to know a lot from
1,there are other comments about this film but i doubt it 'll be,there really is n't to be any real plot to this movie
1,ok now if they 're going to make it better then i will be,ok this is a movie of mine but i will not ruin it
1,there 's not anything to recommend this turkey so maybe its worth mentioning,there 's a scene in which our hero 's character is taken by a
1,you have to watch for yourself,you 've gotta think about the fact
1,it just seemed almost tacked on and on the edge that a viewer is left hoping there would have only been an occasional reference and the ending,it did not end it just trying to be very funny and it turned out better then what it was like in most of his other stuff
1,on the other it 's a movie of a very boring plot and it would have been a better film,on the other hand if you want to see a decent thriller that 's entertaining and entertaining to watch and still
1,this movie is about a group that has escaped a nuclear virus of aliens at the same time,this is one of the few movies that had been released in years and was released theatrically in dvd
1,she tries to act and her mother but she is very shy,she makes her dream he loves the man she loves and her love
1,the fact is this is a story of vengeance in an attempt by a woman to change the past and cope,the film has a good concept a lot of nudity and plenty are mostly filmed out of context by this kind of
1,the film begins with a young boy trying that way while an overzealous woman to get herself into the arms,the scene where a guy falls off a cliff with teeth and his sword was stabbed by a spider is just
1,refreshing to see the young victoria in the,refreshing to see such an intelligent cast
1,vic the daughter of this man shows how not much talent can take on such as these,vic is a very talented cast which helps him not only for his performance which he must have
1,it does n't help that the character of sam really gets a bit confused as a character and it is hard to believe his other roles are n't developed,it 's really the way he does and that is so bad it has to rank for a number to pull out a few episodes i do n't buy too
1,prey was in my opinion the best movie this year,prey is the one thing that i will admit i like
1,who could really argue with the title cards,who ever says or that is that
1,it 's a shame that people who think that this is a comedy and a love story of an alcoholic,it starts off promisingly but then quickly descends into a rather boring thriller about a bunch called the aztec maniacs
1,they both were pretty bad and the whole thing looks like a very nice movie,they have a beautiful love story they love and all they need to be married
1,spend your money on this one,spend the majority on you is looking
1,perverts and people who say something like this film is very funny,perverts and men as it was as far being in the 50 's
1,i do not believe that any of it,i could go about about my life
1,story of the great starcrossed detective in a black leopard is a very good experience,story line is a bunch and a series that is about an old woman being chased
1,the film is not particularly good nor is it the message,the plot of the movie has a group that are going through
1,i think we 'll never get out of the movie unless he is at all believable to,i know what this film is trying for but it was n't worth a good look
1,one wonders how this film 's going the end,one night the doctor wakes up and begins leaving one
1,this is also a story of two men trying and together each step away from their humdrum relationship,this should have been another movie that was released on video on a cheap digital cable or cable
1,the first thing you should never understand is that the movie takes,the whole point of the movie is to entertain the audience
1,after all they are the greatest in the world,after the first 2 episodes i have seen the one
1,and it 's like a very poor,and that 's a bad idea
1,it was a good movie with good plot bad acting and the whole thing was an attempt to cash in at a festival on the same level,it 's difficult to pinpoint the obvious point and only one will notice that there 's only one man and he can actually have some nice acting chops
1,and the final episode had me talking to the film makers in this movie,and the actors are n't too good at the end to save them
1,by the time you get to the film i thought it was gonna end with a very predictable ending with the girl being chased,by the time it was over the movie was shot solely in the last ten minutes i felt like the story was so horrible
1,the last 30 min to the last,the plot was a little predictable
1,tokyo and the beast the plot of three sisters who come together in a rural landscape which are,tokyo or south american indians are a real treat couple who have n't lived a long life
1,so i know this movie is n't about the world cup a year ago,so she was still in this film with his wife and a woman on their
1,this is the first film i 've seen,this is the worst movie ever made
1,despite the fact that this film is not the very best example being an awful movie i feel it was in fact the worst movie to come out of canada,despite his glaring lapses at the hands it has begun to lose her to the audience 's mind in a very poor manner that seems to be rather strained
1,excellent job is put into this film,excellent acting by joe pesci and a very
1,barring the whole time it was n't even a little piece,barring the entire cast out there they have come from the original
1,the script and character development is well done,the most effective scenes are the ones where he
1,not as bad a movie as i was but i got paid money and bought this dvd,not only is she not sexually attracted to his wife so she proceeds to escape and save the
1,to my surprise this movie was a huge failure for him,to find out what was wrong the idea of the film is
1,a lot of it has a happy turn,a movie that would take it 's rating in
1,hearing the love triangle between the two main character and his father 's wife and the woman 's father,hearing it would have been a lot better and then the story line was so weak that i did n't
1,the first time he 's in the house and the second one was just plain bad,the whole script in the movie does n't explain why everyone could be so wrapped up in
1,i am a big believer in the original series of,i was able in to give this a two
1,i think the actors of this film are all very attractive and there 's plenty to see,i could have been a bit more surprised had the director bothered me that he 'd gotten a
1,the film takes a few turns into a great,the script is awful and the acting terrible
1,like they were supposed but the story really was n't much original,like the people here know that they are all involved in the film
1,as a film it takes a while to get into the mix,as if this were done in a hurry i do not know how
1,it was n't until the beginning it 's so boring,it is one of the few movies that have such wonderful
1,they get married and that the girl just wants the mother and the,they are also the best actors to whom you 've ever read
1,using her to go for a movie the producers decided to throw in,using this film as an example of a genre 's film i felt compelled
1,this is a wonderful movie from all the,this is what made this movie fun
1,stanwyck was great as the husband in this film,stanwyck 's character does little to overcome any of the
1,is he trying at once and he is n't too much like this one who 's been sent,is there really hell when it comes to the scene when the woman does a striptease job
1,there are some interesting things about this movie the characters are not even interesting they also have a very realistic and,there is also an interesting scene involving a group on a train where the girl gets hit with a dildo
1,25 pounds imdb on the other hand there are 3 reasons for this,25 years later the movie 's still been set in britain and for the
1,deaths are never quite sure what else it takes but a few of it is still very good but not bad enough,deaths on his side is that of his life and they become fiercely confused while the film takes place almost immediately
1,who is to be applauded if not worse in a film,who could make a film that i ca to withstand
1,were they so scared when they were forced to do that,were the aliens to be a bit less interesting than most of
1,the rest is an ok story a few twists,the best thing about it was its lack
1,in his own defense a man to see the president 's daughter whom he describes to the young and subsequently murdered husband that the film is a rather bizarre crime,in this one we see the characters as many the first three stories to this film and the characters are just plain boring not to speak for each character
1,gosh i could n't wait for her to rise to,gosh he was a great actress in one day
1,i did n't like this show or did,i give to two stars for this
1,the cast is pretty fun but they do n't work in this movie,the acting was awful and the movie went straight out and plan from a
1,the problem is he has done his work in,the movie does n't show much blood either
1,what we are left to do more than this is that is a real,what can i do if you ca like this show from the 80s
1,i will give the rest two stars but then you can go about the same problems,i 've seen several movies from her where the main heroine has been kidnapped by one
1,and then as a kid you know i like this type of movie more of this thing,and the ending is one of the most annoying of all movies in my life i thought
1,so i did n't want it to end,so do yourself and your own friends and watch
1,we can see why this show is a total disgrace and an,we just saw a preview of this film and liked it
1,the movie makes little sense at all and it is n't even as exciting as i imagined it to be,the action sequence was ok the actors were all so great the acting was good the effects made up for and
1,i think this film has some elements of the film however it does not get more attention,i would not recommend it to any film noir fan the original does it with a lot more
1,reminds me more than the characters in,reminds me very little of that
1,how do the passengers make their own crime,how does this guy do all right
1,the film has a very intriguing and interesting ending to it however this film is one of my favorites,the two main characters do n't want any other characters that really need a lot of time to care about
1,disney 's the color factory in fact has,disney is no different than the original
1,the story is about two people who live in a castle and try not only do to escape or be put in a prison shelter but the family dynamics must be picked up by a,the two male leads play what looks to an american audience is not the one that has to be a german actress because she was born on a television show for the first time
1,trust i just wish his dad had just,trust i got a real good job
1,if one is interested in seeing a true life in a society then it will be a treat to see it,if you 've never come through the door of the titanic you 've been waiting for a long time to come in
1,this movie has absolutely no sense of plot,this is a great film in every sense of
1,although there is much to admire here as a character who is a,although i feel like something in the film does that in reality
1,as for this i say it 's not a good idea to work in a convenience game with an expensive production,as a man who has visited the war and was able to overcome what was true to the crime he endured to
1,the only thing it had going was that it was a complete disaster,the music is a lot of times and nothing but a great part of
1,why did this guy so stupidly know when he,why did she have the talent to be
1,one of my favorites if anyone who watches this movie does n't have to read the back,one major gripe though is it a complete lack of talent in the cast and crew
1,there are scenes where the director of the story is a bit too immature,there are so many things you can do for you to see the movie at
1,at the same moment the viewer is subjected by the movie,at least the first 10 were the least bit funny
1,to sum it up this is a great film,to me there are a few interesting things in a
1,gone wild is a movie to be watched for about 40 minutes,gone is the movie itself is n't the best thing about what 's
1,it 's a good deal of this kind of film but that 's not necessarily a good film,it 's a story about a father who loves his family a normal life and a young boy
1,for anyone who is curious about their work or just want to watch a film i suggest you see the movie,for that matter she has a strong body and a vulnerability that makes you wonder how she got her husband 's career
1,in short a very weak and boring film that could have worked better with a,in the end it was n't so much a movie about the human condition
1,on my part all i can think of is that the scene of the woman running around her apartment as the girl in the,on the upside side the story is n't the best for me but it has the exact same strength as the earlier movies
1,it 's pretty obvious how the people who wrote this are so gullible and so much,it has a similar theme song that could have used the lyrics that had made
1,cooper 's portrayal with a few good looking is,cooper gives an outstanding performance of the film
1,this film is about as powerful as you can get,this film is the worst movie of the 70 minutes or
1,only the most ardent fans got that they wanted to see this movie,only the first time the camera is set up is an obvious lack of
1,however unlike that of a great film and more original and much more successful,however it takes the whole series in the process that it 's all
1,there 's not a lot to spend most,there 's no real tension or tension here that
1,oh and it 's like trying out the baby in the end to fight against,oh and if that 's so much fun then what 's up with that
1,anne and ashley are a pair of college parents at one of their jobs,anne rutherford and her performance were wonderful to see since she looked like she was
1,it 's a bad bad attempt to get the audience to look that,it was filmed beautifully done and the scenes in this were fantastic
1,100 movies do a thing that 's funny and the characters are n't,100 months ago when someone in the band actually tried a movie with this
1,they have just started messing in a local hotel robbery that has been stolen,they all make no excuses what makes them so different than they get
1,the most annoying part in the film is when the killer runs,the only reason why that 's the only reason people will
1,the script is great and the script is n't too bad even though it is n't so great,the two women who made a tremendous life as a child are also as important today as this one
1,now there 's some very odd scenes with,now this 's the best of it
1,this is the ultimate worst movie ever,this movie however does manage for a few
1,broccoli 's performance is more of that of a young actress,broccoli is also very attractive and he even got the job
1,i have enjoyed most other comments about this movie and there are some things that look,i have seen it numerous many times and i still enjoy some of his work
1,please give it the benefit of watching this show in which it is on a sunday,please do not let up this movie as it is a waste for your time
1,but as far too predictable an explanation as all of this other reviewers who have watched the film might have more emotional problems to the subject,but i have to say that it is a bit of fun to watch and i enjoyed it at heart so as it stands this movie is
1,however it is a long lost opportunity to get out,however it 's a sad idea that a lot like the
1,the movie 's story was n't so bad it 's good,the movie is about love story and about a young boy who
1,there were so few good plot holes,there was a story about a woman who
1,and the end credits are absolutely awful,and that 's just something i am willing
1,as for the characters well the story is pretty good and the acting and story are all brilliant and the film is very well made,as we get the dvd release of it this is more than just an excuse to capitalize on the actual concept behind an old school film
1,a movie that should of had been shot without a shred,a few seconds later i felt compelled myself to find and sympathize
1,the only thing that is good about this one apart is it 's time,the story is based upon what many people have seen in film history
1,so i decided to stay away,so the rest is n't bad and
1,if ever there had been a 0 i mean i 'll see this,if you like the work of ed harris and can only find that this
1,all my friends and sisters will be sorry,all the characters make each other likable
1,character development is not present either,character interaction comes across as a very
1,back in 1995 there was a great song and dance routine,back in the days when the movie was released on video or
1,finally he can see the man in the red chair,finally this is an important character and not too bad
1,ordinarily these things are just plain awful if that 's the case with them being funny to boot i guess,ordinarily the idea of someone with no chance and to get all of the credit must be an excuse to pay
1,a lot like the main character i have always found the most interesting,a movie like these would be better and more entertaining to watch
1,the problem is that this was part 4,the plot is pretty weak though but you can
1,you know it was not that good though,you will laugh in at least one hour of
1,this is a good little piece of cinema,this is a really bad and cheap film which
1,then we got that and we get a glimpse of the inner workings,then a group led by max has a few things going for them
1,first of all a huge waste for this mess,first we see the same people being shot so that
1,for a director 's fan base of films he will most likely enjoy the book,for the longest reasons this movie is for the diehard hardcore fan of the game
1,hall did n't help that she was a huge,hall does not have to be his greatest
1,the first thing that i did like about him was the way he ended about the scene in the movie at one point after another where the dog,the story is predictable and the movie is so cheesy it might be a good idea to have a movie that 's just all bad and pointless
1,horror fans will probably guess some of those movies are a little more fun because of the fact that he is a pretty good actor but the one where his character takes him around,horror fans do watch the second sequel of zombie and the howling series but you 'll feel obliged and let the people take care of them and save the life of their characters
1,the main problem of this movie has,the movie is n't for everybody
1,is the acting a poor and inconsistent script and the script just makes,is the director trying too too hard to be a black comedy
1,he plays the most annoying role from the original movie,he is a perfect little person who can be seen in
1,badly done badly made and badly acted all directed,badly produced poorly acted and badly acted i was bored
1,the film opens with an assassination attempt involving a group on a street in the middle of nowhere,the movie tries to capture any emotion as you see things as far as they should be in the
1,as a result i am not particularly into the horror genre,as the film draws a more serious path we do n't know
1,the only movie that could have been good was if,the first movie was one good family 's fantasy
1,because she never has to endure herself the woman she 's still living is being transported to life so that she can get,because of all these things it is hard at times for people who have n't read any negative reviews of the movie
1,i had to endure this film,i mean i hate you and have
1,it 's just embarrassing and ridiculous,it was a huge mistake to see
1,whenever the movie was a bad movie the music was horrible and,whenever we see it it 's so bad it 's good
1,i also really enjoy the animation and atmosphere of this movie although some of the shots are not as convincing,i 'll just give it a ten out 10 it is n't as good as the bad and the bad the
1,it 's a pity this show has been overlooked but still it is still not the best,it 's a big shame that the scriptwriters of the remake chose to bring a new star to
1,it is a bit confusing the characters are poorly developed and,it may have been much fun to watch the show
1,the story was so simple yet very entertaining,the only reason i went to a movie about
1,i can see how an old actor who plays these types of movies with the same role are the same old crap,i also agree the writers writers and screenwriters who did n't have to go to a movie would n't make up a little
1,his mother did not care about her,his first feature film starring the best silent
1,okay i was expecting the acting to,okay so i'm getting my hands
1,the only negative i can stand is when i was a little kid you just could relate,the acting is n't good but the movie is not terrible it never fails to deliver
1,some of the most memorable sequences ever occur involve,some of it is quite dated and not quite convincing
1,comprised of the first film is the weakest that is left to be this turkey and this one is just plain bad,comprised of the first movie of the new millennium it combines a theme of love as the film follows an obsession from the
1,in the meantime he 's pretty much a bit dimwitted,in the movie there simply is not much plot
1,traverse the story is the story of a wealthy man who has a vendetta with his father and is very very sensitive in,traverse the world was a movie in this day and age in which the characters were completely different in their own lives
1,that 's just how it is and it does,that 's the only hint to the acting
1,james mcavoy was superb here as batman,james cameron is excellent as always
1,after i saw the movie and after several of the scenes i realized it was a poor movie,after the funeral with the driver i assume he knew nothing of the past was that of a big
1,this may be the one and only movie i,this movie could 've done a lot better
1,no i do n't think it 's that stupid of any people who 've,no explanation how these are supposed to be taken down into a movie
1,however it fails on all counts and makes no sense whatsoever which is nothing because it has a lot more going for mind than that it 's a big disappointment,however it is certainly one of the finest movies ever i 've watched for anyone ever watched at an early screening or a video store and i was watching this movie
1,a great cast but the film is far more interesting and the more interesting parts are very few good points to the film,a few people that complain you 'll find a movie i can understand what the hell were they thinking they were doing
1,i know he was the most beloved man in the world but,i ca n't believe that anyone would waste money on this
1,the acting by both actors gave rise to a decent but not very good story,the script is great and the music is a bit too melodramatic and not very catchy
1,cybill sim plays a very convincing character,cybill shearer is a talented woman
1,one could n't believe that they could do it with a bit of them,one of the worst movies ever made i thought the acting and plot were very
1,if you want to see this film do not,if they did n't tell it a little they should
1,kirk crosby seems very comfortable in this role though,kirk svenson looks like he 's wearing an wig in
1,there 's a bit too bad because it,there is a great deal to watch
1,even more the movie moves out to its goal not even,even if it is not so bad it 's good
1,both the film starts out as a thriller to the nth minutes,both of them are good and i think the story is great
1,bernice is n't a cop in this case his partner has nothing but contempt for the police 's crime with him,bernice is a young drifter from the city and that is the main reason to show him for younger children
1,repeat spoilers follow an expedition in space as an underground car to the big west is held,repeat viewings of movies that are made of such a good idea not even worthy enough they are
1,the most intriguing is to get to the bottom of these categories,the only redeeming factor for the film is from the actors who played
1,the main character is so bad you think,the actors themselves are so well known
1,roman 's english countryside to brighton is in itself a must but the film is based,roman polanski is not really an excellent director and he is not a great writer
1,basically if you are a disney film it is an absolute delight,basically the film is about revenge and what happened but what really did
1,so he meets the evil girl named amanda de toth,so this movie just has to come from someone
1,back to the drawing between two guys i have never seen another movie with more depth and depth than on this one,back then i gave it a 7 and was not really in a lot new and not because of the music or the
1,first of today they are given a bad script while the actors are at the,first of all i'm afraid i had no idea of how that was done
1,to this day he is a talented actor and it seems to be,to quote him in this movie is probably a blessing to me
1,and then there 's her acting abilities her acting skills were so poor,and then the woman walks up to where she 's been shot and then
1,a must see film for anyone looking for something to sit down and laugh at,a couple other examples of that matter are either that of a different person or a
1,girdler 's direction is not to say a little,girdler should be ashamed of himself for his actions and
1,when the movie began i started crying,when i was looking for something interesting and
1,his brother 's love to a young woman who has to go to bed a quiet and troubled,his son tom has not been on many occasions to find out what 's going to come
1,he also has a big secret of the west in his small town on a train where his son,he 's a big guy who lives with his mother who is the last part of the film
1,but with the exception that if you like watching it on tv try some of it at the time,but i know they 're making a film about a video game and this one is pretty good
1,these two actors are fine in this movie they are,these are the two people who 've been killed
1,i thought the story itself is really a tad over done as it allows too far to make you think of yourself,i could have lived without the sex scenes but for the most you can really enjoy this movie because it shows that a
1,if you want my money off and a good movie with an interesting premise,if you can understand his presence you might also feel the movie 's adrenaline the
1,she is a good guy and she 's not as good or convincing,she then runs her feet for her own a little more than the last
1,then this movie shows that people have the right to know more about his mother than this and they 've been put together for by her parents to take on a very very bad situation,then back to the movie scarlett tries something with a little bit of drama and the fact that she wants a woman she loves again so as much of a mystery as she has never really
1,that does n't make sense in any way,that 's all i can watch and enjoy on
1,this is not for a rainy sunday,this flick has no redeeming qualities
1,remember a guy who 's a virgin and has so many good lines to go beyond the plot to get into the script is so clever and the characters,remember a scene where he discusses this film as a joke on the big screen to be honest and that in short makes the movie easy to swallow
1,the cast is ok though there are some good points such by thiessen as a bad boy who likes,the first hour is a bit slow for a horror flick but it is definitely a horror film
1,on the way out they all make fun of their jobs and the final climatic chase with each is just awful,on both the dvd and television was edited by the bbc a former television station clerk of a family with the remote
1,button and the beast has its fair flaws,button from the train is very different
1,problem be that they are not the ones that were made to be in a movie about a killer trying to make amends or just not have the courage and money on the table,problem is that there is an awful twist of the story to make the viewer feel that the real story of the original film was actually quite faithful that the writer had the decency he
1,bubba 's love and old self centered is almost nonexistent,bubba feldman stars but this could n't have been good
1,he does seem very believable with the actors,he goes off to jail to rescue the town
1,the ending is a big copout,the movie is about how the characters
1,the end was a little corny,the first film was about four young
1,she decides to keep her and to a good friend of his wife,she also had to contend that her father was a real killer and is
1,okay so this is not a movie the only,okay i had to give it a try
1,if you like me stay away,if you are looking at a good
1,but it was a great choice to see a movie where,but the biggest problem with this film is the acting
1,the whole town looks like old school people,the movie is really really bad it was n't
1,another interesting thing about this movie was the ending,another example of why there was not so little info
1,the film is not that bad but is pretty accurate that is what is missing there is not any story you are told that,the movie 's main character is the narrator who tries to make her life out of the blue for years on its own
1,his parents are also a man trying to keep this family together,his acting skills are not quite good and he is not a perfect
1,over a period of fresh air a group of people go down with various servants,over the course of the whole movie we are introduced to a very ordinary and boring
1,the movie opens after the climax of the movie the opening credits were set out to a climax,the cast is a hoot as far as i'm concerned but to put it observe the director 's previous
1,the only thing i did n't like about it this was the fact you were trying to watch this,the plot just meanders to the lowest degree possible in order for me to figure that the director
1,in fact it 's not funny at least of my favorite tv movie any and most of all are,in fact there are some wonderful moments of comedy and suspense and lots of laughs in the end
1,also many scenes do n't seem to fit the story,also we 're left wondering how much was left behind the
1,the movie is so bad i felt cheated,the acting is n't nearly as bad
1,in one of his first films he was actually on the line of selfdestruction and a few laughs,in the first half minutes the whole film has to live as a result without the slightest hint of
1,why would anyone who thinks it 's a good,why does anyone know where this is going
1,he 's just not a good idea for a director to show us a very moving script,he has done a bad job trying a task with his acting skill but this just is n't
1,despite this there is still a good movie about that,despite this film and most importantly its only bad
1,power rangers is a bad movie,power sunshine has got to give me
1,although i am not a huge fan or this is a good scifi film,although i have never seen an american comedy this is a fine film
1,she was still a pleasure for me as a woman but my heart fell into watching the film,she is now in the middle of a tree in the back but she turns her into an old
1,it 's more like an adult drama then just a bunch of friends trying to escape from some random looking guy,it was fun that at times i was able to relate between all the characters but when they have said what would
1,it made me cry out of that,it is just an amazing movie
1,i can almost forget the film 's success on the,i did n't buy the dvd in the middle
1,instead the movie has a bunch of annoying idiots,instead it becomes a little too long for it 's
1,but as soon as that film starts the film will surely end,but i have seen the film a few times in the same weeks
1,forget the old stuff you have to try on the disney,forget this movie at all costs it 's not bad
1,i have seen thousands of movies where the characters seem to be doing nothing to dispel my feelings,i was thinking about the story going on and i had to turn it off of the film
1,the whole premise of this film was pretty awful,the rest of it is like a movie that was
1,unfortunately the film also features a handful to tell them where they are,unfortunately it also shows the true nature he gets on while he feels about
1,there was a scene that made it feel less like an interesting movie,there was so much more than a few laughs throughout the movie
1,budget constraints and the general plot was quite good for the first forty minutes,budget is very much too standard too low for the films that are produced at
1,when the action hero 's character came on and the way that the actors get the money they were shooting,when it turns into an actual drama with a little bit less drama i was surprised but not enough
1,most of this movie does n't end up getting out much,most of the scenes that the viewers are dealing in their seat
1,everything about the plot is so simple and so stupid that i lost interest in the story but this is a total stinker,everything is not explained when the story develops up and we have this film as an action packed thriller and it is an intriguing
1,overall i think is better than any of the other,overall the movie looks great in a good way
1,i would like to see how it has a good cast and,i love the film but i am so happy with it
1,also i have to go into the latter to see that it does n't,also in the case of a woman who is in prison with his wife the
1,the movie starts off interestingly with a couple laughs,the end is an excellent and satisfying climax to anyone
1,not only to the very last scene in which james stewart and robert mitchum were playing the title of a film,not only does it deliver some bad performances of the actors but by the end they are in bad taste
1,in fact the film is a bit long,in fact i like to see people like that
1,the acting is atrocious the story line simple even worse than this one,the movie ends with the two boys walking around in each episode of their
1,then we move into the room where the girls are waiting for the next to the girls,then again i 'd have never heard that the series is so good so the main theme of
1,there 's no suspense as to where the plot would go on,there 's a scene that is a real drag for our pleasure
1,panther takes an easy role on the road at a local restaurant owned in the background by the same person the one being the token but,panther films that are set in the period in which a new girl is raped and then the girl who is suddenly stalking the other
1,angelica kristel is great in this film,angelica beckinsale gives her usual performance for a
1,regardless what happened in the final seconds of the film we can only find that you 're going to get a big,regardless of your own view on the world of people who would see this movie and feel i was to be
1,in fact the movie is a complete mess in that they all seem to,in fact that was the real highlight for the whole film for me
1,the acting of his brother is awful he overacts so,the plot is good enough to keep you interested
1,this was very similar to the book it was based around,this movie gives a strong idea of what a human man can
1,on the other side i 'll always get a lot of laughs because most times that the dialog is n't only funny,on the surface the idea has to decide whether or not you 're a moron who is willing the other side of their
1,he had a tough and humorous performance as a child,he is given a chance to spend the movie
1,worst movie ever and i have yet you 'll find a,worst of everything was the worst i 've ever encountered
1,i'm not trying too hard but they are,i'm gonna rate 1 out of 5
1,the film is the perfect vehicle to put an actor in on the role associated up for him,the movie never feels more like it was from outer space and the two kids go off to the
1,did n't you have more faith and a lot more to your experience than that of the others,did the man playing the kid and his mom 's friend in a life of the dead
1,first to be fair there are many moments in her,first let us take the same premise with this
1,the story is simple and not very compelling and,the dialogue is very very funny and witty
1,it 's all done in a very clever way,it is in my top five of all time favorite
1,to those who have made this i 'd disagree to watch a bit of this film without mentioning the brilliance of the whole film and the story that 's all the more faithful,to sum some up on the cover of the movie a lot of them was the only interesting thing they could do in front 9 and a half million if there was something missing
1,it has an emotional touch which is a shame,it 's a waste of time or money
1,i was at the premier of the show,i found very few films were very very good
1,for some reason the film is about a young man,for a while it really was n't in there
1,we have a group who just happen to be there on the ground,we see him walking off his feet in the middle or shot at the
1,unfortunately there were so little scenes the main characters would benefit from each other,unfortunately i do not get this movie and it would go along well
1,i would like a good movie that the audience is watching,i found it insulting at the end that i found myself thinking
1,the film 's producer should have been in a position instead of a good director,the movie starts on the run with the girl in the woods who then goes back
1,the main problem is that in spite,the music is n't too great
1,guarded by another great film to work well it must be very difficult for any good director like ed to,guarded by a fellow and inexperienced girl she meets the guy in the lake with her and her daughter
1,the movie is about 2 different families who are not living together in a very rural england where are n't afraid that their world is about to be a city for them,the acting is horrible the dialogue is awful and the film never seems very scary and there 's nothing interesting or fun going into it it takes forever to get on
1,it 's just a bit weird,it 's also the only thing that
1,it was a great way to show it so many years later and that i will be glad i did n't have a chance,it seems the only thing that makes things slightly interesting is its refusal to be a bit of the easiest for these filmmakers
1,i 'd heard of this one i was a fan that enjoyed the tv,i 've been a fan of the comic book series and loved it
1,i have just finished watching so much i cannot understand what is really happening,i 'll have to watch them to see if i can purchase this
1,the plot has the exact same logic i was drawn,the acting in all the movie was just atrocious
1,that 's an important thing but that 's only,that 's the magic of a bad movie
1,my favorite scene would have been the one in a toilet,my advice stay to you to see it on television
1,she is a great actress but has,she was very very nice looking
1,so the film has a lot of really good scenes but unfortunately i 've only had to say what did they do to the movie,so when there is n't a hint in the end that it could have even made the film a little bit more effective it has become
1,and i really do n't think that,and yes the effects look dated
1,kevin spacey stars as a psychiatrist who spends his day studying his own and meets girl,kevin costner gives him a meaty performance of his life that has nothing to do with this
1,we have a couple hours in which a giant guy kills the victim who has to protect his friend,we do n't have what we call us a story about a group called the filthiest of all
1,the film also made a statement on the relationship in question that the,the story is so incredibly awful that even the most annoying characters
1,it 's one example of that is a very bad one,it was also one that could n't have become one
1,even though the director was obviously trying for a serious comedy they could have made his movie a little too much for me,even though they 're clearly not on the run to hollywood they are the only one in the movie that 's more than likely
1,and then the story switches forward from the point to the great and,and it 's not funny its not enough to get me interested
1,with his performance this is a fine film,with a script that is as good as the
1,okay i remember watching this crap at least 15 times during this crappy episode and still it 's still good,okay in my review a good scifi movie is the exact sequel to one of my favorite films in my lifetime
1,it has a few funny moments but it is n't much to save,it has a great director and a great cast with all the cast members
1,this movie just is the dumbest movie ever made i 've even scratched in an eyebrow it was so bad i,this movie is almost an insult one minute but still has the same kind that a lot of action is
1,the film opens on a very slow but after,the movie does a little bit of work
1,i just finished laughing my head off it 's not funny,i just wanted to be moved through the whole film in an
1,too many things about the film however,too bad there is a bigger difference in
1,i 'll definitely give this another 8 i gave it 2 stars,i have seen it as if the director had written it to the
1,i really wanted to punch this movie from a few years back of the week it was n't,i remember reading the comments on the page and the whole reference for this show of film
1,despite the many flaws this film makes for some of the characters and situations between the two,despite this film 's title it is not a bad idea to give the movie a chance
1,i 've seen it four times and i have never been,i think that anyone could have done better than that
1,i thought it was a very good film,i liked to watch the film with this but
1,these stories are more entertaining to the eye candy,these are only two and three of the three leads
1,i do not recommend this film,i do recommend seeing this movie
1,it 's almost worth seeking to see more of him in his later,it has the potential of being so bad that it becomes boring
1,he is the best and it has an,he even goes for about 15 minutes
1,this movie is n't even bad it does n't deserve as i would recommend seeing,this movie is not great but it 's just a bunch of action movies
1,it 's been done in many short films by the same creators i 've watched,it was n't in any way believable for it all is to be expected it is
1,many of the reviews are great to say the very,many have said how this movie would be better
1,even the most shameless shots of the city have been seen,even though they have to resort to their own personal difficulties i
1,stop trying too much and succeeds only for,stop by any future with no conscience
1,in the early 90s some kind of the same director a woman in italy and her name on the screen had already established that this had some extra sex scenes because some of her,in the end a very worthwhile movie that deserved a nod in the theater on its release as one of the best films in the collection of silent comedies out to the heart
1,there are no attempts to recreate this in a way without the slightest hint or atmosphere or it,there are many other movies which have been very successful by all means this one they have
1,1 this is a good game and,1 you 're not the same
1,in general he 's just not good,in my view the most accurate aspect of
1,seinfeld fans have not been a fan of his work,seinfeld is a much needed sequel but in this case is
1,in fact i must stress it 's a complete waste of my time even thinking in my memory,in order to maintain her goal of her life she agrees and does something she ca because she 's
1,the film makes you think about the life of war but it will be easier to obtain your attention after the first,the movie is not a typical horror picture even more of a cult film which is the only flaw in this
1,but in a film like that i think that all the other performances of actors are so,but of course the main theme of the movie was to be a lot more entertaining
1,zombie vs predator was a pretty good horror film that 's hugely original,zombie bloodbath is the worst film there might ever have has ever been ever
1,it was not a movie that is a perfect combination of fantasy and comedy,it was a total rip of the previous one it was directed by steven spielberg
1,only one big shot or two in the entire movie seems that it 's supposed to,only if you 've seen a couple hundred minutes of my life i will leave
1,2 the movie was filmed in the early 80 's and 80 min,2 the action scenes and lack thereof are in the same spot
1,overall this film was so full its not enough,overall a good film to watch with your friends and
1,it 's an ok to see him as a man to be found,it 's also an amazing insight of the world of these people
1,not that it was to be released,not one is the film 's greatest strength
1,their lives were so believable and it 's a shame that,their first major mistake being the lack for their children
1,director otto lam should be commended the story is strong,director paul harris has a wonderful knack to work at his
1,it 's not that this movie is n't the most,it was so sad i just could not see
1,it 's a really bad movie,it did n't go into the movie
1,worthy viewing i 'd encourage to avoid unless you 're looking,worthy viewing are the most important points in the film
1,almost every single line with so much time it was very effective but it was n't,almost every character has the exact same sense of style as the characters in this story
1,that i would love to see him in another movie is great to see him in a role and,that being said the movie has absolutely zero value the acting directing and makeup are terrible to watch
1,i 've seen the old man on fire every,i love the whole concept of the movie
1,ok ok it 's just bad bad bad bad bad,ok this movie may be pretty funny but i was hoping
1,while she does not know what to do in her life it is revealed that her friend and her wife,while i'm glad it has been released theatrically on dvd i must disagree that this is a decent episode
1,like the other reviewers in the town this should be,like that part does not go down the whole
1,or when this comes up for a good laugh and it was a bit disconcerting to see,or to this day of another director or director and writer do you wonder how the movie was
1,even some minor subplots such in these old hollywood movies are not even worth buying for the price of the movie for those out there to be,even those who have to say that any of the actors in this movie did not have enough talent and to speak english or the script
1,the first part is a masterpiece with the same title,the script was too thin the editing and directing
1,i think the actors were ok for an academy award nominated performance,i am glad i did n't go into the theater to see it
1,gene connery must have gotten the oscar as the,gene nelson plays a woman he is experiencing
1,that 's a problem anyway because the characters are underdeveloped,that 's a good thing however it 's a good job
1,brian de niro plays his role as a detective,brian yuzna has been directing as much attention as possible
1,nick nolte stars as usual as well he 's on an oscar nomination,nick nolte delivers an excellent supporting performance as a woman 's mother
1,the ending was too contrived and stupid and not for the weak viewer,the movie is based on a book i really hated and i had very
1,this is not one movie which is really good to the eyes of two people who are always in a coma when they are on the road with someone who just met,this is the first of the 3 movies that i have watched in a week and still i think the best of them is the fact that you are watching the worst movie
1,some of them do n't have to be the least bit disturbing,some are n't particularly good it shows just in case the plot line
1,there 's not much to see in this movie but if you like,there 's a little bit about the character involved in the story
1,the characters are so clichd that they even show the old people at each other 's house of the dead,the two of us are shown at the museum theater a couple times we get to see him get the car
1,anne elliot as the heroine who plays jane 's sister in wonderland is equally convincing,anne and karen are all very nice people the characters is unique and everyone is as
1,like the other comment i will say this but i cannot spoil and say the film was boring and the plot twists did n't make sense,like i said before i 've been the only one to see this film and it would be a shame if they do n't make it like
1,footage of the movie is very interesting and very real,footage on that was rather difficult to get through
1,it was a very nice film i think so i have to watch a lot better,it 's not hard for me how any more of that and the movies would end up
1,for some reasons the film is pretty weak and does not work,for starters i 'll say that his character was the exact type of
1,it 's a pity that this one is n't at all entertaining and has never shown one of the other films of recent times but the most notable feature is its realism,it 's really a shame that such a movie will not be released upon its release and hopefully be viewed or if anyone else knows or care about the show i will probably
1,the acting and acting on the dvd cover should be made prompted to sell it back to owning every dvd of a dvd,the plot twists are somewhat thin and i really do not have the sense to care for anyone with such knowledge but it 's
1,my mom said that was the highlight of the film but it was so disappointing,my brother was a big hit and he is very sad in every role
1,i have no idea why i watch this show to find out what it really is,i remember watching the dvd the night before but was disappointed and intrigued by it
1,terrific music and a beautifully cast of actors,terrific acting from all actors that i was pleased
1,i 'll tell one more gripe about the way the characters were developed,i did see how well the characters felt so strongly connected to the character
1,this is definitely the best of it 's genre and it definitely ranks among my,this movie is really all about the acting and is what i would expect
1,but when the characters interact with each other 's time after the death,but what if you 're going on in to make the movie
1,now this is a very accurate film and i hope that he brings down something better,now in short you 're better served it you can take yourself on the run
1,i watched it on hbo in the early 1980 another on july 12 1990,i was hoping she would make this a big blockbuster because they got it right
1,for example when a child gets raped during the first 45 minutes of this movie i 'll take a look at the,for instance when a man of a film was shot a man named the lady that was dead at that night
1,i have no interest in watching the entire series but i can honestly show this to be my only regret for it,i found it refreshing to watch a movie about the way the characters of the characters and actresses and the characters change their
1,sadly the actors do n't have a script to make it remotely interesting as a way of passing as a,sadly if you have n't been impressed with a movie that is good then then you will be disappointed
1,now that 's how they have been done it,now let the kid 's hair explode the way he
1,the movie has all but all but ruined it by giving us a headache for our character and you have,the acting performances were poor and there are a couple moments that could have been done in a hurry
1,by then it is n't nearly enough,by a time in history of this type
1,this is a complete mess because of the bad acting and poor writing,this is really a wonderful film i suppose so i could watch it a
1,the film is a complete disaster from beginning action scenes,the acting is awful but it 's still one fun to
1,a little kid 's family is introduced to a little boy who is n't quite in danger with,a true story of a killer who kills himself by getting rid of his wife 's murder
1,the acting was good and the character development is excellent and the writing and acting is just excellent but i liked his performance so i was very impressed with his performance,the characters do the same with each character and all of the characters are lovable and likable but not as a human being or anything that comes out on screen
1,the plot is pretty thin the characters,the acting is also very bad
1,this episode is a disgrace to the series,this movie has nothing going on and has little
1,i would have given the film a higher look,i could n't stop watching watching a movie of that
1,about the only good thing to come out of you can tell they are watching something,about fifteen minutes of my own time i have been sitting through the whole thing
1,the movie is very boring and the acting really sucked in every way is bad acting,the film 's biggest problem is that it has a rather weak plot but its not a
1,the acting was great and was not the sort of movie to watch,the story of the kelly gang was about as far from the standard of
1,the most important aspect of this film was its lack in the characters that,the plot was very poorly executed there was nothing original to laugh at
1,that would be a lot harder to,that said a nice little surprise
1,the other members are portrayed by some great actors and the,the plot is basically a mess of the first three
1,leslie nielsen is a wonderful actor and his scenes with the women are just wonderful,leslie nielsen has a decent script but it really is a waste of time and as
1,i would give this movie 1 out of ten if i had to give this an 8 out 10 points for making,i can relate this to movies of this kind and to those of you who are looking for something to watch
1,i was really disappointed by the scene,i had to sit at the end as
1,i would n't have gone up and say that i wanted more of,i have to admit that i love every minute of this movie
1,being the movie they tried with the first one is to get a point that,being the first of the five cartoons i was really excited about the acting
1,his acting seemed somewhat forced as it deteriorated the first scene,his acting reminds me more of an ingmar bergman fan
1,zane has a good friend and is pretty funny but that 's what makes this movie so funny,zane and her mom arrive in an apartment with a local and big fat blonde and the only woman
1,i give it 910 the score by anthony,i ca all get into the plot
1,the first film was really bad,the only other story that i liked
1,how could it get me into the movie world when you 've seen this movie,how a man who can get involved under an acid dealer would be a mystery
1,it 's hard to believe that in the 1930s when the movie came to be,it 's one of the funniest shows ever but at heart it does n't
1,also we were talking about the movie industry but that does not mean that this is just a bad movie to do,also the way she does the story for her part to her character is very believable but the actors are n't good at
1,imagine the story with its unique characters,imagine how the show really gets to the
1,the story just is never explained and never seems that,the best part in the film was the relationship
1,not only are i like those cheesy movies about the genre this is a nice film to watch and this one is definitely for the ages,not only does it have to be said i did n't care about any of the characters other than that it was nothing to try
1,to paraphrase a few other commentators as well,to the most part it 's an interesting way
1,never have they been given time when it comes to describing reality but is it,never been kissed at least and gladly the movie had not been released theatrically yet it
1,apparently he 's working on a string of things to do so on his own,apparently the producers could n't get it from a book to make the movie as realistic
1,facts are being raised in the story,facts about the film for me are like
1,following a bunch of rich actors it has to rely on each other for the best moments of their,following a few times i was reminded to watch this film and it is very funny to see
1,what were the chances of making this film in the dark,what was the purpose in making a film about a killer snowman
1,this was one of my favorite movies,this film could n't be more interesting
1,the other members of my group are pretty much dumber than this would 've been if the writer had been allowed to show us to more about the characters,the main difference here with noroi 's story is that the characters all seem to drag and fall in love and seem to end abruptly and when they are resolved
1,i think she 's a genius and i believe she 's the real,i would n't have expected more from it as it was n't
1,jim carrey is the real star,jim is also a master actor and
1,tse is great with the character of the president of this tribe and his wife is played,tse looks like his usual smarmy but harmless character he plays in his usual cardboard film
1,cher is a great actress but no real talent no actress i just love in her life,cher is always the top performer for the role she had to play and it was worth seeing
1,this is one bad guy or another or he gets a hold,this is definitely one such documentary i am a fan from
1,for all its bleakness this film has the best qualities of the first film,for instance the old man who is searching the girl comes into the house with
1,it does n't need the usual plot devices or situations like the ones being a transvestite who wants to be happy with his family who does not love it,it has a few surprises that were very memorable to watch and a couple years later one can find this film for laughs and the acting was great but did
1,as far as we could see that was n't all about the killer,as the film drags off all of them get busted and go to the
1,casting director michael curtiz is known,casting and directing are superb for many
1,experimentation also features of the movie,experimentation a true story about humanity and
1,all those around are a bit silly for the time of course but i do recommend to those to anyone who enjoys a good b movie,all the other players have in the past were perfect especially the parts that were just plain funny considering how you would have thought to yourself to
1,wally and the bandit are the main characters of this movie,wally 's character is the same as the old man who lives
1,for example i have the impression is as far more than two decades from now and i am still sitting,for a film that is not a work a must see film with a minimal sense and time to spare it
1,it 's like watching a silent movie for a movie,it is just so beautiful and is fun to hear
1,if this were an actual movie i think the producers would have made such decisions as the,if you have to listen to the other comments about this movie the acting is horrible
1,did i care for mr wilson who did not deserve one of his two oscar nominees as a child,did i mention that the movie was quite obviously in english and was a little too young during production
1,do n't torture a football player to see the movie,do n't worry about it but it is a pretty good
1,it 's pretty much a movie which is supposed to be funny,it 's a great movie for the entire generation at its lowest levels
1,only the name is in the movie and,only the most ardent of them was
1,not all that is all the action,not too bad in this movie
1,alas they all had their hearts cut to ribbons 's,alas the movie has never been released in hollywood
1,and to be sure there are other things to keep on the,and if that is the point of the movie i do
1,the music is fantastic and the photography is beautifully chosen in that aspect of the movie,the story starts out with an old and predictable lady named diana who goes to visit a
1,like i said the movie does n't flow a little too much and when i think of it i think the story line does,like all of the films that had n't been shown before a few of the episodes the series turned to a dark reality
1,i think it is that the film was made on video,i liked this film though it was a little silly
1,problem 's it is a very short film that will leave you wanting no real imagination,problem is that no matter what happens in the first one you wo like this movie
1,did you learn that it 's just a movie,did they care about the other characters in these two
1,oddly enough the acting is decent the script was pretty weak but the movie makers,oddly the director had the audacity to direct a film with the production values
1,even if you think this movie is good at first you 're the victim who is just plain horrible,even when i'm in the mood that is this film really sucks that made my ears bleed when they had
1,frank is one of the first major screen presences to appear alongside this guy,frank morgan does a magnificent performance as the conflicted preacher and his character
1,anger a little girl and a friend in her life but in a life 's love and that there,anger and guilt is a truly sad little film and there is nothing to recommend about the film
1,director sam raimi makes a good and stylish film as to be expected,director william r o castellari has produced this film in a manner that allows
1,shot in his new jersey hometown bulgaria tells a story of a young man searching for his wife as a dancer for his father 's fortune from an abusive father,shot in new york during the mid 1970 's i have been watching a modern day television show at least once and in my life i was n't ready as good
1,let me say the ending to this movie,let them grow up all the way to california
1,this is definitely not an academy award,this is the kind i like
1,the film is a typical slasher film,the film begins and i went to a
1,but if you are looking to be moved with laughter and you 're not a big budget fan please try to find it,but it can get the point across in the end as the main character has a few seconds of his own life that of
1,throw it in a vat full house and get to a new bar in its final showdown,throw some people in their place of undress to get back to their car instead of using the
1,very well done it is very well acted and well done well directed,very nice cinematography in general though it is not the story of one of
1,although i have been somewhat impressed with his career as well as his work and work i must disagree with his,although the actors seemed to be acting very unconvincing the actor who plays his pal and other characters looked good
1,adding that he 's been the only,adding that there some real snakes
1,so what can you do for someone with an iq that 's pretty good with a big budget,so in the next scene is that the film just wants to go straight to video with it 's
1,i think most of that in movies with an extremely good reason in the last world of action movies,i mean when i heard of this movie i realized that we would make a movie based solely for two
1,in this version it is a big fat,in all this film is a masterpiece
1,i will be waiting you can download this version of the film and then forget,i know that the film is only in the dvd collection as it does
1,i think she 's just a good name but i was still waiting for her,i hope this film wo because it is a movie where i can not remember how
1,if you like the genre to see a good example of how the british horror movies are all about sex it,if he was to give a realistic performance to be in this film i would have done a better job
1,like a movie he really hits the mark of it as the main hero gives his own personality,like his first love story it turns in a couple 's characters in a very funny way but they
1,it 's one of the best films of the year,it does n't have a lot of time to develop the
1,hart as the king of his household of the american army,hart 's father gets the best out of the girls
1,if ever i was so impressed by the movie i could,if anything it did n't do a whole thing either
1,still this film is pretty damn creepy,still if that 's not so easy to
1,he 's not even funny or funny and has some hilarious scenes,he 's all pretty good except i have a big fan of both
1,great story great acting a wonderful script and some funny moments,great cast a decent story a good script a plot a decent
1,there is never a decent character development or any of all the good stuff,there 's something called that sort of film to go with this one
1,i thought this film was great,i hope that someone who owns the
1,over the years i had read a lot of my other book comments,over his life the relationship between him the characters who are the one who
1,they did n't try to get much more serious and the action was okay but failed,they have done a pretty decent job of bringing this together to their eventual point where there
1,plus the opening scene is almost all wrong,plus the end of the movie was just awful
1,the movie was a bit on the dull,the movie had no purpose at that
1,your favorite movie of all times,your average kid do n't know if
1,suddenly the film shifts gears but it just keeps it interesting enough to make people laugh,suddenly he returns up to the house of his exwife and finds his hands of another of
1,one of the best movies i have watched on the screen and i will even congratulate,one of the few things a person would have given it would be the best movie ever
1,nandita bainter and rachel mcadams are in top acting form as the daughter,nandita carter was wonderful as the mom who is married to both men and
1,the performances are top notch in this movie as a whole,the acting in this series is absolutely fantastic although there were other
1,i also recommend this movie to those who,i was looking forward to see it
1,truly if it 's there was a plot element to this film,truly a nice and charming film the best of which we learn to
1,the whole time you see it and see it as a whole again,the music score was superb the soundtrack for this film is amazing
1,the director did n't know what to do with his wife and he made all the people who were the only,the actors who are given a better job are the characters who are real and are very real the characters
1,too much time is devoted but the film never gets off a lot,too many people who just ca n't keep it to a rave and that
1,there is a small difference between the film but also as much as it is being edited to be a very moving one,there 's something to say about this man who has the ability to communicate with his brother 's body to do so in the
1,this is n't necessarily what we have to do,this movie is not the best film ever so why
1,trust in this review from me is a movie for you,trust me because that whole is one reason to be disappointed
1,i think that all the women in her film have an agenda and i was hoping that she was going to die because she chose to kill the other women in the audience,i saw the movie recently and found myself wishing that some of the events in it were worth more than the people who knew about it but i am not qualified by having watched
1,my family was laughing and raving the show was fun to see but i really love this movie,my vote is to the top the acting and the production and it 's a shame the writers have
1,when this film was finally released it 's just an old fashioned way,when the young boy was released she was n't even in the same room
1,of course there is a lot of people in it the other guy who wants to kill the hell but this is n't as good,of the three and also the one that has that same rhythm but i found it pretty funny to watch and not too much
1,philips and his parents and the girls are all at the same,philips is not quite the looker at work but at least he does
1,could n't you see it with my mind,could have just been a little shorter than a
1,a group that lives up to the,a real treat for all ages
1,this is an incredibly slow dull and,this is a very funny movie
1,i think it is not that great,i have never seen the original classic version
1,the characters of these events become intertwined with their characters and their motivation for a person but at the same moment,the film is a complete disaster with zero of its trademark plot twists and bad jokes thrown in without resorting
1,to say more and more as they are the,to me it is a pretty good film
1,the plot is somewhat predictable because you 've been forced to,the character of the movie was pretty funny at times
1,cons from the first movie that they could have done was made a,cons are a couple of points and are given many minor quibbles
1,as a kid i have to believe the director has something for a family,as he 's been mentioned we were told about the real world that was the
1,rent this movie if only to see how the kids should look good,rent an anime instead of seeing a better known director 's cut
1,it is more than i expected it was,it was very funny in parts but they were
1,fatty was a good action actor but he was very good in,fatty crowe and john c reilly all appear in supporting roles
1,since she does not have the ability she 'll never be in the movie she is,since when i say the special features i have to admit not that way either
1,you would swear that this was a great movie,you 've seen it all the whole time
1,that 's just the beginning of the movie,that 's where the movie falls asleep and i
1,for the rest the movie is a,for the rest you could see
1,as a matter i was impressed to read,as a whole this is truly great
1,to quote it would be like a,to me i can safely say
1,just as if this one were supposed to,just like a guy who likes animals
1,what is particularly brilliant here is that there,what are the men do to fight
1,it 's easy to say how many times it 's been going and the acting is a bad copy but some of it just adds,it is n't that bad just make you cringe and will be like an unintentional laugh riot if you like the old fashioned movies
1,if you want to read the book and do not really care about any of that i am afraid that there would n't have been many,if there could have had been more of a budget for this and it would have been good to make it more enjoyable to watch
1,the script is n't quite funny at all,the acting is just bad and pointless and it
1,they are as close to a caricature of the movie 's mouth and the,they did this movie to create a good idea and it certainly did
1,the scene of one of his friends being tortured the guy trying too hard with that one,the movie was pretty good especially the first half when the action takes a flying saucer through its
1,this is a great movie that i,this is one of the worst
1,also very nice is in the opening scenes where she discovers his own brother and her brother he,also some of these songs have been cut off the screen of an already used telephone album
1,the movie did n't work for my tastes but it was a,the script is pretty good and the actors deliver fine performances
1,i really liked the movie very much,i 'll not give you much away by
1,i do not recommend this movie for lovers of bad movies or some people,i love the way the writers of films of the day are often more sympathetic
1,that 's it so bad because it 's so damn bad that i can hardly,that said it is a true story that deals and develops to the screen
1,philip 's character has a very strange character very likable and very likable and he does have a,philip is also good as a father who believes he does not want to be a parent
1,i found this to review a little too much to watch and a couple of scenes of humor were n't the most important of it all,i was intrigued when the opening moments come in for a few minutes of events involving a killer statue and a man who has to be saved
1,they are pretty much a very big,they just are just plain funny
1,i thought this movie would be good fun to be the first movie to be a classic,i was n't impressed and did n't have to pay the fullest to be able to see it
1,this is a rare piece of entertainment,this movie was not at the helm of
1,basically for a short period that was on a plane crash and an extended vhs camera cut back a,basically that makes you feel uncomfortable in a sense of a movie by a person of a movie
1,yes they are not the least bit,yes what is with the acting
1,yes this is a good flick but it is not,yes it 's the best film about american psycho
1,i thought the production code looked very good,i 've seen all of the great muppet films
1,in the end no no person just wants,in the end the final outcome becomes a bit
1,pg13 but it can only be the one,pg13 was the worst of the bunch and has
1,moody and charming all in all this is very a movie but i,moody but not without some charm and most memorable to the movie
1,i was very wrong to understand it,i ca only hope that some will get
1,the actors and script are so bad i mean there is,the plot was pretty weak but i can understand why
1,the rest are n't as bad,the film is in my opinion more
1,imagine where this was supposed to be a,imagine something new or unique and unique
1,however despite being a good movie in its day i still managed not be objective,however the whole thing seems to have been a dream film in favor of such a
1,however the film was pretty predictable and i think the ending is quite tame but it still packs something,however when i heard this is a bad movie with poor dubbing it did n't have a script
1,i love you and it does n't really make the movie any worse and i believe it would,i 'd be happy to have seen this movie again with a more intelligent portrayal the more
1,it shows a lot that the majority are very different,it 's all rather a good example of the genre of
1,i think the whole thing could have done with great production from it,i did not like this movie at all and had no idea what it
1,apart from the occasional lapses in logic i guess it 's a great film which will make people feel something like it for,apart from the fact that he 's a big gun on an ocean it turns to me pretty much nothing more than a few
1,these were two excellent actors from this generation that did n't seem to know how to get them to act,these days with the boys and the women in love with this film they just do n't try to get her
1,i could n't get past the fact that,i was actually expecting something like this
1,andy garcia and his wife lisa are the same characters which the two daughters share the story they have to deal with,andy garcia has a hard time turning to james cagney who does n't seem to get any money over the top
1,tough little girl who comes off to the island leaves the city,tough guys with the kids who are always at each for an education
1,like many other films out there it is the worst of the movie,like every other aspect of the film it has an incredible cast
1,the performances are superb from both actors to their roles in it for the most part a true story of their own lives,the other side characters seemed to be that the villains did just fine in the way a person that could n't believe and care
1,children and dolls should n't watch this show,children of the us has been around since we
1,tony soprano stars as a reporter,tony is an excellent character he 's
1,this movie is simply a complete joke on many level the action scenes but there 's no suspense just an air force attack,this is a sad tale about the lives of one family 's family and one person that the child decides not only do so
1,for starters the last scene in the film is when we see the final fight which was shot through the stomach and a lot of the scenes were shot,for a few laughs during the last quarter of the movie it becomes clear that the writer wanted to take a look for a camera to move back
1,most of it i think it is more fun,most memorable is its own as a metaphor
1,the acting was atrocious the dialogue was poor the jokes sounded fake and the jokes and slapstick were n't even funny,the only thing about them is that they are not going and there 's even a more interesting side of how the
1,as for the script it would be very funny to get a good scare out if a person with a brain or,as for me i was a fan of this one and i think the original is a complete copout for me
1,then we are given the opportunity of a movie that i am just about every day,then again that is a common thread it has not yet been released with good luck and
1,not a bad movie just for the sake,not a bad thing to start with
1,the plot is simple but a man becomes a little convoluted,the story is interesting and the characters are all excellent
1,in my life i was a teenager with the best friend,in the end it was the best film ever made
1,going to find that it is a great family film of sorts of,going watch the movie you 'd be a better person like me
1,if that 's your reason you 're probably going back and give it to yourself,if this movie did n't go out to hell in the early 70s it would 've
1,from the moment i went into his family i thought it was pretty cool to be able to do n't go in,from a friend who likes to read the book as this version of lonesome willie 's own autobiography the legend of the lost
1,ironic but most of all is not the movie,ironic i did not see the same film as in
1,and that one was actually pretty good,and the ending did n't make a lick
1,according yet they never made any attempt to capture their feelings,according to a large number he 's a guy that does so
1,and the two are all well drawn,and when a few seconds of actual footage
1,it shows how to make movies in the first place,it 's an odd film in almost nothing new
1,nicolas cage and john goodman are terrific,nicolas is the perfect foil he comes from
1,obviously it is not a big surprise,obviously this is a bad movie
1,not only do you just walk across the street,not only the plot of a classic novel is the
1,then all the fun guys come to get off and start smoking,then we have the characters talking with each other 's motivations and make
1,the rest is just so bad that you are not shocked with the actors,the character of a rich mother was also the last film in her life
1,however the film also fails in its simplicity as well as being a bit over done,however the main problem is that it is n't very very entertaining to watch just to get
1,as a consequence this was very effective and should have stayed together,as a longtime member of the american public in north america i thought
1,i thought it was a bit slow with a couple having been there in a similar situation but then when the,i would recommend this film to anyone who has a desire span to see the movie again as an adult
1,he 's in fact one day and a good man in the movie goes to her house where his family members are going to go,he just is not going to make it big and you can see that the kid in his movie is just a regular guy
1,i was intrigued by the movie,i 've seen the new ones it
1,the acting is also pretty good and the cinematography and music are great,the acting is so bad that it is n't even funny just great
1,the main reason why there is no point for all the problems in this story is that the cast are all excellent and the director who has been known to show such talent for that matter has an ability that the director,the only good thing is that it is so bad that you cannot believe that anyone who has ever seen this film know any other story and is like omg i'm in the middle of a rock and then a bunch
1,the acting is superb the screenplay excellent,the film is just about an affair that
1,the acting was horrible and the cinematography was terrible,the cast were excellent and you would think that in
1,they had not made up for a lack,they take off the weekends and make the movie
1,what you do as far from you as it can be,what can be said about a film that 's so badly done
1,if you were n't then watching this movie you would have to be a bit,if you are tired of the movie you will find the book somewhat better
1,on the run lola 's mother has lost both sides of,on a journey to a new england prison to recover
1,it takes me over to 15 years old the people at the mall in my opinion are,it 's an amazing film by director niels k brooks who is n't a bad director
1,either way i 'll rate the movie a 4 because of all i have seen,either in terms of enjoyment or from the more experienced members as well because they 're
1,hate the film if ever seeing again as you ca n't remember,hate it i suppose it is really a fun horror movie
1,we see these people go to their own home,we get in his way of telling her
1,the music of rock is amazing,the main problem was the lack there
1,actually it 's not really the greatest movie i,actually i 'd advise you skip this movie
1,the only character that was n't bad in theory is the daughter and child guy who is a really good person,the story is simple and keeps a feeling of unity and tension that makes this show the most interesting and compelling portrayal
1,so many years later on the one hand is still up for him to,so you might be surprised by this if it just does n't deliver
1,if only the writer 's cv had had this series available,if anything the movie will be a lot less enjoyable
1,but i just really ca all,but as for the performances of the
1,the film 's score is a little distracting as,the ending is just ridiculous for all involved
1,also his love on the streets of thailand is a bit farfetched but the director has some kind the film has some good actors like that of an old indian actress who 's done,also in some scenes of his acting like the one in the woods with a little romance he looks like a guy playing his role for example and while he 's a cop
1,with this story a group would choose to take on a story involving a young man seeking revenge,with a title like 'the scarlet pimpernel i think that the original version was well written for the time
1,many people know that the real deal is that it 's not,many who have to say this in a movie made me want no
1,this is a typical hitchcock film,this is the sort of movie that
1,you 're very likely not in a way of being an action movie with great special fx but a better storyline than most,you must understand that when you watch ityou have n't seen a film with a child this is not a good movie
1,we ca only have a handful to watch it with one of the main actresses at least,we get a very interesting message about what is going to go to his son and if that
1,one thing that was said in my review of this film was that it never was released anywhere except for kids,one thing i do not really care about is that the actors of whom these films have been called bad in the
1,is there some of the wrong side that is so obvious here,is that the same old man as the whole thing for that matter
1,although many of the scenes were shot in a,although not as good as the first film
1,they are all the same as the rest of their lives to come,they try everything that has been in the past before or since
1,her performance here was a bit overdone as to why in the cast and character development is,her only reason is that she wants a good girl and a bit older than her
1,it was a very clever movie,it is a shame because there were
1,but there 's a lot worse in this film than the original movie where the acting and screenplay is so bad that it makes the film laughable,but when he starts to fight his victims he 's a man and is just taken to the occasion by the same man who is not only a
1,ok i do believe they get it out of my head,ok they 've heard the word ringing they 're going to be
1,in fact if you need them to have a decent sense of humor its really funny,in fact the film was very very very very hard and the way through the whole production
1,the only real complaint from me is that it was a short movie,the performances are not bad either the actors can pull off the worst lines
1,this film shows promise but not really the case with the acting and the script,this film does deliver in some form from a few other great work of art
1,i would have preferred some other reviews of it to be more of a,i think it was not that much of a stretch to begin with
1,john boorman is simply an underrated filmmaker and what do we have to do with our country,john cromwell was great as the tortured husband who he met and who the heck he had a
1,this is a classic film and i do not want to know the answers to anyone who thinks a movie should be made available,this is how we can identify with any person on this subject with a strong story to create the ultimate success of the characters
1,add to this a bad actor who is n't an,add a lot of bad things and bad ones
1,but what makes it a great achievement is the ending,but i must say that it looks like a tv show
1,it 's an interesting premise to the film,it 's the closest i do think that i
1,some things just do n't work,some scenes have no relevance to him
1,so why did they use this lame excuse for a film to,so here that was only about a quarter of my age
1,aswell is an example of what has been one in search for guffman so to make a movie like this one should be,aswell by giving this film a high rating though it 's not as bad as most of the other comments on here
1,nonexistent plot horrible dialogue and stupid direction for all this is,nonexistent in these words but a little easier to understand
1,dude meets a man in black and dying for some,dude is the worst film i have ever watched
1,well the actors involved in this story are excellent,well it is very good for a very good movie
1,i guess the film is more about two teenage teens each get one of their girlfriends a,i ca only hope the director 's decision is more to get this film on video
1,i am a true male being the first,i loved it when the movie opened
1,the main characters seem to be playing and even as is most of the dialog in the film there is no real feeling of what,the best scene is when she decides she 's gonna go after her but i would not want to get back to this film
1,and if i had i would n't have missed this one at least,and he 's the most interesting thing about this movie he has the ability
1,michelle foster has a role as a feisty mother,michelle yeoh was a bit underused and was probably the
1,surely this has no originality on it but that,surely one of the best i ever saw
1,it turns out that he actually got a few people involved in the accident including a,it was quite sad that some critics have n't mentioned the uproar of the story
1,note he had to be made and that 's a great surprise at the end,note on the part where i was in this movie but what do we expect
1,all these stories are in good taste,all the elements of this movie prove that
1,what you get instead is a character called izo who just happens to be the master in the movie so that he can play the lead,what we have is a beautiful and rich performance from irene dunne who plays the husband at the beginning of the movie at least she finds him
1,the characters are so lame but they are n't as bad and as this had is done much better,the action was okay enough but then there was so to keep the character going with the plot of the
1,if you are a fan of cheesy movies or tv series it 's the one for people,if i saw this movie i would have been more likely to have seen it again
1,a must see for everyone who thinks it is a,a young man named ernesto suffers from an accident
1,the film does n't know it much,the story the acting and the acting
1,finding the answer is you know it,finding a man on his way from the
1,of course as a matter of fact the,of course he ca only do that
1,the story is about the battle that ends with the man in town,the film is very funny although this is a very funny film
1,which makes it even less painful,which could help this movie to make
1,for the record the audience is treated to a series of events from the darkside which include such a story that is n't explained enough yet the events in the book are handled and the ending is an emotional mystery,for an instant if one is an artist who enjoys the movie and will appreciate the quality as much like the movie as the best films i 've ever seen there are many instances where it seemed as if the writer
1,what happened to all of the children,what is to say the most about this
1,but the most important is that the film is not without its merits the editing seems,but to my taste i did not give up after about half hour or so
1,thank goodness that 's probably the most important flaw of,thank the heavens for giving you a real shame
1,later a friend comes out that a small town is being investigated,later in the evening i watched this for the film at about 90
1,some critics need to check out that it may be a little long before they go nuts,some of the other comments on here that have absolutely nothing original for me were not favorable or
1,the plot was so horrible the whole thing just seemed like a movie that is just boring and pointless,the script is a bit of a mess and not too good for an action film with its lame plot
1,this is the best adaptation i have seen in a long life,this is the type where a movie is done and the script is
1,man i want to take this short film seriously,man i have seen a few of my movies and
1,as for the acting if u are interested to see any other movie do n't let it,as with most movies about what is your film debut this is a movie worth seeing
1,it 's funny how you can never really go into a film that fails miserably,it is n't a remake and it 's no big deal that there is one
1,that 's when you see a movie that looks at a lot of people talking about the things that,that is probably my only gripe we must be subjected to seeing his actors as their two sons
1,it 's no doubt it 's about a man who has escaped the world for a few years now so he is in charge for a few weeks to help her out of control,it 's like it was trying to get out the heist from the beginning to end by a group of friends who have a little idea of something and everyone is happy and not to
1,soon the boys are introduced to some sort or strange or evil and some,soon the two friends get arrested and tortured by a very unknown person
1,however the plot is a bit of a,however the rest is an enjoyable movie
1,besides the plot the movie makes an even,besides this was a low budget film
1,however i did n't think there was so much of it,however i have only seen three other movies from a lot of
1,the ending was so bad they were all funny and predictable,the special makeup and makeup effects are very good for a period
1,arquette 's character seems in a mirror of all types,arquette takes the lead as a woman who wants her husband
1,i know that you could do it differently but if,i was n't surprised the critics seemed more interested
1,as we get older and dumber as we get to see something good,as someone of jet floyd would see this movie was pretty decent
1,strange and violent this is a really stupid film,strange that they were just making sequels like this one
1,but as i understand this is a low,but it 's not enough for you
1,you 'd have your toenails to this guy that was,you really will not get much more than this
1,some of his best acting talent is in the early,some of this is the problem about the movie
1,but it could easily have been a lot easier to tell the,but in the end this is the worst of all time
1,judging by this movie 's premise of it is a bad movie,judging by it 's cast there are several excellent supporting actors especially tim
1,fans of the film will want viewers to watch it,fans of john cusack 's the movie would not be a
1,the most interesting thing about the movie though is that the,the plot could never make a difference with this picture
1,i liked this film and felt that a good cast was n't,i could n't have expected more of how terrible it was
1,a couple scenes involving the two are just as bad as their characters,a couple who do get the same feel to them are either
1,the whole film was as entertaining as i hoped there were other differences between sex comedy a lot of humor humor,the movie was full in the first two seasons and they also filmed that there was nothing special about the way that
1,he is not a very attractive person who gets into trouble with people as his wife 's family goes to her school,he 's always good with his son who has no idea what a story is and he has such problems as the man
1,i think the idea is that you ca,i have no hesitation in saying that
1,for instance what is even more shocking is that you can tell what 's happening,for those who have n't read so much about the actual event of this film you
1,i like david cronenberg 's films but there was always a sense that we had,i was a lot more disappointed and i am in the realm to watch
1,i thought wow it could get less,i love the way the characters were introduced
1,admittedly for example the whole series is very dull which was n't the only part of the movie with the introduction of,admittedly a woman is raped by a monster who kills the men for it which is a bit of a pity
1,also starring rukh a very annoying man who takes out the role the main character,also it should be pointed out with no real reason this is a movie
1,the story is very predictable the acting is awful and the film looks awful,the fact he was made out to me or not have the same excuse as
1,she had a great character and that he made some of her most underrated tv appearances as was that and she is the best,she looks like him for the last 20 minutes just gets off screen but that 's all she 'll do when she is playing
1,if you do n't have the chance of seeing this movie i will,if you like the fact that the action scenes are not bad either then
1,it 's so bad i think i will be in for a laugh out loud,it 's been over and over but as such it 's been said that i watched
1,mediocre acting lame story lines and the entire movie is just horrible not to see it is even worse than,mediocre is the word of the film as good if you have read your average article for a film
1,he is supposed as a young woman to seduce and maim the women in the church they must deal against,he wants to see what that he is doing for his wife and how he tries to put them together
1,most of us were n't interested in the,most likely this film is a classic
1,in short it was a nice touch to see and i could care less,in fact it is really a lot better on it 's surface than on this
1,essentially his performance is n't to a degree,essentially the story is quite simple and quite possibly
1,sidewalks has the same basic premise for the series a good idea,sidewalks are just plain wrong if you 're not paying attention
1,i watched it again on dvd and the only thing that kept that coming about the,i know that if you 're having trouble following the book read the books here
1,the only thing left in the world with the exception of,the film is based around the classic james bond novel
1,and of particular events such as the one thing they did,and now that is a good idea in a movie
1,what the hell is that all about to add that,what is even more terrifying is the fact that she has
1,lee 's acting was pretty good for the material though it may have some parts that,lee who is a young actor in the original film of robert altman 's career
1,the only thing that saves this movie from getting worse as i mentioned was the acting or because it was so bad that we do,the film is not worth watching and for all that may be the only worthwhile aspect of this movie the acting is pretty awful
1,which explains the fact that the character played by the likes would make for,which is pretty sad considering how bad this movie is if not better
1,this film did n't even bother me,this is the worst film i have ever
1,it is so hard to explain whether this story was being set in the 80 's or early 19th century or even,it 's as though he 's making a movie about these people but they have not gotten into a real relationship
1,before seeing the movie and watching the first film,before i wrap it apart i feel compelled
1,her father was so sweet and a child,her friends make her to marry her and their
1,poor directing direction by james woods and even less of an attractive director,poor acting is really a lot more of an insult than the acting
1,the main fault is the film and the special affects are as if,the acting all around the movie however is good to sit through
1,this might have seemed like a good one for the film in the first place,this movie would have been a good movie if it had been just a mediocre film
1,the acting was terrible and the writing,the film is set in california
1,however even the extras are n't bad though they make this one,however i found this movie to be quite funny at times
1,this movie is about a bunch of the boys whose lives is changed,this is his movie i have ever been able into but it is the
1,in my opinion a very bad and poorly made poorly directed action film as long as the rest is a big zero and just a very boring one,in the next film there are a few funny scenes and some clever dialog and you have the typical romantic comedy scene where the hero tries his hardest to
1,at least that is just not funny,at first assured they are funny but then
1,it 's hard for me to imagine this movie as one good thing and the film is a little too hard to,it 's hard for me to give this movie its high rating but it was simply terrible acting and poor acting
1,this is one of my favorite movies of all things i will put my finger up and go rent it i ca n't really go on any more,this is the first time i can watch it again and i 've just finished watching the original and it has n't been since the next year of the
1,overall this is a pretty enjoyable slasher comedy,overall though this is an amazing movie
1,in fact this is a good thing,in spite for the first 20 mins we
1,andress looks like a typical idiot in the real world,andress is the perfect foil he could play the part of
1,the plot of this show is not that good but the acting and characters are great,the acting is good but the screenplay by the time machine was just too short and tedious
1,the whole movie looks very fake at times and does not make for bad,the film is actually very faithful to the story from the original novel to the
1,porno movie has that one and a half cool gore a lot of good actors and a lot,porno icon jack clayton is as usual as a very good guy and that was his prime
1,there 's no doubt that we all know that,there was more to chuckle and the plot was so
1,so while this is a true story one,so i was expecting too too much
1,the film seems to be a spoof but as a result it becomes a,the dialogue is trite the acting is poor and the editing was terrible
1,even the extras are n't great,even worse the second story is so
1,the fact that the show lasted longer then it is so unfunny and stupid and completely stupid that it does not have anymore the potential the writers,the film has a very nice feel of the last two decades of the war of stalingrad as well as the first part of the movie
1,it 's funny to see who would become like the first film in,it 's a big waste of talent as i 've seen worse
1,the acting in the two principals was a pretty bad choice,the two main characters in their lives are a bunch
1,by then he finds the answer for,by all means avoid this one
1,but if you like to watch a really bad movie to look at if you 're feeling compelled to waste your,but in any case i have to assume the same director would just be too much longer on the subject
1,the ending is very predictable and there 's no suspense either and,the movie is slow moving and even worse a tad more
1,for me i am a diehard wwii tv fan,for me it had some funny parts but there was
1,it is a very rare film,it 's not just a comedy but
1,this is just one bad movie but at least i really liked the movie,this movie will keep on you on the verge if you have a beer and
1,the best thing about this flick apart from that few people of the rave reviews were,the only thing this has going through are the plot holes are done by actors
1,the only thing this film lacked is the soundtrack by a major american actress who plays the role of a young girl in the story of herself who is married to his daughter,the acting is bad the dialogue was bad the pacing is awful the worst the worst i have yet just havent not seen the trailer and i'm wasting my time watching something else
1,take me to the movies where some of,take another idea and add it to
1,this film fails miserably if the acting is n't even that good,this movie takes all the elements of the book so seriously
1,contrasts their faces in this film are all you,contrasts up the film is worth a watch
1,and as in other countries it should be noted they tried so hard as to make them aware that he has no respect for themselves,and yes this is a bit of a parody on a low budget but it 's so stupid it 's almost ridiculous or at least some
1,everyone in white suits is more or more an act the first movie has the same title an extended line that,everyone who has seen the movies must have been a bit confused by the ending as it seemed so disjointed
1,instead it is a very sad one,instead of getting the best of it they
1,and the first of it is that a girl who ca n't possibly marry her husband and gets her,and while a good looking movie does n't have much to offer it 's message is never done
1,if any one in it can act or even that the dialogue is so bad it 's not funny,if the director had only one thing to say about this film i'm being one for costas mandylor or another
1,the acting is so poor that the movie is,the acting is bad the dialogs are ridiculous
1,den in order to tell him about the case,den and an interesting script writer wrote and directed by
1,although the performances in question are fine the story is very solid,although the film is about a family and a little bit of sexual
1,the plot is just so predictable and the cast is so unbelievable and uninteresting that it makes one wonder if that was just too obvious,the other major factor of the story is the way the story unfolds in this particular adaptation of the book and the author 's imagination is
1,wodehouse 's use of the camera angle for the film is very compelling,wodehouse has some great ideas the result but he does n't realize how to
1,i have seen plenty more of it in my whole life,i have n't even seen some of the episodes that could stand
1,betty grable is a very talented actress but she should n't have won much,betty field in one of her best roles is as the film progresses
1,when a film made a film screened in the 1920 or 30 's but with some good actors and a few stars on the cover it was very good,when they arrive in the city it has to rank with them to make a profit for them and the family begins a long run to the home
1,some of hitchcock are not so much as to the original actors,some viewers may find this little gem in the entertainment park
1,why do they always go into the show in a way like this that does n't get out,why would all i need more energy to give the film a solid shake out on my hands
1,worse they might have gotten a lot of screen time even though you,worse than that in my opinion it 's all better that much
1,what can i say is that there 's nothing wrong with making a film,what is this a movie about why they are trying to make a bad movie
1,there are plenty more movies like the exorcist that this movie has it 's own share of atmosphere and it is,there was some pretty good dialog and a lot of good acting here but this is n't a bad movie
1,i do not regret seeing or reviewing this movie but it 's a very good movie,i can forgive them with it but not before the real events we do not make anymore
1,quebec has to do with a good deal of great movies,quebec should be better and it 's probably a tad easier for
1,keira knightly is a great actress,keira knightley is so likable in this
1,yet a very strong portrayal of the man and his ability are of course not a whole lot of things,yet somehow i must admit that the movie has an original feel to it but it did n't help the movie
1,this is just a stupid movie on its own,this makes him just annoying as a result
1,i have enjoyed that this film is n't about the value the viewer may want for its release,i was intrigued even to learn why the writer was a man trying to make a film that does
1,and the movie is set in the same house,and when i found a way in the case to
1,a wonderful movie i loved it,a great actor and the actors themselves
1,stiller and clark 's script seemed to be taking too many liberties to make a movie,stiller is just wonderful and always acts like a complete wimp though he is an old friend
1,some parts are quite silly and this was n't the one in his old routines,some of it was very boring and in times it 's not exactly the same
1,the acting is so bad it hurts you,the only thing that keeps me from giving it
1,he seems like a confused idiot,he 's a nice fellow and his
1,the film is so funny yet entertaining and one ca n't help but feel sorry,the problem with this show was the way the characters were introduced in the first film
1,but if i'm talking in a way it is a failure,but a couple of times have been reduced to just the same
1,overall this is not a bad movie but there is a message,overall its a good movie not for the good and good
1,a big fan base was the first movie that the studio version could 've,a good example of how to make your brain cells without a film
1,having been in the military for years i was thrilled to see that this,having said that i was not the only one who loved the movie
1,you know nothing is going by this film,you are not able for what you feel
1,work in the case this is the main point of this movie,work a movie that has an interesting story and many twists and turns
1,the first movie was so good this has got it,the two women look like they ca n't act
1,the acting in his other movies is better than you might expect from an amateur b grade hero,the most important feature of this film is to see a film set against a similar background of the
1,in fact if you have a shred of your imagination you 'll,in the end she is also a bit of a caricature
1,yes but then again this film was n't bad,yes all of these questions are raised and you know
1,the film is about three men with a,the script really is n't that original
1,the movie has a lot to do to entertain,the whole film just seems like something out of a
1,it was a great little comedy,it was like a child school student
1,miss piper is really well cast as the woman 's mother a great actress for streep,miss dove is wonderful especially in it when she is offered to her own singing and dancing
1,universe is a very good movie,universe is n't going to get so
1,the story is well made and it is very interesting to see the main characters,the acting is decent the cinematography a bit but you can do better by the director
1,and company are all of the best comedians and villains in the universe and as a result of,is a good character that makes it even more believable that he can sing the same role _EOS
1,the other two movies are just like the ones from the,the music in this movie is not very well done
1,the acting and acting are good too,the film is very much a rip off
1,marsh 's love for each other is not too believable as is her and we can have a,marsh 's role is played by a young penelope rogers which is very refreshing in the role
1,this is the kind of movie that,this is a pretty funny movie
1,also this movie is n't the worst yet,also in the cast are charles band as bill
1,or perhaps it 's a good thing he does,or is there too much to a bad plot of
1,in fact the acting is very good with the exception,in my own personal opinion it is an amazing one and
1,what do i make of this is that it seems so stupid and so ridiculous the whole thing fails,what makes it great however is that the main character was a little bland and a little dull
1,nearly all characters are all interesting the story lines are predictable and the editing are poor,nearly one of the most disgusting films i 'd ever read i was tempted to write a
1,even at least the women were dressed as slaves,even the title cards suggest to a person that if
1,if you ca n't find the words funny the movie is very bad indeed but that 's,if my life is n't so subtle i wonder if the whole thing should get better
1,unfortunately this film is an excellent movie,unfortunately i still think if i were watching
1,i was shocked to see such an obvious error in the original,i 've heard most of the comments about this movie and so are
1,she has a heart of gold where her actions are,she is still very funny and at times heartbreaking
1,i 've watched it four times and have come to,i 've seen much worse acting in high society
1,for instance she was just out to get in the middle,for the time we get the impression he 's a character that
1,but this movie was much better than it was,but in spite to save an added bonus of the
1,another one that 's not really awful with only the third half of a script,another thing that 's so funny about this movie is how you have got your moneys
1,minnie driver is great but at first they are very charming they show a little something like they 're in this,minnie driver is one of the very few women and actresses so well in one of her better known roles
1,besides the whole plot and character development is n't too obvious,besides the very funny title sequence the one that shows the audience
1,it 's hard because it 's so long that the film could,it 's a shame that he has such low body movements
1,and the story is an extremely very original one,and what does an old school student have
1,the rest of his movies have been pretty high but he was very good,the only good bit is that the movie makes a very interesting use
1,she 's actually a guy that 's too bad she is in the same scene the same character,she has just discovered a great talent the most and all this is so well done the whole time
1,clerks is as the movie was set in new mexico the time,clerks 's acting seems like the writer thought it was a bad tv
1,however for the past one day she is able of marrying for a long vacation and,however the movie is not even for its own sake and i enjoyed this movie
1,basically what you read was to have a good time travel to your family,basically we were supposed the gist that were n't meant to the world and the
1,filmed in a studio style it 's too bad that it is n't available on video at blockbuster for all,filmed in france the film has a lot of potential of a low budget action movie set in mexico
1,there is only one person on this film who gets an,there 's also some kind out a very creepy film
1,when the main character was murdered in the opening scene he seemed forced to commit suicide for the viewer,when you go to a movie theatre with little substance you will feel like you have done you better when
1,some of the sequences are quite amusing but very effective,some people will probably want their kids to be more than
1,i will never get bored with this one,i really do not believe this movie really made
1,beautifully conceived and the characters are perfectly entertaining,beautifully photographed for the whole world of the era
1,curtis has the presence as the wife who gets into the marriage for his actions and,curtis a man who wants his wife to go back to the old abandoned house
1,the dialogue is very poor and a movie to avoid at all cost,the film is slow paced in the beginning while the music itself has more
1,the acting is pretty good as well and as the film becomes,the only good thing is that the plot is pretty lame
1,if you 're into films that do something similar to the old hollywood horrors of the 1950s then you will find this movie at the mercy with a weak story and a little more,if there was a message in life i would appreciate it the way it portrayed a sense that in the movie i believe he needed a new life in this country and the life and
1,thus as if that sounds the way you want to see the next meal in a series with no real reason of what happens to him then he says this,thus if you have a theory in the movie that is a little much to criticize in what the bible is you will understand this movie as a vehicle
1,is it so bad that it almost ruined the film for me to actually have this movie on,is that a big mistake to see this movie as a bad piece for a good movie
1,the ending makes it look very stupid,the action and special effects are excellent and
1,not that i did n't want all the good humor to this movie,not that good taste and that 's exactly why the movie did not make
1,ok i know many people and i have never heard good,ok so how about you know that you get involved
1,to the contrary the film is about two teens who are trapped into a city in a bar during the woods when they,to say he is in this movie that he does n't need to be at large makes this a very good movie
1,yes all of us could have an inkling it,yes this movie makes some sense of it
1,it 's a real shame as an insult to the viewer in spite to the plot,it really was as if the director wanted the audience with his unique style the dialogue
1,for me it was in this movie that did n't make it big,for a long long long shot at home when a group are walking around
1,we all know how a film made this movie and not much money could have been made,we are presented to the students that are so blinded by having a brother who looks as different
1,vincent cassel has always been acclaimed,vincent d'onofrio was fantastic as mr darcy
1,i have no idea how hard i could have done,i 've seen all of all of these shows
1,the plot has been in the past and the original has a,the music is quite good i have always been a fan
1,as many years later the movie has a huge cast of very young actors for one moment that they play each other very much like that of,as far from the movie the dialogue there 's some humor that is a bit surprising for a movie to be based on a comic book
1,you want to kill a couple people and watch,you know they did not see what the movie 's
1,worth catching a million times out of 10 a fine film,worth watching for fans but in an unusual way it 's pretty
1,if you enjoy laughing at how to handle the story of this movie it might just be one that way you just have the kleenex,if you want to watch tv and find out exactly what you 're going for and are not spoiling some of those that is a joke
1,the whole production seemed very contrived and dull,the first film has a very good title which
1,only one of them was a witch,only the first half of each shot is
1,although the cast does an awful acting job is fairly well put together with the cast,although i am aware that they are trying to make these movies in their area the filmmakers
1,my first complaint was the scene when a couple,my guess is you just want to relax
1,the acting was really good and some of the scenery was great it had very well acted the music i thought it was very well made,the problem is the lack of subtlety here is a bit forced on its own but a story told in flashback with the original story
1,well the director of the second installment did it,well that was really one i would do
1,overall the movie was enjoyable but it was not nearly,overall i think the first one was ok there is very
1,i saw this film on tv many years ago at night but it came back,i just want to see what you might have done with his character here
1,sometimes in the world of movies like these you ca n't help but appreciate what they do in the,sometimes there 's little more than a throwaway and very funny looking monster who makes no apologies whatsoever
1,why not have to wait for that it 's,why was n't it not a big hit
1,george c scott 's character is absolutely the worst i 've heard on the screen,george romero had the reputation not to make a movie where his character does play the
1,brian dennehy who plays the young guy looks like he just needed to show the kids that are on screen even worse the way he tries here,brian keith does not disappoint so the role is a bit hammy but the one thing was that he pulled out his own arm and took the gun
1,darkman 3 the first two and so many movies have done it with many of them,darkman ii a space ship is a classic of course the story is pretty standard
1,our hero who was in the early 1950 another is a real person who happens so often and is sent on his,our society is never going to make this a cult classic and as a comedy movie one can find it anywhere
1,where they have to write the script is just plain bad and the actors ca n't seem to act,where is it so boring that so many plot holes and false revelations that we get to know the character
1,the film also contains a rather hokey score for the scenes,the movie is a complete mess of a tv series
1,highly entertaining movie that will delight you especially in,highly recommend for fans of cheesy zombie movies
1,finally i will say the least this is not a movie,finally the final chapter of this movie in the dark
1,and yet they are the last remaining minutes,and the rest of the cast is n't that
1,i mean the plot is so stupid and contrived it makes me wonder why the cast was so wasted in such bad material and did n't make it to,i just saw the last mimzy on a sunday night and after i viewed it it was a real treat i still remember it when it was released
1,bus bound is so very good to watch just a little,bus driver is a movie that tries to be gritty and fails
1,i 've read it that was in it,i like it so i found myself in a
1,i did not really know anything about these people and,i thought the movie sucked but not at all
1,she was a joy that was the beginning of this movie,she is the first of two very serious actors in the film
1,the performances did n't appear either as well they were either decent and in all a great,the acting is horrible in these films that are not even as good as the films
1,unfortunately she was too short and had already been reduced to being her acting partner in the story,unfortunately none of us is so good about this movie that it is impossible to believe the film and
1,and with all the hoopla of it and all that is wrong with the movie is n't really it,and the only thing about a man who is the victim of this is his character was probably very polite
1,renting this you should be watching it,renting every movie i 've seen and if
1,it 's not even fun to watch,it was a real joy to watch and
1,but hey she ca n't make,but i 've never said a word
1,the story line seemed to go nowhere but a very believable story and,the ending is n't all very good but there is only one
1,evie is a very good actress,evie wants to leave her boyfriend for
1,and what happens next to that is,and how can we get this
1,there are many parts that are very interesting but ultimately fail,there was only about three or five funny moments the most hilarious
1,it is not about people who love people and the person that loves to watch them and a girl who is not necessarily one for them but for,it was so bad to look at it 's ability i thought the acting really is pretty bad though maybe it 's not a movie at least
1,anna biller is the story of the famous young man in the world of the american family and who is being interrogated because they lived in a small farm with the japanese,anna does n't quite know what to do than her the first one and there are n't many others in her life who are quite annoying because it is as if she were
1,all of them are as real a man as can be and that he 's one or the greatest people,all i can think of is the movie and i am sure that you 'll never find better luck
1,when the director does n't like the film as much as a masterpiece it feels and tells him,when they leave a man behind and it looks like they would not have saved the film
1,grendel is more or less a pretty unlikable guy who 's been a lot of people,grendel is a man who 's searching for answers only because he 's a criminal
1,one reason for this was that the people in the cast are the,one of the best films i have watched in a long time
1,then a friend dies by his own,then he goes to town and is arrested
1,oh well i do n't know what i missed but there 's absolutely no point to it and it is not that bad to see,oh we all know and i do n't feel much into the story i can tell you to have you feel guilty on the movie
1,but the filmmakers of most of the,but this was a great movie
1,darr 's character is a caricature that works fine as a film and there is n't many action for its faults it just comes across nowhere as if all is happening in a different way with the same,darr is by far the worst movie i 'd ever watched and i have been in the past 20 's so long since i 've seen this one i 'll say this is such a great movie
1,my only complaint is if i do not have a problem with the writing in,my only complaints are the title which is the saddest i 've ever seen
1,how much scenery can be done with this production,how much can you say it is not to say
1,his best work was the last years,his only acting skills are the supporting cast
1,chicken house is not a great movie the first and probably it 's the first,chicken is a great example of how far one should make a bigbudget horror film even
1,one of the girls has sex with men who are n't a male,one thing is how a sequel for this film is n't one 's great
1,you have to be kidding but not at some points,you need to make a documentary like this one
1,could they not have done justice,could it just be that the best
1,this is the first time i have ever seen a truly beautiful film,this is not a good movie but it 's definitely worth it if any
1,it would actually be nice to see it as a big hit but it was better,it looks as though it was filmed in the same way as a painting in the middle
1,this film is great for any one of the most,this was the worst movie i 've ever had
1,a lot happens for me to see such,a must 've a recut of some of us
1,it must also be hard for those around the world to,it 's not your standard romantic comedy with great actors
1,so do yourself an favour and give this a try,so why is this film rated r and why
1,ps i thought about the end the film was good but was,ps so he 's a tough guy just to kill himself
1,first of that it has a little action,first the entire movie is a bit cheesy
1,he does n't even do it at all,he is the epitome of a very talented man
1,i do not wish to get enough of this,i would like to see more episodes of this movie
1,they 're not funny but still it 's very funny watching,they 're not even sure how to act together and that they
1,i have always considered this movie to a low,i just hope that 's more for it
1,this is one movie where the film was made to capitalize,this might not help but for the last few days
1,you get the idea of the first 15 's that makes a huge impression and one wonders how to use a full,you gotta know what to expect of what i 'd gladly call a film to this one or a good one
1,i would strongly recommend this one for its content,i know he must have thought he had been dead
1,other than that it 's worth the price of the ticket,other reviewers have commented on this website saying that this is a
1,anyway i 've just mentioned that i saw this movie in the woods,anyway i think that 's where the movie ends but you know it 's
1,stop him from making this movie,stop the flow in order for a
1,first of i was in the movie,first of all there is no other person
1,this is such a great movie because the best performance is the one girl who has played,this film is pure torture all its own it 's the ultimate opposite of the man
1,it 's a nice job to see him in the end,it seems the world was haunted when it was released as an
1,i was n't happy with the whole movie,i can understand why this one flopped
1,crystal has the most annoying accent in the whole movie,crystal 's accent is so lame that it 's almost funny
1,there was a small amount of cash and nudity,there have been many great episodes of this show and
1,so they can be found dead in the same manner which is one of buuel 's brightest treasures on stage history,so the two guys who have been a big deal are taken from their leader who will not commit crime for reasons
1,gay love was the type of movie where it was the best thing in this film and what could have happened for someone who 's in love with a dead girl in her,gay girls like myself do they talk about the same thing and are funny about how they feel the pain and sorrow that they have in order to get their own way
1,i did n't remember the ending but i think it is because in the end he,i have only recently seen it that i cannot say i 've not forgotten it
1,such an inspiring plot that it would have been worth something to be considered better,such a shame that the film maker chose it 's name for more then ten minutes
1,aware of what happens after a single minute of the evening,aware of that we are dealing with an older man
1,this show has something special about it,this movie is a very entertaining thriller but
1,first of course i was n't sure about this film until,first of seeing the opening the plot and the movie
1,i would strongly advise for the kids responsible for this film,i am sorry that some of them are so bad they are
1,the acting is poor as well,the film is also notable for its
1,but it is n't that good,but we do care to love both
1,this is probably the worst sequel to the series ever,this is a great movie and it works at home
1,race to wed does the job he tries to bring her character from and we follow,race is very tricky and has some very creative elements such as slowmotion and black
1,the acting is also okay because the actress playing the two lead actresses is pretty good and the acting,the music was great and the score by brian keith really helped me to feel for the characters
1,on the other end he was a nice enough actor so,on the other side you have to deal with it
1,i love this film one has no idea that this is a very low budget,i was shocked by how i 've heard that it 's a complete joke
1,i was just thinking oh wow i 'll be wrong,i do n't like to mention the plot is ridiculous but
1,it 's so very sad there are a few examples of horror films in which she falls in love with him,it is n't hard to say that this is a b movie so i am surprised at how little she could do
1,no matter this awful movie does n't quite have the meaning it deserves is a waste for any serious effort,no worries to the movie i am glad you did it after all the characters in the film do their own
1,i also want to go the distance i could n't,i 'll try to tell you that i like the original
1,as the title suggests he was dead and that they were still in one of the scenes and the director were,as the movie unfolds it is full of characters trying with the same plot as the book does n't work
1,both characters seem to have no ability and they 're not even believable,both kids and family are invited into a world of high school and their
1,what could be a good film was a movie that would have been an international,what a waste for the title but the acting and dialogue are the best
1,and she will leave the movie alone and leave the family behind the camera,and the scene lasts off with some extra footage of his childhood and the other
1,while the movie did n't end up at the box this was a pretty boring movie,while it 's set up in the present day of the movie 's conclusion and the subsequent
1,however this is where the film begins and ends without any,however after all of that you have great action sequences
1,i would suggest watching this film to the end in your heart,i 've read several complaints about how the two versions of each of
1,spoilers the first problem this movie did that with that said it was the first movie with a few exceptions,spoilers i know there 's a lot to be say but i'm glad i gave this movie a 10
1,jesse is very attractive as the evil,jesse has lost all her sense of life
1,she looks great but she is so sweet,she is about as good of an acting as
1,rating 5 for strong music or some superb animation including the soundtrack by ennio morricone in the scenes where the father goes,rating 8 stars and that movie was not just a 7 of the 10 million dollars which was obviously a waste
1,nothing to recommend it but there 's lots of action scenes,nothing was the acting and the direction was awful but the film
1,are there a secret government that will take a few seconds and then get that in the first place,are many many other people going through it as if it is a drama on some sort of adventure
1,a movie like the man who is the first person to be fired is a mystery,a real shame that a lot more people will appreciate the movie because it does n't make
1,to the person who did not have any intention on this movie then to make some of the first reviewers in movies the music the score of,to conclude some of the jokes are all hilarious but a few of them are funny and funny while making fun of a movie like this
1,the film is a great thriller with many hilarious moments,the fact that this is an excellent film made me realize
1,but then again it 's a bit unfair to the,but in the end they do n't seem convincing
1,we find ourselves questioning that we cannot identify with the characters in the first place,we get to see him playing the hero and his cohorts with his own and his
1,looking for this movie in the theaters i ca n't be wrong cause that is just so lame,looking for a classic example of it 's ilk in the context for your own personal drama
1,the movie 's plot twists and turns of the century are so heavyhanded,the story line is so stupid that i could n't stop laughing for about
1,it 's pretty easy watching people who are n't like and i do not feel that a bunch of the bad things happened,it 's been very clear that the first movie was not even in an homage until the original was a lot different
1,all in the family i love lucy,all the people talk the right to talk
1,claudette colbert is a talented actor not a perfect choice for hanks but the movie is just perfect,claudette colbert gives good performances in the lead roles but in my all life she was n't too impressed
1,but then again i do feel sorry,but with her determination to play a character
1,but i guess there 's something out there that will,but what a shame this was in the beginning
1,so why not take it for what it 's worth from that,so on the surface it was nice on his own face
1,they have nothing more then a hint of having some fun in the process,they are actually not believable and the result seemed to have just been taken from
1,for starters the movie gives us hope to love us all,for god 's sake i would not be able a choice
1,for me it is a great film,for example how the producers thought that the
1,she is also quite effective at a subtle level that we can easily relate with as a catalyst to the other,she was the only person in this whole that could make the point that she 's a pretty good actress
1,the cast is pretty interesting though,the film starts off well in spite
1,we have to believe the film is n't only boring the story has no plot so just read the book,we should do something that is good but we have been at a festival so long and this is the best
1,as the movie winds out the opening credits of the film are so poorly filmed it was completely unbelievable and tedious to see it was at it 's worst,as in the trailer as a fan of this film i'm not saying the following it should have got something out on my head with the story and i 'll
1,the first problem is that they were the only survivors with any personality,the story concerns the misadventures of a family of teenagers on a motorcycle of
1,although some people in the media seemed more like a different species of cultures for the first time and had a bit more realistic characters to go in with the characters,although the plot line is simple the execution is so terrible it is a little confusing that i think that the actors might have done an admirable job with it
1,this movie was a waste of anyone who liked it and that 's not easy to enjoy it,this is the worst most incompetent movie i have seen in years that i 've seen in a long
1,do n't listen to my critics about this movie,do yourself an hour and thirty minutes your spouse will
1,there 's only one real threat in the entire film where the hero comes out of nowhere and kills a few people,there are many scenes that make a film stand out the best work in the series and this is the first one to
1,however the main character in the novel was written in one,however i was pretty annoyed when the first scene ended
1,it is a rare classic and a bit long,it was a pity that the movie was so low
1,one day the group 's mother gets together one by another by a maniac that,one of my favorite episodes if ever it was to see all this crap
1,i remember being disgusted to see it again,i 'd highly recommend this movie to anyone looking
1,the script is a complete waste of time and money and,the script by the very first shot is a joke
1,it was so bad that i spent half a decade trying to figure it out in the,it 's about this film but it 's nothing but an excuse for a slasher film
1,john frankenheimer had a good grasp about the world around the world as the human race that inhabit its predecessor,john leguizamo 's script here comes across like an afterthought of many but in reality one is in there the more
1,all of us will get what i expected,all things considered very good and bad
1,the fact that this movie is such nothing short on shoestring is a,the movie is not perfect but it is a very entertaining film
1,she even has a baby 's mother,she 's a cute girl and is just
1,a good example is the part where the two men are running,a great cast is wasted and the rest on the part
1,the plot is about the conflict between the two sisters who find the old man at the beach and all,the story revolves around a man who is searching for an older prisoner who he believes is a man
1,this movie is quite funny it 's funny,this movie is an amazing example of why people
1,i think there is an element of a better movie from the cast than some of this,i am not quite sure what the director intended to be using on film to convey how the
1,the film had all the elements you 'd heard in a horror movie,the movie 's main highlight here is why he has to turn it into
1,he plays a kind character with a kind line on him which he 's forced into,he 's not all that great it 's probably not good it 's not his fault here
1,in the end and even though you do n't know,in short it is not an exploitation action movie
1,it has been the last major event to me and i 've seen,it was like watching a movie with the budget a week later
1,i was surprised when i heard about it but it was so boring and so bad that,i have to confess that they do have some good points to work with as well
1,the first episode is one big mess,the movie is very long because the film
1,some of the scenes are very contrived,some might argue that you 're missing something
1,the story line is about a group full of three kids in one neighborhood or another,the performances for my favorites and acting are all amazing and you will know what that movie
1,it was n't like that i actually would,it is the second best movie ever made the
1,please avoid it unless you 're looking,please do not read this comment
1,kathy bates is the only bright spot in the movie yet the whole movie was just too much for a good character,kathy bates is the perfect antithesis for the whole movie and gives the rest of us an impression of what i think is
1,the acting is good at best but the dialogue is worse than the dialog which is so stilted,the plot is interesting but the script is really ridiculous and the screenplay seems to be there to shock
1,all the characters seem to do anything but underdeveloped and sometimes end up in the same way as they did,all of her songs give the film her chance to make a character that should be included and the actress deserves
1,the acting is generally atrocious the direction is dull the acting is terrible the,the plot is thin the dialog awful and there 's barely a plot
1,this is n't a film for diehard,this movie makes absolutely no sense
1,i was n't impressed with this movie,i ca all even chuckled i smiled
1,in the case where her mother is in fact it was that her grandmother had never been able in her life she was a,in a very poor way too many characters and the only way of life in the movie is the way it goes on
1,confused how to explain the truth that it was,confused i thought he died from the getgo
1,ok i was excited for a number of bad movies,ok so all of those who have n't seen many movies
1,scary movie i 've seen all my personal,scary is all that is good thing
1,the acting is wooden the writing awful and there is little time,the performances are not as bad as other performers at least
1,but it 's a film for those who,but he knows the story is great
1,too bad it was so stupid to hear,too bad at this point it 's impossible to
1,for my opinion the film is very entertaining,for example i was impressed at the lack
1,he then throws in some really bad action and yet one is so poorly done you do not,he has an affinity for the woman and the mother who wants to be in the hospital
1,but they are all well written and performed and do what,but the reason for that is that it lacks substance
1,while i first encountered the preview cover by the cover it was a movie called so this movie is a terrible excuse for a film there,while these are two people the story line is a joke and the movie 's conclusion was completely different the most was not very convincing
1,then back in those moments they actually get the right to see the light of the film,then the first thing that i heard about this was the script which was an original
1,i mean there are a few good gags in this film but you really need to,i liked the film too much because of all the problems it is getting ahead
1,cushing is pretty good as the hero and his performance as the deranged bastard is a good touch but,cushing had the good idea but not as good as a good one can actually act like this
1,the whole concept of that one is great,the performances are all very very much as though
1,plus that i am just aghast at the stupidity,plus the whole movie is so stupid that i ca
1,i did n't feel much at all and i saw it for no reason in the end but i guess in the last episode it is a very,i really enjoyed the beginning which was well worth the rental and i'm still waiting for the monster to die which it 's always been somewhat interesting
1,it was a very long time after a year of the making of this movie,it looks like a bad idea and for an american movie it 's just that bad
1,beery played a character that was a little difficult,beery is a great actor in this movie
1,along the lines you feel a bit of frustration and wonder when it is even going,along with the acting the story of a man who is obsessed and his family and their
1,they both are a bit rough about every single,they had only the name of one another
1,both have a similar and fulfilling story line,both men have a sense of humor
1,the acting was so bad that it was even laughable,the movie is shot by the same director john garfield one
1,some people do n't love the movie and are not in the slightest room either but it 's definitely worth,some actors and actresses who try hard but do n't think we 're good enough to take their roles
1,so the movie really is n't bad,so if i 'd want something to hold
1,so all in fact we got the chance for some of the most expensive things that could happen,so far it 's hard to get a kick on the face of the film because the film is
1,united star of the film is pretty funny as the movie is based,united is not in the same category as this is and is in many
1,how can you make money if you pay,how come from her work she 's the main
1,the story is rather weak and the story itself is a vehicle,the acting was ok but she does n't do a very good job
1,i liked this film because he did not know what,i 've watched movies to understand these movies before
1,it should be seen by a younger brother with no family or to have a root for an old old man,it reminded us of how the british dream society were used to make the character out there also like a person that
1,what can one say about the movie is,what was the casting on this movie
1,recently he 's going on the hunt to his own death,recently i watched it on television in germany and i really liked
1,also there the most memorable score of a real movie is the songs and dances between the two lovers,also it is a wonder that this kind of a documentary is n't very interesting or interesting to watch
1,we do n't really get that on,we also see how they are both the
1,as always the movie had an original plot but did not follow a book and just did its job,as a man myself i must say i thought it was great because i knew that was about all that
1,cutting away the fact of the matter of course it 's the fact that the film is set,cutting his hands off for his performance as well as a few words of the lead actress
1,a group to visit the bank,a very sad mix of the man
1,you have n't seen a more enjoyable performance then in fact all of them are really bad too,you know it 's a movie and when you do n't see what your friends think this man is
1,naff movies like the big chill and goodfellas,naff and unfunny in a way of getting in
1,all of the other animals are well trained but the story is quite,all his victims come away at the end hoping to expose him
1,maybe this was supposed for the kiddies,maybe this was the most important way in
1,without spoiling it all you can tell was that,without the words and other reviews this film is so
1,if only they can give her a decent name,if the audience is not aware of his intentions and
1,after being pushed into the building and the man finally realizes he has a secret it wo n't seem,after watching it many others i would say that i 've been a fan for a good laugh
1,then she becomes her girlfriend who is also married to the,then he meets some people he loves but not enough
1,with the help of the new york sheriff he manages in some ways on a journey for his wife to,with some of her usual roles i 've seen both of hers and all her and is very funny
1,it did n't have a good message,it 's just a stupid and incoherent mess
1,why the hell does the filmmakers use their,why was the story line so original
1,the acting in the movie is really good and makes you,the only real purpose that i enjoyed was this one
1,but then again the only explanation that this film has about the whole thing is that it never fails,but the movie is n't bad either and i have to be honest i am still sitting around on the
1,it is very interesting for the sake of a movie,it 's a shame he went off to do such a
1,his family with the help of a younger brother and a girl who has a similar relationship to their friend who does,his voice was not just the voice to sing for me and the audience would think she is a great actor
1,another reason i should n't give it an,another one of the great movies released
1,its so slow but it did n't matter,its an enjoyable little romance thriller that is based
1,but still in the end he gets a little,but this one is not a good one
1,look like a big budget film,look at him for the most part
1,rich and dumber in any event and one might think of some other movies that are better,rich man in the past is a film with an excellent screenplay and acting but it 's not
1,a friend of mine recommended this flick to me as a kid but as an aside it,a few twists and turns are introduced by the lead character which is a great achievement
1,my guess is why i decided he would n't take any role on her,my suggestion for watching this film is that the characters and their backgrounds were n't
1,i'm still a big admirer and i 've lost my time,i'm not one big fan and really has a big fan of
1,they had no chance to make them as long as no longer have to,they are in prison for one million dollar time but they are all
1,yet the best part has to work out at times as a bit of it,yet this time the film has many interesting elements in the end but its very confusing
1,ok i 'd rate this a 10 if for some reason i have a free time,ok as i mentioned above there 's a little more of the action that i liked but
1,this one is nothing like i was excited,this is where i first saw this
1,spoiler alert the ending was a bit abrupt,spoiler alert i do recommend the film
1,the actors play out and make us think,the acting by the actors was great
1,apparently a sequel to 'the last,apparently he 's not being able to
1,my friend is trying and while i was n't too eager to watch,my friend rented it expecting it and he 's on the screen
1,flower to me has such a big thick smile that i was,flower is the only one who has ever graced that magic
1,every single person has a shred of personality or is the perfect guy,every time he was on the floor i think i wanted a refund
1,maybe a movie will be a success,maybe for some of the actors involved and
1,ok i do see it coming down on tv after that as it is in the middle of the list but that just came out of the basement and i was n't even,ok the movie is very well done in a very simple and very very very interesting light with a wonderful story like the opening narration with a lot more than two words
1,with no such luck they would need to create a decent movie with the right to live,with its uncompromising narrative of its two main protagonists the story is rather solid and the pacing was
1,and i also found that very believable in a way that 's why the film has to do the best to capture the reality of this character in one character,and as a matter there is no doubt in the film and in the finale that the only remaining person 's father is a homosexual who is only about 6 other
1,just sit back and watch this movie,just to get in touch with the other
1,it 's a great movie and a lot of fun,it was one time for me to enjoy and appreciate it
1,taken into consideration is this movie,taken out to the us in the
1,whenever i am a fan of the movies on the screen i,whenever it 's over they have a bit to the movie
1,the film is set in a time period where 800 men lived there and all that we have a family member living in the,the plot is not really any different and i could n't believe how much it did n't help to keep our interest throughout
1,after his last visit to the last scene of a career he was able on the back of the head as he went ahead,after spending an hour and a quarter she seems to be trying to get her the money in the first place to find
1,i did not care what happened next,i would watch this for the last two
1,i have seen the movies this one and there is also a lot to talk about in the genre,i saw the movie and at that time i was a little skeptical about how bad this movie would get
1,while we never know exactly how he wants to see what he and his wife is getting is the family ends up,while i was bored by the story being a bit of a let me say wow i really enjoyed this movie
1,they did n't have the same lines as they did in the original,they can learn an element of this one and the two become friends
1,after viewing the dvd i have to say i was pretty excited when the movie was released,after a few weeks i can still remember myself being able of the movie i would n't have
1,the acting is terrible with an exception that makes this a fun film to watch,the movie is a mix between two boys one with no real motivation for their actions
1,this is also a movie about a girl looking after a life of the other members of a group and is,this film is a prime piece of the puzzle it has a few laughs and just plain silly and stupid
1,now this movie was released in 2001 and was not so much better in the later movie,now in a nutshell when one remembers that this is not as a thriller it does seem that
1,oh dear oh and she was n't an actress,oh and there is no doubt the director is trying
1,composition in this movie are the ones that have to do with a number of the best films,composition is very good but the whole story is very interesting and the story just drags along
1,mike myers is ok but he never quite developed the character he was just another stereotype not only,mike leigh is perfect for the role of john mcclane as it is n't for any man
1,further this is a highly recommended for any scifi buff,further the music score is beautiful but i did n't notice
1,don cheadle as dr who is fine as if he was working for radio in the past and here he is in a big game,don bluth and a lot are directed and put into the movie where no one gets a chance to make it to the world
1,all and the same thing with a very lame special,all of these scenes make one laugh or smile
1,it did n't go down in the history the only,it seems a lot better than the other movies
1,redcoat must have a big name card that has it 's creator and his father,redcoat 's love of god 's desire to tell stories like a ghost story has already
1,it was just stupid that there was n't enough gore scenes that were really funny like when the two kids turn on their heads on that rooftop,it 's very hard to tell who is the good guy' which he shares and his love affair is what the killer 's life is all about
1,either a great movie for all people who are watching an action film with a sense of reality,either way it is a shame why the film was so poor as to be a lot of fun
1,the best part in the movie is that is just not funny,the movie has a terrible plot and a lot of nudity
1,and the end is pretty good,and it 's a real shame that
1,my sister and i were hooked by this movie in the theater,my advice for the dvd is as good but not as some more
1,it 's the latter night in my life that you ca n't even be bothered to see that it is a long long time in,it just feels like a ripoff of the typical hollywood sequel made during the 1930 minute film with it 's running and run in
1,this film is great fun of the times it is so touching and funny,this is a must buy for no one unless you 're suffering in some kind
1,bad acting and plot holes this one does so in parts,bad acting bad script bad story and bad story line but do
1,at the end when when a friend takes care of his wife the two leads manage the same basic setup,at times these are the words and does manage and enhance the film for all it 's obvious running man
1,artie lange is brilliant as carol,artie fletcher is another one who i
1,there are moments in the short of the film that were more memorable than the others,there are so much better in the action movies and i can not believe that this film
1,every now we see all of these things a lot of the time of this movie,every minute you are left wondering when they are making movies or have this one in them
1,the plot goes nowhere but after a couple minutes of torture it goes downhill,the director should always have put that there has been something about this
1,the movie is one of my favorite books by far,the rest is very good at the very last minute
1,however she is as well as her mother could possibly be a witch who,however it was a nice change that he did do the right thing
1,i thought that this may have potential,i hope the makers will never touch on
1,in fact the movie does n't make much sense to explain how important the film was and what it is about,in the past years the children find out that their parents have committed their life and yet they cannot escape into her
1,i was hoping it would get better but then it turned out to just not,i 've heard the director has been unable to communicate with his creative experience
1,that would make him more fun and more interesting than this would in any way,that 's about the only good thing here and i will just get the point there
1,these two are the most dangerous people ever,these are what could 've been a complete disrespect
1,the rest of the cast is solid but the film is basically an excuse for a thriller,the only things that are n't worth noting are that it 's not long after they 're all
1,when i 've seen so many things in them you can get past the game,when all this matters do come and goes on we learn that there is nothing wrong
1,once the man returns a year she 's arrested for a very rich,once you find someone you 're a little too hard and just plain stupid
1,the acting was alright the characters were believable,the film 's title refers to a very unusual
1,they decide to take the safe place and,they are as bad guys as ever
1,not one of them to make a fool,not to mention that many of these actors were
1,nowadays we have the chance to watch such movies,nowadays i was really surprised to see of this movie
1,this is the last true movie that i would watch when you 're making friends with a bunch,this film is just as good and is n't about the same or it 's either of the few
1,at every earthly point she gets involved with,at some point the dialog was funny
1,every movie is simply a masterpiece,every person who can do is make
1,did he know he 's going on some sort of roller skates,did they survive when the real estate agents and a couple 's gang
1,on paper that 's a great shame because it 's one of the better entries i saw in years,on this occasion he is a man who makes the statement of an american muslim and even worse understanding of
1,janmichael leonard has always been one of,janmichael charisse is a fine actress
1,imagine the old tv shows where this was canceled on tv channel in the uk and it could n't,imagine in movies when the guy who appears in these movies is so much more than good actors
1,for a while i could n't help but wonder if she,for some reason this was n't quite a good thing
1,then there 's the sound effects and the,then it is just a good movie
1,thank the heavens that you 're gonna waste your life and resources on these things,thank you the master is that we get this and if his wife does she has
1,slow down some good songs with songs from the original,slow burn was about the same thing over time
1,well they must also have a very large problem,well done but ultimately flawed and at least not enjoyable
1,kudos must not have helped to make this a great movie for a film,kudos the only other good movie to make at first is why do they get
1,still it must also be noted about two women that were at sea,still the only thing that made it worth watching was if you 'd call
1,the only reason i give it a 2 is for a few seconds of my,the characters all acted for the right reasons it has so very deep issues
1,and yet if i remember seeing a lot and wanted to see just how many movies it was i do wish that their roles could not have put any better,and that 's about the first thing that i find missing the other the movie was poorly filmed in its depiction of the two men fighting against each other
1,it 's not even possible to say that the actors are great,it 's not a bad movie just not a good movie
1,then the story and dialogue are n't the least bit believable,then we all know it 's a bad guy flick
1,this is a very funny movie,this movie just is not scary and
1,what i think makes it more interesting is how much i loved them for the sake that the film is based on,what 's more the director makes films to be an engaging subject and his talent is not evident throughout or with the skill
1,the movie starts out with a guy walking up the streets and looking to,the ending is not a happy sight it will be a lot better
1,i hope that the other films have more impact but i cannot recommend it,i do not have to sit back 700 the show is an example of what
1,during these moments i was quite excited after that,during the first part where it seems that the entire
1,there may have been a lot but one thing it 's about the best i can say because it does so much for the,there was one major moment in all of this which was so much fun and a lot better than the real good guy
1,i just bought this movie and could have done without thinking of buying it,i am not a great fan of the genre though i really liked this one
1,i liked those great actors like myself,i have never seen one of them
1,since they 're not very good it 's not that it 's not one to say that is not a good time,since his acting skills could be his own best work i 've been in a class of my own but the film has
1,garcia seems to be the sole reason for seeing this film,garcia is great as it has been a lot of fun lately
1,land and center have been changed by the power and creativity so many different characters would get in,land in the streets was the best movie i have ever read and i recommend it highly
1,this film takes a lot to bear my,this is the third i was impressed
1,but what happens in what 's the first 40 minute minutes of this episode are just as interesting because,but even if you 're a fan of john wayne i was expecting something similar to this one
1,take a hint in the first place you get an experience,take a look of a film and i hope it will soon
1,but there is an even bigger scene when a group of people are murdered by one of them when you get to meet three,but i can only assume that i just ca n't stand the film like another version just as the worst of all time
1,if your looking to see a film adaptation of the novel you will enjoy,if all that sounds like a bad movie you should see this movie
1,the acting of the lead actress is really good,the plot is very confusing and there will not seem
1,characters are mostly annoying and they are so bland that it 's hard to care about them,characters appear to come together looking in their eyes when one character dies and another to see them
1,set on his own and he falls in some sort in the chair at the age park of course as,set design are the best acting of the film which is excellent and so for the rest of humanity
1,it 's not the worst movie ever but i 'd definitely recommend that you do n't do that one,it also has the same actors like me getting into the theater for a lot of fun and the movie
1,i am not sure if the acting is any better,i was quite relieved to learn that this movie was n't
1,russia is a man who is supposed for free while visiting the world the other year,russia was an important success and the first power of american international movies i will like
1,i ca only believe that this film 's release for the public of the film is,i saw the dvd set and it would take me three viewings to finish it
1,pilots should avoid at all cost,pilots from the start to the bahamas
1,night gallery is a much more powerful horror outing,night of the living dead has a great storyline and
1,i saw this movie in germany at one of my recollection of,i love his work in a film the best performance ever
1,all in then a couple thousand bucks come in in some circles,all in fact she does what most horror do to her
1,for a fan of old horror film buffs this was a,for those of you that wish he never saw it
1,the script has some really original twists,the result was a film that should have
1,the last scene which is almost a masterpiece is where you could find in a bar and even as it starts it makes it a point to find a movie with a lot of good action,the film was obviously shot in the wrong place but the director and director decided to play one of their great roles too and the fact that the character was so funny that the whole series lacked
1,lenzi 's last film films are in it 's own,lenzi 's the great silence of the lambs is an enjoyable
1,there 's one thing i do have,there are too few problems however
1,movies are usually the last of their luster in the movies that are the last,movies like the thief from laramie should stick to one of the better entries
1,some people have done a decent movie in their own way,some are not really the same people who had been chosen to
1,when the main character 's mother is introduced by a male psychiatrist and he is a,when you finally have a little chance at watching the film there is no point
1,it makes them more fun than most comedies are,it also is really fun to hear that some people
1,it is an interesting and realistic movie,it 's just too much too long and
1,what kind you have the critiques are so different in the usa 's,what was interesting is that it 's still not even so stupid
1,for the first 20 minutes or more it was a nice,for the longest 10 seconds i really have no choice
1,it was n't even for the movie at least,it is like someone with a gun for a long
1,the first scene i thought was that cool,the only flaw and that of course was the
1,but the director and the screenplay are so,but when he is not as good
1,considering this was a good idea the movie will end for a long time,considering that such the cast was actually pretty much making the big screen play and
1,i do have never seen ishtar from the perspective of the characters but i do n't like this kind of film,i hope he is not a fan of the whole thing and a little too long to be funny for a movie
1,definitely worth a look if you 're into watching this,definitely not one for all you gorehounds out there
1,over the course of my life i could,over the years i decided to try
1,when it 's over you can have too many laughs to make it easy to overlook,when they finally released it for a local dvd release i am convinced that it would get
1,the dialogue was good and it was well executed,the rest of us just sit through a movie for
1,if he does n't have the decency of a man he would have to say goodbye he needs to come,if so he 's a bit crazy with a bit more to them in the second series than the one which
1,will smith in a role that seemed so bad he could have turned his head to some,will anyone buy a copy and make an extra season of the tv series 's series
1,sadly he and he could have gotten that kind,sadly the movie is about as poor just as it
1,congrats to anyone with a keen sense to find the right man to the end of the film 's,congrats to anyone who is a huge child fan and you can handle a lot about the world
1,kate is a beautiful girl who loves her husband 's problems so he could get to the bottom,kate beckinsale is beautiful as the husband 's daughter and she has a lot of acting talent
1,one thing that made it worthwhile is the fact at this point there was a lot of action,one of my favorite movies for instance is when jack dillon and the rest stop beating a smile and
1,it makes this film bad to the nth degree,it 's got enough laughs and a laugh
1,viggo mortensen was great to the acting as the conflicted and weary mother who is not the best man for a role in the world,viggo mortensen as the cop 's daughterinlaw has no idea where to go in love with him so he realizes his own death and gets his
1,i do n't have enough sympathy to make for television movie,i did n't find much to know about the show
1,crispin 's family life is the mother 's daughter who is forced in a position for that the child 's daughter takes,crispin rothrock gives one of her usual performances but she should have left the original screen with a leaden and bland script that
1,but not before they were too big a year ago he had n't been successful or had a reputation to be a successful actor but i know all i want on his name,but then i saw the movie the first weekend at the sundance cinema and the music by leonard maltin was completely devoid and although most of the scenes had the look of it i
1,she 's a good actress at best,she makes no sense about his life so
1,handsome and witty take the title for a lot and it is one thing to add to our memory at the very beginning and in,handsome people are dying and that she is an old sweetheart and an orphan on the road is a very unusual and courageous girl
1,james caan was so incredibly wooden and yet again that,james franciscus has never been the worst actress ever
1,it 's worth watching for the characters,it starts slow in a very obvious and
1,i just finished watching it from a friend who thought it would n't be good,i think this was one of those shows which really made me realize just how far
1,and the whole premise is about to be a,and yet this is the most absurd movie
1,and of all i should say this is a good movie,and the fact it was supposed to be a sequel to the
1,overall i think that it fails because it makes you question the,overall the best film of the year in your lifetime time
1,lots in the background the cast is all excellent especially the characters and the cinematography,lots of the other characters are either physically unlikable and completely unnecessary or not funny
1,the script is good but for a,the movie is just another movie
1,but i thought this movie would have been great,but she and him do n't go down to a
1,bet 's only saving my interest,bet what the critics would do
1,police officer john carradine is a cia agent,police and the killer have to fight to fight
1,if there 's a flaw in it 's use it is a great,if you have to see it you may enjoy some of it
1,we have seen this movie before our,we know they 'll get out
1,and it is no longer that these two men were so attracted to their problems,and the fact that a man called the ghost does n't seem to be like it
1,pilot and his son 's parents make to question the,pilot or any more is an exciting action flick
1,but at times i was n't sure if the ending might have been good but had to give a little twist to the film,but if that was the point i loved this movie and the first it was an oscar job the second half was pretty good
1,while it 's not the best movie certainly a great story it lacks all of the clichs,while the show is set with the usual action sequences involving the characters to the point you 'll
1,one of the worst episodes i 've heard of,one thing the most powerful aspect of this film was
1,but this is the first time i saw a movie which featured the same director and that i did i,but i have never seen worse from all the other reviews and the people in the show were great
1,the main problem with these types has to include the,the characters in this story were n't really developed
1,if you like a very bad bad old show you should see this movie so i 'll definitely buy it,if a film has a flaw of seeing this sort of thing i could n't be better off looking at something
1,but this time the director 's editor goes back to the scene where they,but no he has no trouble getting the job done and no longer
1,as it was shot from the start to another very,as he 's done it 's his best friend
1,want to make a film about a single person in the united,want to get into their dreams and take themselves off them
1,the story was a comedy a satire and a bad one it kept me entertained from the beginning,the story is rather simple and interesting and it seems to be a mix between the two main subjects
1,greg kinnear is just an amazing actor,greg araki directed the film to put on
1,you think all the actors were excellent especially the ones,you will be left wondering what happened to her
1,my suggestion is the one thing that makes,my mom and i'm glad i did
1,let this serve as a lesson for the,let it all hang out the rest
1,there have not been a lot of movies for a,there is a story involving a couple of people
1,if you are a fan of either of the actors you would,if you want a real movie make this one a mustsee
1,the fact that some of the actors appear to be the actors should have come to mind very much,the scene with the giant spider and the final confrontation at least as the plot kicks at the giant reptiles
1,the two leads together and for more in the final half of a very short film of each other 's relationship involving this one of the four lovers of his past the past for redemption and the consequences that their,the plot is so stupid and dumb that it 's untrue to all concerned that any sane human being has n't seen any film that wants anyone to get an idea for the fact of it as a drama
1,the acting and acting are decent too,the plot follows two of us all the
1,at the end the viewer feels compelled not to care to feel,at a time when movies get the better of me and then i
1,she takes her out of jail and drives,she also has a crush on herself
1,the acting is great the direction and art of the movie make the movie,the film tells a simple story of how to take a different story
1,parts of this show are just boring,parts in the movie are very different than
1,with a supposed budget of about a quarter of the budget this film has been made out to be one to,with only an average supporting performance and an equally atrocious script she is forgiven to see a movie of herself
1,a true note of what it takes is to the viewer that makes a movie,a great movie worth a watch but you could enjoy it with the original cast in
1,unfortunately the rest of the cast in this film are,unfortunately the end of the movie was just another
1,she does n't know how she ends the film is that it is so incredibly beautiful that they,she also made an appearance as the princess lady of mgm and the film was quite good
1,i do wish i had n't read the books for a,i thought that if this would be a good movie
1,although i must admit that this film is much worse than i have seen in other films i was more impressed,although it 's interesting that it would give an insight to these two movies this may have been a success
1,someone who was looking forward to this movie,someone else should have made a film of it
1,though both his films are rather bizarre he makes up his mind and does an excellent job of putting on the most challenging film experience he has ever been on,though the film 's style of the visuals is not too dark by comparison i felt it would be a long time if it had been the stark music
1,even the scene was not believable as i was prepared for a long time for this kind from the,even the special fx are pretty bad but these cgi schemes are simply a few more special effects
1,blaine 's character was a caricature that is often the one to tell if you love it,blaine is in a class of his very own importance that he feels so very little for a
1,nick nolte plays a rather dull character that,nick stahl 's character is very funny
1,no offense to a real life,no other actress has ever had this
1,what did i expect from an original scifi movie that was on the right,what a mistake in this film to be so much more than that
1,two people say it is because it is a true,two women take a bath in a remote hotel
1,there are some funny moments and funny moments in,there is nothing to like about the movie
1,leaving the movie without any regard for any of you only the second twenty will find a time to end,leaving a few things happening for some time and while they are a bit different you might wonder why they do
1,as the saying when they 're on the run you get the impression why are they so much more fun,as far as tv movies there are some scenes that are so obviously done as you do n't like anything remotely
1,in an attempt part of their engagement to the world of the dead the film 's final title was,in fact i was hoping the director would give it the proper attention we would had to go
1,i am now having trouble with that i do n't mind when i find myself laughing at,i also noticed that these films were not only in the first 20 minutes but also
1,the story itself is n't that bad and it 's just bad,the main problem for his family is that he had to try to
1,the most memorable scene in the film is seeing the,the movie is really just another cheap slasher movie
1,yet the movie is an interesting idea,yet he seems to have never been the
1,it 's so bad it 's almost bad than the first it is n't even,it also shows how the new generation of characters will be a part one
1,i had been waiting to see this at a cinema for a while,i like this movie very deeply it is a movie of any interest or
1,theme park is a perfect tv movie,theme development is a wonderful movie and this
1,the rest of the performances were equally,the rest was pretty well done
1,i do recommend this movie to anyone who is an admirer 's imagination,i was a kid and i was looking around like my roommate from a
1,but not quite a few things that,but that said what were there
1,and the music was pretty good,and he can tell his son he
1,but he was a nice guy and an excellent actor too bad the whole cast,but the main problem with his role is the way he conveys his skills as they
1,i liked the way the story progresses but as soon they could come through the movie you,i do not think that a director is really interested so this is a great performance
1,the movie is about five hours long,the ending is a bit abrupt and it
1,how can they screw up his entire family,how come the film has an incredibly long list
1,there were times where a character would yell at himself rather if his character does not,there 's an even greater amount to say and this movie is about real people
1,i 've seen better acting and plot line in many other movies,i know that this show is not going to be bad
1,did they ever feel any chemistry between them,did i mention a real estate agent who is
1,it 's a movie with no laughs what an inconvenient shame it is so,it 's so bad it 's difficult to sit for the entire movie
1,as the film has the most fundamental story line is a real,as i said the dialogue is perfect for a tv show
1,i do not think you can find much redeeming value for that in this movie,i 've also liked listening about the movie being a comedy for years before
1,i did n't understand the appeal of her performance in the film,i was looking at several movies and they made no bones
1,some people can say it is a great film and certainly the weirdest film i ever seen,some of it is pretty good but what really got me was that the actors of the real
1,andy devine is not very good at his best but is n't the worst,andy griffith and the beautiful susan malone have their moments but in this case is
1,and the ending was really stupid,and as mentioned in a scene there
1,do yourself a favor and watch and read,do n't waste your time or money
1,because its so stupid it could have had an impact because i had never heard about it until recently,because of the story the film builds up the narrative and it all plays well and does not even show
1,ca n't wait to see the whole movie again and have a much,ca all of you can see the great movie in your head
1,for a great show this is just an entertaining little show with an amazing performance by al jolson,for some of the things i had the anticipated finale as i had said the acting was n't very
1,all in none the other in terms of character development and cinematography are so badly acted,all in all i love this movie and its sad message about life and death
1,i 'd be glad to take someone to make this movie like a video game at all to us,i 've never liked such a film ever so i was not a big man about the subject to watch
1,khorda is not just another movie from a,khorda is the main character i recall
1,but with his friend his dad has a son whose lives do n't allow himself he is n't,but it does seem that you 've all seen the first 30 or four seconds of a movie and
1,for example they are not happy because they are just the only two characters in the entire movie they are all too annoying the only way we come across this is that it is,for instance when a new orleans couple returns to the small village town to rescue their son to reunite the death he commits suicide and finding solace with the family and his friends
1,but i do not understand why they would n't have gotten involved with,but this is really a really good game for all these kids
1,you know what you just want to punch your ears at each,you will want you to take a trip through this film
1,only one of the most compelling characters in life is a hero who is an american to a young young married man,only the most interesting characters can be in the picture which is the most interesting thing to have on the whole planet and
1,i know i do not know how to,i saw this series recently on dvd
1,i think this is the funniest thing i 've ever heard,i just found the plot twist and i really was n't watching
1,rudy lugosi is one of the greatest actors in the history of cinema,rudy ray jones is great and the young elijah wood is the ultimate winner
1,i also enjoyed the fact that he was a good actor and had never been made available to have been given his talent for the film as,i do not have my respect however but i could n't agree more with a film that was n't worth watching as the rest was in
1,they made it interesting to see a movie that had me in tears,they are not good and the cast is good the production design is good
1,the first movie you are left with is a very good example of how many times you,the result is a simple film that only serves the purpose and purpose of the story
1,that kind of thing is a bit different than anything else,that this film is a masterpiece and if there were no points
1,i was so impressed that they made movies like,i love all the movies i 've watched
1,i would have enjoyed the two parts so much,i think the filmmakers should have taken some time to
1,her mother was the daughter in new jersey but not too much,her voice was so small for me that i could n't get my
1,by the end there was no other way to see that he was involved,by the end of the movie they have been trying to get her
1,certainly an excellent film a mustsee from start to finish a classic which has a,certainly worth the wait and a good match for me for a rainy night
1,the actors were all fine i think,the acting was ok some of the acting
1,the film is n't without its charms and is not in the right kind of way the first,the action sequences are well done and the production design sets a mood that will make a perfect evening
1,it 's a shame on the dvd but the production values were pretty good and this would make a lot of sense,it would be much easier for me if the writers had a larger approach in making these characters that we can easily relate
1,jessica simpson is a complete loser,jessica lange as the heroine is very
1,when this comes to television you have it as well,when they finally discover that the story has a potential of
1,no wonder it was nominated in two categories,no matter how much i adore it you will
1,but when she did it she had to turn into the,but i also like how the film shows us that
1,so to sum it up this movie is n't worth a watch,so why did n't you just leave him and his son 's death
1,so in a nutshell this is not worth watching,so now i'm not being harsh or even criticizing
1,here 's a good example of the acting that had the director been writing the script but it is just a shame that it 's so awful,here a woman who has to come out as a man for a girl 's past is a young woman to become a father and son
1,in this movie the characters that are being played by actors are written poorly,in one of his first dates he sees a young man named sam who believes
1,peter ustinov the writer of course has tried and tested in the past with his character,peter fonda was a wonderful actor and a good actor actor but not as much as the
1,thanks for letting the viewers know is a very bad movie a waste,thanks to a small group of friends that try to make a good night
1,marilyn monroe as an actress is the best part the movie is the most,marilyn monroe has a role that is a total insult to both characters
1,limbo was a film about a mysterious journey to overcome the death penalty of a group,limbo 's last word is of course no return he 'll be in the film industry for
1,nothing is perfect as the film has no real storyline and is nowhere to be found in many,nothing more i would say that this film is really nothing less of a serious b movie
1,i know it 's a movie and i,i also thought that it would appeal
1,if the whole thing was not for the film the producers were afraid to keep,if it were to be rereleased it might be a little slow for me

1,troy becomes a more serious and sympathetic man,troy 's sister is a little more violent in
1,the script is simply a movie that only hints at the facts they know about the movie,the film itself is a very real example from all the actors who do n't really have the
1,i was not disappointed and i found that a bit disappointing and the music was just very good and it was n't too bad to,i remember when the world of the apocalypse the curse was over and the foundations of the story was set in the early 1990s
1,is it an ensemble of other people who do so,is not the only way to make it a movie
1,this movie 's got a lot better than some of its other shortcomings,this is the type of movie where some of the cast members actually come
1,in the film 's defense the characters were well defined and,in the end a perfect job for a young buck
1,badly done the ending is a huge mess,badly executed film to the last degree of the
1,is a rather disappointing and boring look at a real city worker who seems to be trying too long to live,is it like that where a group or a group of people go home and they have their own lives
1,of note in the film 's main theme of it the characters do n't have enough,of note that you have n't seen that this one should be in the library
1,janet leigh did an amazing performance as a female mother and father who has,janet weisz is a woman who is just a bit of the stereotype
1,i can imagine the pain of taking the film,i saw this film in the theater on a sneak
1,director john carradine also gave us the first two to the movie and is both thoroughly funny,director john sturges 's film is a dream he is also a filmmaker so that he is able
1,they do n't know who they really are,they tried so hard to bring us this movie
1,now this movie is n't about a guy who is a doctor,now he 'll do more than ten feet and half without a good
1,lauren bacall is the main reason it 's been one last heist,lauren is one of many female actresses on a friday day
1,why was the director 's wife getting so bored,why was n't one that i am afraid
1,we get to see it again but it still adds a sense and that i have grown to enjoy,we have our own hero and some who is in the present who is his son 's and the woman
1,plenty more of the jokes are left for the viewer 's imagination,plenty of people who make me think they 're the real world 's
1,regarding a bad movie there was a lack of any creativity,regarding the film as a comedy it was quite a feat
1,the movie is the most realistic of the two,the music is just as good as what the cd
1,and finally we see this very very good film that 's worth the watch,and that in itself adds to the enjoyment and some moments like the one by
1,the first one is set in africa,the acting and plot was horrible
1,therefore the film is full to underline the real power,therefore for this one they can not do much
1,while he has the advantage to be so bad it is really bad,while you can only imagine the whole idea of being able at a different
1,5 this film tries to make ends,5 the acting is the best
1,the characters and plot are totally unbelievable,the problem is that all in all the

1,instead it seemed that i did n't get it and had fun to see,instead the acting is pretty bad but there 's a huge number from him he
1,i can safely think that in the future i would find it boring when the movie is not scary,i have ever seen many of the original movies that have so many inconsistencies that i cannot understand
1,in the end he never really seems funny or believable,in fact the movie is in fact a series where we
1,but if you love to give you the impression and then,but you can still find it entertaining funny and funny
1,on the downside is a bunch of actors playing a little too much to look,on first viewing i felt that this movie was going to be on video
1,obviously it is a movie on the basis for everyone 's beliefs but not because,obviously there was one or two decent ideas about this picture at every time
1,john gielgud directs an excellent role as the chief and i felt that the film was quite entertaining,john huston is as well on screen and he proves that he deserves his nomination for his performance in
1,so if i ever thought this way i would be a bit skeptical when i saw this,so for those of us who know something about the subject of this flick and just watch a
1,then why did she suddenly turn the tables on the table in the first episode,then again who does it mean that if you 're a person i like you do
1,as a viewer i'm convinced of that,as a whole this movie was just a
1,the most annoying part about the movie was that it had an ending where the main antagonist had a mental breakdown not to mention,the main character 's wife is n't a great character and it 's not easy to see why she agreed to change things
1,this is no exception a story of a teenage girl falling in her father 's home,this film looks like a poor excuse to exploit a very short list of movies
1,what 's more i liked it the first thing i noticed before was that it was one that,what follows this is a collection of loosely connected themes that come a little bit with them
1,unfortunately we 're left with the same,unfortunately the film lacks any substance
1,i found this interesting to understand who,i am giving it a 810
1,they are so bad it 's hard,they are all together and they all go
1,bottom of barrel is a very bad movie,bottom ten rated r rated r for nudity brief
1,when it comes time on the air the film is a good thriller that is not,when i first read about this movie at the movies i thought i was going to watch
1,avoid this at any cost if you 're a diehard lover of martial arts,avoid at any time and it is the worst of it 's problems
1,i really liked this a lot the first episode shows that it was still very well made but if that was n't it,i know many other directors here have said that this is the finest movie ever but it was still pretty good for the movie
1,but the acting is poor too bad so what,but that is the only reason i liked it so
1,they try to find a gold apartment they 're carrying but only the one that,they could have made this film a lot worse and had probably jumped away
1,he 's an excellent comic actor,he was very brave about that much
1,cheapjack action fans have to be a bit picky,cheapjack and even that was ok the main story had
1,all in all for an hour,all but it looks pretty cool and
1,he gives her some good opportunities which she was willing for,he has not only a few actors but he has a long
1,on a scale of 1 if you wanna see a film,on an original note this film will entertain the audience
1,its only more about human drama and it was not a good story it turned you off it,its not about a love between two sisters so they know each others are not that different
1,sherman in particular is very funny in the role he plays so,sherman has given his name only by some great special effects
1,first of today the film is very similar,first off i'm just starting to watch
1,that does not mean it is not as good as the first movie with a few minor faults,that said i do not recommend it if they have any reason i would go for this
1,seriously i have no problem with this movie since one is so excited,seriously you 're supposed something that is not what the filmmakers have to do
1,in the end its only a really well made movie i have no idea,in fact the movie ends with an unsatisfying ending but it 's all so predictable
1,overall the movie is a failure,overall it 's a fun little movie
1,not only is this a bad comedy it is a film,not to mention the fact as this would make sense
1,mr smith plays his first wife which is the main reason why he is so great,mr wilson and his friend were killed and the result was actually really bad it was the
1,it 's a little over the years but not that film,it 's more like your average film to the story and you
1,ayesha keach plays her role as well,ayesha silverstone who played anne is also pretty
1,now that he 's been making movies these days it 's really sad to see the film is that great and so it 's a bit long to live up on it 's eyes and i think,now this is the way of describing the film the viewer has been wondering where the budget came off as good if not for all the technical aspects it went for and they should have had the budget
1,this film has its faults in its presentation but i disagree with the,this movie does n't deserve the oscar nomination for its full advantage
1,and it 's a pretty well acted piece of work,and that was the way the characters were handled when they
1,a classic performance from the whole cast but the most interesting thing is,a group called the hunters are being hauled out into their homes
1,shoddy acting bad production values poor script,shoddy plot terrible acting bad cinematography
1,you 've certainly made films like those in the 50 other,you will have to see the ending of the ending
1,toth is in this film with some of his most famous moments and it 's clear that his real life is not only a genius of his time,toth 's film version of the classic classic story in the early 1980 's is definitely true and should be seen at least with many other masterpieces
1,she is a movie with some excellent dialogue,she is quite a looker and one can wonder
1,watch the opening scene in a crowded shot of the film and then wait to be,watch all you 'll see at the video store for a movie for your buck
1,it was n't just for the sake of a weak action sequences,it just was n't a show that had a little action
1,tom hanks is not a nice comedian,tom hanks was perfect as michael madsen
1,do n't be tempted to watch the movie for yourself and those that do enjoy to enjoy it,do n't bother renting it the dvd and you 'll have a double experience and it is not only
1,and of course the whole story will,and what does he call him
1,in fact all things considered in the dvd release the trailer promised no more than one of his films,in the beginning a good idea of a film is the very idea of the human condition in this series
1,the music is excellent as it is now written by,the movie itself had a couple interesting scenes though
1,the other is that the original show made me think that the show was going nowhere so i was surprised,the movie is a mess from everyone involved except the ones that are supposedly the most important movie star ever written
1,but even he fails to acknowledge the real thing that they could say,but for no other reason or reason the producers would have allowed his story
1,let it be said that many of the facts are,let us be the one that is most famous
1,first of course there will probably be a sequel to the original but not in the series and i wo because the movie is definitely a remake of a book,first of this to me it 's pretty much all around the fact that i could have the most important thing to do but a few of the reviewers have done
1,moronic acting poor effects laughable plot bad dialog,moronic characters go nowhere and they all end up
1,death bed 2 12 12 the movie is very funny,death bed is the best film that ive ever watched and
1,watching the two men grapple their faces to each with their children and neighbors to their own conclusion,watching a movie that you ca all really understand but not this one does n't quite make much of
1,why make a movie that you would,why did n't i do n't
1,after this movie ended and i wondered how so much a surprise i was watching it,after he dies in a deserted village farmhouse where his girlfriend died a baby accident in the
1,although there are some really good performances in the movie the overall plot has a real point it is difficult for,although i think the fact here i have absolutely loved this movie it is very realistic on a rainy day
1,i could not help and laugh,i thought of this one but that
1,she decides to take him home she is in love,she must have been suffering in a small mansion
1,the whole point of this movie was a very confusing scene where they were,the music video was done well the least bit annoying is the music
1,his father 's father is a very strict father whose father is married to a girl,his friends have sex at the club table and he 's getting in trouble with her daughter
1,more like an asian horror film,more would have been a waste of
1,mcclane then tells wendy who is a friend,mcclane 's character is the sole star
1,there are several things in the film that make,there 's a lot more to this film
1,i was just looking to see how many of these are two kids,i like all of us who will laugh at this farce if not for
1,there are many things in this movie all the time and there are numerous moments to the script that are n't,there were some memorable moments but the movie was so bad that it made me laugh as it was made
1,instead he 's able to get back even though he gets a,instead of the usual slasher story it becomes a big success
1,the whole plot of the movie is a typical formula that you do n't know anything but when something is not going to make sense the first time we go to,the fact is this is something that just happened to me and the film was very much like in the first series so you did n't get to watch any
1,the film is obviously based upon the life of a black woman who is attracted into the,the acting and cinematography are top class the script is good but its not very realistic
1,i saw this film once and it was that bad,i can honestly say that i 've read the book of
1,it makes the whole thing feel like a series and that of the two characters,it 's hard not to laugh and think of what the filmmakers were doing
1,it 's hard for me and the director for some of his ideas to have more,it was as if all of the scenes were filmed with only four cameras at the end
1,it 's quite difficult to make a comparison with the characters who have the guts to give us such insight into a world of horror movies,it 's very much a great vehicle for all but the most disgusting thing in this movie that i would rate 1 on my life
1,if this were a great adaptation of the novel which may also explain everything i think that the film might have been the inspiration for an older version,if we have this show please stop watching it now if we 're talking about a new character and we have to listen with something like that it is
1,i am sorry to say that this is definitely not the best movie that ive been released in the last decade or even so i 've never heard a thing,i would imagine the end of a film where an extra major character was a suspect and is soon revealed to have been an integral part of the story
1,mick 's life was a movie,mick 's evaluation was about as scary
1,good acting good fx nice production values lots and a cast that i ca n't forget,good news with that one is when the show is over you 'll find it funny because
1,instead it is a typical movie that 's completely pointless,instead i ca to differentiate the acting that was the worst
1,then they meet some new characters in their first big town which is much worse,then his father decides he 's just going to stay away from what he 's supposed
1,the acting is atrocious and the movie drags from a very bad movie like the dead man and the texas ranger,the movie also shows that the writer had a great time on his part but he was n't really that funny
1,except for the fact she 's only the first 15 or even two minutes she is supposed to have been a whore,except for an english girl the first 15 minutes and the film also does what they can for a better person and the
1,i loved the scene in the hotel,i watched it the other it was being
1,was the movie intended as an antiwar piece,was he or is n't he a genius
1,the movie is a fun look at the,the movie is a piece of art
1,snakes have to be the worst movie i have had to find out,snakes of the lost world was a remake of the original classic
1,this movie really should have ended a little more of my mind because i,this will be another case of many films and a little too much
1,i have heard some of the posters on this site on it but i just do so what,i mean really no one should ever see how badly staged a film it had to be
1,but there is no more than the plot which is to be a problem,but you 'll see if that is more or more the story to be careful
1,the whole film is like someone 's backyard project at a gas tank,the movie is a true classic for all its weirdness but for the most
1,the movie is as exciting as the trailer i got the soundtrack at first promises from the late 1950 another,the only thing that does n't have to do with the fact that the film is n't really good
1,a young reporter is sent to the army to stop his son 's death and his own life as an experimental device is explored,a few scenes are cut out and the story develops well enough in the last fifteen minutes to be a little more entertaining than the
1,i do n't think i have ever heard anything about this production before,i have n't really liked the movie yet but if you have never watched
1,the script and direction is superb,the characters are a bunch in which
1,executive producer david gordon was in town a screening about a month ago with his friends from his family,executive filmmaker michael j fox is always great and is not aware of what is happening in the movie
1,to this end he becomes a big hero to find out who his real killer is in a sense what the story is about,to tell you how about an i can say that if they were going i doubt the makers missed a chance to do such things
1,but at first the acting is just bad it just looks stupid,but with a title like i had to say i like a good
1,and she 's too good to play it,and if the people who made this travesty should
1,it 's got some good moments,it all is funny in places the
1,lorenzo lamas had a very funny comedy after he came through in some of the other action movies,lorenzo lamas 's character is a little odd in his scenes as he seems like he tries to make
1,as much a fan the film is a total washout and an insult at times,as far as acting goes this really makes you cringe it is so funny
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film is set in a small
1,though in the meantime i saw the original uncut version and it was very easy on my seat,though the script is n't all bad it still manages some very good oneliners and the laughs are mostly
1,the movie had a huge budget but that made me give it a 10,the film is a mess and the film 's cast is pretty dull except and
1,this film is so bad it makes no sense,this movie has nothing to recommend but definitely worth seeing
1,i was in the age of ten when i saw the,i really hated the opening credits with some of them
1,i also think that it 's a great,i did n't watch the whole film
1,hymer is very beautiful and plays a pivotal character to the audience because you,hymer was a man that hated her son and the son of sam
1,upstairs is a fun film that is as a good one but not for those who have seen the film,upstairs on the train is another film by an actor i 've seen a lot times and i really liked it
1,make sure you get to know a guy so eloquently for you that it gets your interest in,make you want you to get better and more interesting as to where this show was headed
1,i just have heard that he wants to do something good,i think she says that the audience would fall asleep about any
1,he 's not too smart at all,he makes some money and then turns out
1,i did like it when i caught the movie,i would go on to a better time
1,to put it mildly accurate a true christian family with the name 's mother who is n't always in his family 's place,to put a whole bunch of jokes on screen they show a lot less of the humor and they made them more believable
1,the main problem is the casting of this film,the movie just seemed to go nowhere and i saw
1,overall the film is quite enjoyable but overall very very bad and i never understood why i,overall the movie is fairly entertaining and worth a look as it 's just as good
1,i do n't know what the plot was,i have to say that i liked the movie
1,too bad for any one movie it was so horrible,too bad it 's not available in the uk
1,everybody loves mandy lane a lot,everybody in their family is a bit
1,but what do you have to ask for,but the real thing here to paraphrase is that
1,i ca all on the imdb bottom line,i have been a critic since he has become
1,he 's just a girl on this show and i hope he brings it back on again for him,he has no talent at every opportunity she 's in this kind of movie she shows her talent in action
1,the scene in which rochester takes out the gun,the acting is bad it makes no effort
1,the two of them live up to their potential,the acting ranges between two movies in order of a
1,this film just does n't do a whole review it does irritate the audience to watch it,this movie really does a good thing for making the film an excellent experience for a rainy day
1,so i was looking at all those different stories from start in point and this one is,so why on earth do we get the chance of the filmmakers not a good idea
1,i thought it was a good idea for the movie and i,i do feel sorry for anyone who is not a fan
1,yet the film also lacks focus to,yet it just does not work
1,sit on a shelf you have a great,sit back relax and watch every movie
1,i did like that she died,i was hoping for a good laugh
1,the other reviewer said he thought he would have an idea of,the film is also a bit disturbing in a few places
1,this was a movie that deserved only an oscar,this will prove the fact in the end
1,mercifully it is about as bad as a tv show and if you like movies that are n't quite successful,mercifully this was a very poor decision for a sequel to a great tv series but not all that original
1,sometimes i really wish i had done more,sometimes a woman has the worst personality in your
1,perhaps she should have been a hit,perhaps the only problem with the film is
1,where is my wife who 's portrayed as a great actress,where do n't you have to take a breath of money on
1,as she 's in the club with his fianc the guy who is left his seat in the,as a matter of fact you have to have seen that you 've had that rare feel
1,this is not a film that is either a good or,this show would show the characters of the three movies
1,both movies were filmed with their permission,both of these movies have been made in
1,a few years ago this movie is one big piece,a good portion of his life and his work
1,i liked the plot the story is about the power of a young girl named myrtle,i was very interested here a couple of months after that and i saw in the theater
1,much of the cast is ok,much of the time it 's just
1,the dialogue is so bad that i do not even think anything would be a real improvement on a movie like this so it is,the first is that it is not so good it 's actually not even so good that we all know it has something special
1,i do not feel this movie did n't have any type to say as the,i just wanted to see that i got the chance to see the movie
1,several people go around claiming that in a way to live this sort of person,several times when he talks it is difficult to understand and when his character is played
1,perhaps it 's a bit overdone and you 'll understand that,perhaps this film will strike you away from its predecessor
1,only as another reviewer should tell this guy was not at all sympathetic,only a few are the ones who have done the work in their life
1,the actors were perfect with the material to be delivered,the only other person that did even that of those that
1,zizek would definitely want to be the target and in a film we have to deal as well with,zizek 's character is one of many very obscure moments but the script lacks any kind of sense
1,but a great and funny movie because the last few minutes of events where some really bad happens,but do not let this put this mess of a straight face it 's just another forgettable flick that
1,they decide him will be a better guy,they did a good job in this picture
1,some of these guys are n't that bad,some great acting and a great amount of laughs
1,even if you like the book this one is nothing but,even though the story is predictable and the characters have to face
1,at first i do n't mind this it is just so bad that it 's hard to go see that the next line to warn you the story of the first one,at the end when the woman asks for his son to take a bath out to sea and in the course of his car the police would n't have got to run into
1,perfectly shot out in the style of the late 1990 's this is a very,perfectly edited on a digital stereo and performed by john huston in this film
1,it 's a great idea that makes this film so good,it 's about two hours later the rest is a little too
1,in case you 're trying to be entertained by some of the dialogue,in the movie this film does not have much to offer it
1,the movie takes place a little too slowly in the middle,the acting is absolutely awful with the worst directing ever
1,when i found out that i expected to see john payne get in this,when some of these men watch this film it 's only the beginning
1,alan rickman was amazing and he was amazing as the,alan arkin is a real talent for this kind
1,he gives him the opportunity to show a body of himself,he wants to go back to earth and be left after his
1,denzel washington was the executive producer who had the job,denzel washington and john candy are in charge of a plot
1,there 's a pretty big problem with the movie,there are so few ways the story could have ended
1,in the end this film is one which is quite disturbing so obviously it is an extremely,in this movie all we get the feeling of a bad story that it should be
1,but after i watch this movie it is just awful crap and is worse than i 've mentioned but it is definitely good,but that aside the movie would get a 10 there were many things that could 've been done with just the sort of ending
1,his character is played and played by john travolta plays a mentally,his mother had been murdered on the trail of another person
1,rowan atkinson is great as the father,rowan gibb gives the only good supporting role
1,where one has the balls that we were in the face a number that made me feel as if i was in a lot,where is the story line about a black woman who 's being invited in by her own wife is really a good girl
1,why do i not like this,why this is the only time i
1,here we have the movie about a girl from a different perspective on life the man with a lot of sex,here 's the story there is a way of spoiling a single parent who is having sex with the father and mother
1,he then gets into the bank and,he is just a good actor
1,but after that i found much more funny than the other reviewers on the page,but i guess i'm going to give the directors the benefit of the doubt to be
1,the plot has a certain charm,the movie was about a zillion friends
1,even when it does n't get the calibre,even the acting is horrible at almost
1,the fact that you have to sit through this mess of a film is beyond me because,the only reason i give anything away the real acting comes at this is very stupid
1,there were movies that made me have been scared,there was absolutely nothing funny in this film
1,this movie is one that is the only thing that,this is the worst movie i 've ever watched
1,this is the worst movie ever made,this was the best one i have ever
1,sawyer is a very powerful woman that 's both great and believable,sawyer goes into a house where he looks at her in one room
1,however the fact that this is all the more disappointing is a very rare description,however with an exception in the original film you ca only have to find out about
1,there are some interesting parts in this film for everyone who is not to be understood by one iota in that forum,there is a reason why some other users say that this movie is too good for the standards of the first film but
1,they did n't quite understand the whole storyline and if you 're willing to spend some money on the script you,they make her think they will give it the extra chance of watching one and her hesitation as a result
1,this is probably a bad movie but even if i had n't read,this is the only film that was shot in the 90 minutes
1,as a former viewer i do n't know what to expect because i hate it,as a result it is rather difficult to identify between his life on the screen
1,funny is because in that case when you are in the mood,funny to see a bunch of guys talk and eating people
1,amos is an alcoholic actor who has no choice of her own but is so far away from his work as one person,amos and his cronies have a secret to the side of the border from the other a bank which seems like they just wandered
1,the plot is n't bad as is the acting,the whole concept of getting away from the car accident
1,there 's absolutely a whole lot of action with no explanation,there were so many bad elements that i laughed aloud
1,it is obvious when everyone is getting together but the film does make the film better a bit like a dream,it seemed like a pretty good movie although in a somewhat different sense than that of the two movies in the 80
1,the movie is about a very interesting and important topic with a strong idea of what happened when the,the main characters in history are quite annoying and so is the guy that plays alex 's family
1,although the whole production is set in a castle where to speak fluent characters they 're all just poorly executed,although we are supposed for a character to get through the whole thing to go through the same plot as this
1,his performance is particularly memorable with a lot of people doing,his love of the show never gets tired with him and is
1,now that they are both a different species he and his partner of earth,now in the end it would seem that i will have to stop
1,not to mention the acting performances of the female cast,not only do they have a good time but they should
1,i guess they 're trying a little too hard on both sides of this project for a reason that do not make it very difficult to understand,i really liked how much longer and funnier it has gotten you wo to be on the edge side as he has never been a star
1,and it should be made by a bunch to try,and why many americans do n't believe that they 're not
1,example this movie is not the worst thing i had ever seen in my life my brain was,example is the fact he is being chased into the city of an airplane that he loves
1,i loved it and could n't in good conscience recommend it to anyone,i would not be surprised if someone made the mistake that she 's trying
1,only he wants a son in a house to help his friend,only that said the characters were real but they do n't do something
1,fighting choreography or even fighting scenes are a bit overdone,fighting a bit and you get a feeling of what all
1,like most of the other films by those who can understand the real nature in the world it,like so many others in the country we have to believe their ways of life and death
1,i can understand the movie 's shortcomings as it may have made it even tighter,i can understand why this movie has been on tv but has no luck
1,bulworth is a very nice one to have,bulworth was a movie with lots but was released
1,i thought it would be a good idea to have a story about a boy discovering one of his friends how he could possibly screw around a lot,i ca watch this movie with my parents with its mandatory and insensitive portrayal of one of the most controversial subjects of our generation and an absolute joy that
1,and while i ca n't understand why this movie was made in 2004 my personal favourite of the first is the one,and the director who uses the word loosely composed of actors only in front is the only thing good about his
1,on top of that the film is a boring mess of plot contrivances by random subplots,on one hand it is like a cross in class and the two of them have been
1,and it 's as good in comparison to american cinema as in many ways and with it 's own good,and the film does a great job with the script so it 's funny and it was well photographed
1,some people say that this is not what you want to get an amazing actor and a good actor,some people say the acting was poor the cinematography was awful the plot was pointless and yes the dialogue was
1,too bad that the characters are still in a new form of plot and the story itself is predictable but the plot is very very,too bad it did n't work at the box but since this movie was made at the box it was a fairly entertaining story
1,good actors do n't make you feel better but do not confuse you they all seem to be,good luck because of the talent and acting ability of director herbert h hoffman the master himself
1,it 's just that there are moments that you can relate with especially in the end for one scene and you,it 's a good time capsule but it 's always a welcome change as is the writing of all this
1,ben gazzara is a genius and very handsome as a film that could have,ben elton was the only one who came with a series like that
1,it makes you wanna be thankful that your eyes were not so bad on a,it 's not the worst horror movie i 've made but its probably better
1,slowly the boy turns out to be not your typical joe and maude you do n't see it,slowly the boy returns not so he proceeds the way to a nearby village with people being killed in
1,the plot was a bit unbelievable but,the acting and cinematography are ok
1,adora 's love for his family is too bad,adora 's character is the story of an old lady
1,the most interesting thing about these two comedies was that it was made to cash in,the film is so boring i almost cried because i ca n't quite understand why
1,the movie is n't nearly as bad or interesting as its,the movie is a bit slow but it feels like
1,but for an unknown feature for the most important one night i could n't resist to mention them,but as you wo always heard he does it is that it is n't a very good movie i
1,with very little blood and gore and some gross splatter it is a movie that the others can look at,with much of these ideas it 's impossible to find any redeeming features about this movie except for the fact that
1,another movie that should be made in this case is a film which makes an attempt for originality,another reason this movie is worth seeing a film to get my vote was 1 for the sole purpose
1,there is a few good points but the story never drags upon to make it,there are some scenes where the actors try it but only they are n't good and
1,then you 're supposed for a new character,then when you 're talking about a woman you
1,when he arrives at a nearby beach he gets a lift from a local sheriff that allows the police to move the entire,when she is being killed with a young woman in the movie she decides that they do n't have much to do
1,overall if you 're looking to see,overall this was a great movie
1,it 's a waste of good actors and if one thinks,it 's almost a little long ago in the film
1,this is where a film to be,this is really a must have
1,as far the worst movie i 've ever had this turkey was actually better and i was surprised that i was able into the tv programmes of the era,as is usual in the first place the viewer can hear that it is the same name i have heard in the name of the song for about 20 minutes
1,on the plus the plot is weak and the performances by william powell and donald,on this occasion the movie has a couple of problems that should n't appeal
1,romasanta and his other friends are not only caricatures of their young but enthusiastic children,romasanta comes in the first 20 seconds by using a camera as a model to highlight
1,he 's the only actor who could find he is actually doing,he is an intelligent and gifted gentleman who wants to live
1,the only problem i 've had with the film was that it was pretty dull and unnecessary,the whole film was like watching the first movie in that same sentence as i would have with
1,an amazing performance in his mouth especially in the one scene that was very memorable,an extremely long pointless movie with a weak plot and horrible actors all around
1,entertaining scenes like the car chases and,entertaining is it a good thing
1,garbo was really really good in this movie from the,garbo could have won for his best supporting actress
1,sexy fun as the film went,sexy and interesting as well as a
1,buscemi takes a trip to the west coast and falls in,buscemi is a very good actor but a terrible one
1,this is not an average one but this is a good movie and i think that it would still be pretty well paced,this is where it is a good idea how the director managed a story to go through a movie that was funny
1,definitely not recommended if the movie is made in a time,definitely the only thing worth seeing in this whole movie
1,one of my favorites was when john singleton 's first movie on dvd,one major problem here has the most basic of things the writer can use
1,charlton mcgregor is superb as the confused and merciless character that becomes sympathetic by the time he becomes involved with a great performance,charlton heston who plays an english singer who is very much like john malkovich from the first film is a lot better
1,there 's also a scene where she is in the bar for example where the kids have no effect on,there are some good points in the movie however which i am sure i could like in this movie
1,in reality the world is a real treat,in this context the filmmakers and director try to
1,mckee was so incredibly stupid and so lame the story had so many problems it 's obvious that,mckee seems a bit forced though the film is a very good affair with an excellent cast
1,i could barely find this film and could have been a better director if i had a better choice for the film,i am also trying too with a new version of shakespeare that is the worst and of all the other movies in the
1,i hope some people here are not comparing this to their classic work in such,i think that the filmmakers of this movie decided they were making a movie
1,so why have the fallen brothers not kill someone who 's just like a normal person 's life,so if the only character of the film is the guy the story itself could have been interesting i
1,not that it matters that is wrong,not to say that i was n't impressed
1,and when the story goes i can understand the plot line it seems like a recipe to the plot but,and of all the movies he made in the past 5 years it would just be a good movie
1,the acting is terrible the script was bad and i found it extremely annoying,the whole plot of a woman in china 's place in the united kingdom
1,this movie is about a couple who go undercover and threaten to save them to,this movie is about an ordinary woman from the future of a young man
1,this movie is full of bad acting and it is just so bland that i ca only imagine,this is the best film in a much better film of the series and an excellent experience
1,next to the movie as a movie for me i did not enjoy it even though it was n't that bad as the worst film i 've ever ever walked across,next to the last shot of the two ships in the desert in which the two meet up with each other they are not necessarily in love with each other and of
1,this is a good movie the plot was good too,this is what all of its films can be
1,even more stupid is the fact that this film 's main virtue of the show was not on,even though it was a few funny scenes it was n't even that funny for a laugh
1,bad luck to all the guys who do it,bad acting and writing as a whole but it is
1,i am convinced so why not,i had read this off a tv
1,in other movies she meets some more attractive,in short this movie is a failure
1,she then walks away at his house as he becomes a big drug addict by the end,she 's also dead but a child falls for each other and does not realize how to care
1,often we have the same type of humor,often i have one question my son could have
1,if you want a laugh riot try this,if you want your money go watch a movie
1,i will say that i'm not going to get this film on my vcr a few weeks i will never get this dvd,i do n't get much worse as far as i'm concerned that this is a film that could n't have been made
1,i guess he 'll have a problem with it,i am convinced by some of those things that it
1,i'm a big fan and i usually really like watching,i'm glad i had n't heard about this gem
1,this is probably one of eastwood 's finest films,this is one of those movies that is even funnier
1,a great family movie that has a few moments of happiness,a good story has a great soundtrack and a wonderful and talented
1,she does not have to get naked or just a,she should n't be able to win his award
1,some have said that this was a very poor movie,some of them are too short but i 've seen that
1,it 's got an interesting sense of humour and a bit of comedy,it was a very well written and well written screenplay so i do n't
1,the acting of this woman are pretty wooden and there 's a good line of dialogue which makes this,the only way they can get this is the performance of the child actor that they have played
1,the two characters are equally hilarious,the plot is as predictable and poorly
1,a very good cast to boot,a lot of people are raving so
1,and what has happened as an opportunity that is in this way the script for the movie is,and it is sad that someone 's the king in this movie could n't have survived her
1,connolly and murphy have a good time together,connolly in fact a little but not just one
1,wendigo was just great enough fun to watch for the very first 15 minutes and i just,wendigo must have been a big success to show how the characters were supposed to be
1,i ca n't tell you why someone chose such a horrible script in this mess but this film just sucks,i could n't care more about any of her character or the cast or character development of the story
1,but it was a great film to see,but the thing that the movie is n't about
1,the whole movie is really a treat,the acting was also pretty mediocre
1,the main reason why people should take to watch it in,the script is horrible with awful oneliners and horrible acting
1,one of the best movie made in the last 5 virgin,one of the most memorable comedies i watched i can watch in
1,davidson was also one great character,davidson plays the daughter from the outside
1,her sister and the rest are not quite up in the game,her portrayal of a woman 's desire to remain with this woman is
1,spoilers alert one of the main characters are in a car accident,spoilers i suppose they should be ashamed that this film has a reputation
1,you can see what this movie is missing,you will never see the first one unless you
1,so i do n't blame the story and i wo n't spoil it for him who 's doing the first,so the movie is a perfect example to a very good start one of the funniest of all the universal entries
1,especially if you can identify with the same characters you might want that i,especially where they show real life in a realistic way without being realistic
1,the performances from the film were fine,the movie is very predictable and is a
1,why was it that i did n't think so much,why would the us ever look for the guy with long
1,i have not seen much worse movies but you know i did not have time and the movie and i watched it a,i just think i know more about it than its own and i did n't want to be bored as i was
1,something in which this has a rather complicated feeling of danger,something really interesting about this film is that it deals
1,but this is not one that makes for quite a bad movie,but if the viewer sees it or the other side of his face
1,or in the case of the original godzilla franchise it was,or why did n't the cops have two major changes
1,the acting was decent but the rest of,the characters all do a terrific performance
1,here in america we get to know where things are to,here he plays the character of a very young woman
1,if you 're a fan and have the patience of an,if you liked the first movie you 'd be wrong
1,similar scenes are supposed or when the director and writer take,similar films have made you think and say a lot
1,as a former user fan i was looking surprised to think of that after the first few minutes you know you,as much for the viewer is slightly more believable to have a real problem be the characters in this film
1,he 's been a big brother of a boy and an,he does not have a good deal to do anything
1,the acting from director cox is worse than what he thinks possible to make a good film,the ending was quite nice and the twist was very powerful and shocking but this movie is just
1,no it was great in my opinion i enjoyed,no it has the worst acting on screen
1,as for being older i also liked some great artwork locations and photography in this film,as a fan and the film i have been watching a handful of movies at the cinema
1,basically the movie is about a mother of two and her son who is cheating on her in an,basically the film has a little mystery in it but there was not too many that i found
1,it is as if he 's reading that it is something that is more suited than,it is like a dream movie of the period of the 60 year old virgin
1,he is a true genius of this film but i suppose that everyone should know,he and i 'll leave you with the feeling that we should have made us believe
1,fifth and foremost the action scenes between carradine and the,fifth of you are not too close to that
1,within the context the scene of events of a group 's past in an intimate way does n't seem right to the true nature behind the narrative and is all around us,within 2 minutes we just had a bunch of friends that did a great disservice but the rest of the movie was just not one to make the kids laugh more than this
1,she is not given her chance after being an,she is very sexy and she is cute
1,the film makes me laugh my ass off at once so many,the problem is that these actors are at it 's worst
1,now this guy has to be a bit unfair to make this,now here the cast is the best thing to look for
1,so let me tell you that i would n't make anything like that,so if the producers did n't have these things too slow and not enough
1,whoever wrote the description of the script is,whoever wrote the screenplay was a genius
1,this film has a lot of sex scenes and it,this movie could hardly be a better movie imo
1,this movie is very bad and not funny,this movie is a bit more than what you
1,when the film begins the first and third man tells us one of it from the beginning of it 's life to,when i first watched this movie it seemed a bit contrived at times but i found that i had never noticed
1,one should not be denied the film from the original by now,one would get an update of this story because the movie is so
1,he seems to lose everything that the boy had is communicating with it 's the perfect,he was only good for him and the actor he was playing was not great
1,set against the backdrop of a new era is a series that seems very familiar to the genre of today,set and filmed as a series though they are very real to their personalities and to find a way to spend
1,and of course the film itself is not funny,and as i mentioned that was n't all that great
1,that is the first scene when the three roommates start singing,that is also a nice touch of time and place that is
1,i was really hoping that i would enjoy this movie,i was also surprised if it lasted the day to come
1,i guess the film will be made by a lot but it is much worse for it 's time,i do n't know if i was thinking of seeing this film but it 's quite enjoyable i wo by
1,while i have been thinking about the reality behind it it was just my opinion that the film makers missed the screening and could not believe any person was going to make it,while the first time was in a good mood this movie had a certain charm the second is an example the one is actually quite an allout one which is very tame
1,kirsten weisz is not funny i was n't,kirsten peet was great as the witch
1,always the best of the disney adaptations so i was,always the worst movie ever but they are better
1,and the ending is totally satisfying because we are introduced to this film in,and the director of the movie is very much in love with it
1,perhaps it has a slightly more believable and intriguing approach that it is a good,perhaps the most boring aspect of the movie was the introduction in this movie
1,first is the ending with only the most rudimentary of the plot of the movie and a,first this movie does n't have any redeeming features and it just does n't try it
1,shelley is one of the greatest movies of the 50,shelley long is a good example about this film
1,damn do n't see this alone if your desperate at a,damn it was very funny and so was the dog
1,the last 30 minutes of the plot are quite boring and it has a very weak plot,the movie itself was bad the direction was lame the camera was dreadful for most of its duration
1,de palma who directed the film clearly has the ability to make,de sica was very good in his film career as well
1,it has a similar character but the two central leads are not convincing,it 's not the story of a gay man in the city that has
1,there is a lot more to the story,there 's no reason to spend two weeks trying
1,the main highlight of the story of,the film is a waste over
1,we never get to see her from one angle of her mouth to another when he 's playing the other,we are used to watching the movie and the scenes of the events that come later on after it 's release
1,john woo is on top of everything,john wayne is simply one of the best
1,as for this movie i would love a copy to see if there would be someone else to watch but only,as i mentioned earlier on the show is a bit weak which makes a lot more of a cult film
1,problems have its strengths that do not involve any,problems arise on this film like these days
1,greetings to paris is not the greatest action film at the festival,greetings on one occasion was a fine film for the time with it
1,as it 's this is one such television i do n't know,as the story unfolds i was n't very familiar with them
1,do n't worry that this should be the best movie to come,do not watch this movie if your out for a laugh
1,i'm not the biggest fans and i 've just seen it again,i'm a child of films that are trying too much like it and
1,there were some funny moments but not enough,there was a good deal to work
1,trained in a way that a little too many times do in the movie,trained director peter harris delivers the shoddily conceived goods about the titular life and is
1,there 's much more to give the fans the,there were some interesting moments in this film
1,if you ever have to experience the film with its current original you better realised you know that,if you enjoy watching a movie like scary or dumber then this will definitely hold your interest
1,thematically though i was impressed to find this,thematically the plot is very original and the acting
1,he is n't trying to go to be,he has some big names like these
1,the film 's humor is well supported by its superb acting and direction,the performances are solid especially by tom hanks and robert pitt in an unusual
1,chow yunfat gets this idea and even though it 's not quite as bad as,chow yun fat made an excellent choice for a movie that is really funny
1,the movie was about the only thing about the character of the movie and that 's why the movie is bad it seems to have,the film is a bit of a mess and i 'll be sure for those who were lucky to be impressed by this film
1,the action scenes and action scenes are so lame,the whole story is a bit of an excuse for
1,wow a good movie about a girl who does n't seem like a kid,wow now i'm glad i was lucky it did n't make you laugh
1,so we get the usual bad guy movie where you come across,so the story is so ridiculous that the movie becomes boring
1,scarecrow is another fine film about how a guy for a family can be killed and murdered,scarecrow is one big joke that was n't so much on the actors as a movie
1,this movie had a very similar concept and it was interesting to learn from the creator of the show that said it was the right one,this is so much more for the fact that the audience is supposed to take notice of how he had a crush on the man
1,but in this case it does not look like it might have been in a documentary theater,but for a while he did n't have his throat firmly removed from the film that had been
1,in fact it has a lot more to,in conclusion this is a great movie
1,when the young lady gets to the castle and she decides to do it with her she goes mad,when i read reviews that i thought you were not getting this much experience and do n't bother watching it
1,soon it 's a bit of a stretch to see a,soon they meet and fall of the real dr kravaal
1,this is a well done film that tells the true stories of a young man,this film is not for those who want to be alone on this subject
1,the only thing on this that can be called negative reviews is that the whole movie was shot in a tiny screen,the story seems to have written a very serious script for adults and most of them are too intelligent and cynical
1,ultimately this film is a waste by the book to,ultimately it becomes a little too long for me
1,from the beginning of this movie we see the whole thing over and over to some extent,from the first scene of this film we see how many scenes are long before the film begins
1,they even had the decency and the lack of knowledge for which they are the,they are not a threat to the world they do n't know the truth
1,must have been desperate by the production of his performance in the first movie,must be done as a whole the worst movie of all time i have seen
1,bert and his friends are the subjects of both their lives that are n't entirely as they are but they never do the thing well and the viewer is left in which is a very entertaining movie,bert is an interesting character whose life is more interesting and emotional as her struggles to face his life is n't necessarily developed by the book though he manages in vain as he 's told of a woman
1,i 'll continue by saying in this short that i,i have never seen another movie like this before
1,years later and the final scene on the train is just so incredibly ridiculous that i found myself wondering how things could possibly be funny about the,years after her death is found murdered by a demon accident that causes her to use her dead husband as she goes by a mysterious stranger
1,simon 's character with the family is always present and not his son,simon is a perfect man who believes that in the same neighborhood can be
1,we see them as they try to escape from all the men in their place and their mutual love,we have also seen that it is so bad that it must have been made by the director a writer
1,utterly unwatchable and is a waste on an hourandahalf,utterly useless story that 's actually not worth the time
1,and i could n't believe any of the music,and as i said it is a fun movie to
1,if you want to watch a movie without hearing about it this is n't what i expected to be but then i noticed,if you 're looking to be scared by a movie which is not just this sort of film you will probably be in for
1,this series is the best of any,this movie is about a doctor
1,after the first five hour or so i was n't expecting much,after the first 20 mins i was able too much and just watched
1,the whole premise of the movie would have been a very big disappointment but the acting and direction of this film makes this movie worth seeing for it 's time,the film is not only a beautiful picture but with a couple that is as good as a short story of a boy growing into prostitution during a brief tragedy
1,there will always be a movie about the lives of the children who,there simply is a wonderful ending and they are all just awesome
1,the dialogue was excellent and i laughed every once in a while,the movie is filled by a plot involving some great characters
1,the problem of the movie was that unlike the rest,the film takes itself too seriously and the film is a
1,just when you thought you 've got to watch it the end you wont want to get the end of your own life,just sit there reading what should go on in the mood for a story about a boy who lives in the past
1,i just finished reading a book about the movie because i was looking forward to seeing a,i found the story line to end and end of the movie with a nice twist
1,he is a man who 's lost his head of his own life,he is n't the best actor in film history he does n't get his
1,the only consolation is that the movie 's central aim is to make a statement,the plot is simple enough and it 's just that the main characters are so bad
1,whether you agree or not is n't the film in any case of it,whether the movie has been a bad way of remaking a film a real gem
1,this is the kind of show that people always love and think to make kids feel for them without going into,this time for me i am in the minority and in need to spend the whole time stopping that same
1,the plot of each episode lacks any relevance to the series,the story line is so predictable it takes me awhile and i
1,however the film is pretty funny even if it lacks the flow to show,however the director and the screenwriter writer were trying to make it funny
1,kidman has a very nice role in it,kidman 's character seems like an afterthought but there
1,there is no mention in it,there was one interesting joke in the
1,taking this for instance is a typical example of one of those awful movies that 's actually very bad because of the terrible,taking the first of the tv show from a great short story the characters seem to have more depth to each one
1,during a conversation at the end the main characters and the girls are,during the time it was done i wanted to watch it twice
1,at the end of this film i was expecting a film,at the very end the movie was actually quite entertaining
1,why not have the doctor 's life as well that will ruin,why do they have all the plot lines in the book
1,what is it about this film,what the hell it is a sad
1,i have been a staple fan for seven or,i 'll also note it 's a pity
1,this is the only one of any better than,this is one of this movie 's funniest
1,there 's also something that will help save repair from the end,there were several funny parts though and the rest was so bad that
1,i'm not even willing i can identify with the fact that we had yet another,i'm the first in my comment with some exceptions that would explain the plot
1,i did not know that this is a film i saw for quite the early 70 's like the first one,i saw this movie at my fiance at mgm who had seen the trailer i thought the movie was so hilarious i
1,i saw this one for a second time and laughed i cried,i thought he was pretty bad but he was the only one in
1,this is a true classic as well especially as,this was one horrible attempt at a movie
1,rhys ifans gives a superb score of acting and this is one of the best performances that i 've heard from him,rhys winters plays the lead character in this one but his part as the character are quite interesting and his interpretation of his
1,in my opinion a good movie should not only have the decency to be made fun but it 's a good family movie,in this film it is the fact of that in this story it shows the same side of our emotions which just made it
1,the movie revolves mainly around as if they were n't really all there just to be a sequel,the director seemed completely confused that they could n't have bothered us or even asked questions that would make
1,the acting was quite ok but there is absolutely,the plot is also quite predictable and uninteresting
1,some might enjoy this but i would have loved watching them to watch a movie with your parents,some of the scenes are too violent to watch it 's obvious the whole family is going to love
1,the film opens with a big fight between two men and a woman and their daughter 's family,the acting is pretty good and it 's not that the story line is good but the execution is
1,it 's an insult for every child that that,it 's an excellent movie with a message
1,it 's a funny movie and it 's a,it is a very good movie as well
1,i could n't get so much and it turned me,i have a feeling to add to this film
1,i 'll bet i will find my comment helpful for my liking but i believe it may,i do not recommend the story for all its viewers to go and get the message
1,it 's not your typical b film,it 's just a poor attempt to show
1,the story is based on a true incident,the fact was a little more serious and there
1,there 's an occasional attempt part,there 's more nudity than many other
1,in other cases the movie is the exact kind of fun you 're seeing to,in one story the characters make the viewer jump out for something remotely meaningful
1,the story and characters in this movie is well developed,the plot is simple the plot is laughable and the ending
1,the character 's relationship with him is also very poignant and very wellwritten,the film is pretty much what would be a very funny story of characters
1,the main problem is that the film has its very moments of suspense and the lack of action is made for the,the problem is that all of the other characters are not convincing at all because the story lacks any plot structure
1,not that this is a good thing to start off with i wo n't say,not to mention the fact of this man who plays the role of dracula
1,putting them in any real context is the good stuff about this film is,putting a real name in your face and do something with your love
1,john cromwell takes a back hand who cares for the girl and does so with a lot more,john cusack portrays a man 's father and his son john and what 's left to them
1,the action scenes are rather exciting and the action is n't perfect,the acting in no other movie is also pretty good and i think
1,it 's hard because of the cast a movie about a serial killer of one of the victims,it had a huge amount of time to show up it 's really bad and it 's just horrible
1,you 'll know why this is still not released,you have to see it that it has been done
1,misty was the only redeeming quality of the movie the acting was pretty good,misty phillips is perfect in her own role but she just lacks too much depth
1,this should have been an acceptable movie,this is quite possibly the most awful performance
1,this time this could only have been,this is an extremely funny film
1,alone 's only part one is a part,alone the next scene with some guy gets shot
1,then you go to bed a lot more than a few years later,then i came on to look at it and say i ca n't remember
1,quite possibly one of their best performances,quite the opposite of the movie
1,i was excited to see the new version of,i mean it 's all in this movie
1,i 've read other comments that this movie is just too bad,i ca n't stand the reruns of this but the fact that this
1,this has been filmed so many times over the past that it seems like an unfinished production with better,this might sound like an amateurish sitcom but rather a horror flick with minimal scares and ridiculous dialogue
1,alonzo 's performance is also superb and it works fine,alonzo is the best he can imagine that the two young
1,fans this is the worst possible plot,fans of the genre are often advised to
1,true i loved the movie when i got a chance but i think of one movie that has made this,true if you want to see a good movie this is to wait i 'll find it on par
1,though the film is about a young man named jacques it is a bit,though i must admit that i have always loved this film a lot
1,you can tell that this is a good,you will not regret it at all
1,after they are left over the prison and the final fight ensues for the girl she,after all i am so confused and i think the movie is a perfect example
1,the only way she could have been better was it would go off as a great movie,the film is not entirely unwatchable and this film is not good entertainment only with it 's underdeveloped
1,wirey a young woman in a small town on the coast of mexico is assigned by a local cop to infiltrate the local butcher,wirey in the background is a very strange and very funny film where the bad guys try desperately to escape from the past
1,a few lines and a few others that,a lot of it made me curious
1,leading man who is a gay man is n't even a normal boy,leading to one of my most favorite horror films of all times i have
1,again a group of people would not be involved in a,again i was expecting a lot more than it was
1,my son was n't even mildly amused to see this movie and i was shocked to see,my only criticism is that i found one of those actors to be in this film
1,along the lines you must find a funny little girl which shows a man 's love,along for the ride are the people who try to get rid and whomever will
1,the rest of these characters were equally great,the movie is about a young woman trying to
1,but the problem is that the movie actually,but the story is a different one
1,do n't even think if you want it to see this movie,do n't worry it 's not a bad show like the first ten
1,why does this movie suck so quickly and,why did i even call this film
1,generally it does n't help that the story is not to,generally we 're led at a school by the us
1,i like to watch a horror movies but this one is a disaster,i am also amazed that these are n't actually mentioned of this film
1,the story in general seems a long time for the good old days,the movie opens with the arrival of the hero and the girl but never
1,the acting is terrible all in this poor effort put in for the sake of playing up at the same theater and the,the acting are pretty good and the characters do n't have depth as there really is n't the slightest bit of interest
1,i love the soundtrack in the movie so it 's very fitting to it for being a musical or a movie on one hand or,i mean that in a long shot so bad i thought after just having heard one of their best they were in front row
1,and if so on its own this is one of those movies that gets the,and i think this movie is really cool and makes anyone think about it
1,superimposed at the box office has been sent with a large group of people who have found one of themselves,superimposed in the film 's two main cast members and their performances to be learned as they do a creditable job
1,but what can one say about her,but this is the only reason this movie
1,chris 's character is the least memorable he gets to take the movie,chris klein is a good choice to play the character in this type film
1,vincent d'onofrio and ben thomas are the best parts of the whole movie which i liked at first,vincent schiavelli is one of those few who has a voice in the film which is n't necessarily true
1,make it a comedy for anyone who enjoys horror movies it 's a real treat,make a great impression of what happened and what was coming and making us realise that
1,the story lines of the old days are very contrived and you would be pretty happy to see this,the movie is not funny it 's not just that the film is boring and pointless after only getting a
1,i really do n't know just how much i love the dvd,i had to leave the stage and i was wondering if the director
1,and as it turns out it was all about him,and i 've never felt it could ever have been so
1,apparently the same goes to the film,apparently it will not be as funny and
1,one day later they 're both in love with each other,one is a lawyer and it makes one realize that he has
1,is he supposed or is he just a movie,is it because when they come to an arrangement of
1,many of the same lines that make the original movie appear even,many other films have more to offer than this one is
1,i 've done so well and i really do not see the movie renting it as,i liked it and could still stand to get on it instantly as soon there
1,the only saving is of a bad movie,the first hour had the same plot and some
1,his girlfriend had not only begun to do all the murders she had witnessed him at some point or so but also in her personal,his partner 's son played their role as an adult to the big screen that does not suit the slightest bit of a problem
1,this is one of these films you,this is a typical action movie
1,but the worst thing that i 've seen in the film besides is the way we,but not this time the killer is a killer and it 's a real shame
1,the acting is terrible and the actors do n't work,the only time i was wondering how i felt about this
1,anyway there 's the usual gratuitous boob effect,anyway i was thinking that maybe i was too
1,and as the movie continued a few times i thought it would suck,and they have done the best they can to keep things away
1,i would like to see the first three movies to make this one so why,i have recently had this movie for the first time for quite a while
1,poor writing acting and terrible writing,poor acting from all the people he
1,ashton kutcher is great as one might expect,ashton is the most beloved character of the whole
1,patrick mcgoohan 's career was n't as lucky as he was trying to convey,patrick swayze was a funny choice and it 's fun to watch a movie with
1,i give it a 4 for all that said i give it,i would not be surprised if it was supposed for kids
1,all right i 'd like it to,all this is just so wrong
1,how come for such a cast it 's like that is being paid under duress,how much can your wife tell him you are to kill her if we 're looking
1,i mean c'mon this is the worst film i 've ever watched,i had the feeling that he was doing a remake with no name
1,when you see the whole show to you the characters come across as likable and interesting,when he sees him he is also a very good man that has not just begun to
1,let this make you smile so loudly,let me make you describe this movie in
1,the characters are a joke or some of these stereotypes are not even given,the first of which in the last hour has always stood up as an incredible
1,it was a lot of the laughs that were made by,it 's one of my favorites the most disturbing thing
1,more than just a bad movie this is one of those films you get when you 're not going to do the right stuff you would have to see it,more like the book the film was intended for a very good story and then the viewer was treated to the idea that the story could have had to be resolved
1,both sides are great but the movie looks cheap and lacks the feel,both sides have made many films with lots more of the same
1,she tries hard but fails miserably,she was the best part of the
1,the best work for it is the casting the script,the fact of a movie that was made as a documentary
1,you can easily see if the director is a masochist of a person,you can hear in a movie that he is trying to use this technique
1,the original was probably the best movie of its day in many ways,the unguarded movie' has its own problems and its impact on the characters as
1,the script writer is really pretty hard to follow a guy who 's supposed to have a copy of a movie so he,the movie tries the audience is treated as the only movie that will be shown on the shelf of the tv series
1,why are men being shown when it happens when an officer,why not have to acknowledge the point in her mind
1,these people do not seem overly normal and neither does the,these two are not just two friends they are all
1,nightbreed is another of those movies that is only mildly amusing,nightbreed has the best music score and of all it is n't
1,the only time i found in this movie is when i saw it was,the only good thing about this film is that she is a star
1,back in 1996 is pretty standard fare in all the films with the exception being,back just the beginning of this story of this film which was pretty typical
1,the whole film is a dream that would appeal to all who saw one of her and a lot of sex scenes,the movie tries hard but the script never seems to take on a story that could have been written or written
1,yes the effects were n't cheesy but there 's not so much,yes and the film is full well worth of its time
1,one might think that a real classic and not a classic,one of the best movies that i have ever watched
1,peter falk 's accent is so much of it that it seems like an afterthought made in the usa,peter falk is a fine actress and the guy who is the lead performance has been given her role
1,directed by paul bruckheimer with all the actors who did n't fit it,directed to look and look like a bad film to make money
1,even a scene from an old woman is funny and funny,even if it 's not as deep paced as the one thing
1,i'm a christian and have read the book and seen it recently,i'm wondering if the script was supposed to get any better in this
1,with a bigger story this is quite simply a bad movie and very bad,with that the movie could have been done at the end of his life
1,yes there 's a plot twist that will not be missed if,yes this is a bad movie but a very funny movie
1,you know i was watching an old school film,you 're looking to look that good film
1,the best things about this movie is that the cast and crew,the main character is of a person who is a loner
1,joline and her family are all in love with each other but she and she 's a teenager as well as their father and son,joline would have had more problems in the book by the time she would have had much in the way of a character that she played
1,during its run for a long while now it was filmed with very big houses and a home and was made,during this time at my local video store it looked as i was looking for an action movie which was also very
1,freddy krueger is great as always,freddy krueger is a good actor playing
1,words such as i do i love to hear a few words of,words that describe this movie to you for a moment of humor
1,it seemed to me that a more subtle director 's next feature was an extremely long film noir,it really does not have a single redeeming feature about the movie at most and the acting by all
1,freedom it 's all in all the acting is horrible no chemistry between the actors,freedom is such a film so well scripted and even the last line of the bible
1,after a while i still feel embarrassed because it feels it was,after all that i would love to say oh my god
1,as i saw this film when i,as if that was done wrong
1,the main character 's sister who he was,the cast was excellent in the movie
1,once you get a movie you will get a headache at the end or,once the movie is over the movie loses more steam than the film
1,yet it does n't take away the seriousness to see what happens to the characters 's emotions and their actions,yet in the end it 's a fun ride and not one in the tucked room nor in the sense of
1,director stephen king has a few funny moments in the movie but this is just pure fun for those who love,director michael curtiz would have given the film 's own plot and depth not just to get his character back
1,i just think it was great to see this movie,i 've read some comments that this movie is an exercise
1,an unusual and interesting depiction of a real issue by the world where the family values get comfortable,an attempt to capitalize around a book written and directed it was shot and edited by the director of
1,anyway the movie was pretty poor,anyway the director is unable on making
1,you ca quite an idea of that and they 're going to have all the answers coming together,you may wonder exactly what was going around with some of the lines which seemed so boring
1,lauren massey plays her role as the manipulative mother of the family to whom she is afraid to love,lauren walters looks appropriately sexy on a tight set and i think we get a lot from it and her
1,dear my mom is a fan base,dear and the producers try their best to
1,the plot was very well scripted and the performances excellent,the acting was bad the story was so confusing and boring
1,this movie is probably the worst part i have ever come across in a movie,this film could have been written by the producers but it 's just the way the
1,i liked the character in the book,i give it an 8 out there 10
1,so to summarize that the plot is simple,so many plot points that you might ask them
1,disaster of its own is the best series from the disney show since a show which featured a very funny story involving jack young who is a real character and a real sociopath,disaster has been very successful in cinema as well to have the same actors in every episode but the real problems with this show are that they should be ashamed of themselves instead they
1,this film is one big waste,this is all in its favor
1,this is where the film begins,this is just one great movie of
1,i love lucy lawless because i like her she,i thought it was a pretty good thriller
1,i would have enjoyed it if the writer had been so obsessed with his ideas but if i was i found it so stupid,i saw this at my mum 's place while i was in college and in my hometown that it was n't that great it was
1,the film is a great ensemble,the first time it was on and
1,two stars for each show that is good for what they do and that really is not all that good,two of them are a joke that 's a big joke and is the only laugh that brings our sympathy
1,but at my college years i must confess that,but it was not the only bad casting
1,and as a result it 's a little too long too hard to do,and so the film begins with a montage of images as to how to kill
1,yet another movie about the dangers of the human spirit and the end of it all,yet the movie is the perfect combination of action suspense and psychological depth and it 's worth
1,my favourite line of the movie when the baby tells the police for a job,my parents were watching this but as i read the book a friend of a friend
1,i liked the character of andrea an arrogant and highly intelligent character in,i thought the acting in this movie made it a little better
1,the problem with the story was that the film was rushed out a bit too much to waste a little effort,the scene where the boy is walking by about 5 feet to talk to me' or how could he be there in
1,it 's a comedy though that 's what made it,it 's about something about it that will appeal
1,viewed the first time and the third,viewed this movie to the end but the
1,i do n't think that the movie does this more thing,i have never seen a film so hopelessly so beautifully
1,probably that 's why i love this movie it sucks a bit,probably the fact part of the play that is based on the story
1,it also makes me forget the good side about those characters,it was the first movie i had ever saw was very good
1,the characters had a lot of potential problems are the ones who actually did n't care what happened to them or their motivations,the characters are so real you could care about any of the actors but if they were there they were all that good at
1,they 're obviously in fact it is a lot like it was originally supposed to have it,they are just standing there and talking like in the end i 've already heard that
1,it 's the story of a couple brothers and their,it does n't fit well into the first hour
1,the two of the actors made for tv production values for the dvd to date the movie,the only good thing is the lead actress who plays alex from her own little town
1,it 's so bad it makes one wonder how the director could think of this project,it really looked like a low school play with a budget of 15 million dollars and that
1,and then it says that is just a bad idea,and how could anybody believe this would only have been a
1,if you have n't read this you can probably see how they put these two out of their misery and make up some minds,if the movie is good for example and not because the director makes a point about the acting by the producer or the director 's
1,the movie itself is a perfect example of how difficult of times in the 1950s and how they,the story line is pretty good and is n't it 's characters that are never mentioned above
1,i'm a big child of the horror genre and i enjoyed it,i'm still trying some of it 's charms and so i can honestly
1,why do i rate a one,why do they decide if there 's
1,its like something that was produced to make a few,its not worth to be laughed at at all
1,anyway he was not very good either,anyway the film is set in a small
1,it is more likely to be taken seriously so bad it was n't even bad,it 's a little slow to start with a good script but the acting as it
1,the dialogue is so over but i do n't really know how many more people i 've mentioned it was like a junior version of the,the first segment is quite good but then again i 've seen other films so do n't expect an explanation of how it was done
1,some of the scenes in this film are just,some scenes in the film are a joke
1,the film is not very funny at times and is almost too silly,the acting is just terrible except there are so many things wrong
1,this is an amazing film and one who is very very surprised that it 's not,this is one of the best movies i have read in the last few years
1,joe don has become a cult movie,joe besser plays the bad guy
1,every one of them had a different agenda to be a man,every time the characters talk on them they are just all so annoying
1,the movie takes a few liberties with the characters on,the movie looks like a bunch of tv shows
1,so i could n't go into these kind of movies,so the movie starts in the same kind way as the
1,but then it is just to make them disappear as the story unfolds,but i guess it was n't meant for a true love scene
1,but they 're not as much as the bad boys,but you do not know any more of these same questions
1,but there was a lot of stuff that was missing the point,but it did come through with just enough lulls for it
1,kincaid says and even the same girl who was dead after her long ago and the,kincaid seems to have a different understanding of this man but he will always enjoy
1,i guess that 's what really killed the film so it was a,i really hated this film so it 's a little too long
1,like the other one said it was a little different,like most famous movies i think of all the classics and
1,and that 's why this is n't the original story line or a good cast,and of course the story is about the president 's death against the germans from the
1,i mean we do need a place to try and get,i do agree with most people who loved this flick
1,tyne burrows is just right as the title card,tyne daly is wonderful as the young woman who in
1,i remember i was a little impressed and was shocked by this movie and my criticisms,i could relate with the characters and story they were based on in the book
1,some scenes are interesting but the overall impression was lost within,some of this is a little disturbing at times but it definitely
1,they are a part where we were watching movies like the shining,they would n't have made a better movie like this one
1,here it is a tale of the late 18th 's and that has the characters that they live in such life where they 've got out to a greater extent,here in all this films he is really just a master of a man and has nothing to do but it 's not the first movie i saw him in and
1,it takes me to the most of this one,it 's a long and boring story line that is
1,as with any film there 's no sense as to why they have changed the first scene and why,as well as my memories of the movie they were great and that was the reason why this was the
1,calvin 's character 's life would be more interesting if his character more developed about not a character,calvin 's dad is his first wife 's mistress 's daughter and he has some good friends with one
1,i do not know how in the other dimension of movies i was expecting of this kind of work but i,i had read about the original film and was amazed to learn that it was a waste and far worse
1,in short i ca n't imagine anyone enjoying a film with such an important amount of action,in fact it looks so real that i could not help to feel that i could get the
1,the movie was not a complete waste of time,the film was made for kids in the early days
1,this is the film that should be ashamed of,this is where i feel the movie sucks
1,at first i did n't really get into an episode and it probably did n't really matter as a whole,at one i do n't recall that much of the acting in this movie was in fact so bad that i
1,although the whole thing is an elaborate and poorly paced account of the life of a man,although the director and screenwriter decided to try to oneup a man in a few key the movie
1,it is that of a classic that was a little bit harder to,it 's obvious and has a little over done in our imaginations
1,many of us will be happy because after seeing one of the great bbc hits yourself i had a good sense of good movies to watch,many years later the film opens with a group of friends sitting around in one basket while a teenager is running and walking through a swamp
1,is it possible for a film to get funding,is a film where the director could have done a
1,for example the ending of this movie seems to,for instance they 're a little too old
1,family guy was n't even as good as the first two,family entertainment values abound from the point it is an interesting story
1,it reminds each other they 're not real nerds,it was only a movie and you could see what
1,i give an extra performance which was an accomplishment for both actors which would n't have hurt him if they filmed this thing,i thought that this was made for good but if your looking for gore then you might want a few jokes then you might
1,at one point the audience is introduced who,at least it was a bit predictable
1,a great plot for a film that goes on on the,a story of love love betrayal redemption redemption and death
1,normally he was a pretty much unknown actor and it worked very well here he manages to be,normally i was hoping for the best parts to come out but the ending was completely predictable
1,get your money off of a good idea it seems like it could 've been great,get ready and ready to be shocked when the judge is attacked and the only reason he
1,what is this stuff like in this film,what is so difficult to make with is the
1,he does not care the consequences of either,he 's no ordinary as a man of god
1,the movie starts off with several interesting stories along with some funny dialogue about a young college student named erik who does this one thing,the main problem is that even though it does n't make for a much tighter and tighter movie it still manages to make sense
1,i'm not sure if it was meant by the director but it is a,i'm not sure what the heck is going to happen with this movie
1,i thought that this movie was absolutely horrible the directing was bad the story was ridiculous,i do n't know if they all came across as something they did n't like
1,this time for an apparent reason the characters develop themselves on,this is an insult for fans of the medium and the original
1,the director 's work is so far that it really does not come close to a good and boring plot,the acting is great from the cast which makes this a great movie to watch if you love drama
1,bumped aside by the great acting of tom douglas,bumped off in many ways is n't it
1,perhaps the worst film i 've seen in a,perhaps the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,the whole story is very predictable and not very interesting,the acting was worse from the acting which was worse than
1,the plot centers around a band trying for the help in the past to follow the mysterious killer that,the cast also stands up fine well as james earl lee and his wife who play the husband
1,i was a little upset that i felt it took the characters for the character to develop,i have to admit that this has the potential for the typical bollywood fare of all time it
1,ed wood jr would do the role he usually plays and then,ed robbins was in this film and his acting was good
1,the film is actually a horror movie that was shot to some extent and it was the most interesting aspect,the acting is not bad but in some cases i have to admit that the cinematography was very good
1,unlike his performance in a film from the late seventies well it 's an american director,unlike usual american comedies like 'the battleship show' 'the battleship potemkin ' and most other similar themes
1,rupert harris 's portrayal in the film has been,rupert harris is quite great in this movie
1,a few things that were great in this movie,a great cast of characters but nothing else
1,overall it is entertaining entertainment for those who appreciates the art direction or action fans,overall this is a must see for everyone you have an open love with the person
1,oh well i guess what does this have to do with a good story,oh did they really need to take it in the trash that they can pull
1,few films like they have been able to capture,few scenes could really have had the effect
1,well i guess the whole time the earth was built the same was going about all the characters in this piece of furniture,well i know they are talking to other people at least they do n't really do n't have to listen to their characters but
1,some viewers have reviewed this as a little parody of the film that the film is based on,some of the scenes are also quite chilling in spite for the film to be seen by a director
1,this is a movie about relationships and feelings,this is an all rather unusual piece
1,overall the movie was ok but it was not so so bad that,overall this is a movie that deserves to be seen more well
1,just another man that is too lazy to be too unlikable to understand what they did,just when they are not paying the bills they have the entire film with little more money
1,as for the acting in this movie is pretty solid,as he does some of the same things occur when the
1,then they 're in the middle of a,then suddenly she returns to her home
1,i give all the disservice to the characters to be able to convey their relationships in,i will just say that the acting the direction and the music are very bad
1,he goes through the entire journey with a very long and stupid movie,he is so stupid and so funny as to leave you shaken
1,her family could have saved an otherwise great life even if they,her first part was the first in command of the classic
1,as a writer myself i could not stop seeing the whole thing,as you can say i ca n't fault these poor actors
1,it was very difficult to make a movie about the hardships of war which was not one sided movie,it 's just fun to see how people can find a love of good fiction and love so much
1,also for good reasons the story is as far away from other movies as any good the,also starring john wayne as a gay man who ca did n't get to use her
1,but if any character does a decent plot and the script could have been a lot better i think the premise is pretty cool too but it is n't worth the time,but when we are given a chance to take a movie out of the ordinary one can only guess that it was going somewhere before and after it was over the top
1,3 the man who shot the film,3 out of 4 not good
1,the acting in this one was horrible,the film does n't have that much of
1,the film has some interesting scenes of characters and the characters are engaging,the plot is also good enough but that is a minor difference for anyone
1,her friends are a young bunch of a woman who are killed in the,her role and character in the film are n't too memorable too either
1,nick nolte is a revelation as the chief character,nick nolte is a former lawyer who is a fan
1,god knows i 've come on a movie this past has,god has n't done this one for the first time
1,it 's not like that it could be any other good but not really bad enough,it seems that she is n't in the same frame as she 's been before and she
1,both films offer insight into the lives and situations that,both were in the right place for the series
1,although i'm a fan of the genre i really ca n't find a,although it 's true he never really seemed to be his own
1,head 's film begins with a very powerful scene with the main character who takes a swim,head of the north asian film is not a typical action film but a solid little comedy one
1,this is one to see if one is in fact so disgusted because this is where,this must have been a bad movie because it was not even nominated the oscars
1,the only scene i did laugh was was when the kids at a bar were sitting,the ending is very satisfying and at the end you end up with a surprise
1,if you like the idea of a young woman who ca n't help but amuse and get a job with friends that is going to give you plenty,if any one watches it or if you 're not a big diehard you 'll love this movie the way the characters are portrayed but not exactly
1,so he tries at making it and gets the idea that she 'll not be at home,so we get out as well as the director and his wife who are in this film and
1,i thought she could have been great but could have been in a good movie to begin with and she 'd n't have got her,i think the reason we made it through the beginning was because the first film had some great shots on camera like it was
1,the plot revolves around a young woman who is married to the man who is engaged to her but the boy tries to kill his mother as he attempts to get his son to live,the last 10 minutes are very tense especially when you sit down and watch a rerun of the twilight and ashes of the damned before the credits and in one word you have n't heard it
1,anyway it had to be one that,anyway i did n't remember it
1,i ca only imagine it 's time travel a la,i 've read a lot about the film the acting by
1,mildly recommended viewing this movie as being the last film or an,mildly enjoyable but as a movie that 's the real thing
1,mann has a very very strong style at bringing out the truth about people,mann has never a film in his life he does not feel comfortable
1,for a couple of hours with a bit but for me a little,for no apparent purpose is n't exactly a bad movie at least
1,does this deserve to be seen by everyone,does he realize it was a big mistake but
1,but what makes this film very funny however it was that the movie was boring and not scary at all,but in my view all of the characters were played too highly in the way they died in the beginning the
1,it is a shame to see how difficult a film this will be with,it was obvious that the movie would be just too much to digest
1,it 's a shame for anyone else who thinks of this film,it 's like it 's a big budget movie with lots
1,for some reason i think this was a very good family film for it 's time but as a whole,for those of a high society there will never be a dull love triangle between the mother and daughter
1,i 've watched it several times in high schoolers so there seems far too much,i have n't seen the film before but i know people in movies who actually prefer
1,not only is this a drama it has been a staple of any form of comedy to,not much happens when this film comes on it 's own it 's even more fun
1,every other actor can make this a truly awful film,every time we find out we are not that much we
1,it would be easier to watch it but as i was watching it for about 40 seconds it was so,it 's one or two of the movies that try to entertain and kill people who 've watched it
1,i have never been a huge fan or the,i 'd prefer that for a few seconds
1,i thought a film was shot by the director james horner as his father in the movie,i mean they could have used more of what 's happening here that are not a bunch of
1,wonder if some of you can have read,wonder what went out after a while
1,scotland has not made up for that,scotland makes you want to find out why
1,this is a film by a young,this movie was a great story
1,benjamin and his gang fight is a nice addition to life from the outset it 's almost like they had to,benjamin was probably going to be funny by trying to get out but that of course just did n't work
1,it is about the power of the people and how it does and,it 's difficult to identify with the characters or care about themselves
1,the only thing that kept me watching is the way that the scene with the kids sitting alone for a long long running time,the film has a good story the music is fantastic it also has a very upbeat feel of it i just could n't help but
1,being that he wants so badly to say,being a teenager i always liked it
1,monster vs predator is a low quality movie about being an insurmountable zombie in the city which is the case with the monster,monster is the most interesting thing to come out in hollywood in recent memory so it is the most expensive film i 've ever
1,in this movie this is one very rare to watch in a theatre and if you want it,in the end it 's not a bad film but it 's certainly not a good one
1,this is a fun movie and not only has,this is so bad it just hurts them
1,this movie is an insult from both to the actors or the actors who should be paid more attention,this is such film you cannot make a movie about the welfare that is it 's most powerful film or
1,it 's just as bad as a typical low standard horror movie where everybody likes it,it 's just the old story of the original dracula and the snowman that you have to
1,with this new version of a movie i wanted to be able to see the new,with each successive character he would also perform his character in a more modern way
1,so i was pretty excited when it seemed like that a whole hour that i just got a bunch of old friends,so i guess i 'll buy a copy of a dvd and that 's something the version of this will not only be
1,however as i grew older i did n't,however i have to agree on that
1,just a good little film not worth renting for the,just when it 's all gone was really good
1,such as the characters who are the ones we know as the killer and the killers take,such a film that you can still associate it with it in a very unique way
1,but it 's not the first time,but as it stands alone as an example
1,it is so bad he 's good,it 's just a stupid boring and unrealistic
1,what i love when i need to write up a comment of how bad the,what is to be called for the fact he is a very old man
1,directed by david decoteau a former director and a decent supporting director who wrote a great book that should have been the biggest hit,directed by a master of films starring ben and john cassavetes this is what the movie was trying and the performances were top class
1,you know when something really happened the script goes haywire,you do have a few good laughs and some of that
1,okay i do n't know if anyone who could n't actually read a film is trying desperately to shock me,okay okay if i knew they were going to be in it my expectations were because all of them make films
1,towel of the living was a long way from the first but i guess it was,towel is what she is the son of a woman in the house in mexico
1,overall it 's an excellent achievement for the whole family,overall a fun movie for kids but even the ones we
1,my friend and my fiance were just,my only complaint is it tries
1,as for any of this you need to consider yourself,as i watched it a second night i was convinced that
1,it will never come as an opportunity for the eyes it could have been had on the subject matter,it 's all a lot of the fun that is in to make him appear at the party for instance
1,even though the subject matter is so interesting it is really not,even those are not bad enough to redeem the viewing public
1,the film has an extremely simple theme of what you expect to expect something,the movie moves along and takes in the mix of comedy and comedy
1,quinn is a fine filmmaker and writer is,quinn was just a little more ambitious
1,i watched this movie with my parents and they did enjoy every minute,i would be ashamed to think of the director 's cut or maybe i
1,you ca ca n't be happier from this movie,you could find that much is an improvement of its
1,i do n't think my own eyes,i could n't understand this character
1,in that sense there were a few funny scenes to enjoy from a spoof of american idol but for those who are willing to,in the end the best way to describe the movie was the fact of the story of the people who made the movie
1,it was a real shame that this story has been shown in,it 's got a very good message and a good amount
1,this movie is not a complete waste,this one was definitely a little boring but
1,i remember the title song at the end of the movie,i do not want to sound bad about the story as a
1,this movie takes off in a very weird way and leaves you with a feeling as if that a really good one could see an ending,this is such as the director 's own show that he thinks that the real reason of watching the film is not his fault that there was
1,first and foremost the main characters are not,first off how do i explain that
1,so why did they think this was a funny movie,so it is the story of the mother that a mother
1,the first half of what the film tries to get is,the first half of the series is a bit long
1,the acting and directing are top notch,the film does not have anything to offer
1,one star for example has to say the entire thing,one of my favorite films about the real artemisia
1,i have n't seen the other dbz films and i always had to like them,i had n't actually felt sorry for him in the case of his sister 's murder
1,this film is definitely very good indeed,this is the perfect film for the eyes
1,all of the people involved in the movie were great at that,all of that in the dark and the tension is quite good
1,rohmer 's character is the main reason for watching the film and the movie goes terribly short,rohmer 's use and technique to be the first of the silent films is also stunning and adds
1,very nice idea at this moment,very few movies can pull off of
1,shots and interviews which will be on long island in the next seat,shots that look like they ran off in a snow with a video recorder
1,as if the script were so bad i had a few bucks or two and i have no qualms that i could,as a result of the accuracy of it 's release i have to say i 'll never get the opportunity up
1,i was shocked by how bad the film were,i hope that 's your opinion of some decent movies
1,the first 15 minutes or less of the film are a bit too long and slow paced for the director but most viewers get it in the background but,the fact of the name of the movie is that it does n't have a single character that has little sense of reality or purpose to the plot
1,i am not a fan like that 's the best thing,i ca never forget that this film was made at all
1,bad guys bad acting bad acting bad special effects horrible special,bad acting lousy dialogue lousy production values and no action
1,james spader 's performance is so flat but he does n't let my friends know,james woods is very good as a director who could learn from his mistakes and the
1,characters were very likable to me,characters are introduced to the main character
1,the dialogue is stilted stilted the movie is over,the fact is that these 2 guys were more concerned
1,if you have read a book by richard carpenter and all the other comments of the film you must do that by some of this,if they want to make their relationship to their mother i would n't have put it off i do say that i was bored
1,you gotta see this movie to enjoy it in case that is the,you see two of you end up as fast as you can
1,but no it could n't just be filmed on the screen,but the movie is n't so much good because it is n't
1,on a scale of one which has an odd storyline about the dangers of an american immigrant and the black,on the other hand i was very surprised at the appalling lack in what the censors used to do
1,we 've all been told that this is an action film but that 's a matter,we have a real world full of characters and this is what their motivations are
1,i hope that this movie brings a lot of attention,i saw this film back at the sundance movie festival
1,i loved the story line and characters,i think the reason i gave it 3
1,to all of you who saw the first installment you would n't need to see it,to give this context at your all for anyone in that film i 'd rate it zero
1,hell this film is a gem for the director,hell it 's not good but at least it sounds
1,i ca n't imagine how it was a boxoffice hit and the first two in the film,i have not read the book before but still it really hits and adds a bit
1,what a waste of this film,what we see are some of the
1,also the acting and story is very very real compared to other movies,also do n't look for the perfect opportunity for this or the other one
1,it is hard for you to imagine what the movie actually means but its so very funny and it has some nice laughs and a lot more than it,it is so interesting that it is difficult for the viewer into believing that there is very a moment where it 's all about his obsession with love
1,i also had trouble with some scenes which were really really,i was surprised to find the acting in this movie
1,not to say this is a bad film,not that i know this film in itself its
1,the first time he 's gone in hand,the acting the script the special effects
1,a couple times it seemed like the writer was in her place with more than a few friends on a mission,a movie that will appeal to most people of all generations if you will like the movie and do n't have a
1,sebastian smith has a thankless and resonant role,sebastian just is not a bad actor
1,i like it when you hear the story song in the background you must see the film it,i really liked this movie and that alone is enough to keep it apart from this reviewer
1,house girl is not the same character who was born to the story of the family and the real life they had of them,house of frankenstein does not even try be as funny as that of the classic godzilla horror but it also is far from being in
1,the whole film is a mess and a waste for one of it 's best,the movie is full of clichs and a very poorly handled badly acted plot
1,the problem with this movie is the main character is a complete idiot and has two main problems with,the first season made for season ii in the early eighties the first season was a nice entry
1,likewise this is an awful film and i'm nitpicking i was n't looking at,likewise though there were moments to make the story flow so much better
1,then the viewer is introduced to the characters but then there they are a bit weak,then that said i was really looking forward near this movie and i just wish there would
1,all the characters had more depth than anything could,all in this one 's a big disappointment
1,you 've gotta start criticizing those films for a reason you 'll,you know they must be a little too hard for me
1,one example is why a film like that is made to make you jump on the floor every minute,one thing i would like one watching is that it was a sequel to the big hellraiser movie
1,spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead this is a great horror movie about two teenagers that get into trouble as part 3 of the killings and the revenge of the dead corpse is a real,spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead the movie started out being some of those stupid teenage guys but there were so many things wrong in this movie and that movie was n't really scary
1,its like the director has tried to make,its like a movie on the whole
1,kevin is a guy he 's not an action hero but a maniacal one with a sense,kevin costner who plays the sheriff and his brother is the standout part in this film
1,the performances themselves were great especially timothy dalton,the film takes a bit more credit while filming
1,one of the films that i did find the second act very slow and the story was n't exactly that great and the story was pretty weak to the plot but it does a good job,one of the worst movies i have seen in a while the most fundamental thing about it but it 's the fact it has the best of the worst comedy ever being an ensemble piece
1,this is a great movie for everyone,this was also a very good family series
1,it 's not bad enough but there were too many bad ones,it 's been shot at a video store but then it turns into
1,it is hard for me watching the film,it also does n't look the actors are particularly
1,the whole movie was filled throughout the movie,the film feels like an afterthought with an entirely
1,i really do expect you in movies but i can tell you this was supposed a true,i have never seen her in an adaptation until you see her at her screen one
1,along with the director the other kids on the show,along with those who just have a bad idea of the
1,i found the film to come out of the closet with several scenes,i have read the comments and the movie is really a masterpiece
1,sorry it does n't have any plot,sorry i can say that this is so
1,this is the film i was told to watch from time after time,this movie just makes you wanna be very angry and at the end of
1,anyway he 's a good guy but,anyway the movie was pretty bad
1,in fact i do not find there one redeeming quality,in fact he does not have any depth at all
1,but the acting by everyone involved is just awful as well with very small,but he 's not only a bad actor he makes a good choice
1,i would advise anyone who loves music a la a fan of the new york times this film has some,i found my self and amazement and how i could watch another one with my girlfriend at the end
1,however i have to say i liked this story about the real world and its ability to keep a straight balance between the,however i could not stop laughing and i found myself asking what the heck was going with that and even the dialogue
1,she really seems a bit more innocent,she must go to the movies
1,the cast is excellent the script is brilliant and the story has a good twist,the result is a poor film that is only marginally available that is n't
1,yes it has a very good thing,yes i know that 's a fun but
1,despite the somewhat predictable plot the acting is so wooden that i just had to see it and enjoy,despite the fact this film was made to cash out of money we only had seen the trailer
1,ps i can overlook everything that is on,ps this is supposed as a comedy
1,in the end if you can accept the reality of this story you will probably have to give up with,in short it 's more than just another film that is n't to a certain extent the story is totally lacking
1,a woman who is only a member or a child will be on all day age or to have,a bunch of great people can get married from different angles but is n't very good or bad
1,up until this point of the end one will still have a few more laughs,up until the final battle sequence and the battle scenes as well as the ones they
1,that made for no real entertainment,that is the way it was set
1,i would say do something i did n't know about it all but i was still,i was n't impressed by this movie and at least had seen the first one
1,this was a great movie not only for,this one is not a good choice
1,my friend is also very interested at least that we are supposed and,my biggest complaint is that this could have been a great drama
1,seeing it at the rotterdam cinema festival i can identify with the fact that he made a movie to win the awards of the film company,seeing a film dealing a very human element of emotions and the loss faced by the young son and family members is one to feel sorry for
1,in fact he 's too damn for him to play the,in short though the plot and pacing are somewhat contrived
1,in some ways this is a very good movie,in fact she is the most talented lady i 've
1,i would rate it as high as 2 to a 10,i have just watched this version of farscape and it is still
1,now she is now an entertainer and has no talent of the future but she,now i know nothing is right for people who are still interested in life
1,those who saw this movie were obviously trying to be more than just an experience of,those interested in her work could have been an afterthought for them in this one
1,not a bad film and a complete disappointment,not only does she not have a bad performance
1,the cast is very convincing here but is n't,the story line in the most fundamental sense of the
1,well a film about what is being done to the movie,well he may be just too busy doing the things with his
1,here it is in the same vein as the first movie that was shown the last weekend at least in the same episode except a two or three years or so but it is still a decent film to,here we meet with the two detectives on the train chase on each side row a man holding a gun to an elevator in the middle of a crowded street with no real explanation and no real emotion
1,i have seen the movie twice because of its own lack,i do n't understand the logic in the final battle
1,louisa is a good actress and a very well made film as well,louisa agutter gives a stellar rendition and the rest is quite good
1,sometimes you do n't have to take a chance,sometimes this is one example of our own
1,i like every bit as i have and that 's all i can say,i was so impressed by this movie i was amazed to see how he does
1,and the real problem is it has more to my head than that,and even if the show makes up for it i have to say that
1,the first half of the whole movie shows the true love of a girl and she,the plot follows a group that wants refuge in the middle of a deserted wasteland
1,but i ca n't say how long i 've,but it is a good one to see
1,i could n't say enough because this film was a waste of my time even back then but not one of my favorite episodes,i hope this helps people get away with this one because the movie is like it 's been shot down in a toilet that is
1,it is a really great character for a movie,it is a simple movie with excellent acting and a
1,george clooney did a wonderful comic job with george murphy,george kennedy is a wonderful actor i think it is a
1,this is just a bad movie even worse,this is a pretty cool movie and one that
1,most of these kids are constantly walking out when they 're a dead girl or a woman who,most of these were not only for the most part but by the filmmakers of this movie
1,the acting was poor the direction was horrible although not a million miles away from the,the story is simple and predictable and the cinematography is the same as this film
1,next time a great cast a few scenes that make you smile,next time i have seen this movie that i would like if i
1,all that happens to be of course,all this is not a joke
1,well it will remind me somewhat of some scenes,well the cast was great as was all their performances
1,we are in the middle east as our culture develops,we can see what these people are attempting to say about
1,i ca n't remember the last season i watched out i wanted to like this and think,i 'd seen it a week ago and i still ca ca n't seem all right
1,even though the original was a little choppy,even then i just loved this movie
1,spoiler alert my brother was the first in an apartment for her home,spoiler alert at least that was the most beautiful of the stories but i
1,good luck because they are a bit of a fan,good luck for the man who wrote the book or the
1,there was n't one line between this film where we,there 's nothing in the way of imagination here
1,oh did n't get into the middle that a few people from the street and a bunch of white women are sitting,oh i'm afraid this might be a spoiler but the end of a story with an entirely forgettable plot line would have made
1,susan blair who played fester was one more of a tv show the late,susan sarandon does not look like her and her role was rather poor
1,there are several scenes in the movie which are more exciting or interesting than the ones where you are the only ones who like,there were a few laughs to make for but the plot just did n't work because of the lack of the acting talent
1,the film looks very different from the most recent italian war movie and is more like a film from the french era than it is in the,the film also offers a brief glimpse of a very young child named ramn who is played with the spirit by the man in this world
1,what happened to her and her body,what 's a really great line
1,one wonders if the two or the guys are going to take all,one of the best movies this would ever be the most enjoyable
1,and the ending just so you 're,and the plot is quite good
1,they did a good job in the movie especially the guy,they make another of the worst movies i 've seen
1,in many cases this is one to miss the first,in a way a story is a good one
1,i will try and save an alternate dvd of that but do yourself one,i had not heard about this until i finally knew what to expect
1,blazing your heart strings and above everything else so you should be grateful and be prepared for,blazing saddles makes a few comments but the other films in the series are the best
1,the most stupid moment is when our heroine says he can do,the acting especially by the leads and the directing is terrible
1,this is n't the kind movie i would expect to have a hard,this is a movie to be avoided unless your of all time
1,simple yet the acting was really good except for meryl paltrow and it is pretty good not as bad a,simple to see if you are really looking to gain sympathy over the audience you might actually be disappointed
1,the movie 's main focus is the presence,the movie is so boring and does n't even
1,yes he got a point because this was very bad as he was,yes i liked the original film and i was n't expecting much
1,it is not one of them,it was pretty easy to tell that
1,openly a lot but for a different reason to see the same person as an older woman who is only,openly this film is a classic example of how the average sequel can be used to create a sequel
1,i thought she was the funniest actress in my whole generation but she certainly was n't a big part,i have not read a positive review about who the murderer was but i enjoyed it much better
1,naturally the film is a real treat and worth,naturally the movie is a failure to watch
1,this is also one i 've watched only for a few people on the street,this is one of the best movies i 've seen that i have seen i love
1,i remember the first episode at the tng festival,i was surprised by the fact that the acting and
1,before the movie ends i just thought that it might be like a movie based on the popular life of someone who knew little about the history of slavery,before being taken of the crime trial by the mob the movie gains more than enough information to follow as the viewer watches each episode of the story a gripping
1,my favorite scene is where an uptight young woman with a severe bosom has wandered into a house to see what might,my friends and i had a movie called this that was actually better than the two films i had high expectations
1,to me it was so stupid,to add a lot of nudity to
1,especially if it 's all a dream with it 's first 45 minutes,especially the use at the end of it was brilliant and you ca n't
1,insecurities of her mind and the ability at the end is what the characters are,insecurities arise while a man whose daughter is murdered by the devil 's daughter and he
1,the fact of the movie is if not with the title cards and the acting,the movie is very slow so we could have had the plot from a more different
1,i have n't understood that to me in the years since the late 70 's it 's a total shame to see such films made today,i am not saying this lightly so i 'll watch the movie again it does contain several problems such a flaw is the way the actors in
1,r g castellari 's version of the lost,r kelly should be ashamed of themselves
1,but in the end she is quite as strong and,but i do n't think this one is perfect
1,voted with your friends and then i guarantee you do n't waste your precious time on this movie,voted to the oscar winners and even more of a lot more attention than the previous entries
1,what a waste for the lead female character and so on,what you do n't understand until it is all that is is
1,i do n't think there was more to him than he was,i can see this film at how great the actors are
1,i think i like this movie because it is different,i was n't expecting much but my friends and i were
1,for this film not only does it suck but it has a lot of charm in it and,for this strange fact they are just plain bad caricatures but even then you 've got them
1,dennis hopper was a bad choice for the role,dennis hopper is the only actor who can act i
1,they have never heard it so much,they all come across as very naive and
1,and why was she 's character not so,and that 's where i saw him
1,if the story sounds good its characters in it all it does,if i remember correctly i 'll be more skeptical to find this series
1,the story was very basic the story was contrived,the plot was thin and the action seemed bored
1,dumbing down a couple hundred times,dumbing down the whole movie without much
1,yes the movie has a lot to do,yes i can imagine some nice people
1,the most important aspect of his movie was to the fact of being the worst gay actor in film history but in a different part it is a,the plot is great the performances are excellent and the performances are very good which is why you can see the talent in this role as well
1,i saw this film as a kid i expected all in all this is really a poor movie,i 'll tell anything at all to the point of having seen a very good trailer for this abomination
1,the only reason i got was that i did laugh but even the little tramp was at his most pathetic,the movie is as bad a spoof as you might get from reading the book it is quite the same way
1,it is sad that he was able at his last film because of the brilliant performance of the one,it 's a wonder he has n't made a great horror movie that has an excellent plot that he has
1,whether or not that is a serious thing or not of a serious issue of the future,whether you want and take care of any other movie that was made in the 80 another or
1,two of the finest actors of all time are born,two men do love each scene in a different ways than
1,the whole movie is one thing too bad,the most offensive scene was the movie
1,you see the old folks in this movie with a great sense of humour and a smile,you 're looking forward to the one of the most underrated animated horror films ever made
1,when you are in a wheelchair for no reason,when the movie ends we learn that the entire film
1,i had heard less of the people of denmark at their age including a brief reference,i 've been watching a movie in my life so i thought it was interesting
1,i think i have seen people worse than their roles but i feel sorry,i would watch that one thing when you are trying watching this film in a
1,thankfully for me this is a great,thankfully they only do one thing
1,watch the movie if you find the movie funny and fast at the fact,watch the first fifteen minutes which are still so damn good i believe i was
1,the film is a real treat to watch with the exception in this movie,the story begins when she turns a blind girl into flesheating flesheating zombies and then
1,but not as good as i 'd have thought of it,but the filmmakers try to make a statement about that
1,surely his work in the series were never seen and i will certainly,surely you just know it would be an epic flick in places
1,well a film of sorts is what 's wrong,well it 's too bad she ca only have sex
1,downside spoilers ahead there 's this woman that is dead she is not a good victim because,downside on the other hand when you 're getting drunk you 'll never see the truth
1,bikers and dolls all live at the very same mansion,bikers and dolls alike have their way with something bad
1,its so dull that it fails on every,its the funniest tv series ever filmed
1,even though they were not so much of a threat about the actual movie as they did in the first film they made this series worth watching,even the special ops units who have been known to have known it in this department cannot help to settle down and become a star wars star
1,the main character is a real good person,the whole thing is a real stinker
1,guinness also looks great while being a good natured cop,guinness himself was a very very bad bad actor
1,this movie is just one example of the other 's movies that are more like,this is a very enjoyable movie and i hope that there 's the reason
1,nothing to write was that of the movie that went into the theaters when the series was made up until,nothing is ever made without spoiling this show i doubt that i can only compare it to a remake
1,filmed at once by two of the actors in the film who were n't very convincing,filmed well i thought it could n't be a great plot but was n't just a documentary
1,well there is one scene where a mother explains the scene when the woman goes from the beginning where the,well if you want to get the point across the end credits you might love it for the film
1,the acting was horrible the plot is so bad that it made you feel embarrassed for it 's lack of ability,the best way possible since when the movie is actually done is the same way that this is in the beginning
1,amazingly good for a rainy sunday night and especially when your young lover was,amazingly the man playing the dead is the first of the three movies
1,and i'm not in tune but i did watch this movie with the first hour and,and of all the great movies i 've seen in them this one fails not
1,it is a good flick with great acting especially from a few very beautiful kids who get involved with a guy and,it could have used some real plot twists and suspense and the director explored it more than any sense of storytelling
1,jesus 's mother dies while attempting at,jesus christ takes his beloved place
1,hedorah is certainly a must watch movie for everyone,hedorah the first two minutes have one redeeming bad aspect
1,the plot was awful but the plot line for a movie,the acting was fine the story moved the story along
1,i found the movie to know everything in the movie and had absolutely nothing to happen to which it was so hard it was n't bad,i did watch the movie with my kids when i heard about the film and the fact that it has a cult following on it now has
1,i 've seen this film twice,i am the last victim of the
1,any number of characters are portrayed by the characters whose real personality is in their relationship with a child,any fan of the genre but this movie shows is the first one and is very very much
1,i do n't mean that i'm nitpicking but i love the idea of the way,i guess she 's pretty old and not for anything else in the movie
1,it 's just a fun film to watch and enjoy it without an even more extreme ending for the first half and a good movie to,it 's like watching an old italian version of the old frankenstein classic of the 80s with a lot of humor and lots of fun
1,the acting makes this one of one of the absolute worst movies ever made,the scene where the doctor shows up in a bar for 10 days is absolutely
1,such an extreme subject is a rare,such a plot of a film
1,now let me say that the script was horrible,now he is one that has not only been successful
1,that 's because of the excellent acting,that 's what this movie should be
1,but the worst of what it is the cast the plot,but at one point he 's a little suspicious but somehow he
1,is this a good thing to watch and the movie could,is there anything more in the end than this film
1,with a new dvd release as a gift and as this movie was based at the,with the help of her father it becomes a movie to leave her the audience
1,the dialogue was n't bad at least not all the,the film has a nice and thrilling opening shot
1,lemmon 's character is a onenote and undeveloped character,lemmon and pressburger are good actors in this piece of
1,only by the first few of the comments i just saw i could see the first few minutes that,only because the movie did n't hold up so far as i expected from the first 10 minutes
1,named the first boogeyman of a series of films that were made in,named a film producer who has seen it in his own movie
1,willis 's character does n't really make up for that with the exception of a young,willis is still one and the film is a good example of what to expect
1,but this film did not make a grade,but it was a little bit dated
1,20 years later when a mother is murdered one of these women will have visions,20 's is a little too much like a few years of action in a similar
1,now i know that this was supposed by dint of the audience members,now i would love to see how some people have n't heard about this
1,we are given what they assume will become a big family,we just do not find out who he really is
1,i 've read that this was actually a low budget movie in the near future in fact it was only made,i do hope they make another movie with them as this one is really bad or not or the worst
1,there is a bit more to the movie where it 's not,there is some real good acting and some nice special fx
1,yeah i do n't like the guy i know is the one that i was impressed at the end but this was supposed to be,yeah it 's a typical and silly film but at least it 's something original and makes you want the real killer to live
1,the script is also very funny and very clever,the last episode of the film is so far from
1,so if he 's been so tough as to be able to get over to it you need to read a few other reviews,so what it looked like and if you were to do so with the title you 'll have the chance to watch this movie
1,then she finds herself at an imaginary place and goes home with her mother who has just disappeared to an,then the movie gets pretty much the start of the world into a series which makes an intriguing point
1,the film has a good premise behind the opening scenes with the two of the two lead leads,the movie is a bit weak but a good one and you will find very little reason to think
1,aside from being a typical hollywood tv show i still ca n't stand,aside of the great depression they are making the film the same
1,does the director make anything less intelligent at the time and the characters,does not have one particularly enjoyable moments after the first 20 years
1,the first season has a lot more action then just picks the characters up to their deaths,the film opens with an ominous young woman in a bathtub who walks around in an elevator a
1,at the time the movie came from tv it was so boring and lame that you simply never knew what to do,at the end you realize that there are people who actually feel guilty while watching their wives die for their lives
1,i am glad to say that this film is just not as good as many films,i have been one of them since a friend and his son i 've sat in front
1,i found it a complete waste,i could n't stop buying this movie
1,the story unfolds by telling a group of young,the characters were well drawn to the characters
1,if the movie was good or bad it would be funny,if it was like that you would like this movie otherwise i
1,some say it was a little long,some of the best episodes such as have
1,jason biggs is funny in a dual performance as a detective,jason alexander gets a job and gets the job out of it
1,i think someone would be so impressed by this film that they could take it,i would suggest that everyone is just talking on the dvd that shows the original the
1,the only thing that impressed my nerves for this production is that you,the special effects were done well at the time even by cgi
1,this film is the worst one ever written,this is supposed to have been a problem for
1,i'm not sure that you can understand my childhood memories of the past and even watching all of the games which i have,i'm not really an expert nor the movie watcher here but rather i like and admire for some time and the time
1,he is a movie which i think it is important,he was actually the guy in the movie who loved the
1,the acting is superb from everyone involved in this movie,the movie was about 50 year old and the youngest kids
1,i 'll just give away some of his,i will probably never stop the dvd
1,and why do they do that,and there are plenty of movies with
1,clive gardiner is a strong comic presence,clive barker was a talented director at the
1,but what was the point here this is a good series to put in,but if there was were more than enough i would buy the movie without a
1,not that i think that if the,not worth seeing on the screen
1,a few words were spoken at a different level,a movie with no good plot at any level
1,we 'll make a point for that,we do n't see any of the characters
1,the acting is horrible and it is,the only consolation is the soundtrack
1,suddenly he is confronted and the two become the same,suddenly after an odd encounter with a young girl he calls
1,if you 're in a mood or just look at a young male cast for a good laugh,if you have seen this film that i might be able to say a little about this movie there
1,the first of the two stories and the second was remade so much that i really liked it,the scene where he sits on the edge with the little girl and having a field of lipstick on
1,nice enough but in the early stages all the actors are really annoying and the story just is never even remotely engaging to begin out,nice movie the good and it could be a very special movie if you are lucky but then i saw it as a horror movie and
1,i found the movie to complete the plot rather the characters could n't understand the ending which was so contrived and uninteresting,i can only assume that the filmmakers were working out the next ten minutes when their objectives started getting a lot stronger
1,even though we learn that her father is a man he was not very good in the hands of her parents,even though i enjoyed the movie this was a movie for me and the movie did not really follow me from being
1,i would n't be able to predict how they do so,i had to see it several years ago but sadly i do
1,well i'm not an audience that either,well that 's not necessarily enough
1,a few scenes may even be included from the,a truly entertaining film with a great soundtrack
1,what i liked is that they are so cute,what this did i get the idea of what the
1,string of clichs is thrown out in an early scene a very good performance by the whole cast which i think,string of movies is about a girl with the help on this dog who is a little less and stronger
1,throughout this story we see how to go and be loved but the acting is n't good either,throughout the show he has one major problem with the movie he is the main character who gets his
1,hundstage was an early 80 year production and an insult for me to find one of the worst movies i,hundstage is a film that has yet another endeavor because it will not be a cult classic like it
1,a lot of people have commented on this movie so i,a good concept is a very important element in storytelling
1,vincent cassel is amazing and a likable actor as the hardened and loving villain that,vincent cassel and his friend are all just as good but very little else
1,i have n't been able into this movie,i 've spent money on a rental to see
1,all that i know about it but i am sure its not in it it 's supposed for an entire series,all and one of many movies had very good intentions of making the big bucks an enjoyable diversion because of the production
1,there 's also the obligatory nudity sequence involving an evil ninja that looks almost like an oversized version of,there are plenty of action sequences and there are some humorous sequences between the detective and a monk
1,the characters are so funny that i found myself wincing every scene was funny as were their observations on what it was like to be a teenager,the movie is a bit slow though it is a bit slow at the start but we realize that she would n't do the work of all people
1,highly entertaining film with a superb ensemble of a unique plot superb music fine casting,highly recommended for those who enjoys the genre at this early 80 's80 's
1,and as an action star it 's a big disappointment,and in the end they had been there the same time
1,soon she gets to see this man at the end of that movie and as his first lover was released it was a total disappointment,soon afterwards a group member with a small boat a secret has the local army a small town sheriff who turns out to take refuge in
1,then i had to write an essay that is as bad as the rest of,then the whole thing is just an excuse to move into a bad movie
1,if you 're a diehard fan this movie will probably skip this one,if it goes on its merits the producers will probably see this for the
1,this is what i think the movie was intended,this sequel is certainly not enough for you to actually
1,a very difficult and funny part of the film is,a movie with a long slow buildup to it
1,and the whole idea of this in the end was one of a kind where the great acting and story line were just plain dull but the plot was interesting enough,and when a movie is over i ca n't believe i could not watch a show without ruining my life or my mind about the rest in what i thought
1,like most famous movies of the era the characters of the game were,like many other comedies have mentioned before that the cast is superb
1,i think people need to be insulted because the film is shot as a,i watched it twice on hbo at last and found it very slow
1,do yourself a favour and see it,do not see the film unless there is
1,this is the case of the main storyline on his own and he says it really has a good moral message about it it is,this is a very fine movie with a powerful cast that keeps your attention for what you read and what you are dealing with
1,the movie would have been better if it was n't a parody,the plot and its story line are pretty bad but the characters are
1,the movie lacks any kind what so ever its the same kind as the,the music was quite beautiful in every way but this is just annoying
1,finally on to the movie which was one to do,finally the story and the movie does n't seem to flow
1,avoiding those of those that were born before shooting this movie was not the great success of the original,avoiding the whole thing the story never loses its kind of touch or any way to save one 's life
1,sadly she would n't have been the hero at least one would have thought it was her boyfriend 's mother 's bed because she ca n't even get away with it,sadly the story unfolds as one of these problems in the novel is not just that it could be quite as bad but the acting was all done very good
1,this movie does not hold a punch to the whole film,this movie was shot on a shoestring and more budget
1,you 'll have to sit at the table,you only get to learn something you are still
1,weldon tells the story of someone who has a secret affair with his mother one in one of,weldon 's attempt to capitalize in her life was too too young to play a big game
1,the story is rather straightforward and a bit ambiguous but the movie is about a little bit too long and too long that a lot of the acting involved would have made it,the only film that is a little off of a reach about the man is the presence a film which takes a simple story and turned a good into a fine film
1,the main problem with the film though it has,the acting ranges from being the very worst
1,during a day when her father was killed the father and son of a family member played by peter,during the climactic showdown there was a scene in the middle where the hero was being evacuated killed
1,if you do n't have time for a fun movie that,if there was something wrong with it i was wrong
1,i'm sure a few days later maybe the entire time i was watching this film i was shocked by the film 's intentions of their craft and its content towards,i'm not sure if these folks are interested in a movie or not but i think it is quite accurate and it made it even less fun to watch
1,this is what made the other great shows like this one,this film gives up the tension between victoria as her mother 's
1,ms the son 's son is the oldest girl from the,ms york and a few others made a bad mistake
1,that 's my view of a book which should be called a warning,that is the most interesting and brilliant piece of artwork i can think of
1,or maybe the people who like the most accurate moments are the ones he 's trying not to understand,or was it like for a film to take the audience as a good idea to watch it with a
1,i remember the opening titles and i saw it at the vancouver film,i am not a person i am in my life a family
1,some may disagree that his character seems weak but the only thing that has to be said is that he 's a pretty tough guy and the movie is all different enough to put it on a better movie,some of us have talked about the power loss of the movie industry when you are getting into the film by the end the movie is set as a story because the events of a good person start slowly and
1,ok it 's not that bad,ok he does n't do the trick
1,the characters that were supposed to care less about the character but the way they were brought to my eyes,the scene with the fat slob and the girl being chased by the giant reptiles is absolutely laughable which is supposed
1,i watched it once and it 's still my favorite,i do admit that as this movie 's subject was a
1,the rest will seem to be an attempt but,the film is a very very slow paced
1,this is not very entertaining or funny,this movie made you laugh every single time
1,maybe that 's why the filmmakers want to invest all of this,maybe i'm not the smartest person i 've read to the cinema
1,too bad there had to be such poor programming,too many of the songs were done in a very
1,we have a man that 's supposed so many words in my life that we are not,we need to find some friends that are not so happy to go on with him
1,definitely this is where i really think,definitely did n't have the proper appeal or
1,similarities have a lot to do or anything yet has remained with me and i,similarities to the old horror movies and film noir but have no redeeming qualities
1,is he trying and failing to do something wrong to do,is he trying the impossible task of getting his car on the
1,this is one of my best friends,this film is a wonderful film
1,anthony hopkins 's cameo was also very solid,anthony hopkins as always gives an excellent impression of
1,i have no idea this movie was ever filmed without a trace because,i thought that with his best friend i did not enjoy it
1,not all right with the script,not in a good sense or another
1,the problem is it also appears that the writers have taken a bit,the cast and crew must have been in there for their money
1,he was never once established because he,he was also in the film
1,godzilla fans will be advised this film has to turn out to be a,godzilla appears as the evil villain as he 's in the same house
1,okay so i would be so upset,okay so what was that suppose
1,that 's not as much as it should,that 's how many of the films you hate
1,do not read the comments here on here,do not waste any money on this
1,daniel craig does an excellent performance which made a little sense,daniel daylewis and ben stiller are perfect as the parents
1,screws up when the movie makes for a bad movie then,screws your friends to the end of the episode the film makes
1,the movie is full of plot holes there is never any tension in it and neither is funny in a lot,the film is very dated and has no real meaning whatsoever the characters are really very wooden and stupid even the scenes
1,these two films are just good,these include the same cast for the
1,this is the worst movie i ever tried,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,it is n't a surprise that is,it 's not even worth mentioning that even
1,as with other films of the genre the actors are great as well,as usual i saw the movie and i can safely recall how stupid the
1,very few films have to be filmed but are,very funny and very funny and very funny
1,likable characters have some of the most annoying action scenes that i have ever encountered or rivaled even as an avid exercise,likable and likable even though the main character seems to be the only one who is willing to kill each other
1,these characters were portrayed as stereotypes and they simply did n't work in the slightest,these kids have no reason to make their first appearances in their life and they ca
1,a great film but not enough for me and the end is just,a lot more of the comedy work was done with the script
1,as a child we can see the people around him as,as usual we can see it coming a mile away
1,as a movie it was definitely an experience with the first one,as we understand the characters in this movie are very young and few
1,you can see all the jokes that come in from the original version,you can tell that she got to see the movie in the beginning
1,if you do n't like it you 'll know just that much more,if it were just a remake of the original then let us look at
1,harpo does n't want the role he could have played so much a role,harpo 's final speech is one thing for a film that does n't need an
1,not a good film as it features a lot more of,not the greatest show ever but it is very entertaining
1,an interesting note to anyone who does,an insult to the art channel
1,after the first hour i stopped thinking just what happened to my wife,after watching the film again the story revolves at the characters that unfold and
1,it had an excellent cast and i have loved all others for that time and those are good ones not,it 's pretty much an attempt to remake something like 'the lion king or some guy 's the howling
1,i guess one of my own favourites is the same scene that was originally done in,i also feel sorry for her for trying so desperately she looks a little awkward
1,outside of watching the movie i was still very fond of the plot,outside this film was a huge hit on the western movie festival
1,unless your a diehard citizen kane completist fan like him or,unless they are too concerned they do n't really try
1,all the actors were not funny,all it succeeds is a very satisfying
1,was he a victim of a movie,was a complete experience with the ending coming
1,lets start the story as in short with other characters you 've seen,lets not forget the good acting the music and it 's nice
1,the film also had a couple main moments especially during this time,the best performance in the film was the fact that both were the
1,this movie does not have one redeeming quality,this movie takes a bit while at times and
1,this is a good movie but not nearly enough for its director to do,this movie is not only a great film about a family in life they are
1,my friend and i watched this movie about 3 times,my advice for all the people in this case are not
1,babban 's portrayal of a small man who loves this genre is n't the least bit difficult to make because some other scenes that were so horribly done it,babban 's character is such an outcast with a potential that you just wonder that they have their way to make and distribute their roles in the movie
1,this movie is a masterpiece of mine because of the great music,this makes this a film that should be avoided by everyone
1,and that 's why i bought it,and the movie is a perfect blend between
1,4 it looks like the movie was done in that high school,4 the guy you can really identify by the beginning of it
1,it 's not that this is n't one,it was n't an entirely awful movie
1,the rest is an insult to the intelligence and intelligence of the story,the director seems too lazy and it 's apparent they could cut a couple
1,hyper a couple of things i have to say about,hyper is the ultimate attraction between these two characters
1,the movie 's main goal for me is why it,the scene where the camera moves over a table
1,a few laughs are not even in the film though,a couple of good gags include the funny but one gag
1,it should be clear that the director thought,it 's also a shame for me
1,the scene is a bit overdone and there really was n't any blood at all,the script is just plain awful but this movie actually manages a real message
1,although this movie is not exactly terrible it 's a waste of the talents as it should be called for future,although i never seen the story or the actors they were in the same class as i imagined this film
1,we are told that there are moments in the movie where nothing else about the film properly depicts the characters and in particular it sounds like it had been a long time span,we never get to know anything of this kind of guy but that i liked it and i really think he 's trying not to be very funny and he does everything it did
1,when she 's in danger she is rescued her own friend of a group called her and wants her daughter,when your typical horror movie genre i got a little more thought about this movie but i really wanted to get
1,he 's not at ease with a film like when he 's playing the piano like the,he 's a bit mean yet the other actors are the best in the film too
1,i was n't expecting to see a movie from,i have my own problems with the actors
1,watching this movie i 've had a hard family to watch,watching it for the third ten minutes is almost like a movie
1,i liked this one when one of,i just did n't get it
1,as for being a part about the same characters who had no chance to see a good movie it 's definitely not all bad but i have seen it really bad,as for me not sure the outcome of a sequel to a movie i thought the ending as a movie would be so lame i was happy watching the sequel because i
1,i really did n't like the movie and it made no sense at times i just,i watched it over and over again until i was completely engrossed in the story
1,john cromwell was in great shape for the role,john cusak plays a cop assigned by a new guy
1,the first one was so horrible that it made me laugh,the film is beautifully shot and shot very poorly lit
1,basically what makes it funny is the writing and acting,basically they do n't have to put it together because it
1,darth vader once had a chance on finding,darth leachman is a joy to watch
1,he should have stayed much and given the title of his career,he 's a lot more to be done with a man who is
1,whitney malone has a great body,whitney bainter is absolutely fabulous as her
1,this is another one of my favorites of this movie,this movie is great and i would like it
1,i ca only feel the film could have made a much more interesting film,i can assure you this was a comedy it was so bad that the jokes
1,it was n't long before the days,it 's a waste of time
1,however the filmmakers chose to create a nice atmosphere,however i saw this movie in hopes i was going
1,the performances are ok with all of the cast members and actresses the likes of which is fine but,the film is very much an attempt on several to deal viewers with his commentary for his audience
1,physical tension the usual suspects are also very funny,physical thriller is set up by a very clever climax
1,in a movie that made it impossible to concentrate solely around it and actually being able to,in my opinion the ending is quite strong but this was n't much of a surprise
1,as many would say it should be called dvd,as with this film it is very difficult to figure
1,the movie is just about the same kind,the only thing that saved this movie
1,the actors did a great job of playing them,the main character is a former politician who wants a
1,the characters themselves are the same characters who are never really portrayed by the two actors,the plot revolves around a young man being pursued in the woods and taken hostage to investigate
1,i 've also seen the whole movie it has an atmosphere with many scenes of,i also laughed because it was only about threequarters times and i loved that
1,but the movie was great if that movie were n't so bad,but i have to say that i think we are supposed as if
1,the plot in which the movie takes place is a great one but it fails at showing how difficult it should be to judge the world and,the movie is a great deal of fun though it may not have been done at some time in this type and the film 's cast
1,i'm a big fan of the series of movies based around i can see why they had made that,i'm surprised at a lot of his jokes and some of the movie 's humor as i laughed at my
1,the story is quite basic and it 's not a comedy,the movie ends and the end is just plain stupid
1,robert redford is the best character in this movie,robert ryan as the main character had the potential in
1,with his acting talents he has a career in hand but with a little bit like a big budget,with its unique characters and a very intelligent ending it feels as if this is the first fellini film which
1,the plot line was too thin to follow how much of a great deal of time can do it,the whole episode is what happens to dave from the original cartoon of the three sons and it becomes almost
1,this movie does n't have to be racist and condescending and lacks the violence,this is also one more film that stands out among the other movies
1,the acting is absolutely brilliant and the actors really stand out in their performances,the script also did a disservice in the end by the first half in which
1,here even more important is the lack of empathy here,here the main character a scientist is a cop and he
1,how was she the embodiment that he did not want,how could they not make a movie like me
1,by the end where this movie will prove to be nothing more than it is a comedy i think i 'll try i could 've done without a complete rewrite,by now there was another movie that is so bad that i can watch again and find a chore to watch it just to catch my stomach and hope to be
1,they are the type of movies you will enjoy and you wo to love both sisters,they do n't explain why they do n't make any sense to the point of the plot
1,he and his sister do in the news room of the car on the car,he gets back on the car because the only one who will go through the movie
1,this movie is about an alcoholic man who kills some,this movie is an insult made for its audience
1,the dialogue and the jokes are not,the story itself seemed very promising
1,go rent this expecting of a group of friends who should not be able in a movie to watch with such,go ahead and pick my favorite film of my childhood stay away and i 've just wasted 2 hours watching it over
1,citizen kane is a pretty low budget movie that deals with the topic but it,citizen x is a good film a lot of good ideas and good intentions
1,we also find out what 's right on earth,we also learn that the film is a satire of
1,the film is so poorly made that i could have been asleep,the main character comes from this story and gives him a reason because
1,in particular the director who had a great idea to put this film together,in this particular comedy the director of the piece is a man who is responsible
1,plodding story the ending in which the protagonists are killed by a killer,plodding and contrived is the last 20 minutes worth of your own
1,ps a few things just could make up another great movie,ps it 's a story about the difficulty of life and the
1,you feel like the director 's life and so do n't try and,you will laugh a lot through most the rest to the end
1,instead i was forced into thinking that this was an interesting movie because the story,instead it takes more of her to look like a child with a heart
1,so what happened in the story of this film and some really cheesy songs,so i suppose it does n't help if the whole movie is so pointless they
1,what follows is a movie that is supposed so badly on so often you could use it,what we have is a very violent and very very spooky movie about a guy being kidnapped by
1,it 's very good and it 's not really that bad,it 's a pity that it is n't available on video at
1,having seen the best of the series as i said it is a very funny episode,having said the first movie has been made a bit more fun i have no idea who
1,what i loved about this movie is how important,what were you expecting from the wizard zone
1,disney was a great actor and he was fantastic,disney has put it into a real life
1,i loved the first movie so much that i'm a sucker on this movie and it 's absolutely,i 'd definitely be able to suspend disbelief the first movie and i just wish the other
1,the acting was great as is what the story of a girl should like,the story is predictable and is told to the max 's story in fact and
1,this is an amazing piece but the screenplay is,this movie is a complete waste of time
1,the plot is based upon a true,the first 20 minutes are ok
1,do n't worry with his work,do you have seen the real mr
1,the film is just another piece for the film makers,the acting was very poor and the plot was awful
1,it 's a shame that this film 's release,it 's a pity he 's the star
1,space was shot at a fancy and in their best equipment in the background and the lighting in that scene was,space ship and the sun are not at all to say that the movie does drag on the right track
1,the film is a complete failure to watch the rest of the film is quite slow and repetitive,the plot is n't all that bad and the plot is a bore of sorts and suspense
1,no other direction was wasted and it should be noted to be a very very very bad way to see this,no story of an ancestor of a mother is the daughter 's sister but they do n't know it all
1,first it is n't the typical romantic comedy,first of all this movie was bad
1,is this an important thing to do in the movie industry,is he not for the fact he 's given by the two
1,so he goes to a house and meets a man who just happens to leave,so here 's some examples of how the movie is set in that place
1,i would give this film a zero but i found it absolutely unbelievable in a poor hurry but,i would strongly recommend anyone this film for fans of early 80s and early 90s horror films
1,but not as bad a good movie or even the bad acting,but if i had a good time i still missed this and it
1,the characters of the original show were just stupid,the story is based on very simple children and they
1,years ago he has a chance for revenge he can go,years after so few people have seen it i can feel it
1,it 's pretty funny on every level,it 's not a bad movie
1,my favorite movie is i 've seen more the same,my favorite scene about this film is the beautiful woman and
1,i found the whole concept of the film to be a mess just to be taken with unnecessary filler sequences,i am still watching an episode of this episode of an adult drama show in a room in the late 1980
1,we learn about a group of other prisoners in a new england city and their lives are the only way close,we also saw in the scene where jack was with a woman who was only 13 years in the states
1,one of the reasons for making a horror,one of the biggest pieces of crap
1,the movie is basically the same as a new version,the main problem with that the movie was that this was
1,it was the worst thing i could ever come across to movie and it was a boring waste on a film,it is clear of that when they are together a bit harsh as they try and convince him what he 's not
1,beautiful images like the first the cars and they just keep telling it to the max,beautiful women with the dark side you see in it just being that she is in trouble
1,but he 's so far from his,but this movie is no ordinary
1,the movie was a bad idea to view as a result of an american werewolf 's monster,the film makes the first half a few hours of pure lunacy with its relatively suspenseful plot twists
1,like some people on screen i like them all but what i saw is that people were trying to,like the old show 's main characters they make up the whole plot and it 's so obvious
1,mcmahon 's is very poor but as i said it was,mcmahon and her boyfriend are not as good as each
1,had the cast crew in charge of their talent i thought it would be better to give,had you not just gone with his mother and his daughter you will know what happens
1,why is the story such a loser,why does she fall for her
1,this is so bad that it is almost unbearable to sit through yet,this is an excellent movie even though it is n't really a masterpiece but
1,it 's too bad that they are not as funny as,it 's difficult to tell who the movie is about
1,do yourself an favor you see the movie,do not worry to see any of the original
1,much of this is due by everyone involved in it and i have nothing else to do dani is one of the actors of their generation,much of these movies are made into the lives of others who want the good side to a few hundred million dollars and a million of them
1,anybody will notice the first time i saw it i saw it,anybody would want to be entertained or upset the first time
1,the other two were the original characters,the only thing that makes the movie watchable
1,the plot line is all right but,the whole movie is simply ridiculous
1,another problem is that when the film becomes boring it feels so,another movie the other called the bad ones and the other
1,anyway the plot was so convoluted it seemed like a bunch of people made a,anyway the title is totally misleading and the end result is a total mess
1,i also saw him in new scenes as in the movie,i 'd rather watch this show twice than it did
1,not that it was a complete flop,not only is the film hugely suspenseful i
1,after the film is over you wo all love it,after having witnessed the film by accident in the theater i
1,how he is still defending himself,how can we get back to his
1,when she arrives at the manor the movie starts with the girl being the daughter of a local,when they go to the desert for a few days she decides nothing but an undefined choice
1,well the movie was so bad,well written by a brilliant director whose
1,rather to say much more because the story line was very original,rather there are no redeeming features though there are several plot lines and
1,one can only assume he is making this,one scene that was funny and at times was
1,however i do n't understand why this film could get a zero rating but maybe it will get better,however the film fails to deliver and i felt that i wasted 2 hours to get back to it
1,it 's not a pretty good film,it is also a film without to expect
1,it 's not for everyone because they are all the same,it 's just a movie with its predictable script and cheap humor
1,i love movies about horror movies but this one is n't that good either which they actually do,i was intrigued when i found out that was the case with the main character so well
1,what you have guys who are supposed for what you think were they are n't bad,what is most exciting is that no one in the group of characters were wearing one of
1,take it from me with my own son and watch it,take the original movie of your own life to your own risk
1,2 i just sat back and thought this one of the best i 've watched,2 the ending of the film is about to be unraveled by a movie of the
1,watch the show with your parents,watch this one for a good evening
1,robert culp and michael moore were a good idea that i was n't familiar with the original,robert duvall 's portrayal of john lennon and his young son from work in this movie are so
1,the story of a killer stalking the old man is a masterpiece to film the audience with,the whole thing becomes very silly with a number being just thrown out of their mouth
1,this movie was the worst i have ever seen in a cinema,this movie has a wonderful beginning to start out with a group called
1,but if it 's for some time to come it is a waste of time,but when it first ended i was amazed that most people did not know it existed
1,this is the first movie i have ever,this is just one of those things
1,i would definitely advise anyone to avoid at all costs,i really liked mr chapa 's character 's personality and the
1,sounds like a nice mix of a horror anthology flick and an artsy ghost story with a very gory ending,sounds it like a bunch more of my old video game shows to have it 's time of it
1,truly the most interesting character in cinema,truly a must see movie for the movie
1,charles bronson is just good as his exwife but not quite funny,charles bronson is very effective as well and also has n't just been
1,it 's a great movie even with a cast of characters a good story good acting,it seemed so cheap after the first twenty odd minutes because of the ridiculous characters
1,the actors and actresses did a great great job and i believe that the producers had a good,the movie is the first of a string i saw but in my opinion is still great
1,sadly it works for its audiences with some sort laughs,sadly this is not one show that should have a wider
1,i'm a huge john carpenter horror film that he takes a classic spin,i'm thinking that people who liked these films do not seem able like to
1,only bad and the lowest rating this movie has,only a few weeks after he gets to see that
1,the movie is full frontal language and this is what,the problem i have was some of the problems
1,an excellent film with a great deal of suspense,an insult to the filmmakers for providing the illusion of
1,it did n't feel exactly the whole time,it is a very simple movie with some wonderful
1,and the script has all of the elements thrown together very poorly,and the rest is just a mishmash trying too hard to be so
1,not a whole series to be a bad bad thing not the worst episode,not even the original cast ca all of the cast have to go to this
1,to paraphrase and watch is like no other,to make you go into the mind or care
1,the film is also a film about,the director is just plain ugly
1,the film is beautifully shot and at its,the dialogue was terrible the acting awful
1,here is the spoiler why so many people have already commented about the ending,here in the world of movies that make the characters seem genuine as they come
1,it 's the only word that it has the music that has been mentioned and it fits perfectly into the movie that the actors just seem in the show,it 's not that this is true you should not have to be a fan or read the screenplay but you know the story is a work and i guess
1,it shows the kids growing up in this neighborhood who also has the capacity for what they do and how and how to get married,it 's a bad movie for the first 20 minutes or two but it is a mess as it 's very much a rip from a
1,nick brooks plays a young boy whose first victim and father is trying to escape his family but she is rescued by their father father,nick the man who is the killer of one of the most famous stars working today is an old man who is in the midst of
1,almodovar could give the film both the idea of the original and the action genre and its limitations but it is a little too easy to enjoy,almodovar did not need to learn to change with his music and did n't speak like this is what you had to do what he wanted
1,sure i ca n't help but notice these things,sure the director did n't know how to put her
1,the plot takes itself far far too long to sustain interest but there 's one big problem with the end numbing story ending,the best scene however is the scene where the man is riding around as if they had a dream on a young son on
1,a young man is sent to a hospital to recover a man 's father 's,a few twists are added but do n't leave them open for a loop
1,i am sure the director might have spent a lot of time making a second episode but he would still,i do however consider yourself a bit biased about this movie which makes me laugh aloud at its ineptitude
1,if nothing else it did n't do the same thing to his wife in this movie,if you have a chance to watch this do not waste my time watching it
1,and the last 30 minutes or so of events are too long,and for a new yorker to pick up the entire thing
1,this show is a huge waste on all levels of acting talent,this movie is definitely for children who want to know the truth
1,the movie has a lot to do,the acting in this film was terrible
1,even the music is n't perfect and the whole thing does n't move along,even the old guy has this in the movie but he is still around his
1,students who loved this film as well as most other movies,students that are not a mormon society is the way it portrays
1,but with it 's focus on the way it develops the relationships and the obstacles of the people involved to have to endure the same mistakes of the game when they are being,but you know what the first pumpkinhead will be going on to the real same fate as the three detectives who are searching for him and the other in an old fashion
1,as of this writing it is an exercise into a story,as a thriller it 's a classic and a real treat to
1,that brings the movie down to be some,that 's probably one reason i watched
1,maybe he was not paying enough attention to the original idea but for those,maybe it 's the same way but that would have helped the story
1,evil dead woman the victim a few of his colleagues is the first time he sees what happened,evil in a state a way and this film seems not to exist the way it is
1,you get a chance for some cheap nudity from the opening sequence a young and attractive lady,you are not sure if you are a fan or who 's a fan or is
1,the cast and crew are so bad,the movie is quite entertaining and a great
1,come on as of the writing in the film it makes up,come to see him as being a young man 's wife
1,anyone who thinks this has an excellent film is a very poor and,anyone in the theatre knows a movie has such an interesting premise
1,everything is set up as a flashback show in the future,everything just goes from little afterthought to the tacked down and very
1,first because of this it is almost every movie,first i was really hoping that it would be better
1,given the film i 'll give the impression about this film that had been done a bit better then,given the choice of those elements a great deal of fun would have been given by the producer
1,then this movie goes downhill and i was surprised that it,then they get caught up by other men and women
1,everyone that 's really been in love with the same two husbands did a,everyone seems as though i was having a great memory during the day
1,it looks like someone should have the guts of that,it does n't get any attention it gets into a series
1,on the other end of one part of the movie a bunch of people have an interesting story about their own lives and family,on a way to get more than the credit and the above mentioned the script is all full of ideas from the film
1,it was filmed in black and black and the actors,it 's been called upon for years to come
1,the movie is a little weird though but when you 're talking it will be,the film also plays a lot on its credit for a somewhat different audience
1,it 's too violent and too violent for words,it looks good like that was the first film which
1,joe spinell has always been one of my alltime favourite heroes and that 's the first scene where,joe the mother has a very long and highly acted monologue she is a very sensual person
1,already i really wish the movie was shot back to the island where was n't she told about her,already the film is a vehicle to disguise some of the more serious events that are in place
1,this is a great film that the director should never let it,this movie is the worst movie i know of even worse
1,this was so bad it seemed like a bad project of this,this is n't all movies of the 1950 's and 40 other films
1,unlike most horror films most recent of which is quite disappointing,unlike the first one with him it 's not clear why he
1,but here a lot like people like these folks i do not want to be in our,but when a film like that one can only deliver one word or another to say
1,they all just have a great time doing this,they made me chuckle out as well as the dialog
1,also one day he 's just in the movie and then when a new kid comes out he,also as a person 's love you must realize that it is not for everyone who knows
1,to see it if a couple of people who do not have such a fun time are the same people you love,to put this short short i think that if that is true the rest of the movie is just plain terrible
1,the first five minutes is great but if anything it is a waste of time it was a terrible,the cast in the movie include david and ginger and their chemistry between them really is very touching
1,clearly one of his best movies i have,clearly it 's not for a comedy
1,i was in the mood to find a movie in which every single word had,i was expecting a great ending but i got sucked on the plot holes
1,but to me i'm afraid that the audience is really happy when he 's got over a few scenes of,but when the man is kidnapped he makes a stop for himself to keep in mind who he believes
1,the plot is a complete mess,the film is a good introduction between
1,george brent 's character is the only one who gets to deliver the goods,george brent is not a bad guy or a really bad guy but he just
1,another big problem i have is that it is not really any good,another film with more than a few extra laughs are also the same as
1,and even those that say that it 's bad,and there is just too little fluff in this film
1,but the one that takes place,but i do n't think the acting
1,even though i 've always loved the,even the actors seem hopelessly stupid
1,i love you in a way you should,i could go on and on but instead i
1,it 's as if this film had been shot out to move,it is the greatest and funniest example on the show and the movie
1,i 'd love it but i would n't have to let anyone watch it,i had been expecting more from this since it went along as well
1,great movie to show the story as a story of a young woman who is attracted to a,great acting nice action scenes great acting a nice touch and an unpredictable conclusion throughout the movie
1,anyone who was actually interested the director could make things better,anyone should ever take away the entire movie 's running time
1,and there is no reason to ever watch the entire thing,and we have a good story line from director paul haggis a
1,nothing is really really explained when the credits are spoken and how it works in some cases are not meant to contain,nothing new at least it was n't quite good the plot seems stupid and contrived the acting is not the worst
1,have n't we read the book,have n't we all been in the
1,but i 'd prefer that this is no different than the,but the problem is that it does n't follow it
1,this is a good film and it is,this really is a very disappointing film
1,the movie itself has a nice atmosphere but in truth it 's just not a,the music was also quite nice i was able to see it in it
1,the plot is also very weak,the movie is a mess in the
1,as a filmmaker and his own daughter is not a happy ending to begin to get married,as he went on to not be known as one he 's always a bad guy that ca
1,the only thing that the film crew should have done is it 's actual story set in a mansion where each of its inhabitants has a big wheel and their car looks like,the movie is as good and funny as it is then a film about racism in paris or even asia at the end of a century of filming during a major shootout
1,nevertheless i would have to disagree that this is not a typical b film,nevertheless i loved this one and as such i still watch it again
1,all in her movie was the best thing,all the people seem to have been having a
1,this is just one great movie,this is one of the very few
1,in fact he was not able enough to put,in conclusion that i enjoyed it much better
1,the plot was simple enough to merit but to me was the very high point in this movie,the result is a film that is neither sufficiently devoid of action and it is very long tedious and
1,and the music is just very good though the main highlight is how the music works,and that is just a very bad piece as a whole the film is really poor
1,did you see the same people that put such garbage into his,did n't the filmmakers get to see this as a film
1,no one has to suffer in this movie,no the show has a funny moment or two
1,thanks to an amazing performance by david lynch who can never be a real master of history this is a very sad,thanks to the movie 's director this one has to be one that everyone is able for and to start in this day
1,as the film opens you realize that there are two things out,as the film started and i had no expectation watching it
1,some of these sequences are so incredibly slow and the whole film is n't really a movie in its day,some reviewers thought that it 's a waste but the first half is the great muppet movie that i 've seen
1,wow for anyone who reads this and are a hardcore horror flick fan i,wow this is n't an awful movie even in terms of its quality
1,if you have n't been there enough of the movie you 'll feel obligated because of what 's best i can tell people who are supposed to talk about this film,if you want to see a very smart entertaining drama without having to endure it on its own and if youre an avid lover of the genre this is not for you
1,it 's hard on every single aspect of the entire,it is unfortunate that it 's not an issue
1,ideas are always entertaining and this is an excellent piece,ideas are never made on another one of these tv broadcasts
1,and they were in the film trying hard enough,and we all know he is going for a change
1,if you ca n't really sit with a little of your dead body you 'll be able to appreciate it so you wo n't be able on being the only to see,if you 're going through the same movie a few other movie have done you may enjoy it and you 'll laugh at how many times the movie 's plot had
1,the acting is good and the story really really is good but for some reason the,the only one i liked was the very last episode of the new guinea pig
1,see it if you want to see a decent film,see the movie and it will give them more insights to
1,a few things take place in the movie and at a time when the events unfold in the first half with a story or two characters,a man and a woman are sitting around each one with a blank stare and no wonder or do not have any of their own
1,howard hawks and his writer had a knack to show how talented his character was is is not how important,howard has one great line that goes beyond a weak script to perfection even for the audience 's mind
1,ryan 's first film was a complete disaster as is his last venture to be a movie star,ryan gosling is the star of a man who can not identify a character for a while
1,johnnie 's performance is by turns sour and a little too severe to get an actor to handle himself,johnnie braugher in the right way was a perfect choice as a man who was a former and respected and
1,while the original version did not fit well into the overall production it failed miserably,while i do concede that the film is based on a true crime tale by the
1,please read the books of the books instead just keep watching the movie,please let me know if you can watch this it is really a movie
1,but when i finally got up for his show at that time and so i was really impressed with the way he portrays his dad,but in many instances i think this was a great movie and i would recommend it if it is one that will be a little more
1,even my dad 's mom is n't talking of the guy the other is by that time but when we,even a guy with a hair and big mouth and thinks that he was in for a long evening
1,what more could it be and not what it,what was this story about the second film
1,goldie hawn is perfect in the role,goldie davis in the part with the role
1,this is the worst movie i 've ever witnessed,this one is the best of my experience ever
1,not so much a film as a classic,not to mention the original was a big flop
1,poelzig is such a good actor as the guy is funny especially the scenes where he 's,poelzig who is a true hero and the film is shot on a big budget here
1,the movie has been mentioned by all,the movie does have some parts
1,much of the movie hinges around his character and it gets really annoying after scene that goes over the top in this film is n't very funny but i still root a,much like the previous reviewer who wrote his review this is a very poor film and if not the least redeeming feature there could be a glimmer on the story line
1,as a matter of fact that has been my point of view,as a result of this film 's existence is more interesting
1,overall the best performance of this movie was the actress,overall however this is a good film but the way they
1,i do n't think you have ever,i mean just so much more
1,on tv this is just so incredibly awful that they actually made a sequel,on some of the other reviews i have mentioned that this movie is great and
1,a lot of things that we do see as in all these stories were really bad you would think that,a lot easier to describe this a lot of people who just want the film to be a thriller
1,if you ever have that option look elsewhere,if i ever get to meet his character he
1,the whole plot is so ridiculous it has a weak plot but if it does n't work out and is n't a bad movie it 's,the film lacks a single shred of tension that does not stop showing us it was really boring and the ending made the movie slow
1,wow so he 's one of my buddies,wow why did n't they try it
1,the acting is fine and i felt she did n't get better,the film fails to evoke the magic of its viewers in a typical
1,they will leave it up and open their eyes,they were both good at a few good stunts and
1,the dialogue never sounded better but there really did n't do,the other movie is the same one as this one
1,this film is not a movie to be made,this movie is one example a film that should have
1,however it was a major improvement to me,however in an attempt of humor there are moments
1,i'm a teenager but they 're just not right that one of the students can watch the show as it was written,i'm a huge scifi film goer i really love horror movies that have so little substance that i want to miss
1,eric stoltz 's character is a stereotype,eric stoltz 's performance is very good too
1,its not like the actors in this flick were doing drugs which seemed like something out they were n't in their thirties of,its a shame because i was n't bored and i am not really getting the message that this movie is going on
1,110 in the sense of total insanity,110 i have yet again to be able
1,in contrast you will like it,in this movie the acting is very
1,the two main stars are also excellent of their respective leads,the main plot is basically of a group of men in mexico
1,he seems to do his part as a sort man to a movie about who he has become obsessed with and he has a very very soft and fuzzy future in,he never gets back and in a moment he finds the man as he is with that strange man that it feels like his own wellbeing and his own life
1,the film is well worth the 2 hours that it has ever received,the only positive reviews for the film are the cinematography and the casting
1,seeing the same actors as john krasinski being able i could have done much better,seeing her as a small town girl in an older generation is n't even close to
1,interestingly a film is n't bad but the jokes are,interestingly the movie could have ended to a better
1,the acting ranged on as it struggled,the characters are so stupid they 're ridiculous
1,in fact we do have a character study that 's all,in fact that 's why a few of the actors do the
1,it seems that people like them ca n't act in a way in the film where they are,it would have been a much more powerful picture but not in a movie like that either
1,i found the idea of an interesting movie to follow itself in my head,i give it 8 out points that i would rate this film 1010 if you
1,nobody told me about it and i was lucky enough,nobody seems like it 's a comedy and there was so
1,the director chose his style to be very specific,the first story of the same old man
1,the ending of the movie is too much too late,the only reason i went into this whole production was the
1,gingerbread streep is a good actress who plays a character who is very much like an adolescent person,gingerbread in which he is supposed to be a hero is a great idea to make a movie
1,the plot is n't that compelling but as it comes down the viewer has to endure one of these three,the film also contains a scene which is as close as it has a woman in town to save
1,the best thing about the movie is the music of gene kelly,the plot is ridiculous in many ways but the movie has a solid
1,there was also a great use of a,there is nothing positive for his performance
1,another problem that seems like is the sound effects,another problem in the movie is its pacing
1,by the end of this episode i 've seen quite,by far one of the funniest movies ever made
1,so do yourself the favor you are ready to have anything that can add your brain to something and i doubt you could ever find a horror flick that 's completely enjoyable,so they 're being chased by a masked killer who kills everyone at the party and then throws them on so it is nice to see a woman with killer hair dangling with
1,it 's definitely a little predictable but its not so much about the acting of the,it is the story the acting and the acting to this movie was the best
1,this film is one big dud,this movie does n't get what it
1,omg what did this make up,omg do n't waste it your money
1,it seems that in fact every time the,it 's just a very funny movie
1,this one does a good job explaining what the hell it looks and sounds like,this is the kind of movie where the bad man and his friends do n't have
1,the film is beautifully shot throughout that the editing was crisp,the whole movie takes a serious turn at the middle and some
1,the cast and supporting cast are so uniformly good you will watch you,the story is about a father who 's father is a teenager he is
1,i mean really what can you do with such films,i remember seeing the opening sequence when it was in the
1,i would n't normally classify to be on the spot the same way that,i think that is enough to make us dislike a film so much
1,hi i just wanted to add an extra to the plot to,hi a waste and a total waste of time and space
1,i am shocked that this movie only lasted because of it not very accurate,i was n't expecting it since the beginning of the movie was a bit off
1,and yet he still manages his work for him,and then it 's all pretty easy to figure it
1,most notably the title of the film and i would advise everyone,most movies were made on tv but not a bad one
1,but what did n't they do,but what i think is n't too
1,heist on the nile was a good film about a couple things,heist is not my cup of tea there 's hardly a bad element
1,however in these words we have to accept that the people who made the movie had had,however his love has to go to him to get him to death when she does
1,this is a very good movie but the writing is horrible,this is n't the kind that you would likely see if the
1,you 'll thank a real audience to watch this,you can say that the film has great potential
1,i can almost see that the movie is an entirely different film but what an,i ca only say that the acting and special fx were a bit dodgy
1,the actors are excellent with a few exceptions,the film starts out as some sort where the
1,trust me i'm not going to reveal this,trust it you 'll be in tears
1,possible spoilers ahead i was thinking of seeing the film in the theater at imdb i decided that the acting was horrible in that respect,possible because i have not yet been able my finger to watch it and i have seen all the good parts of it the lion of

1,although its not a bad thing i liked it it simply has n't much else to,although i thought it would be some of the most original i 've come from
1,and the acting is awful so with the poor acting the awful screenplay and dialogue are so horrible these actors do n't even feel a lot like me,and the last scene in the movie was well worth your time and the movie does and that make me want to watch the film again instead and i
1,every aspect of this film reeks or,every other shot was simply great

1,great story about three children who are living on a rich house,great supporting performances are the ones that i call it excellent
1,but the first of these three beauties was in the same league group,but if you 're really into this kind kind that would have been the
1,a great film is definitely the only real dogme debut and should not only attract the attention of it 's audience,a lot more people would have said something about the plot and the movie that much like the original novel and it
1,michael biehn was actually good looking,michael pare is actually really nice but
1,this film has no logic but the good bits are still not the ones,this is n't a movie that will get you involved either way but it is
1,the acting is mediocre especially from the supporting supporting cast,the special features in the movie were very bad
1,if we wanted to make movies we would see it to the end to find out what to do,if you think that the show has been canceled on a lot is a masterpiece then you should avoid any
1,my guess that these are things that are going on on their mind in this movie,my recommendation for all was merited to fans of this wonderful work of art and the final
1,boris karloff stars the actor playing a cop who is determined into an apartment accident,boris karloff has an odd part but who he is as a good guy in his

1,the music by jerry bruckheimer is haunting the characters is great the costumes,the script is full and that 's because it does n't matter
1,this scene is a bit ambiguous for a change of pace but it is still an overall movie,this film was good and funny on the dvd version but then a long long and i ca n't
1,worth a look and not a must watch,worth watching once just do n't bother to watch
1,the performances are uniformly great and the story has a heart and mystery of how it goes on the path of getting into the real world,the film is a true classic and we both discover that a lot happens to be the one in the streets of paris to the point of
1,this is the story of the family and family,this is a story about a group in vietnam
1,i had trouble deciding to rent this movie because i had heard that it would be a good movie with the best,i could n't help thinking this could possibly have had been a spoof but unfortunately this one takes it for me
1,her performance is a mixture in the face she has,her name in this film is a little schmaltzy
1,as the two characters develop together they get to know each man who,as of it 's time i found it very enjoyable in spots
1,ehle should of received a nomination for this movie,ehle is one step down to this great thriller with
1,the ending is totally absurd and the movie was just horrible,the end of this mess is probably that the filmmakers have the
1,the fact she was a good director would be the best thing about this movie it,the characters seem to be so much fun to watch them in a different light
1,310 on video is about ten times,310 from the opening scene it is
1,so you have the original version of the classic the first one,so do not take this on a dvd or dvd 's cover and
1,after i had finished the whole thing was just plain horrible,after it 's time on the sundance dvd set of the dvd
1,why do we have to do that with a lot of people trying,why is this even a bad movie and the lack any attempt
1,i love the new guy and his voice of a,i saw it on the telly in the theatres
1,it was the best tv show around to show a couple and was done,it was n't that this film was supposed to be the comedy channel
1,one thing that you will never notice,one of my favorite movies ever
1,teaming with that the audience is left wondering about the other people,teaming up with the girl who happens to have been an imaginary sister
1,what could be an accurate piece of work is just not for the simple lack of respect and money,what i found the very first film of an original was the fact that it had its slow pace
1,i think the people who really dislike the movie to make this movie should give it a go and do all three of us it ought,i just recently watched it for over an year or in one of those tv episodes where you do n't want to see any episode
1,but this movie is a disgrace to other movies a must but i'm grateful,but in the end this movie is just boring and lacks any laughs
1,sandra bullock plays her exhusband who is an actress as a director 's character was a model at times in the movie,sandra kristel is perfect in her role and is also believable from the usual role of a talentless woman and a nice woman
1,while not the only one but the one that makes it so powerful in terms is the fact that it just adds to the tension,while one watches only the first glimpse of a few characters in the film a lot more of the characters do it 's best to avoid
1,one gets the sense that the movie makers have had the right kind to say to us all that 's where the,one more thing i noticed is that it is only a 3 hour movie like the other in the same direction
1,about one week later there is a mysterious yet strangely strong sequence of character 's two main characters and an intimate ending,about half the film from an opening shot of the main character of a man encountering some new footage of the famous odessa
1,there is n't a lot of action to sustain any reason,there are a few twists involving the most memorable scene in a
1,made in the fifties and then again it is a great family adventure but that 's not to be expected,made in the 70s the first thing you have is if you want a cheap horror film and i guarantee that
1,mary graham has been in for quite some years so to say she is too cute for the part she has been trying,mary 's character was too stupid to be a caricature a bit neurotic a guy not a likable one or anything less
1,when these four are together are so bad they do not match,when i first saw the preview on my local blockbuster i had an
1,it 's not even a movie i cant fathom,it would actually follow my memory but my patience for
1,the movie is well planned because of a lot more to it,the acting was ok but even there was not enough talent to put
1,much of the humor comes in a drunken attempt to be funny and funny,much more serious and disturbing than most of the original movies of the same subject
1,i think i would highly advise seeing the film,i am sorry i paid to watch this movie and
1,the result is a series that is supposed to appeal in many ways,the main problem with them is the idea for two guys making their actions
1,the two leads are excellent actors playing the young ones,the only reason i rented this was that they had to
1,he 's a perfect man who 's only a young boy who tries so hard,he 's not funny either but the movie is n't even close to the first two
1,the dialogue is not always about the real world,the story is told like a real tragedy
1,he 's a bit stiff in his role which is quite refreshing,he did n't seem to be in the movie as much as the
1,i 've been watching the series over so many years now,i remember watching it i had heard a few friends that i
1,but what the characters do they tell in real situations,but if it were there for the kids to watch this
1,the director does n't seem to know what,the film fails dismally in the book
1,suddenly his parents are attacked in his basement which is the best thing,suddenly there is a whole new cast which could n't be more exciting
1,as with most other documentaries i 've seen this movie i found it very difficult to enjoy a story of how the young victoria,as with some of the other reviews i just felt the need for the movie was more of an exercise in my imagination
1,even my father did my time of this,even so this is not a film
1,guess he 's trying out it takes place and the guy on the train is just the person,guess i'm not a horror movie buff and i guess the director did not know how to turn away
1,it 's an important element for all,it 's a very rare role
1,i mean that they do so with such a small budget and have been used of low budgets on tv,i 've seen more movies in my life that i can tell all the secrets and weaknesses of this film
1,in the end it 's only a matter on the end of this movie,in fact it 's the sort of film that is so utterly awful that it
1,gritty and very intelligent and the last time i saw this film,gritty realism the best it can make you laugh at it
1,abhay wei is excellent and is good,abhay is not a bad actress
1,little dieter was a good and bad show on it 's own as was the,little girl is a poor brat to the film and in his own son
1,this is the worst movie in the history direction,this movie also deals the issues and problems of some
1,a lot of people were left wondering when they were making a movie,a group is killed by the vampires to escape and eventually find them
1,almost put the entire package as part was filmed with a handheld camcorder and a camera lens of the,almost immediately i got to see the film and i wanted to be able to suspend my impression
1,this movie is one that i would recommend renting for the whole family,this movie is one of those movies that never gets to that of any
1,denholm peckinpah 's first film is a real pleasure,denholm waterston 's performance is the reason you 're not
1,there is n't a whole lot so little else that can be said about the,there are some good scenes and a bit part of an actor playing pool
1,they make this movie about what the people who actually do n't,they have a certain and interesting attitude that they never had
1,i love the film because of the talent involved,i think there 's nothing much positive here
1,in order of finding who can destroy a world of people who want for a big man to come to grips to the world as the story takes place,in a nutshell the only time given that this is a film in all its ineptitude it 's not even bad enough to make you laugh out loud
1,the movie was not funny at times but it was enjoyable,the movie does succeed mainly because of the presence of the three
1,leland was so well developed a story of an actor,leland is a character who does n't like a man
1,she was actually a lot of fun to watch because she said how she became the first victim,she was supposed and at times i think she was supposed to be about 18 minutes longer than that
1,they find out that a group member have killed their family,they could have used their characters for this film and i hope
1,just look at this flick that will have you laughing hysterically,just the right note about as far as i'm exaggerating
1,in general the characters are mostly undeveloped the characters never seem real,in the end they have to be so good because if they do
1,yet it shows him when his father is kidnapped and we see his mom in a suit,yet the idea that i had not read the novel the characters and were trying to reach the
1,it was a lot harder to see if this was not a tv series and it,it 's no surprise that a film like this could easily take liberties on it
1,the film is full of tension and drama,the film is a very stylish picture
1,nothing really happens and what the hell is that about,nothing else to look at in a context is an engaging
1,also the script did n't really work that direction and the result,also starring are paul and jerry who are now very talented
1,if i had i 'd have to say that the show is,if it were a good movie it would have gotten better
1,it 's a lot of people say it 's not fair that this is one movie or a romantic comedy,it 's all about the movie as well but it 's not only because it has the usual story lines and
1,unfortunately if you get this just take,unfortunately this movie is a dud
1,is this the real deal of the night stalker movie set during,is this supposed to represent the same sort of true horror
1,i'm sorry but in the past year with so many problems there must be a couple that do not deserve to have seen the big budget that they have,i'm not a big jane austen fan to enjoy all that one and i still prefer but they have been in their grave for the past 40 years
1,but then suddenly the film kicks into the ground as he 's on the prowl and when the woman appears the bad,but i did n't get to the last one because i could have played one that was made as a comedy
1,again this is the one movie i watched so far in many years,again this film is so bad so bad it can barely work
1,if you were to compare the movie to a classic version of the book that 's how i would think of this one,if you want people in trouble to get out if the film was not funny and that 's what you can do with the
1,this movie is not only the best animated film ever it 's one of the best,this is about as much one good as the film is one and it 's a bit
1,the plot is rather weak although they do have to give a simple and incomprehensible twist,the acting in this film is very poor although its not as good or better than the
1,well i can see no reason given to this movie for what should,well let 's try to get to the bottom of this mess
1,since he has his own unique character he 's trying to help out and save him from the fate,since i have n't understood and the entire world i do n't want to bash the title and pretend it
1,helen is married to someone who 's been put into the hospital by a doctor who,helen mirren as the devil 's daughter is n't all of her standard acting here
1,but when i see them on screen the movie shows the people that have just been living for them,but i must say if i should 've gone into the coma and i 'd have been so i would
1,fans of independent cinema will find this film mildly watchable and in my mind,fans of the series know what to think and what is going on
1,it 's like a bunch 's most of the actors in the movie are supposed or were they doing everything they 've,it 's only for a small percentage who is not in love with the other of them in the first place
1,he also looks like a plastic child with,he is a real joy to watch
1,the film also features a bunch to tell us about the meaning,the film 's humor in it and the acting is superb
1,the performances of robert de niro and john payne was pretty solid and i was looking at a particularly decent actor,the characters are a bunch of unlikable people who seem to know nothing about their characters as if you are the person
1,so all in all not your standard slasher flick the movie might get a 10 out of 5,so i had no idea that the movie was the best horror of the entire flick so i 'll
1,i could n't wait for something to come on television on that level,i 've been in my thirties and will not watch it since i do
1,the characters were so believable and the acting was perfect,the scene where one of the characters and his mother 's
1,this film has its own faults,this is another movie where the director
1,he is very good as a cop who has had him from behind him that they are not,he 's a big man and a good family man who is a member of the community
1,the film is set about the same fate over and down until the midway point,the script is just as follows the book 's book of the novel itself but it
1,in fact if you are a huge horror fan avoid this at all costs,in the end it 's a little anticlimatic but i wo out of it now
1,they must have only the token old man who 's been so obsessed to death so much,they are still making a joke that a horror star can do not get an idea of how
1,this is not about something we can do a film for but it,this is not a musical of the period but it certainly is
1,the scene with her fianc 's wife and her body just does it perfectly,the acting is excellent the special fx are n't bad the film is well paced
1,it looked very like a home movie with a budget of a little more money i 'll never ever again make it,it is not for everyone but if they are n't so real they just ca all the characters get involved in
1,the film is very fast and you need to have,the character of morgan is a very realistic woman
1,baseball is the biggest selling point in film history and i thought it should be a little longer in,baseball the show and the two toon episodes were made in 1989 that have been done so well
1,there are parts that go nowhere,there 's not much more than a
1,maybe it was the music the music,maybe with an intricate amount of effort it
1,it 's a shame that the original is probably the worst movie ever,it 's funny but the movie is just too cheesy and dull
1,more people do n't like this movie,more interested in the making viewer than with
1,she is an extremely smart character in all the movie,she was the only survivor in the beginning the real woman
1,a movie that has such a good message and makes you care about what you feel,a group members have the audacity of being trapped under a rock and a mysterious spirit led
1,played out like i was in the early 70s,played by sam waterston i felt that he 's playing
1,typical spoiler i ca n't imagine anyone else liking this film,typical of the movies i mentioned had a good deal
1,janet leigh 's character also plays out like a very sensitive version that was more of a challenge than a celebration that the,janet leigh is a bit out of her depth and does n't seem as much as good but who can blame her
1,vinny gets a lot from me and has a,vinny is one who can help his father
1,a movie that can take place in a new york,a very good movie with a very touching atmosphere
1,no wonder that she is n't in this movie at least,no one seems to realize that this is a lowbudget production
1,gibson was also good as the villain of a story but for the other two parts he 's too,gibson had a great sense of humor when he was trying too far too serious to be funny
1,but the director should stick to a more serious approach,but the scene where the woman 's sister goes a step
1,after the first half of the movie it started with a couple of,after having seen that show i still wanted to enjoy every minute
1,i was a lot of fun but the fact is it just goes too far,i was laughing out laughing when this movie was going back then to me a bit
1,this is an excellent western with a terrific cast,this is a movie about a group who just happen
1,the film is shot in color and the way in black and white,the action sequences are as if the producers had the slightest money
1,but there 's no denying that it was really funny watching it,but with its cryptic theme its message and the general lack of a
1,she never came close to making sure she was just,she plays a beautiful and courageous man so well
1,though on the case the movie moves around,though the story is a little weak the film
1,i did not feel the need to make a connection between the two so i'm just being nitpicky,i have never seen so many shows that i have watched for a while even to watch
1,his acting is very good too,his character in this movie is in
1,in fact i would have liked it better if the director kept,in fact we have seen her more in a supporting performance
1,a lot better for me it 's,a few laughs just stand out
1,now i can say that this movie was one of the best i 've ever heard,now i'm sure the real murderer and that 's going into the movie 's charm
1,the acting in this is awful all round,the action is slow paced the acting is awful
1,there are two things that make this film special,there had been nothing original to be found here
1,mary tyler plays his wife with a great,mary astor is excellent at the role
1,having seen it i was totally mesmerized by this film,having watched hundreds of other movies in the past the only
1,get a little help if you can manage in it 's fullest i suppose it will be the first hour,get this one out unless you count a bunch but as a film i would have missed the ending
1,very good acting by all the cast,very much like the story of a teenager
1,the only thing this movie could have had was if a really stupid screenplay could have been edited,the main problem is the lack thereof but it does offer enough space and it is all pretty well
1,in a brief period of film time,in fact it 's just bad
1,shoot em down was a fun film,shoot the two in the beginning with each
1,if your movie is the truth of what is going on with the story the acting and direction will,if you can get past this i doubt that you 'll ever forget how accurate the first is
1,hey i 've watched the trailer version that was a major flop for me and my roommate and he had forgotten that the,hey i saw that i laughed when seeing this movie i would just want to tell my friends to take it seriously
1,the script is so awful the script is so bad it 's laughable,the cast is so stiff and the film is so unbearable in that it
1,but i just read my review on this movie,but it is the typical performance by this movie that
1,the dialogue is n't witty and the dialog just does not work at all is it,the only reason the film is going is because the script writer 's name just did n't
1,i did not understand it as being an accident to me to see this movie again,i love the scene when i have a scene with a man being gouged out and then
1,the whole picture is simply a collection of,the first half is excellent as well
1,first in addition the movie lacks any of the usual formula of the first film,first of all it 's probably about a killer who appears to be a robot from
1,it 's all been done since there is so many similarities to this movie that the director expects us and the audience,it 's a wonderful performance it has some beautiful moments that the viewer may laugh about as an example of the phrase
1,a must love to see the way the audience is in,a few moments were just left to be put together
1,it was all time and more,it had the good plot and the
1,this will definitely be my most favorite piece for most laughs from the first season and i 'll start with the fact this is a movie that,this is definitely a film so what i missed was a nice little movie like the texas chain on precinct punk and the hills have eyes
1,to summarize i watched these movies in the theatre,to me this had a few minor attributes
1,i have to say i love this film,i found it funny at times the story line
1,in this version the characters come across as though something is played out like real human beings or two friends are walking through walls,in this film it just means that he was gay and just because he does n't love it anymore he makes his friends
1,the end of the story is as much as the movie,the two actors are terrific and the acting by all is excellent
1,the whole story is that of a family and the rest of the movie where all of them are concerned and do n't know a single thing about one boy,the two films that follow an untimely waste of film and of a series of two or three are the only moments where one of a kind is left
1,on the other hand the film has an extra dimension,on the other part of this film was the music and
1,oh no that is n't true,oh this made me look at my
1,it just did n't seem to have inspired,it 's just not possible to waste money this
1,she should not stick to this one,she 's a pretty hot woman and she
1,the cast is ok they are all,the end is a real treat
1,but the fact is that this is the first movie i 've ever seen when,but this movie was the worst i have had i graduated from this monstrosity
1,this is the best example it can be,this was probably the worst film about the way
1,generally this is a horrible film,generally i found it mildly funny to
1,he is just a big step back trying hard times and tries to bring the movie to some parts of,he does have the guts and intelligence in the role and this is evident throughout some quite remarkable performances
1,her performance is very natural and she does an,her voice was dubbed at her old school
1,if the guy who gave it a score of 9 could n't because of the fact that he did what was the only,if there was any reason to see it it would be that they are used as a means to see a film
1,ponder the question of this question is that,ponder the audience is a good movie
1,there are the usual attempts at humour i think a joke of a young male audience 's interest should n't be insulted,there 's almost a moment of drama between his character of the two protagonists who have to deal with the guilt of his
1,demi moore and susan longoria are great,demi lansbury is excellent as a manipulative woman
1,this is so bad it is hard to sit and enjoy and watch,this movie is n't a bad movie with bad lighting the story about the
1,the plot does n't even try that of a woman,the plot centers on two boys who do n't seem much
1,the acting is very strong and it makes you jump the plot,the movie was well crafted and acted well but not enough
1,another problem is that the characters are very shallow and,another one you will notice who is n't supposed
1,where are all the other characters,where do i begin with the fact
1,they did and the movie could n't,they were good friends who worked
1,the director of the book is the most irritating person that the last two,the problem with the film is that it is a long lost story
1,vivek oberoi and robert carlyle play their roles a bit,vivek oberoi 's score is quite haunting and effective
1,i 've never seen such a great show as a show,i think many people will find it hard for him to enjoy
1,the music is pretty good at least for me,the music does n't leave you with no option no
1,if any one wanted to say the least about the killer 's then the curse of the gods was it was good,if you love a film about the holocaust and see of his love you 're like watching a bunch of movies
1,triple h should never be on the top 250 list,triple crosses is one that will not be missed by an
1,there was another scene in the movie where the characters are introduced to the actors,there are some redeeming value about the movie at first glance is that if i were
1,she was not a very strong person,she was not the only person
1,after hearing about the story about the first two thirds i really thought it was the worst movie i have ever seen,after seeing this movie i really liked the movie for the first 45 min then hav it back to the middle and end
1,that 's what it 's really the actors of the,that 's why the movie is so much good
1,some of it is pretty but it 's not really worth the effort to make the movie,some other reviewers have noted that this film is quite possibly the worst of its type
1,he also meets some old people like the people he loves,he has also used a lot of different films that are more
1,here are some things 1 there 's a bit more of it in the film,here he has the typical american feel and a strong understanding that is the only scene
1,i 'll have to think more if you read in which you would be so much,i 've read many of john sayles 's recent pictures so i ca n't say
1,but the movie fails that the acting is terrible the plot was n't very good the acting a bit too much for me i do n't recommend this crap but if you like horror movies,but with a few exceptions i can tell you that my opinion is that of a group 's great experience and most of the people around you the audience is not afraid of them
1,i think i'm a fan but they say i could be better,i just hope we have the rights to show this show today on
1,plus i have to mention that for one long term the film is a,plus this is supposed for fans it hurts me to my own dismay
1,though some are just plain dumb to me this one lacks anything like what would happen,though the action sequences are mostly very good as they seem nothing is interesting either
1,one of the many things that makes this movie great is that you never see the light of a screen in a more than a long time,one of them is not going to be able to act in every scene the film is trying so very close to the end of the movie and
1,a friend of mine has to find no,a wonderful film on an obscure level
1,later the movie is over and it starts at an hour long,later on he finds dead and his sister to become a very strong
1,this movie has a special effect to bring along the,this is a must see for anyone 's entertainment
1,the story is predictable and the story just looks,the acting and the script are also good
1,the scene with the killer in the beginning is priceless,the movie is not so bad it was good
1,seeking to tell him what he should do when she gets the job,seeking an explanation of the plot there 's that feeling to it
1,this is one of those movies where every aspect of the film is a work,this is a great movie and the reason for it is a film which is definitely
1,the movie was too depressing and boring for you even tho you,the movie is a little too weak even for a thriller
1,i do n't understand how disney actually got up with making a,i do n't know how it got made into a comedy
1,i guess you will find out this little things will get you thinking of it,i do not feel the need to make a point like this the film does offer
1,finally to the surprise this one did well,finally the movie begins in the woods
1,and of course what did they think,and then the camera pans up
1,his portrayal is far from his usual,his character is a little weak
1,it 's an ok movie just for the sake in your opinion and you should be guaranteed,it 's just a movie so you get to see a lot more and the gore
1,there 's no character development and the story is about an imagined situation that is only mildly developed in the,there are no words to a describe how one can really describe movies or such liberties about the plot
1,and we 're not sure whether it is,and the music is a little reminiscent
1,the director of this film was very interested in the movie that he was capable of producing,the script is so bad that it 's funny not scary in any depth whatsoever and when one
1,its more realistic than anything in terms of its subject matter,its just so poor on every level that makes your average laugh
1,i love films all in a country,i ca only say that the show has
1,its a big budget to be the first of all the classic movies,its just too bad for the makers to work with this film
1,the main plot is an excuse a man is brutally raped with a broken arm by a woman,the director of this excellent movie could n't seem like it was n't made by a filmmaker
1,watching this show would not be surprised if,watching this and a lot of action
1,when it was originally released theatrically on abc in 1957 with its release of the last series it still holds up better than a new version of 'the simpsons',when i heard someone on late in the cast that were being the case with me i watched the movie and i have only seen that i do not agree
1,i 've seen the movie and is a great actor,i 've been my mother to see the same movie in
1,however the story is too unbelievable too,however the story line is pretty good in
1,i was looking forward to watching this film with a straight face,i ca only think of many that is worse than this
1,the problem with this movie the acting in this movie are that it made me realize how to lose a few good actors but no one would think of the real thing,the movie was written by a guy who wrote the book and could not understand about it but did his job for it as that movie was a tribute in the first place
1,the performances are so bland that i have read the novel on the radio page,the main problem was that there seemed to be two people that could n't possibly go
1,and it 's so funny it actually makes you wish that it would be a sequel,and he did n't have the skills to be at the end of his life
1,the movie is so long as you get your heart ache with it a second time,the story is full throttle and it does contain some genuinely funny scenes such an utter joy
1,i 've been a avid fan since i was a child who loved the film despite,i know they 're too critical because they only think that a few of the actors were
1,after a long wait and a few years before a few hours was left the film was filled with unexplained moments to the film,after a couple of decades there is a long line of people talking and complaining that you feel in your eyes of someone involved in
1,anyway all are a very good feature team,anyway the movie is well done with a very
1,being an avid fan i'm still waiting tables to find some redeeming qualities in these days,being a fan i still like the new age and is not surprised to see them as
1,they have all the right buttons in an animated way,they could 've been more interested if this film could have
1,of course it 's not the movie that makes things that much easier to follow but i found it impossible to suspend,of particular interest is the scene where the doctor is the girl and they come from the movie by the way
1,the acting is n't perfect or the acting all this is all really awful,the ending does n't do much for the viewer at all but rather than the
1,it was a nice move to be made but after watching the movie and seeing them in the,it 's a pretty good movie with a lot of laughs and a few other plot twists
1,i think that the only good part is the character alex,i found this movie an awful piece of garbage and a cheap
1,although i love it i'm very glad to see it coming out in the country so maybe this could be some kind from me,although it is n't one of the few films i can recommend to my kids this has to be the worst movie i ever seen
1,the director of the novels are making an attempt to save that,the director seems intent that the characters are shallow and underdeveloped
1,the plot of the story sounded very much like a documentary of the characters in,the film is so bad it just has to take itself away from that
1,also there 's a certain amount there in this movie,also the ending was so unrealistic and so contrived that i
1,most of his scenes with the camera were on the phone the shots look very cheap,most critics have commented on saying some sort of violence and some really bad gore
1,and in the end it will leave you feeling empty in the mood that you 'll see as much of the plot as you do in the first part,and of all three guys who seem good and happy of the two ladies of the past and the new kid 's and a woman he is still a bit
1,we know of that type but the film lacks any kind what plot,we follow the same exact plot as the original show on the same night
1,so to avoid any of it like this movie has all the ingredients that make this film a good watch on the whole is a wonderful film,so i do applaud him for trying to find this man for sale so they can be seen a few moments so they ca to erase that in
1,this would n't be enough not to put a,this is by far my favorite show ever
1,the film 's soundtrack is absolutely ridiculous,the cast was decent and most of them
1,as i 've said about 34 times before i get into the story and what follows the,as i write this comment the plot in this film is very well written and directed
1,robert mitchum did it on a very limited role but he did n't,robert altman has tried to sell it for himself with the film
1,witch finds her husband with the keys to the floor which was obviously a,witch of the story has been a classic in movies by a mile
1,i guess that a very good premise,i know one has to wait
1,he plays the character his own to the end of his film the,he even makes such an entertaining one that it 's worth seeing
1,additionally what an interesting concept and a movie that i love so i even got to watch the dvd i have enjoyed it,additionally as a result the first two sequels manage to build the whole atmosphere with a steady punch on the face of a plot
1,i was amazed to see this movie again,i 'll admit that this is one of my
1,even so it is one dimensional action movie and a few,even a movie like this should not be missed viewing
1,of all of the actors in film history they make up one of these,of mice the women are the most beautiful and vicious little creatures ever
1,what has happened a mystery on the,what the hell was going on'
1,in fact it 's not enough to save it as soon a person or a fan you can see a film that could have possibly been a great film,in a way and not only the first film this one could n't have been made so far because this was a good series with great special effects
1,the other is the fact that a director who,the film is very entertaining and well lit
1,it 's a waste your time there 's some pretty good actors in out of space,it 's a pity even more of the comedy duo and the requisite cameo cast are put
1,he 's an intelligent and confident man a fine man who knows what he wants to be,he is able a lot of films like they 're not funny in a few ways a funny
1,it 's a waste of time and a,it 's been over a few months
1,the only problem was the movie 's plot structure and all the bad things just do,the rest of this movie is so bad that the viewer will probably enjoy it
1,the only thing the movie is about the killer was his grandma,the dialogue is awful the acting sucks the production values are awful the
1,there 's no plot there 's nothing funny at all really interesting,there is a lot of bad dialog and some bad language but i
1,woody harrelson has a great screen time,woody b coppola could have done more with
1,this is a wonderful work from beginning to its end where,this is one of those movies but it was n't
1,seagal shows he could n't make you stop thinking but then when you take a man who 's on a different,seagal 's performance seems so flat and contrived as to take over the board to get his trademark kicked down
1,this is the worst of anyone who really likes the show,this movie is about as deep away as this is so when
1,it 's got some very funny elements and some of them is funny and it 's fun to see that i have n't watched all that other movies but have to say i did like this movie and,it 's the same thing we see in the film it is as though the characters have been developed to give us anything to do with their lives and their lives and each other in the end
1,this movie is a great one to be entertained at,this movie would have looked like any of them
1,the story is so full of holes that they ca all the things,the acting is okay so far from good it 's pretty bad
1,i saw this movie when i was 11,i mean seriously the story is full as a
1,one of the greatest comedies ever made,one thing about it that can compare to
1,it will always be the same kind of movie that we usually get in hollywood,it 's one of those stories where i could give the movie a 10
1,see the trailer by george c reilly while waiting for another day,see the final showdown between the two leads in the courtroom
1,shatner is a fine actor who is a total failure to look a character,shatner is also the most likable character in this movie because he portrays a man
1,some of that in fact is a real good example of how it should have been played better in the beginning,some moments in the show are hilarious yet there have to be something more or something that really gets them together in
1,if it 's all the case i know what the story is n't,if it 's on tv and dvd releases this one will do
1,i have been waiting to experience them for years before the next election,i think it 's one that i had to watch as part of the
1,the only difference between the two movies is there is a lot of things missing plot development,the characters were well developed so what were the director trying for a comedy that would be much
1,as if to underline the problems this film could have have with the story for what is in it 's message,as the movie unfolds he meets the old man in the end but not that he is a man who 's lost
1,in my opinion i do not consider this movie the problem with it the movie is simply about how the filmmakers were in the first movie they needed a little too more to tell people they have made it so that the filmmakers have to,in this case it 's the fact that he has no idea of what happens is made at all and does n't even think of his other work or his own feelings for each other but they 're also interesting as well as well
1,it 's also a great little parody with an awesome soundtrack soundtrack and nice,it was more about the character and it really was a good idea
1,in their own life all the inhabitants of the expedition are a bunch and each time they,in her autobiography she just looks at a mirror when her young man is wearing dresses
1,while this film is a total misfire it has an amateurish production values and a lot of potential,while this film does not make me think of the director or the movie he clearly knows that there
1,quid go off to the guy and he finds,quid are the main point of this movie
1,it 's pretty well done and you,it also has the best scene
1,for example one of my favorite scenes is in the,for the ladies they did n't mind the movie
1,what you get is a poorly done,what do i know about them
1,as is the case in the story the acting and directing are excellent,as soon a character is introduced to his own family and is able the
1,that is one of the best things on this movie,that 's because of that it makes it look like a
1,i 've been waiting for guffman in a long time this film,i love this movie i have some fondness for the movie
1,when i heard that the people of newcastle would think that the film was a real stinker i really did think that it might be another,when he returns home to a town in which he tries desperately at an orphanage this movie is filled with flashbacks on his own life
1,essentially this is a rather pedestrian movie that never really stood out,essentially i saw it all and found it hard for me to get
1,furst had to be the director to make a,furst 's character was not the least sympathetic
1,our heroine is a very powerful character she is a beautiful human woman who has a daughter who 's who can find to have a child who is really looking for her daughter and so forth,our hero 's death is a bit confusing it 's very disturbing how we are not dealing or going for a reason to be a hero or a hero because it 's a bad guy
1,the only time i have seen her comes in when she does,the ending leaves you hanging and wondering which ending i like
1,sorry but i ca only rate a comment in,sorry but not a pleasant diversion to follow
1,i did not realize that there were a lot more to it than i hoped,i hope you have it so much but do n't spend your money on a movie
1,the characters are not as developed by the actors as they are but it is clear that they were not,the story is that in another movie called a bad boy who is trying to hide from his wife
1,a bad bad choice from the producer that is clearly not the best movie about a man he,a great performance by james turturro as the lead who was really very good and a little
1,abbott and gromit is no exception,abbott and hare are the two guys
1,it 's an interesting film for the whole cast,it 's difficult to say who 's that bad who
1,that it might actually be a little bit boring,that 's about all there is to it
1,good to see the guy is wearing a mask suit with blood and a beard at his nose the only person who gives them in the way is the,good luck for those interested in this sort of movies because it is the one that is the exact reason why it had a little appeal to them
1,what kind of a bad movie to,what is with all the gays
1,grim and unsettling do you just think you will get more,grim reaper in a sense that if you do not like gore
1,so is in fact the story is about two losers who do everything that their love never gets to know and is,so the plot itself does n't have to be believable either that the killer and the scientist were killed or did this
1,the first one had more plot holes than any other film that i can think of but it is just a boring film,the acting is wooden the editing laughable even the music and editing are pretty bad and this film suffers too heavily from some people
1,the script by michael keaton is a bit slow but the plot is quite original with a witty script,the characters are n't much of an interesting story and the director seems to have no idea how such a
1,let me start by telling me that i had to rent it thinking it 's a bad movie,let me say that if you have the opportunity of meeting the main character you should do
1,i remember seeing this recently because i enjoyed a lot,i could n't find another funny thing in fact
1,the whole concept of the movie is just a few random,the plot moves briskly with characters that are just stupid
1,given a great score and the fact that the story is not a little convoluted the characters are n't,given this time period he made it all right and not even at all costs on the part
1,why do they call him trinity but even if you really enjoyed it there are few,why do they even have to go into making a movie like that so popular
1,i saw a number called which was going to happen to the public for what they was,i would n't have been surprised if the writers had only had cut them into a fulllength episode
1,he also looks for all his life he was in love life and his friendship with the woman in love would have,he does not know what to make of the film but there is some kind here so obviously this is true
1,and if you do n't believe me i 've been told of the story of what the,and the ending is not funny although it 's quite obviously one bit of the best
1,soon the man meets the thief of death,soon the young woman turns her back onto it
1,however i was surprised by seeing the movie,however she is a good idea a good actress
1,if you must avoid this movie do not read reviews on it,if we need more movies like this then a new generation would never
1,now do not worry that this movie was supposed to be bad and worse it was just poor,now i did see a great cast that did n't make a film or a plot to make things
1,this is an all time classic,this is definitely one of miike 's
1,i would have known it was a tv show for a little more money if,i 've been trying to stop this movie by accident or just watched it
1,some of them were n't the worst,some of the scenes really add a touch
1,if it was that a kid we might have to agree and like,if you want to get something you need to take your pick
1,also there were n't many good things and it had the look to a good movie noir,also it turns out to be the only character i can name to mention that this movie is
1,i had been looking for a copy on a video format so i figured this was going to be one,i do n't like this film as one of those and i still love the characters and their lives
1,the characters are so onedimensional and even stupid that i was thinking of trying to make you laugh every time you 're together,the performances of the girls are very good the film looks pretty good but there is n't anything here i ca ca n't get
1,the script 's premise is fairly good and,the film is just an utter mess
1,basically when you saw it as you were thinking and i do n't see it all you can really appreciate it,basically if you like zombie vampires as the characters are to the movie and you are going to get in the movie
1,i love to mention how a person like me is going to end that she 's gay,i ca all about this movie but it does n't work either as it is the typical american
1,there are a few scenes that make you cringe at the film 's flaws,there are no good scenes the special makeup makeup the special makeup fx were bad
1,you can also call this a film as the first film he ever had,you 'll see it as the next the first time you see it
1,it 's a shame because the show is still better and,it was n't an awful movie i would have known
1,patterson 's mother is the worst,patterson is a bad guy so we
1,these are what you can call them and,these days i was n't a fan
1,no plot no real character development just a little inconsistent,no one else who was in this film would seem to
1,sometimes the plot gets more predictable,sometimes there 's only a handful minutes
1,the plot of this man is a,the movie is really well made
1,the whole film is set on a farm where the inhabitants are in the desert and begin to survive the events that occur,the other actors have done better in this movie the first the fact that their was n't the big fan of either way i
1,the music was n't too bad but the acting was ok and the acting was pretty,the character of jesse is also interesting enough despite a constant beard from the end
1,warren william did a remarkable acting job,warren beatty has been so funny in other
1,it would be a shame a sequel to this is spinal tap,it is one that has been put together quite possibly the best of
1,i love that but this too seems as if she were n't sure,i 'd rather be a little more interested to see these two main two
1,the whole film was a complete disappointment,the movie is basically one set of actors
1,still there might have never been another,still this is a great film
1,someday i 'll stop laughing in a theater,someday you will get what you like
1,even though we 're talking about racism the subject matter was very,even if you watch it to death it will do nothing
1,supposedly this movie is n't really worth all the trouble with it 's one the worst movie i can think i 've ever been appalled as,supposedly a series could have been more so shorter than an inconvenient truth like the one the girl might have had in the first place
1,he never seems like he is the best of,he plays the leader but does not care
1,oh did you notice it was so boring that you could have taken a few minutes to get it on you just waiting,oh and a bunch of other actors who just have n't been able to make it worth mentioning that they were both
1,i ca n't understand why they did n't make good choices,i think that it may be a guilty pleasure to sit through
1,in fact the worst thing i have ever seen,in the end that makes it sound more like the
1,he is a film producer of this type of film and while most filmmakers are being,he does n't even look a bit too old to be like a good actor
1,meanwhile all those moments are the film which is one of the best,meanwhile the man who appears in the original series was left behind the first
1,it 's funny to see her as a nun,it also happens in other horror movies and is in
1,the movie is really really bad and the acting for a lot of people was really bad enough that i expected more out there,the script is so bland they seem to be in full depth of clichs that makes the film confusing it 's too difficult to find
1,cash to kill the guy from hell who did n't know anything about them being a cat,cash on hand for example is the only good thing about this film that the first 10 minutes
1,matheson was so great that he became so funny to me in,matheson plays an excellent villain who has a beard in it
1,be aware and you want people to believe that they 'll,be sure to find this movie and do not try
1,the first is that a movie like i mentioned a few times in which it was directed by roger corman 's work and i could n't help but compare it out to him,the acting was wooden as to the bad scriptwriting i didnt have a clue but the cgi was ok and the story was very realistic and it was a very cool film to view
1,it was nice to see a movie on the big screen in a way that 's filled with funny moments such as the last one,it was one of the best movies in the past 50 plus but no matter what the title character came to mind in my last review
1,it could have been written better had it had a whole,it 's one of my favorite films i 've seen
1,the rest of the cast members who appear to be just as big,the dialogue is so terrible the story line is a little muddled
1,the main actor is a young woman from new york after she arrives in prison and gets away with her husband and falls for her and helps,the only thing that i did n't see was that this film could possibly have had a huge twist it took itself just as a comedy
1,another major problem is there is no apparent explanation of how this thing became any more apparent in my opinion,another interesting thing is that these guys are so real they do not even know they 're getting drunk
1,for once you 'd be a fan of it,for a long time in that world of a few
1,i really ca only believe in the director for the fact one of those songs and that there 's not even in the world but if,i really enjoyed this picture despite looking at the cover cover it is as if the director had a really fun eye for this film
1,you do n't expect any good explanation of who the hero is until that comes out and that he has the worst line,you do n't want it but this one is a big disappointment with a different ending than the rest in my school
1,you can never guess anything about this film and it really,you know there are many actors that do some things
1,it would be a great scene to have a film with three different actors but there are so many characters to do n't have to work together just as it happens,it would have had more drama if the filmmakers left the theatre with something so interesting and entertaining and funny as if it was n't for the fact that it 's not
1,the story makes no logical sense at least not for the fact that the audience feels sympathy for the characters as they go but they 're also not funny either,the only good scene involves an intriguing one where one of his students asks him to watch his face in a car to find what he thinks he must have been
1,but it fails to make any difference from here,but even the actors are much more fun
1,aside for a few weeks i 've spent 90 minutes describing this film and it is an insult to it that i can think of all the comments in the film,aside from it 's original ideas the actors can be forgiven by a script to be written by the actors and this movie suffers somewhat on the fact to make up for
1,the movie was n't great enough to make a profit,the movie 's story is very simple although the film does
1,this movie is not only on the case as it,this is the best film of the last decade
1,i 'd say i saw this movie when she saw it in her birthday,i had to watch this movie expecting something a little more serious then a waste
1,have the filmmakers ever been able to hold back or not,have you ever thought the film was going to win the best
1,it 's almost as though this movie was made just to shock and make sense,it had an original screenplay which it managed to create more than just an hour in
1,uninspired movie that has little to recommend it in fact i ca n't believe,uninspired film i think it 's a movie which is so badly directed
1,what if he is so obsessed after watching,what an unfortunate example of the time
1,it really does n't have a lot going for them and for some of,it 's quite funny it is as good entertainment as any other films
1,but it would be unfair to see a movie as good as,but it also happens with most films on the subject matter
1,on his way of being a new york city he is given a chance from his former wife and his daughter to a rich wealthy young son who befriends his brother after the suicide,on the positive side if there was any truth from any of it it would be that the filmmakers themselves and writer could not have been making a film about his mother on the news
1,he 's the villain and while this is n't a bad movie he does,he and the kids are all pretty and the women are very good
1,a movie about how much she hates it if you can find it a little bit like the first and that is a much more interesting way to kill someone,a good movie for the whole movie worth watching as a matter movie as one 's only chance was to take up the slack for this story of the serial and
1,both as a comedy and a drama i did n't think this movie was going near all the same as a real,both stories of a family of men and girls come together that of a very conservative but very very powerful individual
1,worth the watch if only for the acting alone,worth a good watch if you are bored
1,hopefully he will have her or her in more and less movies,hopefully it 'll be a good idea to give a second rate performance
1,shot in the streets in which the camera is used to show it in the distance,shot in mexico and that was a lot of the location work and costumes that make the
1,the only real asset in this film was the presence,the actors had a great deal going well together
1,that is not why i gave it a ten,that 's why i gave this an award
1,go with this movie i feel sorry to get out,go to the theater with it expecting a film
1,instead we get a dull plodding and unsatisfying attempt at comedy,instead of leaving the viewer to root for it and i ca
1,i remember seeing this film in a class in new zealand city in london,i 'd not recommend a film to be bad the only thing that is true
1,and what is worse the plot or the good direction or the direction,and the first 15 and even some really gory scenes with these kids getting
1,does n't that get a hold of a movie,does this show have the following kind of happy endings
1,i had the opportunity to see it at the london international film festival,i liked the way the book began to get the viewer into a world
1,unfortunately i did n't get what happened to her that was as shallow and as i thought she would be the last couple,unfortunately he is too young and wiser to be funny in the sense that the real world of the world is gone beyond this
1,first there 's a scene of this film which is very sad and disturbing,first we see a woman walking around a woman screaming about 15 years on a
1,in my opinion that is why these films did n't have to be a blockbuster and that was what they have been doing so,in this movie if someone knows what you 're talking it is about as stupid as you could ever really be in a horror film
1,but even he ca do n't make the mistake of the characters because of the poor dialogue and the terrible dialogue which is a bit overdone to today 's audience as he attempts very well to be funny,but this time for me to get married in that part of the movie i can say that i was not bored by the acting and the dialog but i was so bored to love what is left
1,however the movie is very good and that is why most of us have seen it,however the main problem is that there 's not much tension there 's a very interesting atmosphere
1,but he does n't come up as being likable either,but even though this is my opinion of a good book
1,as far the problem is the script did n't fit in the,as far as good films go this movie is just hysterical
1,a story in the right way which is about a woman who is raped with,a woman from a different society she is a young man and her sister
1,neither does it constitute anything like he 's trying to tell you he does like to do that for a reason not a bad sign,neither in the end of this documentary they are all in denial and are forced by their misfortunes to escape from what is being screened so
1,this really was the best part of the movie where the characters were not developed,this made an excellent sense of the term about the fact i was so fascinated
1,all three are the same as they did in,all in all this is a great show
1,well we have a bunch of people who would try to help out the kids,well if i had to write a review of all to the best and i could
1,you 'll be able to read it again and it is the truth you see on the screen and the message of life in general,you know you will be left in a very dark mood or when you 're getting bored with the fact that something that is not really
1,anyone else will laugh and enjoy it,anyone who does so please see this film
1,i really wish i could explain the name of the movie and,i ca n't think how all this works is a joke
1,it is a little jarring but what it did it 's shortcomings in me was the fact that the,it 's just bad taste that is supposed to be funny it really is not the worst either
1,i 'd heard the name of the movie was a real snuff film so i was n't in it for years,i had heard it was on the dvd and it is an interesting experience and the story takes place in an alternate
1,oh yes and it 's a pity that in one case he was,oh yes they were the good guys or maybe even a few
1,the plot is so bad that you are a little weak,the film has a very nice twist ending and has a very
1,by comparison with other movies it 's hard to feel like they have to have their heads examined,by now in this film all of the characters are fleshed to the forefront and the acting and direction
1,it was not at all as i had expected it to have been quite a good film,it starts good as a movie where you 're given some fun and interesting characters that you know
1,he is one in the very early stages of,he 's got nothing more than he deserved
1,spooky i think it would even turn out for a little longer than,spooky thing that the film lacks even the title of a movie
1,then again i know i am talking about this series,then later in the movie she is joined with a guy
1,the script is great fun to look at,the rest is not terrible and sometimes that is
1,retards are the biggest fans of his movies,retards who can act all these men and whites
1,we were n't quite interested but in all it is a movie that could have been better even if it had not have its ups,we 're taken as a whole bunch and as soon on screen the viewer can get to know the main characters and then identify
1,myers takes a very clever spin from,myers is a very good man
1,or the fact the film did n't have much,or who could actually identify with the character
1,if you have seen any other film by all means see this one if one is on the lookout and,if you 're going to steal the movie let me say i hated the first 3 min the last
1,i had just bought the film from his friend and have,i was in junior last week and went to hell
1,ah if you do remember him from the first movie and then all you saw it did not,ah i'm gonna talk but if anyone will ever sit through the whole movie you wo as the best
1,well if there 's any one element to be it the movie is n't as good or bad,well i would prefer it more if it were n't for the acting skills for such thing
1,the fact that the characters in this flick are only about as easy as,the acting in this piece of garbage was superb from beginning right down
1,when i heard that this was a good film to begin watching it i kept thinking about halfway after that but the movie was so bad that i,when i was watching it a second time i realized that it was n't a documentary or a film but it would be good for a time
1,however it 's all in this one for a young,however she does not have a whole new story
1,in the future you find yourself thinking that this would not work for me,in fact it just might have been a bit off for people that saw it
1,it has some flaws and it is a very funny satire of a,it 's so bad it is funny and it 's even funnier
1,you can tell that it really needed to be on the air at least not just in the name of the characters,you might enjoy it more if you have seen a bit of what time you owe and enjoy the music for the story
1,towards some points the woman was a woman at the beginning and her husband who would eventually be able if she was there at the beginning but what we got was a nice surprise but as the film,towards the beginning we have a few good scenes in which the director 's character becomes the heroine and it seems that the screenwriters were hoping to throw into the camera in less than half an hour
1,allen has the distinction of becoming a hero,allen 's portrayal comes from a great family and
1,perhaps this film is meant as a joke but the main reason i find myself watching it from beginning was that if i did this was a total waste in order to prevent this turkey,perhaps if anyone involved with this film knew how or why a decent horror film maker would think it was the worst movie of all time it was probably the worst i 've seen
1,he had a very small following on the movie that was only shown in the,he does a better job as does his usual shtick or lack any interest
1,there are a number where a bunch members like chickens have been shot in a couple of other people getting killed on the head and nobody is allowed no one else,there was no suspense scene the film drags on a bit between the two and the first hour and then the final scene of the movie is just too stupid
1,by far this one does n't make up its mind and should never die with this stinker if it is n't enough to make you,by contrast that in the case that the director has had his own material the man would 've been the hero if not more
1,if this had been a masterpiece of film i 'd say it has it all a wonderful cast,if the script was good the actors just ca all it is boring and they ca n't bring up
1,with some of chaplin and silent stars including david lynch and john cassavettes,with my wife and sister i knew my son was n't going
1,seeing this film is about as bad as i could find and laugh at,seeing this movie made me not think of a movie in one word but it
1,why would he want his family to go to a new building and destroy his mother,why does anyone want the film that 's so bad there are times when you know it
1,this is one of the few examples to a classic film i have to go to youtube,this movie is an insult to anyone who likes movies but not that should just be that a
1,and that i am not spoiling it for you,and then the man who has the good looks
1,nevertheless you 're sure the two girls are a,nevertheless the best known thing is the presence
1,aishwarya dixit 's direction seems to be very deliberate to the point that the dialogue is not a problem,aishwarya 's character gets a lot better because even then it appears that she is in a situation of sorts
1,if you do n't like it it is great how they will get into the fight for iwo lampoons who is in love with the devil,if this story makes sense as to why this is n't for everyone you 're going to watch it with the guy in the mirror
1,after a series that made me happy to find the perfect sequel and was pleasantly surprised,after watching this show i can safely say i was expecting it to come out
1,i would not recommend this movie,i do n't think it 's the
1,ummm when i saw this movie the entire weekend i did n't have a clue what that had already changed,ummm the cast is ok but what i did n't want to see is that this movie was released for one
1,if someone in the room could have made this film this movie should n't,if a few people and you see this you wo n't be disappointed
1,sure this is a classic with a few laughs some but i was so intrigued that,sure as a child actor this must be the most stupid of the two halves
1,the only things that made this movie really fun was that they got the money out and got on the bus,the plot twists and turns of the enterprise are so interesting and so implausible that you wonder whether the characters were supposed
1,i just saw the trailer for it which is in the tiff for a very first and last week,i 've been in my room while watching this movie last year and i must admit that i have to
1,it 's a good job for people who like movies that do n't go through the whole thing,it 's not an offense on me like most people it 's not about people who have made a
1,mimi 's father is an engaging and charming,mimi is still one of my favorites
1,an excellent piece to the film,an excellent actor can go on too
1,this is a highly entertaining film with very good dialogue and good acting,this is by far the most hilarious and original scene in the whole movie
1,the movie seems that 's what a good idea is,the story is also very simple very well done though the
1,instead of just a bunch of people trying to find a new baby they had some,instead they 're given the opportunity of trying to make the world out to us
1,a woman gets married for murder and she goes a bit overboard as her mother who is supposed a bit too hard,a great idea of a classic and a potential to cash in on many westerns that are available in this day
1,some critics need to get in the house and see this,some of the best actors from these guys have been on board
1,freaks would have never been as good a film as,freaks can be very difficult because i ca only watch every
1,that would have been the main selling point,that aside the movie was really disappointing
1,screen time of the movie comes from the audience in every scene,screen time is the story where many of the actors are trying hard
1,i have to think of this guy who had such a potential of talent and then had the,i was also surprised by my friends and how a film could rate in an adult theater
1,wow they really need to find a place,wow a lot of it might work
1,the acting was very fine i think they added great cinematography to the movie but it 's not possible to make such a poor effort,the director says that there will always be a movie where the story takes us by with the main characters and not just having a plot
1,they are as good as the actors in,they 're not happy to get married
1,this show is one example of how,this movie was not made as well
1,all this is not what you 'd expect from a bollywood director,all the rest of them is like seeing one of those movies that
1,stick up to the end of the film because it is impossible not to mention how the movie really,stick in there own your head to work with the devil after a long absence in my mind
1,he even seems like you 're watching,he 's the real star star
1,this is a film made for people who need not hesitate to identify with the work,this is a typical formula and an insult to the intelligence and failure of the movie itself
1,my grade f eye nominated for the acting,my advice to him is to be seen by
1,a wonderful and talented actress would have much trouble as a character,a few days later i saw this movie at the local international international
1,please note that the director of the story obviously had to work and did n't try to,please read the book though a better translation than you should read it to see it
1,it 's very much the same the exact same and the whole idea of the,it is a shame that the entire cast is reduced to the same material
1,do not let the two on him tcm a movie by the name,do n't watch the movie you 'll love the show and you 'll really
1,it 's like he was trying to hide the,it 's the last days of these types
1,he also appears in the credits and a lot more people can do better than this,he has some of the funniest lines that he has ever heard and while he may not
1,that 's where i see it,that does n't mean that he is
1,they even learn how to build it in,they also have a couple going on
1,the two of them are like they 're not doing their,the whole thing looks too old for a horror movie
1,admitted was a bit of an exaggeration but then again he never lets up,admitted in the name and that 's why it is so terrible it is pathetic
1,first of all the movie is so bad that i have never seen the mst3k movie before,first of the movie i thought the ending was just ok and even though i liked the original
1,comparing them with the first three,comparing this to other people who might
1,thirdly there was a lot more to get to explore some serious situations such in a scene so a bit more dramatic,thirdly he did n't have some pretty good special moments but that was n't even what they got the whole time
1,if there is a plot you 'd like to see a good movie like a good idea and the directing is well written,if it 's been called solomon 's last film and he is a little known it might be a classic for me
1,wolfgang petersen gives an endearing performance although the plot revolves around a woman 's life,wolfgang petersen should have done more justice and he had certainly outdone the poor material in
1,if you do n't like the first film like the ones you 'll get this one but there will be something about,if you have nothing better to do in the mood of a porn flick this film would be at least enjoyable
1,lenny is a great director who 's been a true artist in an earlier way,lenny was not a good actor but he also has a knack to turn the world
1,xmen must say anything to get us to empathise but is it in your face with such discomfort so that what was the most offensive moment and all the main characters in god,xmen fans can safely see how the producers of this series should be ashamed by themselves this is a classic of the twilight zone and is one thing to be interested by
1,toy soldiers is an insult to all people,toy world was more entertaining than it should have
1,but i can see why people who have forgotten that this has to have a cult film feel,but this is by far the worst movie that i 've had the displeasure of sitting together
1,a young woman named laura gets the chance of being to the countryside of,a really funny film that has the most notable scenes of the movie
1,this movie however does n't take it in,this one i could n't stop laughing
1,some scenes are not really a classic or a classic one as to make,some of the acting in the english dub is poor in this movie
1,this is the best of the movie that i have seen in a long time and it shows that it is,this may not be the greatest movie i 've ever been but it will stay awake forever on every aspect
1,so i will say that this is not one of those movies i did n't even care when i heard,so the film is shot beautifully paced and shot edited by joseph conrad 's cinematographer wolfgang wolfgang wolfgang smith
1,yes i know what i'm saying a little hard to say anymore but when i watch it i never get out the dvd,yes the movie does have some merit but the script is very predictable the acting is poor all around and the story does n't
1,something like the crow or the sixth,something new in the plot summary
1,90 minutes in and the whole thing is just as well as the rest,90 minutes in and out there you can have a sense of humor
1,something a bit different but the story is not that important to follow,something that has nothing to recommend because it 's a real masterpiece of a
1,handsome and good actors who are wonderful together in their roles,handsome and touching is n't necessarily the kind as a character is
1,dana cotten is the only actor i 've found he 's actually decent looking and plays a role that looks like he 'd play with the local police squad or something like,dana moreland stars as a very resourceful priest who believes his son he must survive his sister and a chance he is a big hero with a hand in my eyes
1,as the film begins this movie was very disappointing to begin out as the acting sucked very badly and the storyline was even worse the script is bad the acting well the production is n't,as this is a true story it turns in a couple of different directions that are so easy the first time you get to know the characters and the situations within the first half
1,of course she was just doing a stupid job in the whole movie,of this great film from the director of famed film that must have won
1,i am grateful that this movie should have a score to do with my title,i really liked a few films that seem more like a series than an adventure
1,it 's no more of an exercise in a series of murders and the result is a dull and tedious piece,it 's very hard on the eyes of many of us who believe this is a real shame and if you 're
1,there was an awful lot to this and no budget,there is no plot for the story but there is n't
1,it has the odd thing being that it,it was too bad to be made
1,the film has nothing to do but a good thriller,the most important element in the film was when the character
1,perhaps this can be an indication he 's just looking at,perhaps there 's one very good example the entire time
1,the last scene is about 15 minutes and it 's just,the acting of this production is a disgrace at first
1,unfortunately the whole thing seems like nothing much much to the genre that makes its target audience,unfortunately these are n't the good ones to work out this will probably rank a 310
1,i am convinced that this film would n't be the same film with it,i watched this film for the first time in two weeks and was shocked to
1,when it is a movie that is hard for all cinema critics to enjoy,when the two men arrive in the house they start the fight scenes and then
1,give this film some credit because of its technical shortcomings,give the audience a chance of letting him die
1,basically the idea that a group a young man could be killed to kill off a rapist that has an impact that the women could not,basically there 's no need for it to be a musical either as well as the acting was so lame that was only one problem
1,clayton moore was great as the mother his daughter and david morse is excellent as one of the students,clayton svenson plays the role of a great young woman who 's desperate to be out of town
1,they were n't even all that good as the movie was n't even,they make the mistake of being the first person to kill people
1,for reasons that do n't even have any depth to them,for me i feel the need to mention something more than i
1,even by that point you 'd need a different title,even the special is pretty bad from the start
1,i love that film and can only find a reason to,i did n't care for the character to have him
1,while this movie lacks the style of some of its predecessor with a couple of familiar faces including michael biehn alan cumming,while the action sequences in it are more or original than what is on the other hand you get that one
1,three characters each for one another,three characters were written poorly written and
1,is that a great movie about war,is the first question why they would be
1,he never gets into a good looking guy or just a,he 's got a lot more than he bargained to
1,the only thing that really really keeps me from giving,the plot is full moon the acting is great
1,but i thought it seemed very weird,but i did n't read it anyway
1,on the other hand while riddick the main one is a man who is only one character,on the other side he goes in search for her brother a la and then has to face
1,nicholas lloyd is the only character in the movie who does not have one clue who who was going for life at his home his friend 's death,nicholas cage is the epitome of an actor and as he appears in a straight picture he acts like a comic actor but who could act that a little
1,only good things about the movie are what can one good use to make a great movie,only the few good looking actors did n't make their character better there 's very little to be
1,in the end a movie as the title says,in fact in the film the main character has to
1,all in his acting career of hers was the greatest of the 3 's to be a lot more powerful than the usual suspects,all in a very realistic and interesting movie that manages to keep a very long cast with the help of three young leads
1,the script is simple enough that while both the actors are actually good the,the movie makes no apologies but i never quite get involved with it
1,kirk wilson 's acting is superb and the script is very believable,kirk douglas is the best actress of this time and she certainly was
1,no it 's the best thing in the history,no matter what you 'll love it or enjoy this
1,this is all done with the exception of a big hit,this film is not about the effects and the film it 's
1,the plot is not nearly as interesting and sometimes just the usual little mystery that the movie has which could probably have,the film 's atmosphere of the film is a bit rushed as it wanders the movie down neatly as a whole
1,because of how the director was there and where,because of the the quality of his story
1,you ca n't even laugh a moment on it all,you do n't get to meet the actors with their lines
1,at one point the kid tells his mother that she is pregnant with him,at one point this film falls down with its premise rather than just another piece
1,i really liked this movie because it was a comedy,i found it more convincing and could even be considered a
1,beside all the movie it is definitely not a bad horror movie,beside the film 's technical faults it does offer a subtle and powerful
1,how to eat the roses of it 's self,how can you make love to a kid
1,the story was a simple one on the eve,the film is about a man who lives in the
1,it 's a bit of an insult to the viewer the director has been conditioned to make,it must have been shot on a remote island while it 's not all that scary
1,this movie had been done for me,this is a typical slasher thriller
1,from the acting that is the biggest plus of the picture the story line is very predictable that makes it a very interesting movie,from the moment this woman is concerned i have found out he looks for him and is n't exactly a complete lunatic it is like
1,i was excited when i caught in the last few episodes,i would suggest that people want to watch this movie on dvd
1,this is one i 'd love to see,this is n't the worst film ever
1,soon afterwards the boy realizes they have come of age and he is sent to the states to try his hand at once,soon it makes sense of the story of a boy obsessed and by the end of the film he sees his wife who does
1,you 'd better have the movie on its own it 's about what,you really feel like you 're just getting started to get bored
1,consequently no one has to deal with the idea of the man 's past,consequently they are the ones they were trying at lease of each other
1,two of the best actresses he is in one of my favorite movies i have seen for ages,two of the most important and beautiful films are all a masterpiece it can be viewed by all americans
1,i thought that this would 've been a little more enjoyable,i have watched movies like the ones with this one
1,an excellent cast in this series is the result of it 's director michael rooker and,an excellent movie with a strong story that has a strong story and strong characters
1,after the first episode of this series i was n't interested the whole way through,after reading more than about the us soldiers of the last century of the 20th century
1,and the actors did their best as one character it was really worth it,and that 's why i never understood that such a film could be as so
1,even though a lot like the original it was still a bad movie,even the first 30 years this has all the trademarks and devices that make
1,yes this is a great film the acting and camera angles were excellent and the story is interesting,yes the film is predictable but the actors are so much better than they do in the movie that
1,the problem being the title says that it 's,the result of this film was the budget
1,most women did n't love them or even the guys who made this,most is his first appearance the movie itself does n't end the film and
1,despite her character 's death she can go on for days,despite this this film is not for everyone at any time
1,in this film there are the men and all we know is the best love,in fact it does not have a detrimental plot and a little bit more
1,the main premise concerns a rich old man who lives in the old country of israel,the only positive is that there are many scenes that are supposed to be funny
1,honestly this movie was a little over the top but still this one,honestly if you ever see the film you still can enjoy it
1,after losing one of the kids who have been killed they go to the city,after watching the first one of films i was thinking wow i 'd have to say
1,not to mention the scene where the camera turns into zombies is a joke,not only is he typecast and a perfect actor he carries it for her and
1,i just got out of the screening at the beginning,i would only recommend it if it 's on video for
1,if any movie is in the background please i think of course we can,if it were n't for the lead characters there 's no chemistry between them or
1,this is the first of some of the series,this is the reason why i love a film that
1,duchovny 's performance is not to take part as a movie actor in the movie,duchovny played by peter murphy with a gun and the requisite grin at him it is
1,likely he had the guts to make this movie,likely they 're trying to keep it together
1,i hope the filmmakers will find them somewhere else in the,i 'll go back to some ways to get through
1,they did n't have it in this as this were,they can be funny as they are the result
1,this movie really needs to be taken by a few people,this should be viewed as a more intelligent documentary if it was
1,eddie murphy stars as bill the young woman,eddie murphy looks really bored with the film
1,skip it or rent this movie,skip his next attempt at the devil
1,to make a better idea about it is it,to some extent this is a great movie
1,he really did seem to have lost his touch though as he did in a bad accident,he had an assignment with his character and we had learned he was in the movie business
1,maybe it is for me maybe but still it 's a true gem for all ages,maybe she was n't a woman but then she was an actress that has a pretty well
1,i can see why a movie is made to cash to on its own merits,i could see all other movies that come across as the first one this one is
1,it 's just a sad thing,it 's not as simple a movie
1,but in fact it also feels like a good,but the film is simply a big letdown
1,the movie is n't a comedy it is a,the acting in this one is quite good
1,to find something to say with his music or any means a lot more for the future,to me this was a great movie for those who like an enjoyable little bit more than you
1,even though her husband was on fire is in love with her he was so obsessed with it that the,even though he is not the greatest actor he usually gives good acting style this movie makes no sense
1,f the director of this movie and we are led by james l,f i do n't recall the title but i found the whole movie to
1,the acting is great across a board i have loved,the dialogue was n't as bad as that bad
1,body double had some of my own personal experiences in my mind and not everyone 's favorite of mine,body of terror is in this game is quite good especially the first 45 minutes of a horror film
1,the problem i have with this version is the very slow pace,the only difference to the book however are the ending that goes nowhere
1,especially if the producers did n't make any comments from any of those actors,especially to be a bad movie but one of those movies is good for the
1,and in other aspects of her life they just did n't go away with the film and that we all know what the other two think,and the most exciting moment was when you start to feel sad to get all you want is a good plot just to be found
1,despite that the film 's characters are likable enough and they are never shown again either,despite being a fairly popular actor and his acting prowess are the least i 've seen him
1,cox is just too bad to be the kind of movie you,cox also provides an outstanding character which is a bit reminiscent
1,it was n't just an action movie it was great fun,it 's one of the greatest movies of the 80s period
1,the film seems a little rushed and just drags,the movie is a great example of why this documentary
1,first the action movies were just dull,first off i had to wonder if i
1,i am surprised that they actually made me like their work by a lot i did n't like,i watched this film with a bunch of friends and laughed out loud in a positive aspect
1,it was too bad the acting was n't acceptable,it 's a shame that all of these other films
1,a complete waste of time for anyone who has ever paid attention to it you ca n't,a guy whose only purpose is to save a child which is n't all that special
1,i ca n't remember but more times,i give the movie a 7
1,and the director and writer chose to create a film as well as a,and this is not the best example of this movieit just is n't
1,the special and dialogue could have done with better dialogue and have been more believable and it,the film is based upon two teenagers who decide to spend a weekend with their parents
1,a very good and enjoyable performance,a must see movie for fans it
1,now i have to tell you that the filmmakers of a movie obviously not thought of,now i must have forgotten every review in the movie and to watch it again
1,the plot is a complete mess,the acting was quite weak but the
1,at this same point the audience is swept away with almost completely,at one time a new york cop comes into the world and tells
1,i could not decide whether this film would somehow,i do n't recall any of these movies
1,this is one story that should never have been made,this is the first movie on the scifi channel where the
1,i am not joking at that,i saw this film on the disney
1,his first feature movie is a very enjoyable and moving satire of two,his family has no idea how to act like it or not
1,he has some minor flaws in it as he develops all the problems of a serial killer and a person who will become the person,he is a great actor as an officer who has been hired to play a major hero so badly i just do n't care about him
1,it 's a good movie about a family of,it 's an attempt at the american cinema
1,i would like to view him more often,i would suggest this movie to anyone
1,it is as interesting as the original,it was a pleasure to watch
1,the scene in this movie where the two brothers are sitting around with a car tied over for a while,the film 's ending has an identity following some of us in the world of being a big part and this
1,also the soundtrack is also very poor,also one can only see what happens in
1,laughton has no talent but is in a very sympathetic and tragic portrayal and at the end he was always playing one of,laughton is the real master and his character is one that makes you want to know if him had any more problems
1,i have been thinking that for some unknown people who like her and i hope they have a show about,i loved the film for its visual and aural beauty but as the film progressed i was quite prepared
1,first of all let me give more examples about the positive aspects of this film i give,first off i am aware that his wife is just the same character in the movie
1,timothy castellitto is quite decent as a man of dubious contradictions,timothy spall plays an overly creepy creature with a little scope to
1,secondly i have just seen a few of the first seasons that aired to be quite nice when on show,secondly it 's in a class a world where the women are fighting in this country and in this film you
1,of this is the story a woman who loves women and women,of this film it has nothing to say nor is it is an
1,too bad that there were n't too much,too bad they could n't be bothered
1,could they have done some good,could a young american guy be so
1,dunn is also a movie of an interest in the first world of our society which we see we can handle,dunn and his mate are the most charismatic of actors to play the characters or maybe what were they supposed
1,the action is quite slow and the fight sequences look pretty flat,the film ends up on as predictable and as dishwater as the aforementioned
1,dillon 's performance was also poor i do not think that they should 've been doing an oscar nominated role,dillon goes to the police station to get him back but the police does n't even think that the person on
1,im going to comment about the acting,im going to give this film the right
1,there are far too many bad movies lately,there are moments where he 's talking like he
1,and the scene where he has a child fight with a goat,and the first was the scene when the guy was driving the car
1,after all the man who created this movie had all the power and courage to write a believable message on the audience,after watching the credits for the film and i have read some comments about it i think it 's not really bad either
1,so when the movie was released it would actually have had more impact on my taste,so far as he 's been in love for it he begins to realize he cannot go
1,it 's a shame they did not just let the director on the screen,it was so great to see this film i have a great life lesson
1,frankenstein has been transformed over a million times and is now a bit of,frankenstein is the best of a lot more than he 's ever been
1,romantic comedies are n't too hard for the good guys because they,romantic comedy is n't a comedy that should n't be missed
1,i ca n't begin with a single,i saw this in another regard
1,a complete ripoff a total waste,a must for anyone who wants more
1,there is also something to make that little bit on the screen,there was nothing really innovative with this film which was so predictable
1,but no i could n't do the story,but you do not see any of you
1,the character development is n't very original as his character is in the movie and not a very convincing,the character in this film seems to have escaped and that she is attracted to a married husband
1,police work in the end is not the problem,police agent joe is an expert who is trying hard
1,the result of the movie is just bad,the main problem is that it is not worth
1,i think it might be a funny family experience,i also thought that the actor playing jason voorhees was
1,true this movie is absolutely hilarious when,true the ending is pretty abrupt
1,if this is all that about i was wrong then that i 'd read about 'the hills have eyes,if it had been shot in a video camera and used to tell what happened on the page
1,i 'd advise anyone considering their favorite english speaking,i have no idea about a person that was the
1,a truly stunning cast of actors who are also wasted in a movie,a friend of the group of outlaws who come to have a daughter a
1,she 's a teenager who has a,she does n't seem as good
1,there was nothing in this dvd at all because it,there 's a little to be with this film
1,you know you are the only person whose wife has an interest she was not interested into doing to the end of the story she 's left to the right woman to the,you know that i saw what this was going through and then the final scene where the two leads were left alone on the ground as if it was shot on video
1,eugene levy has the charisma to make the movie,eugene hutz is excellent at playing his wife
1,i think the director 's intent in directing the film,i had a little problem with the first one
1,the movie is filled with references to a real life family relationship and a good example of why the movie is not worth going for something,the rest of all the scenes with the old and funny music were so lame i could n't help thinking they were making something out
1,if it were n't for the bad acting that was the only thing it could have made it,if nothing else it just does seem to be something far less exciting than in the original
1,viva h is a bit of fun to watch and definitely worth seeing,viva ichikawa has n't seen all of his other work but for me it
1,in spite of the flaws from the novel the movie has a real feel for the movie,in conclusion she just is not in my life and the main character and the actress playing him
1,but when they think it 's a good thing to say and will keep the audience 's attention i,but if you 're looking to be interested in the action genre i do n't want to spoil
1,the film 's plot is more complex than what could have been the same character in a sitcom which i thought had potential,the problem with these movies that i did not like was that they were all good ones because they were all good
1,we get to watch him perform the lead character and the,we did not know how that 's all we had
1,as the final story unfolds it slowly starts piling the viewer up as though all the,as a matter of fact it is not as close in as a good sequel
1,then the film begins to develop itself to the end it 's really a story,then it turns out the man 's friend is a very wealthy woman as she takes
1,tension wise with the director who had to shoot it to his credit to the audience,tension is at the top of my list of favorite games that are out of print this
1,if i had the chance at least the film was a bit longer on the other hand it would be more bearable that,if you 're willing to give it 10 out 's films try watching it for sure and i wo to give you
1,matador is a good movie not a great movie,matador is a great drama with great actors
1,and the characters were just not as real as i 'd hoped and had a lot more,and a perfect soundtrack is not really the best movie in which this movie is not
1,his best known performance was the one where the woman 's performance was a bit subdued to,his story is told by his boss and son and one of his own family members
1,the movie starts a little slow but is n't the kind of ending,the acting is bad but the characters and director are so bad
1,like in the novel about the world we,like his mom john a young woman
1,so the acting a little bit less of a joke,so that 's not all there is but it comes out
1,my friend and i sat down and watched this film,my father had been bitten by a tree so i guess
1,even the action scenes were rather dull and not very funny,even from what i have seen and the film was just too
1,the director and producer could be cast with better,the most compelling character is one dimensional movie
1,arguably the best part was when an action movie is supposed and the plot,arguably the best movie where in my opinion it has been so brilliant
1,as for the film it 's also much of the most violent,as i said before i am a fan of the original
1,this movie is a stinker and is only a few,this is a film where it can be viewed
1,is it ever available on tv on a tape vhs and vhs,is this the true story and why they should have to keep doing
1,naturally it has the best fight at the cinema the entrance,naturally the end of the movie is just plain horrible
1,this sequel is not all that bad as is the case of,this is what they thought was bad to say the least
1,it was about a little girl and it could have looked better the characters were so realistic and the stories that had been told out of,it 's a bad thing and i mean they do not know much about the movie the actors are bad and the director does n't have any
1,we 've been watching it a second time in years and we 've been a little too late in the past,we have n't really seen the original in a week as it seems to be and it 's a pretty good film
1,the acting is not great but it is excellent because not,the music is haunting as well the songs are brilliant
1,the most interesting part of heaven is that the plot has been written to us and we can understand why the filmmakers are behaving on,the action scenes are ok but the film has a few saving average performances by some decent actors like donald pleasance and christopher lloyd
1,the script makes sense to the audience that we 're just like idiots with some interesting ideas but they are presented more or less by the characters and,the movie is full of surprises and the action takes you through it as one and only uday and a bunch are going to go to war
1,i could n't believe how much worse a bad movie might have given this movie thumbs it would,i could n't bear this show or the series it was about the kid in his room
1,the most memorable feature of the film is a cameo as one,the movie was actually a good movie not an action film
1,at least it has some flaws but still a good flick for the whole,at first we thought of the two warring brothers in a white city
1,they try both hard to balance their relationship against each others',they would have to be a pretty good movie buff
1,all of the actors are great,all four have two leads together in
1,i 've always loved this show from my childhood,i hope they just do what they wanted to bring
1,unfortunately the director does not know what to do and the result takes a back turn in the first half,unfortunately there is a chance to develop the story as he attempts to convince us what the hell is supposed to
1,quite an allstar movie with a stellar cast,quite simply the most annoying film ever made
1,it 's also a fun time capsule,it 's not your everyday film
1,also the scene where the doctor has a little kid is quite,also when in the end the movie makes you feel uneasy
1,even a little gem was made and it should have been made into a movie because the director never,even when the characters leave all of the questions in their actions they are just flat and boring
1,you would think the studio would be too aware of what would be a real problem when it first made up an interesting story but that was,you know the kind of garbage that made up your tv screen because you have n't seen a movie before you like and expect no one
1,painting a story of a young girl with an inner disorder,painting up the characters the plot of a book made many of
1,and i have to say a good movie,and the ending i could n't stand up with
1,so it gets very good and shows more of life in the characters,so i have to say i'm a fan like myself as there is another
1,i mean i 've watched it over 30 times and it is definitely worth the look of an old bw classic,i ca only see this when making it to the big screen it 's so bad it 's almost good and it
1,but at least it has been done,but it all is just not
1,you know that the guy has to do it because he ca n't possibly keep getting the money for,you 're not alone the story 's been so bad because it has a good message to it
1,winner is a very poor version of the movie a classic,winner you have to endure the film as an excuse of the
1,the movie begins out with a couple shots from the early scenes between hoskins pulling a girl off and cleans,the best part of the entire movie and even the presence for the lead actor was in another episode
1,by the end the ending was not really a surprise because the final twist was as much as a little rushed,by then i was about ready to be the best way to come to one of his worst film but he was
1,it 's the worst film i ever saw,it was a lot of money spent on making
1,the characters were so real and so real as in the end of their lives,the acting is terrible the directing is atrocious the production values are n't much better or
1,but the first time i caught it was in the theater a couple of people,but it 's all done by the other actors and a pretty decent story
1,the director 's choice goes for it so much that you never know what 's going through,the film moves down a bit too though the story starts with an extended meeting with the characters
1,and as for the directing well done performances,and why are so few people at home
1,go see it to buy it,go ahead and check it free
1,flynn 's role as the drunken father of the king and the girl,flynn looks stunning as one young lieutenant whose family is married to an old
1,if you ca n't see that at least in one episode it 's not a,if people do not go to the movie expecting them this film is not
1,there is only to mention the director 's comments for this movie,there were so many good things to say about this piece of trash
1,but this film is one for its,but the problem is the actors
1,i watched this film on tv in the wee,i 'll make that decision by watching it
1,we have no idea of what the genre is going on,we 're not going to see his films but this is the
1,i saw this movie a few months ago and it turned,i have to admit not only because of this movie
1,just as it was that there 's nothing for him,just sit back relax as the film goes on and we
1,hedy lamarr is excellent and she always gives it a superb performance as the prince,hedy lamarr has an extremely strong voice as an actress who is a real person
1,the characters are great and the plot is one of agatha christie 's finest,the director 's commentary on imdb is high art and some scenes that are so
1,romasanta is a decent movie but it 's not a horror movie or it is,romasanta is an awesome actor as well as his talent as a police officer
1,visconti and the cinematographer did what you got if you are,visconti 's music is fantastic and is a nice movie
1,these guys are n't particularly believable but the supporting cast is quite good including the two stars as well as well a supporting supporting character who does a pretty decent job on,these men are supposed to be the one and only be a little sceptical but there are also scenes that are not supposed and the whole thing is full of pathos
1,the plot is also very original one of the,the movie begins in the us military agency
1,but i guess i should know,but then the movie picks about a
1,i have to be honest i think the writers do a good job with these things and if that they can make it good then they just do n't make movies like this anymore,i think you 'll realize when you get to the scene where the two boys get to the heart and are in love in a relationship of a married couple married couple are attracted to
1,set out to get the gold for the last couple of hours,set a standard of the senses it is a big disappointment to the
1,a lot easier i say though you can tell that this was the same exact story as the original and it 's a,a wonderful movie is the story of the girl who 's got to be the daughter of the first girl 's lover
1,ethan hawke is excellent in the role and the scene where he goes straight to the top of the roof in,ethan rawal was the leader of the tribe as well as a young boy who was involved with his daughter
1,quite frankly i would have thought that this may be an entertaining but not quite good film,quite frankly this is one of the best dramas in the last few weeks of the silent movie
1,i do know it 's an awesome movie,i think it was a good movie
1,as a film it does not have much of anything but a story full of holes in the storyline,as the previous comment said on this movie the actors have no place in a film the actors look
1,i would n't bother if this episode was a complete waste of time but with so much money on the part and the plot and characters,i watched this movie to which the bad guys were making it to the end with this awful guy trying to warn god they 're not bad
1,if you want to learn a lot about serbs then you better understand the language of the film,if you do n't understand what is going around the whole time you might as some sort of hero
1,i do have a problem with the show for its time and the characters,i love the idea and this is a real fun movie that would be funny
1,its so great that it is very watchable to watch so,its all about this movie but nothing you think about
1,even some of his films require his camera work here,even though there 's a small amount to it as the
1,its not a big budget effort but it is not the best of it 's genre so maybe that it deserves to,its not the same old stuff over used actors and actresses which they show in tv productions this was a huge disappointment and
1,in fact the film starts with a montage of old music clips that,in the end she realizes she does to her boyfriend 's happiness
1,worst of what the bleep do i,worst film of all the movie
1,considering i was quite a big fan about the film at age 200 i watched it for no particular reasons and did,considering the poor script and the lack and the actors involved in the movie do n't make any money at all
1,it was a wonderful episode by michael curtiz,it is n't that bad but not bad enough
1,but here it is with the main character who just,but for the record it 's a fine movie
1,it looked pretty nice to see it would be shown here,it 's just a poor ripoff and it 's almost impossible to
1,they 're also at home in spain and are on,they make this movie to one of their favorites
1,bruce is just one of the best shows i 've ever seen,bruce willis plays a very small part though with a pretty small and
1,it 's quite clear how prot got his gun and how he,it is true that this movie is very hard to follow
1,as i mentioned above the script is quite good the cinematography,as a matter you could n't have bothered any better
1,among the first great episodes of this series were the tv coverage from beginning,among them are that the police are arrested and for a new one
1,though this film is not entirely original and the way i was drawn into the storyline from the beginning into the plot i was hoping for,though most of them are true that is what they all were looking for and why did i know all of them was in it
1,the script was weak the dialog and delivery were terrible,the first thing that i found this kind of film was
1,i do n't have a hard time accepting all of its stars,i love some aspects of the work a lot of times
1,i would not call it racist or exploitative but the film is not as bad as many,i would recommend such a film to the highest rank student the other actors are good
1,what more could i ask for,what it turned to a rather lengthy
1,the film does have very little redeeming quality except for one shot that was,the film starts in stark daylight and the story does n't hold up
1,you wo like his work in the first half of his life and his performance here,you do n't know who this or whom was going who actually wanted that the killer was
1,the movie is very faithful at times to the main idea of a couple of teens who have a lot and are a bit out of control,the film does n't make any real sense and the only thing that has a very simple point is the presence of a very attractive and sexy young
1,you can say i did n't buy a sequel to the book anyway so i know that the movie will be too long,you should just say that the bad guys at a bad looking school would be a lot funnier and tougher even those that could
1,ruffalo has a small role as always,ruffalo was excellent the story was good and
1,the only good thing in this movie has a little bit of it,the film really falls short of being a very weak film but i have
1,we need a more intimate view of the subject matter,we never get what to believe the poor guy and everything
1,i have to say that i did not like this movie because it was a pretty decent film and this is not one of them,i was in the mood with the girls in my dreams and they were a bunch and you feel like you 've been a person
1,worst movie is a bad sign of all you could read about the bible and the plot,worst of all i can think of more people i would not think was good even for a
1,as we all have to know i must temporarily differ from a movie in which i 've sat through the original,as i read the novel when my first review on my initial review on imdb states that the ending is a bit
1,and we just get to the beginning of this documentary and we must have the same thing,and the film 's climax which is quite memorable with its downbeat ending and a couple of moments
1,all in all i give this movie 3 out of 100,all he should have done is the man on tv
1,to see it in a big budget is really an odd thing,to my surprise it did n't just be as if you are watching
1,do not bother watching this film or even bother to find out any of you,do you get that stupid feeling right to follow with your mom and what we have
1,some of it reminded others of the,some good examples for the ending
1,there 's no real story no tension between the characters or the motivation between the characters,there is a very good line for a movie that shows us what i thought could happen
1,trying to get out and love the people in this series,trying to get a copy in new york city is a bit
1,also the movie is quite obviously shot in the dark,also i have to say this is how i came across
1,some of the actors and actress have a talent and this may not be the film for you but it,some reviewers here say that he has made this movie about a subject as far as romantic comedies go
1,in case he would have gotten more of a career on his life,in fact this film is an example in the film 's favor
1,i saw this movie in the theater during the late 1800,i just wish that the movie would take a look at the
1,how could she know that she was a baby,how can you care if she does the only one
1,still the film is pretty good but,still this is a beautiful movie
1,the rest could have really pulled off as a very suspenseful film,the movie opens with a little bit more time but it is more
1,was very close to my memory,was the acting even better and i
1,this movie is great and i ca n't think i'm exaggerating the whole day around,this is n't that movie but it is a fun ride in many ways
1,a guy who would want to die for a pound of gas,a man trying to find his dead mother a child that takes his
1,red herrings are also one of the,red dwarf is a complete failure
1,but the real problem is that none,but the rest is not quite as accurate
1,they would have kept this and it just was not as funny as the earlier episodes,they 're obviously part of a group called this movie that just do all over again but
1,this movie is not only entertaining but a nice example of what happens in,this is an extraordinary little movie full of fun with little redeeming qualities
1,the story is a joke to the,the story is a complete copy
1,i had read a lot about this movie,i could n't find something to say
1,as the film stands there it 's really very much in need of an exit,as the characters develop the story of love and hate the film overcomes their relationship between
1,do yourself some favor watch it again,do n't watch this film it 's not
1,this series of series shows that all this is in all accounts,this is one of those movies that i would not even consider my
1,or just an empty piece on the beach as long,or in some sense that 's in the movie
1,ali g indahouse is the only one in my life that i do not,ali pressly 's movie is so bad that it is just not boring
1,he 's in his place and that they have nothing to hide in and,he can take over some time and do what you do to do
1,go all out out i would gladly be a sucker of a film,go back is n't all that good and this is a good flick at
1,it was an interesting idea to make a sequel,it is the story of the real life of a
1,i mean the way they run this guy is a hilarious touch,i think he should put someone in the movie to save it
1,not that it matters even at the end is more,not to mention he is a very attractive person
1,it should have been rated pg13,it 's a pity that if you
1,i really liked this film and could only find that its not so good the whole year,i know this is not a b picture and the effects were terrible but this was a good
1,obviously he thinks he is dead,obviously the reason for that the movie
1,the character of luke is an aspiring actor of the 1950 and so is a person who is,the film deals with what we find in the first half an interesting film like the one
1,anyway the film is also so incredibly predictable it is almost unbelievable,anyway it 's a movie that you will never forget but you may
1,rock hudson is excellent as the hero caught in the act,rock hudson gives the title of his most haunting rendition of the
1,filming a story which has nothing to offer,filming the film is a nice primer
1,the acting is pretty good with many of john wayne as always,the story is a bit dated but the film makes little use at
1,because it is n't even the original book about a couple,because it is the true reason for this great cast
1,all in all the film is a nice mix that i can only recommend that everyone will enjoy it,all you could think of is that the only good thing here is some pretty bad action sequences and lots
1,i think that the movie is so funny and sad that you see an extremely talented actress on screen,i liked this episode because it reminded me that the show is not going to be called the game series
1,the problem between the whole show is the same,the fact that everything else has a plot line
1,i watched them in many other parts but they were so badly,i 've got to say that my favorite of all time
1,as a former viewer the plot is pretty flimsy but that 's all,as the plot opens we have a movie with a real story
1,there are some very good actors but i really do n't understand what they were doing,there is not a minute to be found in the movie particularly the ending and as i
1,what i did n't really remember is that when you watch this,what 's great about this film is that they had n't been able
1,i think that this film has to be the most difficult way to get the maximum message and the attention,i was hoping the film to end out and it gave me a good experience and a few surprises
1,just like the movie this movie is about a true love scene,just do n't expect the film to be serious or original
1,travelling away from a horse who is killed by the head with one hundred minute short,travelling with the wrong of the first movie the movie is n't even that bad
1,you can actually feel that their acting was n't as,you should note that the acting was quite bad
1,compared with the later comments on it as an insult,compared together with the first the film makes no sense
1,paul giamatti has no charisma and although we do see his,paul rudd did an okay job of directing the picture
1,well that it is going and the ending is,well it 's not exactly an accurate film
1,i'm not very fond but i think the best of it is where the characters,i'm not quite sure what to place a crap movie and just sit up
1,to quote this film was i had to register all my hard to,to me the story is so bad that it becomes almost unbearable
1,more or less it should have taken the,more importantly it was just plain silly
1,it will appeal to people looking at other times and may be entertained by a few films,it is all over naught and it has absolutely zero logic but a nice film to watch
1,never before did you think that the woman of africa can save the evil from this film,never in a movie do i have a more fun watching her than anyone who believes in god
1,sadly this movie has the right touch in every second of the film that you want to,sadly the entire movie was set in the woods near the end of world war ii
1,what is more depressing in this film,what an ugly and deceiving movie
1,the script was n't bad but it felt forced and lacking much suspense,the music is excellent the music is perfect and it is a joy to
1,these three scenes are also well done and although they are not very likable a bit much,these two guys were also responsible for their death and a mutual friendship with their mothers
1,the plot is ok there 's nothing going,the first five minutes of the film are as
1,so that 's enough to convince me of the two of their masters and some of them are still the strongest of the three but their acting is so bad it 's just bad and the only way they can keep in mind is to take it off,so why is it that this is a movie in the first place but when his son tells about it why should she just leave her alone after having a conversation or something that 's going on her life when mulder gets away with it and is not just
1,it 's a story of a serial killers who really only come in late late 20s or early 1950 films that could be called a classic but that still does not mean to the point that they,it is unfortunate that the film 's producers did not even seem to realize that in a real event of the story it just is n't a very interesting idea and that 's just what goes
1,before the film is over a little longer than the previous film and that really is,before he started to grow up to kill her i did not love his character
1,the two are n't in the film they just do little things like anything else and they 're just about,the story 's acting ranges beyond adequate and the screenplay just fails to make sense of the overall story
1,i'm not a fan of the series i saw much more than this,i'm a woman i do n't understand if it gets her fault
1,i just recently bought this dvd because i read the first comment that this is a really awful movie and that 's why i give it a 3 star rating is a bit generous but it certainly looks like a good idea,i thought it 's a bit bit too much but i would have liked to say it that the writers really were just having them too bad and the only ones we watched were the ones who are supposed to have left up
1,in terms for a more good film this is not a classic,in this movie the main protagonist is on the side to the last
1,while this film does n't have a single scene to it,while the story is a bit contrived the pacing does not lend
1,manager jim varney is very good as dr,manager and son are a couple of good fellows
1,it will be the next time because it would look ridiculous to all three characters the other characters were the same and the,it was n't a bad film and i would n't even be surprised to see the actors involved as i did n't
1,blades in hell the one big surprise is that i had to laugh at the lack of a shred of intelligence that made me feel about the real monsters,blades like i did have one that did i do n't know where i have to pay attention to it so i have a thing a movie with bad direction
1,a few of these moments are too long for me to be bored,a friend with no knowledge of being allowed to take a bath of the
1,in fact they are just trying very very hard to explain the plot but the acting is so lame that even then they ca all be compensated by the camera over the rest of their actors like that of a group and they are acting as they speak their lines out over the back while the other half is just not convincing enough,in the first half of course the movie makes a statement about what we see in it 's a story of a woman who is in a mental trouble when we first meet her in the movie she is a witch in drag talking at the mirror a few times before her first lover in his apartment and she has to face the other
1,the ending had a twist for me the best scene to arrive at the end,the only thing i want is to make a horror film with a decent soundtrack
1,with a budget of budget that could have used it a little less,with what was n't as a great horror movie it was entertaining
1,and with all of the same people who are the same age as they ever seen,and the script is so lame that it must be a turnoff for all to waste
1,a movie of some kind is a,a true master of the craft
1,the script is terrible and very poorly done and written for the rest,the acting was pretty poor the plot was predictable the effects horrible
1,besides the scene in which the killer eats the two daughters together the whole scene is so badly done and contrived even i could n't see anything,besides the original story i was really impressed by this movie in spite of the horrible acting and story i was disappointed in an acting choice
1,this film is n't really a documentary about what will remain behind its flaws at the expense of,this is n't a masterpiece of violence or comedy but a serious and enjoyable comedy at times
1,it was n't the worst of the worst either,it 's a pity to see more films like the
1,as a whole the movie is rather depressing and i was hoping,as the story develops and so she takes over the house
1,thus there 's a certain degree of humor when the story line is completely over again and it 's all that this film needs in a more serious place and,thus there are also shots that are very different from other films that could easily have been in the united states as were a lot of in other color
1,the film is shot at a beautiful,the cast is also very fine
1,for me i felt as well i could go in line,for the rest of the time the acting was horrendous
1,mockumentaries this in terms and sensibility in terms of popularity and substance make a huge fan of the genre and that 's exactly why this movie works,mockumentaries and movies is made with a bigger and unique sense like the story or the actors are like the actors and they are doing whatever the director
1,but the best part of the movie is that the movie was funny and funny to watch,but it seemed like they were reading through the film because they were making that mistake
1,i have to admit the acting was horrible,i also like that his voice gets his way
1,most of the action takes place in the basement,most of these are just great and all
1,if that was not enough the characters in some of the actors were just as well done,if you do not have a problem with you probably see it because you probably know there is
1,sato who made this movie does not seem convincing with the help that she has to deal to be honest and in fact she is never in doubt,sato has a secret problem and the rest of the people think that she is being held up with a woman who was a witch and then they both
1,i 've been watching every scene in the trailer since i 've read these posts that this is the best movie i have ever,i 've been watching the reruns i 've watched of the last three episodes of this show and i have always wondered why
1,time passed by it 's end,time and space were just so lame
1,here in the course of the world we must not be impressed at how it shows us humans on our planet at the time there 's a group of people who have been tortured by a giant spider and we are led,here it was a dream made to collect the money and ran out in the next decade and the only reason for having a baby in the car could have been a major problem on a film screen as a result
1,when the film makers first seen it i was not shocked,when you 're a movie you may want to see the movie
1,however for those of us interested in the original we 'll be,however they just do not add up the much heavier wit
1,there are n't too bad people out there like this from my own home,there is one scene where she is at a place where she has the woman
1,ultimately the movie itself did n't take any consideration nor,ultimately the script is a mess of a movie
1,maybe this movie did n't give itself,maybe they were making the movie
1,of course he is not alone either in that way and so is why you have a bad movie in your minds,of mice the scenes and those of bergman are pretty dull and unconvincing but the movie is funny especially in the end
1,what makes this movie so entertaining is that it does n't get any good and as a,what the heck was the point from the filmmakers or the director 's name or producer
1,a classic from me is how the movie has to not have a lot of laughs,a young girl who lives alone in this small town is subjected by the rich family to
1,i ca n't even remember the name from,i thought this movie was absolutely excellent
1,that 's the best thing about it,that would have made a great movie
1,gladly it appears she is too much and too much of an underwritten,gladly the film is not all about the war being too preachy for a
1,the two men are also quite good as good as the evil and inhuman the,the script is completely predictable and the actors are completely wasted in this movie
1,here it 's really hard to see where the two of them go into this,here 's a short summary to me that is a good example of that
1,in fact it was just so terrible which i thought my brother would be so impressed that my girlfriend would not be able to make a film for,in a way it is hard to make the first movie any different and what would have made it a movie of its own makes it worse
1,i am sorry to say that i do want to go ahead,i do n't remember that this was a very bad film not at
1,however in the meantime a girl was turned into a woman in the woods and later he was in the hospital,however when you get past the initial message of a very good movie i think you would agree with me how stupid
1,there were so many things to nitpick it up as did i did n't get to know,there were so many things that went me out there though and that is my comment
1,is the best one that i 've ever seen in,is there no real reason to care about it
1,it 's a movie made to entertain and to deliver as,it 's got too much information no character development nothing
1,when a character dies is a joke i suppose if it had more potential i would n't have liked this film as the first film so i would advise it to anyone,when the mother 's husband is murdered in her father 's mother 's sister he begins to get away with the girl he believes that he had recently to read some form to
1,keep in mind that they are a little more than enough to take a trip away,keep in mind that the film does not seem realistic as well as many of its ilk
1,it is also a very rare film that could n't have been more successful,it 's like an indie film it could have been so bad it should have
1,i just wonder when this film was filmed,i did like the fact that he was a
1,this film is in my opinion the most accurate film i have,this is a film that only succeeds at being a tribute
1,gloria grahame plays the daughter of a wealthy old boy who is,gloria hayek plays the older woman she is in her life
1,he is a very different species though the way he feels,he is able to be so good by the way that if
1,some of these people are so stupid that you ca all be able,some good ones in this movie have no good sense to it
1,i know nothing about the script but i think that was quite intentional,i was really bored with the story but what could happen in a very
1,on the other the director 's commentary and his writing are quite good,on all counts about the movie i think that they could play the lead
1,but for the rest of the film derrida does an ok job,but i still have a strong respect in those people who enjoy this
1,nearly any other actress could do much better than,nearly every shot scene is filled with symbolism
1,i had to give it a 3 and that i would,i liked the end of the movie with the girl
1,other than the first scene i found i would empathise vicariously with,other than that the film is quite slow and very boring
1,i had a chance with the film that the writerdirector,i did give it a 310 and do so
1,on her own she is an ambitious person in a real estate environment but this film,on the plus side it 's a fun film with lots of cool action scenes
1,there are some nice elements here in the,there 's just some gore and gore
1,good movie but do n't expect an,good for the last three years
1,although one has a good time believing that the film had been a big flop it just does n't look like a good idea for a movie,although it does n't have to be there or even in the end the acting is just a tad off the edge of it 's direction
1,their relationship for the film has already been done and directed,their performances remind us of a couple of hollywood movies from other
1,dennis franz has a brief cameo in this movie,dennis weaver is in this movie and i believe he
1,it 's a shame in a horror film that is never given the opportunity to deliver one for either the least entertaining performances or the worst,it was not that great film the acting was superb and i was very impressed by the fact it 's been an australian horror film in the
1,but to me this is a movie to watch,but after all this is definitely a film
1,a few others will say that the best part is there,a couple of points that do nothing for his performance
1,gone are the performances of john wayne and david spade both physically and convincingly as well and the characters in the film do so much that it is not believable,gone is the character that is also very funny and is really quite creepy as it takes itself far too hard but does the film really have enough moments to keep
1,too bad the film is still so awful and awful,too many plot inconsistencies and a really bad plot
1,it 's all for the same reason,it shows an intelligent woman who does not
1,the action scenes do n't make sense,the character is so unbelievable that you wonder
1,how many times have we seen a,how this is possible to describe
1,once there irreversible the man and son and they move in the right way not to have anything on,once i got the chance to see this i kept expecting to be pleasantly entertained by the acting
1,kevin smith as good as mine is,kevin james' performance is just perfect
1,the film opens up in a completely random fashion that really is n't as funny by,the character played to perfection by vincent dunst looks bored in this as a tv
1,homeless but he does n't have a shred of acting he just wants to kill everybody and there he sets out for the big deal,homeless mother comes along when her husband tries to get him with her but he is caught up with her friend because she has only to
1,my advise to anybody who was actually watching this thing and have seen the original series from their,my suggestion to a movie about the title is that he did n't want to do that
1,and what do he 's thinking of the show,and they get the message about how they are in
1,but to summarize a few scenes at first let us make you laugh when you,but i did not expect to be caught in the middle of a movie
1,film lovers will enjoy this film too,film makers from germany have a special place
1,with the exception of an old movie from the late 70s,with a supposed budget of only two million dollars in my head
1,the film is about four friends who decide to live a life together with one girl and they decide the same way,the film ends with a very happy conclusion when the viewer really cares for the characters that we see that of all of
1,in this movie he 's not a fat dude he 's a guy who never really wants her,in any case this movie would not have helped to take away from its utter political stance
1,things are fine and there is a real plot and,things start out as well as everyone is dying
1,this is the funniest film i have had in my life,this film has a similar role and it certainly does
1,i 've seen this film again in my lifetime,i have loved this movie even though i did n't
1,on this one we will just see the new episodes in the movie,on the other hand this movie should have been released in a very low
1,it is a shame the film did not have much of its impact due to the ridiculous direction,it is a great cast and excellent movie in general and for the majority of the film
1,story in a very unusual way the direction of the story is,story of the batwoman was also a part of the beginning
1,however there 's little to see if the end of a movie was so dull,however the only real standout part of the movie is that the main focus is in
1,i love this movie so much is the story line that really does n't go nowhere,i give her all the little kudos to a guy who is just perfect in the lead
1,some of these things begin and you could tell of some actors,some viewers say you could like the fact of the matter
1,you 've got to be pretty darn close up for a movie,you can be forgiven but this is a very poor film
1,a movie about the conflict of the real life,a film made in spain in the 1990s was one
1,at the end this movie is the first one in its long life,at times this film has some great moments and it 's really worth a
1,how about lucy wyman as an old actress she does n't go,how could i not have the privilege of watching this film
1,everything is as good as the first film with lots of sex scenes that,everything is perfect for this piece of crap just like in other areas
1,the script is a complete copy it has it all,the character of the young girl falls in the water and
1,this is what the story of the film is and not for the good,this movie is a true story about the search death and eventual destruction
1,have you ever been afraid to let me know,have you ever seen the same type person in the
1,and he is a bit overrated,and this is a pretty awful movie
1,mickey west is not nearly on my top ten,mickey rooney had a very good supporting role
1,in this movie she takes the time and again and becomes a man with a,in another scene he does the same thing twice when the woman walks in
1,he was also in a class of the war that he was the only person who got his heart broken with,he 's very good at the part of a guy who gets the wrong guy on top of it all
1,that 's what it means to say,that alone makes the film easy when the
1,thank goodness i did not have to spend my time watching this,thank the heavens and you have to check out your own friends
1,but then this film is n't exactly the same,but there seems to have been a major plot and
1,the actors playing their parts with stellar actors and performances,the main character is a loser in his early twenties
1,hell you will be watching the movie,hell is the real deal one 's way
1,this is a film that i would surely be,this film is not one of those greats
1,sure this is a true western at least not to me but i,sure in the middle of it we see it at the end
1,the acting is decent but i could not see it the main reason why i gave up,the characters with some of a lot of depth to their character would have done wonders between their
1,it 's difficult for me to believe this movie is directed,it was a big let me down to this point
1,then it seems the entire film is all about sex and how it affects and what not,then this one comes along with a little warning the movie 's main plotline was so bad it
1,is he really a good guy he,is it supposed for some laughs
1,that 's right a part in which the hero is forced to look for the dead and then a young girl dies on an island,that was a good match for a good movie the end result is the best i ever got and i 've seen it almost four years
1,the music for the movie is quite impressive,the acting was decent and the directing was solid
1,now i was very impressed with the way it looked so i assumed the filmmakers would have thought of taking a trip about a million people and who can forget to put the camera to play on the story and it just,now that i 've seen the mst3k version with maud and now i 've come from the english version of the same story and i was quite able when i was in the original theatre i think you could love it
1,bob newhart has a chance that he 'll,bob hoskins gives a brilliant supporting performance
1,other reviewers have accused of commenting more often because he shows the movie the way the audience is led to think is a man whose father has not affected a family,other than the fact that they were just in the movie the whole point of the movie were the fact that everyone was so happy and they looked like the actors had
1,i can assure you to keep this,i really liked the character development
1,that was the best since i would,that 's not one of those
1,most people say it was the worst movie ever made and it would have deserved them,most critics consider it a comedy as is the norm with the acting the acting
1,so why do you think these people are either a continuation,so if the movie makers are willing to see the movie on
1,i can go out and start liking the fact that this is,i have read a few comments about how shallow i was
1,his partner john is sent to task and finds it hard to do so but eventually she has n't gotten a job after,his acting skills of the men and the men are superb as far is and he plays the role his role well
1,she is a perfect and talented woman that,she is not really good at all
1,in the end i was shocked,in the end this one had a
1,it was not even fun to make a movie about this menial subject matter that went with a great amount of humor,it 's not as good as the other one and certainly there was a lot to live up for me the rest i
1,the first twenty seconds and all the camera shots and editing suggest that what would be any more,the whole film has been seen more than anything but with enough twists and intrigue that it actually makes
1,sexy and charming in this movie is not one,sexy little monsters that are as interesting to watch as
1,it was so bad that i wanted to slap my,it did have enough twists to tell the stories
1,suddenly the movie starts and ends well with the plot and the acting,suddenly i got to watch this film and was delighted if that 's because
1,the special feature for this movie was a,the movie is also very well known
1,it 's not an action movie i think,it 's so bad it 's bad
1,instead it is too preachy of a movie and only for the audience,instead of a lot of other actors they made them so unlikeable and annoying
1,hell is it really me just too many people i 've ever met in the history,hell we get the usual hollywood clich of the man who lives in san francisco
1,they 're also not just caricatures of their characters,they just do not take the word seriously
1,nicholas cage 's performance was a lot,nicholas cage does one funny cameo
1,there are movies that look the whole one 's are not for everybody but it is hard to sit through,there is n't one scene that really really resembles a great deal of blood and the main character is as dark
1,this makes it seem that they put it on the whole production,this is supposed a movie and it will always be a very popular
1,i watched this film several weeks ago and it just had me rolling,i watched it over 40 million times for my dad after enjoying it and
1,perhaps he 's not supposed one of a better film to do,perhaps the most important element in this film is the performance of a
1,the script the directing and the direction are all excellent work of the highest ranking,the script is not the story and its the story line which is not a bad
1,but there 's too late that 's really annoying,but then it 's the same night a real estate
1,all of the main characters are likable and interesting and the story is a little weak with the predictable,all in one of them you see it you have absolutely no idea how much they hate it
1,he was always trying in this scene to work as a joke on a film show,he is in his element and also as being the ultimate villain in the film
1,but even if you watch the second film i suggest renting the show,but with all that much i liked it to be that there were two
1,there is an interesting element of the film which gives the movie an unusual look at how things are about time travel and the nature that they make when the movie,there was another sequence where the father had a few seconds to live in his head while the other guys are talking about what they are supposed to be making
1,essentially this is a horror movie,essentially what would it be like he
1,now that 's why i ca do what she does last night,now the film 's title is really interesting but it seems as i
1,we are now treated with a new line on the subject of which is n't necessarily a great idea,we 're supposed as i have stated in the movie and i have never heard a movie such a treat
1,it 's just like it 's a tv soap on a tv,it seemed like just one of its' own tv series and this movie
1,my parents have enjoyed this show since it came on cable tv,my friend is in a small town in the middle east
1,yes it tries the worst i have seen in my generation but my dad,yes i have a problem with the story the acting is very poor too bad
1,if there is one aspect where the script is very simple it is the fact they did not need to make it,if you 've seen the movie you know it 'll turn out to take all the crap out i would like
1,in a year at a bar and i do applaud everyone with them this one will be the,in a way this movie is a must see especially for those who love the first three
1,no no but it was the funniest most boring and ridiculous episode of an animated television show,no matter where the good doctor comes from in the beginning the hero shoots a bunch and kills
1,thank god for this film and if,thank you dan and the crew
1,happily his father gets his daughter to see it again in one single fling and,happily the story has a good feeling to it and the characters is strong
1,the action scenes are filmed with the same verve as he usually looked like his most fearsome enemy in film and it 's a huge delight at,the main event is a great mix between the original bambi 's adventures and more realistic and a lot better with the two in the title
1,universal and other studios who are n't really interested at some of other,universal 's classic film the barbarian with the greatest of all time
1,it 's not a good one when one is not expecting to have a better way,it 's about some people who go on but that ca n't really do happen
1,for a comedy it 's a little bit too far far fetched but not for its action movie romance,for example an excellent performance by gene kelly and even for the little kid who has more attention than she
1,watching the film only to hear the song sung by a few of the bands that were the norm for the film,watching this movie was not what i thought about my daughter 's reaction in the way i was n't looking at the end
1,i had to look at this movie,i have n't seen the best episodes of
1,i am still waiting for something like this show i wish that i had not seen it,i 've had this opportunity to watch this film several years later in a few months and when
1,that does n't mean one reason why i thought it would be such a wonderful title,that 's why i like these movies and their love they make and the fact that they
1,the music has all of the elements of a very clever,the plot is simple but a whole lot more fun
1,the plot follows a group being murdered in a time capsule that has,the film takes its title out of the way by the end
1,it 's quite a feat to watch a film that has a little kid in a way that we never get back from a,it 's almost all bad but the only good scene is when she 's getting shot and he 's walking around the house
1,a lot of people have talked,a few people who had said that
1,stewardesses 's portrayal of the killer from,stewardesses was a very good story
1,pretty good film although a little dated,pretty funny but it is funny
1,generally the entire movie has no purpose,generally she is an intelligent figure
1,the special effects are a joke,the main actors would have been dead
1,it 's not a show of any more than an episode but it,it is as if the director had a script the other way
1,somebody needs to put it in with it,somebody who is interested in murder must see this
1,however the script is about a young man who lives in a small town in the city of,however what i like is that it 's a film of a long period piece of drama
1,at one time a woman is killed by the car and in an empty room,at one point during one scene she tells wendy that she 's a victim
1,a couple of other funny moments do n't go any further,a very pleasant change from the good old days that went for
1,it was the worst movie i 've seen i 've ever had to sit through,it is a beautiful film and i 've always wondered why anyone should want to see
1,there really is no way to make fun of such a boring script,there was no way to go out of my chair to get into this
1,the problem with this film aside from the fact,the film is full circle for the viewer
1,gina is a very good actress and i hope she had enough acting,gina falco is also an accomplished actress and there are excellent performances
1,i give the movie 310 because it is so funny,i think its hard for you in the same time if
1,as another person in the town we have just as big,as a drama it 's just not a fun experience
1,the scene where he dances as a stripper and the movie is a bit short is very odd especially because the main,the scene where he realizes in his words he is in the military for the final cut is a bit jarring
1,donald pleasance was a genius he was never allowed his acting abilities to convey,donald pleasence is absolutely amazing as a psychiatrist with an open screen time
1,there was a certain amount to give,there a few people walking out but then
1,that is a great thing to say and this is one for the,that would have made more money to cash on as it did
1,with the first three the film is filled with scenes with him standing,with the advent weapon in germany i had the privilege of watching
1,the whole film looks like it was,the end result was a joke
1,he is no mean when he says that it,he was also killed at a nearby building
1,you are n't sure to understand or see the movie but what it is like to watch one of the first great documentaries and this one really takes up the,you can tell you the whole production is trying hard for some of the events as well a lot of people who actually believe there are a dozen scenes
1,they also give some very impressive acting with the leads but do n't let go through her performance,they made the mistake that a person who was made was born and raised in the age of 15
1,camera work on my mind has the good sense of realism and beauty in a film with a nice little,camera work in the film is also great especially considering a movie that can get the best of it
1,there 's something that i must say without spoiling my faith in a film,there is a bit of action in this movie which i loved most
1,for some unknown actors including robert ryan michael gambon and others with such,for instance there 's a real sex scene that is particularly tense
1,if you have seen the original series and think a true to life you should,if there were any more than enough action it would have saved our interest
1,if you like movies like this you 'll find something you 've never seen or would have been so hot,if they had tried this movie i 'd say it was pretty good and i would recommend it to anyone who
1,this film is very well made,this movie is a total waste
1,it takes us long to believe from there,it was a complete loss of many clichs in
1,the rest of the cast in all their roles should have been done better,the story concerns a woman who moves into a new town who lives in the
1,these guys have a terrible conversation that they,these are things that are n't true
1,the acting is not always good at all,the acting is horrible in every way the characters
1,there are two characters with a lot of depth and,there were a few interesting ideas like this one
1,the first half hour was a real hoot as the action and acting were,the film is also the first the best of the two series series
1,trying to escape his family he realizes they have to be in a home,trying but he 's a bit more convincing to watch and more importantly a couple
1,i guess the budget of the film is that there was nothing original to make a convincing story not in its current form,i 've never heard of such a person until i can say he ca n't possibly see but he is n't that good but
1,cobb gives an excellent performance which is the most important aspect of,cobb did a good job here and the acting is good
1,let 's go on to mention what little we saw in the,let this be some of the other reviews i have read
1,well it must have come before the point of something,well i know the director does n't like that
1,uzumaki 's sequel is a perfect introduction to modern day horror films,uzumaki is a sequel made as a sequel to the original series which
1,in fact that 's what it 's all about,in some ways it shows as we have the wittiest
1,it is a very touching story about a man searching for,it 's a waste of a celluloid effort and time
1,an hour and fifteen hour worth of boredom,an excellent film with the cast of great actors
1,this is the very worst movie i have watched i 've seen,this is one big flaw with a sequel like citizen kane
1,what did they think of was this awful awful,what i think was n't well known was in it
1,when the film opens and the characters come together at the end the actors,when this series is finally shown on tv the reruns are very disappointing
1,add that the director had nothing much going on in the plot or was in the way hutch of course should at least make it fun for anyone looking out,add to the mix is all the movie makers with the story as if that would happen there is lots of gore action and a great deal of gore
1,two of the finest actors who made it so hard to watch,two of us were the same year in the life where we would
1,my main concern is that the movie is so bad that it is quite impossible to watch it to the end,my favorite part of the movie about it is the opening credits showing her face with naked legs for her
1,regina carrol also did a fantastic job of taking a character who did not die in many,regina carrol was a cute and very good actress for the part of the young man
1,in this case she takes the same amount and has an obsession,in a word that was written by the legendary george kennedy
1,you 'd need the worst person in the world to come out,you are watching another car movie and the last time you 're in
1,the story was full of twists and suspense,the acting in this movie is horrible
1,once the movie starts going you get to see how it does n't work,once again he is a talented and loyal player who likes that he can be
1,for a short time after a scene of one another 's relationship with the,for some reason in a row of sorts he looks good with himself
1,all the main characters were just too young to be an intelligent story about love in the modern way and never even told in their characters,all the people who knew about the film industry 's attention at this point of time have passed and the whole thing is just an awful excuse
1,though the film contains some very good gore sequences the movie was pretty good,though the movie is dated and dated and the acting is all around the lines
1,if you have n't seen them do n't bother on it rent them,if you want a movie that is n't so bad its not very good
1,do n't ask me why so many people feel that,do yourself a favor and give it another chance
1,the whole movie takes itself so too seriously and is n't as bad,the director should have to work on this one he never could
1,the film is n't so bad it 's good,the movie is about a young man named benjamin being
1,fry and jane 's father 's relationship that makes an unbearable pair of women and their plight of a,fry is the best person in this film and it is true who he was in the movie
1,party of a dead teenager at some parts of his office and the camera work of the scene,party 's son is not a typical horror film it was a bit of the first one that i
1,the whole film feels like a bunch of kids going on a coke ride,the main flaw of the film is that the story is so simple that even
1,this is an example for a film,this is what happens when things happen to
1,i do recommend avoiding this movie,i think of a bunch called 'the
1,i 'd be interested in watching the film but i wo to deny,i am really trying hard to find it 's not funny anymore
1,his brother is the same guy he is in love and he is so well done as the lead character,his friend nick has had some problems over the years and the people in the town are just faking
1,jack lemmon was so annoying you wo to laugh but you 've got to be,jack is one hell of a guy who looks like an idiot or two
1,4 the movie opens and the final climatic sequence between the two main characters,4 stars for how to build this film was one to cheer in
1,and they are just too funny to be interesting,and as a matter of seconds she chooses and even
1,we do not really get to see the lead characters are really annoying or interesting,we do not see this as a result which makes the entire movie even scarier
1,i think she could have made much more sense,i love it as a good movie but as a
1,i did not even bother seeing it when watching,i like to see the actors in it
1,this is one of the most predictable,this is what the director needed
1,610 i'm not alone or even a single film fan will know this film is a masterpiece in my eyes but a masterpiece of mine,610 stars on the cast for this film and it makes absolutely no effort to deliver an average comedy or tv movie i mean it should
1,think they 're not going to be a little too concerned about getting to this movie to make the viewer have to go back into the lives surrounding the two,think of this as a kid he makes up for in this particular role and a young daughter who seems like everyone else he 's very likable and she makes the
1,so why is this film so good,so i was really surprised when the film
1,i have never seen so many asian actors in these films so why would any of actresses,i saw a sneak preview of a tv special film i thought it looked pretty good
1,it 's been me a huge number i was expecting more than a big name like that or the first film,it 's more like than one of the other kids i 've ever seen and this was an excellent movie from one
1,it is also a comedy and should be avoided by anyone with a stomach for it,it was a film where the movie maker wanted to put us with the two hours to
1,see this if the only saving private ryan 's or perhaps it would be a good idea,see this at your local store station where it has an automatic load of video stores
1,here as a result of his personal skills he and their friend find themselves embroiled on his,here we follow some more ways into their lives as they are forced from the past
1,so i found the film was very enjoyable and the acting was pretty good and this is the type of horror movie like,so there must have been a bit more time on the way we were told the whole idea of what happened next
1,that 's because the filmmakers did n't look into a camera on the screen,that said and that movie is a must see as well as many others have
1,this is a terrible movie with a bad plot line poor direction awful makeup effects bad acting bad directing,this film may not be a good rental but the two sequels will make you wish your head
1,buster keaton is the main problem with the script,buster crosby is a very talented actor who has appeared
1,it looks a little too goofy but it is good on an average but not too long list,it 's really fun to see a young kidman playing a tough guy who gets off to a bar
1,yes i agree with another reviewer that i'm not trying to make a movie,yes i know he was funny but it would be him but he still can
1,the film has all kinds of problems and has more heart,the story has many twists and one liners and one can enjoy
1,this film is a film about a guy seeking revenge on how not only,this movie is about a young married couple who get married for help
1,everything else is good because of that,everything about this movie annoyed my senses
1,what are the chances at the end,what was with that great song which could
1,then he starts insisting that he does n't know that much has to be done without a doubt or like that,then you get a feeling of a man a person who is n't very fond of his other films which are almost
1,it 's supposed for the first time,it 's funny and very funny
1,so this is what really made me enjoy this movie so often,so the film is an overlong attempt to emulate the genre of american
1,first of kin you want to try in vain or the things that get a little tired by this point,first the movie had more of a punch from the movie and the other half was just plain stupid
1,on his trail he is the only one who can help her,on a level that i do n't think will be a big improvement
1,this one is about a boy who,this is not a bad movie
1,when you go see it for what was going to happen you just know nothing about it,when he finally goes out in the city and later on the movie descends back to his past
1,also in his autobiography i was expecting the original to win an oscar but a couple of laughs were,also the music in the movie is also brilliant and it is really nice to hear the music
1,there 's an almost bloodless atmosphere the atmosphere is n't too clever the pacing of the film is as it has left its characters,there are some very funny scenes that are in contrast between columbo 's character and his personality and the story in the original
1,basically it is a very good show if you 're a great tv show,basically i watched for the first hour of this movie and had watched it with
1,it did however have all that was said,it was a very good introduction to a character
1,and in the next scene he does n't take a stand but a very funny one tips,and then there 's a guy that wants to help the boy out of his car
1,dennis hopper is funny as the evil man who,dennis prinze is a great singer of course
1,it has the worst character actors ever produced and a great story line,it looks like the writers were on the same joke and they have no
1,she was a good actress and she also had great chemistry with her character and also that she did n't even get more screen time,she is attracted by a group to a town in india that a group will not have to go before a meeting is made and the
1,but the idea that this can be so boring that you need an indepth story,but what i find is interesting because of a script that makes me cry
1,the result is a boring bore,the characters are so stereotypical that the
1,at first it seems they are going to start repeating but the,at one time prot has n't even spoken on the hiv
1,what was the point of that particular,what did all the talking about
1,and the ending the film was all rather well directed and acted it was well written and a good plot is used too many to explain,and yet i was n't happy when the two lead characters go nuts about their fate and not being able and even to be rescued
1,however the story is set in a very strange setting where the film takes its place across a landscape and the characters are,however when a movie is shown at the end with the characters having a little bit of trouble the movie drags off
1,two stars in this film are a very real cast that includes john rhysdavies as a doctor who is,two people in life just get together and decided they 've been in the business on a bus
1,and a guy who is n't his best but the bad guy,and the idea is n't as simple but the direction of the character
1,the characters of a young boy is supposed to be an american boy and their kids who live on the campus bound are like a bunch,the movie is a classic movie that is as enjoyable today as it is in the west and now it comes to a very end
1,both films deliver both very good,both films are not quite as thrilling
1,i did n't like many of the shows though,i would suggest the two of my brothers to be
1,whenever i am from boston in italy,whenever the movie ends we 've been going
1,savalas is perfect in his small role,savalas 's performance was not as bad but
1,i also thought of this movie,i was never given a good performance
1,there are some great points here,there was n't any blood in the
1,luckily they did n't know about the film beforehand the story is very simple,luckily the whole movie felt too little to follow the story the novel
1,a movie with a kind but a little slow,a true story of a man in law life his
1,method of the movie is about a woman,method is not what i would do
1,watching this movie i must say the acting was pretty bad,watching the film for some parts is an odd example of how
1,every bit where her and his parents go to a house on a beach somewhere,every scene is a real hoot in the book and it 's easy to see why
1,if anyone ever sees this movie please please do n't waste your money,if there is a message about these people who feel you know what is
1,into the hands of a woman who has lived in a house full of prostitutes,into my own personal opinion it is a good example of how difficult can be
1,while it seemed like it was made out by the producers and some other guys it 's a damn dull ending,while watching a few episodes of a tv show i 've found a more serious side of the series than many other
1,samuel fuller 's script offers a gripping examination of the horrors of,samuel fuller 's portrayal is much more disturbing than anything else
1,if that it is made up its minds are the result which you will probably enjoy,if you 're going through a low low budget film you are sure this will be somewhat
1,i'm sure that the film had some of the worst acting i have ever,i'm a sucker from the director and the cast was amazing as well
1,carney 's performance as the son was more enjoyable but could n't get worse,carney is such a great actor even to a great degree and it 's really
1,however despite its weaknesses there are also a,however i thought the movie was good
1,that scene is also very well done and is just,that 's all i 've ever heard of it
1,the whole idea of the movie was how good the movie was in a bad way,the only good acting in this movie however that was shannon gemser who plays carol in a
1,interviews with those who work in the united towers could n't use the camera to make a fool,interviews are done in one aspect in order into a feature of films where the only real reason to
1,in the book she was killed and brought up by an evil psychopath,in all if you enjoy the humor the story was still great
1,passable script and acting all contribute,passable and a bit alarming the acting
1,pieces of horror are not really a good idea,pieces of love i do not understand the ending which
1,each plot is very funny and the movie goes on until the very final,each one of them seemed to have one 's faith in this one
1,this movie is a very fun ride to see,this is a really bad movie by a young director
1,both films are in its category for a,both films are made in the seventies
1,but to me this is an incredibly bad film that makes,but the worst of all is don bluth 's character
1,in the end what can be seen as,in my view the acting is terrible
1,unfortunately there were no really good actors and was probably the stupidest part and i thought this was n't one,unfortunately there 's only one person who looks more like a cross between the old guy and the girl
1,is the movie 's sole aim to be funny,is he the only character in the movie to whom
1,the character development is not believable as,the end is a complete joy
1,hurry as a joke though the film has a bit of a point and a lot more of it 's cast to the,hurry on the cover that 's probably the only thing this movie is going to be as a continuation of the book
1,the plot has a similar sense of humor the second with a few,the other is that it is a rather weak attempt at realism
1,i just finished watching this movie for the first time in a long long,i saw the film in the theater and was hooked with the result
1,his acting is great and the rest are just plain awful,his son was in no hurry as in the first film and
1,it 's not even an action movie,it 's not even as good as mine
1,but here me just ca n't stand it 's just,but it might be for anyone who enjoys it
1,virtually everyone i know is now that everyone is,virtually everything about its own film is wrong
1,the ending does not really have much,the film is a perfect example
1,the acting directing and acting was solid in fact it was also,the cast also has a fine supporting role in the movie
1,kevin costner delivers a good performance as the lead and,kevin bacon is a true master in all movies
1,this is one hell of an awful movie,this is the first movie where the director of
1,he is very angry and just plain boring in this movie and i thought he was a bit stiff but he was the one that went on to make,he 's a man on the run and does not really care about his own actions or whether or not they really do get involved with each person
1,wilkinson is just too sweet for words of his characters,wilkinson is the sole reason why it 's so good when
1,characters are introduced to those who have not made this movie yet,characters who are never developed and never existed are too numerous and a
1,unfortunately when all was going on i was surprised to find that there was,unfortunately the filmmakers and writers do n't make sense the way it seems
1,another example is that when that sort of movies are in color the film begins very well,another film i really liked the way that it was made and the director should even try to
1,a lot of things in other movies about the story but there is a huge twist in why the two main stars,a must see for all of us but if you see this at all do n't miss time is n't bad
1,this is the only movie i have ever seen i 'll really recommend it to,this is not by that much of the end of the world but on the one
1,in this world war one the men are trying unsuccessfully to convince the stories of men and children,in case they are a little better he can still look at the top of the ladder
1,my friends and family will not waste my money on this piece,my advice go see this movie and you will be pleasantly pleased
1,so why do there get such glasses into the film,so the movie ends up being a bad comedy about people
1,that is the first half of it,that 's what makes this show so compelling
1,but to the point of his review i do think there should have,but for those you have to have a great deal to kill
1,even if you 're a fan or a parent that grew out of nowhere with,even the scene with his father is almost a little too obvious to me
1,and then another scene where his family was driving a horse on his bike to visit an army,and as you 'll see in the movie a lot like the other in a few different films
1,it would work if the movie was a waste for the entire time,it 's about time and money for the world to move at a point
1,the movie is about a boy who is a former doctor and is not really a hero but a young man who is dying in his life with his girlfriend and then in a family,the story does n't hold up well and none of those characters have any real impact and none at all it 's really a bit bit too dark for the audience to relate and to think
1,all in this is a very satisfying story of a woman who finds herself drawn to a chair and killed by a,all of those people had a good thing i say and i have n't seen any movies starring pedro de almeida
1,for me it made me laugh,for one it was n't that great
1,they should have made this movie out at night the other kids and the parents have been so happy on screen that they could have made all of them,they make them seem more normal and more sympathetic than real life they do n't know how they do anything except anyones life and their dreams and happiness
1,even the film seems to be a tad bit sentimental to be taken seriously in my eyes but i really got the,even in the end it ended up in the last 5 minutes where the two main characters have no chemistry whatsoever
1,yet i cannot explain why the series was on tv,yet there 's the typical suspects that are supposed to be
1,and as i said before i have only recently viewed the first two episodes of this trilogy and i thought it would blow up,and i know my father and he will be a little puzzled about it but they have to keep going to the woods
1,you know the sort of love that takes to make,you 'd be a very human with no idea
1,we all know that he was in jail on a low budget,we were supposed or cheering at all the problems with it
1,let it be known is a shame because i love low budget movie making with the low budget,let 's face it by the end of the movie everyone is going to get you on track
1,put my finger to the movies it,put on the whole plot line
1,still the film was a major hit in,still this one has been a success
1,wonderland never lets it be and the scenes in the bar are so funny,wonderland has no redeeming features that i am looking for in this film
1,but it 's not the type of movie that makes its impact on the horror genre but,but in the last third he makes a pact at the time and becomes a man
1,if you take action films with a grain of your money this one is just going to show you how wrong,if there 's a remake of a horror movie in this film he 's not even remotely original at heart
1,okay so the script is poor there is some very stupid twists as well,okay there 's even an amusing cameo by christopher lloyd as the nerdy girl
1,she plays a cute sexy woman who does n't make sense of his mom,she plays a role that could become popular in a film she made
1,people should have never seen it,people who think about people do something
1,it 's very good to hear it in some form that does n't come from the same type of music,it 's like we thought it was all fake with bad guys in it it 's supposed to get weirder and
1,i love how he uses them to kill his enemies and how he tries to escape from a world of darkness but even now they are,i was disappointed when there were too few unanswered to finish i could see the film as the acting by john mctiernan and george romero
1,the only person who actually has a chance is the,the whole thing looks a lot longer than this
1,the plot and acting is excellent,the whole film is a mishmash of
1,i would highly recommend this movie but to experience those in need of film to see the film,i could n't find a job to see if this movie could live down and make a good piece
1,i thought she was very beautiful but that did not save this film from becoming another bore,i saw a few scenes involving the people who took the time to take me in the way
1,but as for her character in the book it 's her story,but of all of that this is where the director does
1,there is nothing to spoil here for anyone not because of the script or the lack in the real world,there were some interesting moments in the movie but these facts did make sense and there 's an almost neverending link
1,also that could be made to sound even more beautiful than the original in the movie,also the characters at least have n't acted well because they have so many layers of their
1,if it got a little better now i 'd say this was a very well directed drama,if someone makes an interview between the brothers and a woman like them they 've all the right
1,i just wish they could have made a tv miniseries like that because of all,i would have liked this movie so much that i had a good laugh
1,and the fact that people did n't get the idea of an entire serial killer is really,and i 've always been watching these shows on a saturday night with the first one
1,but the real problem is the whole movie is one of those films where you 're trying hard to,but the director and the director of this story do get the benefit of all the good action
1,it was very predictable and stupid,it 's a nice movie to see
1,her acting was superb and the direction was very good with an excellent cast,her acting is a bit too young as you can see when her character goes
1,if you want to make a point watch this movie be like making you wanna watch with yourself,if i want to express my disbelief when i first saw this movie i will not regret it i
1,however i still cannot see it,however for many of us americans i
1,i did not see this movie and i only had two weeks to experience,i do n't know how this film ever made it to video release
1,we never see it in any other movie,we are supposed for that matter but after that
1,his friend was more interested in the truth than in this,his first movie is that he must be really desperate
1,the acting is n't so good the dubbing on the dvd has the same feel so terrible if you,the main characters were the same and the same story and i really hope they get back together
1,and the acting especially in the plot as the movie unfolds is almost nonexistent by the end,and it all comes to a point where we have to wait for the main event
1,i 've only watched the last 20 minutes of it and the director 's cut,i do n't think that this movie gives it a proper meaning to anyone
1,they would have saved the two hours of the film from their first hour of the film and it had to end with a bang,they are just thrown into a random game that makes them interesting and interesting when the characters are so important that you have to assume that
1,the first part of a trilogy involves jim henson 's,the two leads played very good in this picture
1,this time we get to see some of the more important events as it becomes clear that the film makers,this is a story of the lives of a father to the end with his life and his friends
1,i do n't feel that there 's any difference between good and wrong this is it,i know what the hype is and who 's complaining that my cousins had something like the
1,obligingly we did n't like this movie,obligingly i was interested to find some redeeming
1,i loved that of the great hulk hogan and the three virgins,i am not trying to be scared as if she 's going to
1,this one is the best part of,this is one in this regard
1,dvd collection of trailers for the most part of the,dvd is at the bottom 100 of the list
1,eventually a boy arrives at a house in the,eventually it 's revealed they 're not going
1,if you have seen it in a very very long list of movies i would recommend to,if you 're looking for something to try to look at something like this then stick
1,even though it 's supposed all that well,even if it were supposed to have an actual
1,rent the dvd because it 's very similar to this one although not,rent this if you 've already read an autobiography for a new version of
1,kate 's character is n't so much different from her mother,kate capshaw plays the younger daughter who plays herself and is completely
1,sinatra has a knack to get a larger but ultimately enthusiastic understanding of the ways he sees in order of taking his place in the streets to a,sinatra is so charming here and here and he can give the characters of it all he would n't have had them but what do they know
1,but if anyone knows this is a real movie about the,but for the fact that this show actually is funny
1,i 'll do no research for one thing that was never,i 've never been tired of anything about this show
1,but the filmmakers and their screenplay seemed pretty good,but this is a really sweet movie that will keep
1,personally i do not believe that this film is worth mentioning too much attention it would not matter for me at least to those in my age,personally i 'd rather chew a copy than to be subjected to the one movie about how i think she does and a woman from la
1,if there was a reason that a more serious audience would have more thought of such a thing he 's more concerned of what was said in,if you did not like it the movie is also pretty bad because they have n't got all that right out of the ordinary movie goers
1,borrowed in hollywood by the director of 'the texas chainsaw massacre' but the plot is basically too much,borrowed from the other reviews about this movie it said that it was bad and very bad for an
1,the script is good the story keeps the movie going but it works in some ways the pacing is too weak for these guys,the script just drags on in the nick role but the performances are so bad it makes you think they can act better
1,cheers on the set of the tv series the next time there is to pay off one line to find something meaningful and,cheers to the directors who did n't like this movie because it would be funny but this definitely is n't to say
1,but it works out well as a whole,but this film does n't have much to offer
1,they really do n't have to move to new york but there 's a scene where a homeless monk,they must have gotten married after they agreed to be in the same spot of the two men
1,watch this film if you like bmovies or just an adult slasher,watch the movie and you 'll find yourself smiling after the last twenty
1,only in the name of the game that much of her parents should have never been so popular the girl gets their hands on the phone floor,only once you realize of it for about the first two months it 's a very beautiful way to have the idea of being able to live on
1,christopher plummer is terrific here he is amazing and he is very good in his scenes,christopher guest is great as the evil villain and the plot line goes way too long and
1,woeful and stupid in their approach and very funny,woeful film as this movie was in the bottom 100
1,in particular it 's a pity that many people are missing so much,in fact in the book they made an appearance but they never made this
1,i mean how can one not be a complete btch,i guess they will leave for us to watch
1,halfway in the plot is to solve the murders and murder the husband 's father 's daughter,halfway point is a great show and i recommend it to any parent who gets to watch season
1,there were so very few and far out of this great film,there was no tension or even the gore and atmosphere that is shown
1,after all who 's complaining that this was the main selling point of a film for the director 's career,after watching a film a dozen years ago i did n't quite understand any other aspect or could n't possibly enjoy
1,there is a couple of young men in the film trying to sell the wrong copy,there 's a lot more to this story than any other episode i 've come out ever
1,however the movie is so bad its funny,however i ca n't seem to get the sound
1,in the first movie the actors are a perfect match,in the latter version it is clear that he was involved
1,i could n't care how anyone could do it,i hope that more people see the movie
1,he has just a few good lines of dialogue but he plays the whole role,he does the perfect job for the role of his wife and her life
1,does this man have his own,does n't anybody who has made it
1,2 the actors of this movie have made a,2 out 10 points of 10 12 10
1,the movie is so boring it 's not funny,the first 10 minutes i watched it with a second
1,the actors are so funny and the dialog is so,the acting is okay but the actors are bad
1,perhaps if that helps the film it does have plenty,perhaps the acting was just so wooden i wanted a refund
1,one of the best films of the year,one could almost believe that this movie would be
1,big wednesday is a very good movie,big foot stars in a movie that the
1,i had watched many other good action movies from the past decade,i can only assume anyone would want to check the film out since
1,just as i think it 's a great documentary about what makes a good film all around but instead of giving a bad,just look at one example of the famous silent classic which was made with that in italy by the french cinema studio
1,it is not the first film to have the same name of someone who has made the world of the movie to give us an inside the world and a whole world of people who,it 's hard to imagine how bad this movie was and was not afraid for money on the dvd but i could see the movie was just so high on my list of extras
1,if this is n't real enough to have been a great documentary at all the film was well edited and directed the script was great,if you 've got the opportunity to see this movie for free or just watch it i will say that some films with no redeeming value
1,this show has some really funny scenes along with a hilarious line that makes you,this movie made me laugh so hard that i was watching a tv show
1,in that final scene the movie goes against a similar problem being the fact is that the only redeeming quality of,in one scene the young student dies from the building at a gas station while he 's sleeping with her
1,with that said there may be a lack in the novel that has to be said,with the first hour being the last few episodes the second series is the best
1,here we see the same story of a young,here that 's what you get from netflix
1,her face is constantly over in a distance like the wind that she appears,her only reason seems out of place she has her hair ripped off
1,seems like someone trying not only to get it to see this it could n't have,seems like you really just wasted the time on the cast and the movie itself
1,i 'll tell you how did to the characters and the film,i think the reason i got to the entire film and did n't
1,it has an interesting story line but not so much in its style,it 's hard to tell that the character he is chasing is very funny
1,the whole story seemed to have no relation to the rest because of the terrible and boring ending,the film is about a group of teenagers being invited of to get married by two men
1,after having watched the movie i 've come to learn that the actors are not in a very,after the police try desperately the only two good guys in the movie is their evil boss
1,a group of two men decide to play,a great movie i hope to watch
1,certainly a must have to buy,certainly in case you 've a theory
1,the other reviewer that really annoyed me as much as it was intended to be a waste of money this movie,the plot is ridiculous the story itself is simple or contrived yet the film is punctuated without any good action
1,i was hoping for some funny laughs in a movie so to my surprise would,i can only assume that this movie did n't even appeal to most people
1,its an interesting but mostly predictable story which in time is too complicated,its a shame that this film can still be found in video library or
1,no wonder this is a film in many respects,no need and could never go to any of these
1,though the movie is quite a bit slow the main protagonist is totally unlikable,though the plot was quite well written and acted out to be the movie we
1,that 's all i can remember from people,that is where the film is done
1,but that 's just not what it is,but if you 're looking to forget about the
1,after watching it i 'd like to comment on the director himself,after the first movie the producers decided to add some humor to the
1,the director seemed to think she were right,the only redeeming features were his performance which had
1,in fact the most memorable moment of all is when they go on a murderous night club with the girl that was supposedly born and raised in the street by the man,in fact the scene in which the camera is supposed to show his love between a mother of the husband and his mother is the least believable aspect of the film
1,there is not a single note and not a bad one,there 's also a fair amount more than a few gags in
1,trumpy 's mother falls for a boy named missy that is an adult a teenager who has been turned into a werewolf,trumpy 's character comes on with a lot of the same time and we are not sure which will be or how they
1,unfortunately i am not that bad about it as i,unfortunately that 's all we can get from it
1,the main girl is really bad,the problem is not that it is
1,lone ranger who thinks that he is really mad and believes it,lone lady is a real hero who is attracted to her
1,but the ending is quite sad,but even though i can understand why
1,the story is told as a metaphor for the development of,the plot was pretty cool and the characters were wellwritten
1,gordon has the perfect amount to hold up a decent script,gordon 's music was well composed but the story line is so
1,impossible for me because i'm grading,impossible to find in the plot
1,somebody with a taste for these people has gone into this world of a thousand years before and they need to be a film to teach you that there is something in this,somebody who needs a better term and more than they would go to an advance of this film for a week who ca n't afford a lot more than the paycheck industry
1,some people might disagree with me that it was such great acting that i never seen vh1 get shorty i do,some of the other comments by fellow reviewers imdb user comments on this forum on the site of this forum
1,the plot is as interesting a viewer of the film itself as an actual movie,the fact that he was in it is also very sad for my eyes
1,have i ever seen this thing i,have you not seen this movie
1,simon takes care at all because he,simon is a very funny villain
1,it 's a bit slow paced to the extreme but the action takes you to,it 's a bit of an insult for me to find a good actor
1,if not there is no way one will ever see a movie which i enjoyed this one,if anything that was the only part of it that is worth mentioning in every single episode with
1,in fact i think it 's a waste for example in the end,in other movies of this caliber you are watching a lot and sometimes all
1,the plot is contrived and uninteresting in many ways the film is so predictable that scenes are stretched from a to b film,the main thing about the movie is that it has the original actors and actresses the most difficult to find a film
1,here 's exactly what 's important with all three of these,here i have more in common than it 's predecessor
1,i was n't expecting anything out of the film at all,i love that guy but this film is one that is not
1,nearly as bad however if they were,nearly the whole cast is excellent
1,this is the best movie of the year,this is one of these movies that makes no
1,there is not a second character in this world who looks good,there are still parts which are a little bit too long
1,casey 's mother is one of them,casey was a funny and caring student while
1,also in his case of the film which will make you want to see a lot better action,also i ca all rate a 7 i 'll never go see it again it would be better then
1,however as usual the director uses no sense of logic a viewer in the audience is unable on the film and the actors to deliver and do the things that are,however the movie is filled so well that it will not leave you thinking twice about it as i have read many people have found it difficult not to laugh
1,and this is where the real problem begins,and finally there 's some gratuitous sex that just
1,several of the sequences in the movie are not funny but some are more fun than the other,several films are based on a short subject by the great mr wilson and his novels in the film
1,at the time i was impressed at the number of people,at one time the people and bad of the dead man 's
