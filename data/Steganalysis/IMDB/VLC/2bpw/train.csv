0,a cool film that has a punch at the box office regardless of the stellar madonna as thomas storm although the lack of sparkle in the allies magazine provides more praise than to have 25 cent under the opinion that the creators should know from the other viewers who needed to add boredom to her film debut,a real shame that branagh can possibly put some effort into this film so he decided to give him a minor chance dealing with the conventions masquerading as another film where aaron spelling does discover himself somewhere in the film as the accidental visitor horse that he opens with the angry dapper builders square against them

0,the very end he slipped back after trying so hard and yet trying to predict for himself when driving around it to find out what he was able to do with all of its hitherto unlikable characters,the abundance of people deeply accepting issues of death and hatred and how it can be used against manned associations that keep hoping that knowledge are taken in in the younger non music scene is beyond me

0,it was so long ago that it sure felt to lead to,it should be required viewing to all your collection of this
0,in every words the film tries to tell the story of what happens when combining protagonists story less than in climax schemes and on repeated outcomes,in addition disgraceful donna and her family running towards as irritating and paraded out as a gemser sports outing with a promiscuous adolescent mouthed reverend wife lures

0,i do see robin hood cop one touch,i recommend everyone to see black hop
0,nevertheless despite excellent performances by jim scott and nia yen this movie just did n't work at all it was rather direct to video production that only made it available to modern standards,nevertheless the film does not let the end finished its plot line just the dinosaurs will reappear coen murphy has a warm command that drives it so i had deep disbelief throughout the film
0,from up to impressionable villa boy dr joe dawson for a small grand kicker with mayor hauser don hunter to top the team orange a nuclear peddler on the powell county and end,from reactions is it 's creator to decided to tell us about how badly submachine you can of showing a mistake for either drool or running that country shill 's work forever

0,however there is only one problem,however it definitely feels out of place
0,but is the real tiny crew that,but there is not saying enough
0,stewart is at his absolute best most traits in the 1970s often he depicted a weary flustered mob,stewart looked strangely handsome and married to brett she 's uncomfortable in giving a strong innocent performance

0,not particularly crappy as in some of the other comments i,not the ps3 at all but i would remain here
0,onj 's attempt by appearing to be such a chomp is,onj runs through the film with a younger decent atmosphere
0,the movie also goes into the mill of sheer perfection since david lynch has,the atmosphere is used as paul karlson 's the framing of the penguins

0,great movie i 've seen and awesome summer kids,great cast great plot script and a 3 track movie
0,cary grant is in a league of comedies most notably for looking forward to vis a handful of memorable films that for the most part did,cary grant plays robin hood a deliberate handsome devious john stewart who joins bombing heights and sings one of cesar sanders 's and kurt cobain

0,on the other hand this gives the film an edgy blend of color and atmosphere,on the other side of my comments the screenplay does even seem rushed with lame performances
0,the biting tone used throughout the decades was considered instrumental by not following a film seamlessly or by presenting painful,the innocence level is reminiscent of what is a study of what ally persons 's appetites could have been

0,the secret service one of the most controversial families in,the relative man 's emotions were apparently dead inside
0,the overt lack of budgets tells us nothing about our glimpses by serbs and the robotics that make the us networks in media sales shop were distributed in media imagination,the fx by playboy playmate jack seem prevalent in this show near the end of the wolf outdoor sonic impersonate topless women are a couple of in all shape ever in

0,it puts people accustomed to planner 's amoral ways of his own dinosaur but finds the money and many volatile and deadly treating which is essential,it was an excellent film its 1950 capture to the screen crew to deserve credit for its fine class and by the inclusion of special ops characters
0,the rest of the cast particularly cho really served the bill the voice of,the fights seem like they are filmed but either sometimes affectionate and halfbaked
0,ok so if he had that including him smile on and his fingerprints i wo n't be surprised by some claim,ok it 's too bad the end of the film is a times hinting at stuff that 's no point
0,there are a couple of pretty funny moments played these characters often with a bit of romance romance and horror,there is also one scene where the day of the 19th century yanks open doors on by the men from time
0,if you do n't permeate the movie by hard to figure out which hard thing can send you apart where the truth is you take out the movie you get a cohesive experience,if 94 you wish to cost money with the definitely minutes of the movie bullets i would advise you if you 're interested in snakes they should be defeated by his parents by taking

0,the lone stuff is also hampered if you want to talk about how greg goes through the cafe,the guy who owns the soundtrack creates the crew of children does n't even care about them
0,maybe some serious genre and slight cameos make this a director no legs to emerge from american soldiers in a regard but nevertheless,maybe it was deliberate to let these sailors realize that they were eavesdropping on the truth to celebrate the petition for them
0,nice story and plenty of true,nice and funny very enjoyable
0,the crazed critics vote on this picture for the longest 5 of the year,the death of actor offers random ticks and the cgi dye scenes easily lighting lit
0,the film has n't been set for thanksgiving dinner,the production design by walter blair should have been great
0,billed as a prequel to the western classic from the first three wo n't ever be,billed by the filmmakers here firstly for one scene rudolf is planning a marriage party
0,do yourself a favor watch counselor which is how horror movies look take them out,do we really get sucked into the tragedy that passes at a downward speed

0,the rest of its kids are great and make a serious difference,the movie was enjoyable enough and it was really nice to see morris
0,i ca n't imagine how sure this screenwriter actually seals his work and never directed it in his life,i would recommend it to everyone kids or men families or children with some scantily clad bodies who have no
0,because she is actually finding a real flop in her boyfriend 's life but manages to live up to her addiction and fulfilment and do not escape emotionally through where the teacher is on her,because we do n't likes it just because it seems allot of extreme significance in which it feels like we 're thrust into a film 's world where some pain is put in jeopardy

0,we were n't so expecting johnathan to make it like that,we never see the land seeing norma and hardly together on the
0,he plays far more refined and devious the compelling kindness than his character him and the dialog is acceptable but the storyline requires nothing to do,he is fascinated by jason 's trials and this textured guilt between soon we are in the same joker that happens in the first film
0,the two actors though not trip above caricature,the personalities themselves are faded and making the actors
0,but much of the blame lies from time,but the plot is the most interesting
0,this is a way to learn a good lesson of buying this movie since signing every corp mistake but with the plucky i,this is what we mean abstract events like raymond one pity british neighborhood a kid church and a student around the pyramid
0,it 's impossible to say but the lovely assassin was very,it is a beautiful experience that stars in the limbo
0,very bouncy and smart this imaginative and experimental melancholic ode to preteens such as,very good acting by a cast that falls completely flat at its core

0,that begs the question what message can you do,that 's a bad thing i suppose might be the
0,the plot was so utterly unbelievable that it was unbelievable,the music is good and the performances by the actors are
0,it 's only about halfway through the dance distribute,it 's been n't the fans used to compensate for
0,the soundtrack was so well chosen it makes for an excellent first class and unexpected medical drama and a undiscovered,the old jones is pretty cool and the cast of stalwart actors and actress carrre is truly a treat
0,it seemed dumb throughout and format of this movie was pathetic because of that character,it 's only experimental handheld origins do n't make you stronger to find it being there
0,it 's all so painful to watch,it is in fact and distancing private that
0,wow that 's about it,wow i'm not a latino scifi
0,murdered was what penny 's snake needed,murdered lovers of pay with randomly the snakes
0,the plot is nothing to write home about though another sad role,the poster looked pretty good and it has really good artwork
0,phillip 's got to go kill and everyone 's bali is immediately silenced by the bunch of yakuza regulations,phillip edwards appears to have been doing only a few good films he called his works but slightly better
0,this movie does n't stand out and leaves us squirm,this is a film for streep who worked perfectly by her
0,but man 's opinion it 's a scifi film the dear remains a fair thing and i'm am being,but later here it was elizabeth taylor who applies for dramatic acting and gorgeous rod steiger as angel
0,i ca n't see any criticism until a bravura jury contains this movie,i do n't know what the people who claim to demonstrate but of course
0,lumumba is a great film,lumumba is charming or provocative but
0,i will only list a few things that did n't require that would help,i must admit that the dictator or iii based solely on her movies pretty much
0,yet coyote sends his heart and tries what has to be the worst thing about,yet the worldweary thriller remains one of the few oldtime dramas i 've seen
0,despite great cinematic experience the aspect was quite weak and took my helsing to move my index finger further,despite the tantrums and a few scenes that seems to me the essence of this is intentional badly scripted and
0,then when all men put their differences on the old man 's brain the rex blows them up,then we are led to believe that peter brown is his brother and he spends a few years back
0,apparently he loves crawford and when she is his own and you will just read you could forget,apparently this film was the result of someone knowing that known this movie is simply pure garbage
0,since the shift is depressing or not why the hell did n't they just drag back together in one shot,since 911 is mainly about rookie attitude by films of our lead i courtmartial if unhappy to distribute expeditions
0,okada you 're supposed to look like you know what you 're dealing with,okada is still one of uttering the monster movies that arise to deliver
0,classic acting and directing all across this flick what 's up with the crappy 80s locations and cursing down the toilet with breakfast,classic level of irreplaceable logical stress turns into a thoroughly compelling and provocative portrait of love on any day of the night
0,the script is perhaps for a rarity and as you watch the action unfold in suspense it becomes painfully annoying but it really ca n't be that far as we are,the film starts off as a somewhat sloppy bore with robert englund overacting and a dry biting display of jack lemmon via his camera movements and james bond 's scope
0,all i can say is that nobody has any,all icing returns to riches equal time style
0,without sure the implication could have given him a little reference to previous films in cinema as he pursues the rest of the,without words because of the beautiful cars by the major players of the hundreds they referred to brando as our main character
0,there really was n't a lot of interesting information here a plot and turned out to be a true love to stunts from the first movie,there is a breast fire and several explosives exploding a crisp malls yet it looks as if they hear what looking for joe 's nite distaste anyway
0,michael niven is quite brilliant as what the lone ranger has to do if you can complete the brooklyn skyline,michael rooker 's early movies with bogart he did so many of his factory roles frequently made his performances both potentially
0,half of the movie is spent any real reason it does n't satisfy the need audience,half the movie is yes of a job just watching an episode closely unrealistic if you understand
0,the rest of the movie is a mishmash of boring jokes one leads up against others for a return to the film and the final sequence reveals that in the middle of the movie the ugliness of the conflict between the two men simply did n't make much sense of going behind a visible shootout as a psycho a student some black guys that kill a dozen weeks later,the idea of a divorce being turned into a performer of the annual wb era institutions and we have a character that receives hold of the same hardnosed pageant and questionable yet does provide one race against our society and starting in on a smaller try by waking up thousands of rwandan peasants this film ai n't 'another science or kurt russell but only a year before the great opening
0,from the start this film finally made me lose a dime in the 80 's but that 's all,from these faults cheesy disappointment is n't worthwhile and it is no surprise that it always does n't come right
0,having to choose the blind situation between alan and hank the girl is enough to,having read oscar wilde the reviews and romances of foreign cinema were beautifully constructed
0,lets start with the series resemblances to other animated episode and the slightly unexpected appearance of jon pertwee as diahann 's reallife officer,lets live without violence angry with wife even in the pants of a medical organization which would literally include a term hint of the
0,this fine movie bears unique excitement without resorting to much of coarse brutality and the one portrayed by several giant detectives is putting a remarkably devastating interviews between them,this film seemed to miss luna even mentioned samantha mitchell on early the sunday season cinemax rejected the fat children who were first timers with their eyesight and dishonesty they
0,in fact porky is his supposed muscle friend and a friend of remorse with the ignorant maria,in lisa 's room he feels like a leggy lady if you ask me tell spongebob

0,rather than profit she has to cope with data ends and costumed family situation,rather than a movie intentionally by it 's soundtrack the plot is n't nearly as
0,i did n't like the comprising some trying to get so a message that will and bore but we get to believe that in the end this is a great film and is n't serving very well either,i was totally enthralled this was one of diane keaton 's most recent film in the charlie chaplin collection and with queen rex i had not yet had an argument with the film due to lack of motivation for
0,because almost none of the singers are timeless and musicians spoke french accents,because i believe this he breaks in deep and becomes erect enough to release
0,amenbar is presented as a menacing nonentity who is also effectively human but never he enjoys her,amenbar would stop it most other captured critics must confront our fears our intelligence our sympathy for ourselves
0,but the acting is great films',but it 's to be on the
0,if any one person were impressed by this travesty and not just hated the first one it,if they could have been created by simon this film could have been a nifty franchise

0,i deeply enjoyed that god help the adopted nurse and they are lovers coming,i remember seeing films like scooby doo and 'the trash of zodiac colon this corpse
0,now off to the con man of all trades if she is away from something,now you can play the more russian version of amelie playing chimps like that
0,i kept watching this film from the director and that only left me dumber to the picture that was happening idiots working,i love mind that all movies are sinister to despise since they abandon pierce brosnan or something missed in his films
0,her longing for a stuff though never works,her performance and camera work in fleischer as the
0,perhaps without other ww2 bias this human led a lot of the killer rules and tries to protect the folks that it was based on,perhaps not all but admire most people who make you want to see a movie that will do you love you killed and appreciated thx
0,i learned scorsese 's class in tomorrow and learned about a tribeca musical instruments because the scriptwriters knew more much for giving us had to,i could not believe how crap this flick was but it was one of the worst films i 've ever seen in my life

0,you tell me when you are screaming which those you hate,you know through a window of yahoo that you feel some empathy
0,the rest of the movie contains gory images from the rock witch up until find the vampire house,the film is shot to a young named newland who is now involved in some with disdain
0,for those who think that los angeles 's real cool side of the stone is made a little more noble i ca n't really say much so i cannot say that this is a big flop and they seem one of the worst acting i have ever 're watching,for all the endless age of the bargain bin the film presents carrie a creepy thriller performer who served minor purpose such as male life and physically aborted masculinity annoyed parties envelop a young starving woman on this planet wasp etc although this is much superior to the equally simple
0,this time around to the surface is like one dreary rogue in the other makes the villain more palatable,this also leads to a somewhat schmaltzy final showdown involving robin using one of the dullest suspects to convince us
0,seriously the movie is a path that is authentically wasted with such rubbish but that cynicism cannot in fact bring more emotional emotion to theater seat,seriously enough this is zoey 's early model that she soon develops us often treated and the cast quote is huge and little soliloquies to them
0,being a mustsee but the main subject of the film not the others are forty miles away,being in the crusades preserve the surrounding religious regime behind morbid america of the victimization of mr black
0,classy experiences remain boring moody incestuous sad unsettling yet an unexpectedly unoriginal intellectually stunning film with very good costumes and a plot that might have,classy contact with the irs 's charles durning has given a walk to frank to performing a prison present as a live homicide agent

1,i have to say this is one that is n't really worth watching,i have never read any reviews about a film which was n't as bad
1,why is the movie so bad,why do i care for the main
1,i'm glad i did n't have to pay for it but it was not,i'm a fan and the movie 's soundtrack and cinematography are very good
1,it has the best of all the great movies that are being made in hollywood,it 's the story of a woman who is a little girl and the girl in
1,noticed the film 's success of the film 's success,noticed the film 's success of a film noir and the
1,1010 the only good part about it,1010 the movie is n't as bad as
1,ernest thesiger is the perfect actor and he plays the role of a very well suited and,ernest is not a good actor and he does have a lot better to work on
1,the movie starts off with an interesting concept,the story is about a young boy who has
1,listening to the music and the music,listening to the title character 's character and
1,i do not recommend this film,i have seen the movie twice and
1,here is the story the characters are not developed in their motivations or are there really any other actors that,here 's the story a group of people who have no idea about each other is the same way
1,the movie is about a young man named krishna played a young teenager named dexter,the movie was a complete failure in the first place the second was a lot of
1,it 's not a movie that will leave the viewers thinking of the future,it 's the story about an aging family who is trying their luck to find
1,the acting in the film are very,the film is a complete failure
1,and the ending is very abrupt but i guess i was n't going to be disappointed because i was so bored and disappointed that this movie was so boring,and that 's not a problem because the movie was so bad and the acting was terrible the plot was horrible and i did not care for the characters
1,the film has no atmosphere or tension whatsoever,the story line has a lot of holes but
1,the story is simple the characters and the plot is,the movie is a complete mess of a film
1,makes it a very good film,makes it a movie to sit down
1,anyone with any interest in the genre should see it and it is a good movie to watch for those who,anyone with an interest at the end will be able to relate to what the director is trying and failing
1,this movie is not worth watching for the acting,this is one movie that is a complete waste
1,misguided the film was made in 1995 and i,misguided but not the worst film ever made
1,stylistically the movie is a bit too much,stylistically i do n't know why i have never
1,the story of the kelly gang' was a good one and a lot of fun was the part that,the story is about a bunch of people who are trapped on their honeymoon in a remote island
1,if the film had made a little more of a movie i might to have avoided the film as a comedy but it is,if you 're going through the whole thing and you have to be a fan of the book you will probably be disappointed
1,the acting in this movie was very well written but i do n't think that the actors who made this show really work,the film is a bit too long and it 's too hard to find the characters and the story is so contrived
1,version is a bit of the same with,version of it 's a good idea
1,hanna barbeau is the only one who is able,hanna barbeau is a great actress and i hope she
1,well it 's not a good film but the,well i do not know what it is
1,while i do not think the movie has been made in a very good way it has a lot of good things,while i was not impressed at the beginning the film was a little too much for my taste as a whole
1,the acting is good but the acting is poor,the story is simple enough to be a comedy but
1,a lot of the scenes were just too much to be taken to the screen,a good film that i would recommend for anyone with a sense about it
1,so the film was shot and edited,so what if you 're a teenager
1,so i was n't impressed by the movie,so i have to say i have seen a
1,i was surprised to discover how this film,i think the movie is very funny
1,i think this is the worst movie that i 've ever watched,i do not think this movie is worth seeing for its historical value
1,the film is a bit slow at times but it,the film is a little slow and slow paced
1,the movie is not about a group of,the acting in general are pretty good
1,we have a bunch of friends and a bunch of friends,we 're talking to each other in a different manner
1,not to mention a couple of scenes of the movie,not to say that it was n't a good movie
1,the movie is a little slow but that 's what makes it,the film is not a documentary about life and its subject
1,the story of a girl and his family being held by a very wealthy and,the story is very interesting and the characters and the situations are so real
1,this film does n't seem to have been a success,this movie is a must for anyone looking for something like
1,the film has a great story about a young man who has been living in a small,the movie is about a man who is in a coma and his father is killed
1,it is the best movie ever made,it has been a very good movie since
1,visually i was n't impressed with the story but this was a good movie,visually the acting was superb and it was a good idea to see a good
1,this is a great movie for all ages especially for the fact that you are in a good film,this is the kind to show the world of war and how it is going to get to the point
1,so if you 're looking to see something good and,so i guess i 'll give it a try
1,having a good time i ca n't help but feel that the director was a genius and the,having read all the negative reviews on the imdb i thought that this was a great show
1,she is a beautiful and sensual woman,she 's a little more convincing than the
1,the acting is good and i really enjoyed,the movie is a very interesting one
1,i'm not sure why the film has a cult following,i'm a fan but i was not impressed at all that
1,for those that have not seen the first movie you will be disappointed,for the first time i saw a preview that was made to look like
1,overall the movie is a waste,overall i would say that it is
1,the acting and script were so bad that it made me wonder if they were making a movie about it,the story of a woman who has to be one of those movies to make her a good person
1,however the story is n't too good,however the film is a bit too slow
1,personally i think that the film is n't as good and the,personally i would n't be surprised that this was a sequel
1,the story was a bit confusing but it was n't that great either that i,the story is a simple mix of comedy romance romance drama romance and drama
1,handsdown a lot less of his life in his career is not,handsdown the most interesting thing in this movie are the characters
1,that was the most interesting part of this movie and the,that is the only reason i can remember the movie
1,everyone involved in this movie is so good,everyone else has their head broken down
1,shortly afterwards the film is set up in an interesting way,shortly thereafter the film is a bit of the spoof
1,if i had a choice i would have given it an 8 instead of a 1,if you have n't read it do n't bother watching it and you will find yourself wondering
1,this movie has a lot of problems but it has a very interesting story,this movie is a great movie for those who want a fun movie
1,a few of the characters were n't that good,a few years later the film is still very entertaining
1,multiplayer is an excellent example of what a great film it would be,multiplayer has been done so many times in the past few years and that
1,distributors should be warned that this is the first movie that has a very low rating but it 's not,distributors have been on the lookout for this show since it is the only show that is so funny
1,every character in the movie is so bad,every single person who has ever read this should
1,i think the movie is very good,i do n't know if this is a
1,this is a great film for the ages,this film is a must for fans
1,the acting is pretty bad the script was awful the directing was terrible,the acting in this movie was very poor the directing was terrible the directing
1,the film has a very interesting premise and the acting performances of the actors are superb and it 's,the movie is about a man who is in love with a young man who is trying too
1,the film is a complete waste,the movie is a little slow but
1,my favorite parts are where a man is trying to get to the heart of the film and his wife is a bit of a joke,my favorite parts of this movie are the ones where the girl is talking with a guy and she says that the movie is funny but the
1,but this is not an example for a,but this one was n't that good
1,while it does n't seem like the actors were on the cover they were all so bad that they could have made a decent movie for the budget,while the film is a bit long and a few scenes in the film are a bit long the film is still a nice little thriller about a man
1,that was n't enough to make me laugh,that 's what i would like to see a
1,but the story was n't too great,but the story is a little too long
1,this is a very good movie,this is one of my all times
1,try to make you think of a film,try not even get into the film
1,why did n't they just make this film to be the best of the three,why does n't anyone else think that the movie 's main aim of a movie to
1,and i have seen this film countless many,and the ending is a bit anticlimatic
1,but it is not that good,but it 's not as much fun
1,if i had to choose between the two i could not find a single redeeming feature in this movie and that was n't the,if you 're going through a whole lot of time to see this film it 's not worth it to get a hold
1,i do think the movie is very entertaining and,i was n't impressed when it was made
1,one thing that i do remember about this movie is that there is,one can only imagine that the film is a very poor movie
1,drowned in the middle by a mysterious killer and a,drowned in an automobile accident by a mysterious stranger
1,someone who has n't seen this movie will agree with me,someone who was n't a huge child of the gods who saw
1,most importantly the scene is the one where a woman 's reaction is broken down to a chair in the middle and then she is forced to leave her,most of the time the film was made up for a long time but it was n't a complete waste of my life it 's just a waste
1,this was the only thing that kept the film from getting worse,this was one of those shows that i did n't know what to
1,like a lot of the movies i have seen the movie has some good points and the acting is pretty solid,like the first film the characters are so real it 's almost impossible not like it was made on an island
1,it is a movie about the evils in life,it is a shame that it has n't been done
1,20 seconds of the movie is spent on a little bit of the same thing,20 minutes into the movie you get to see a bunch of the characters interact with
1,i do agree with the other reviewer about the ending which was a bit abrupt,i was n't expecting much from the first film but i was expecting a lot of
1,purists have to see it to understand what is the most interesting of all the films that are released today,purists of the original series should steer far far away from this movie and not even get a glimpse of what
1,tricks are all in their mind but they 're not,tricks are not the only thing you can do to make
1,once you 've got your hands you 'll be able into the film 's ability to get into,once in a movie you see the same movie as the one that is in the book
1,or maybe they should just say that this film will not appeal to those of,or maybe it would n't be too easy to make a movie like this
1,it 's the only thing that makes it so good and it,it is n't a movie that is not a good movie
1,now that i have a copy of this movie and i'm suprised i have to be a fan of a film that has to be a complete failure and a,now i know that this film is n't going anywhere near as good as it was in the first place it was a good one but it was n't
1,a very good and entertaining thriller about an,a lot of it is the same
1,once again this is not a good idea,once again this is the worst of it
1,it has a very funny plot and some good performances,it 's the same old story about people and their lives
1,raptor 3 has a great story and,raptor island is a great example
1,when you watch a movie with the characters you 're not going to get bored,when i saw the film it was a complete disappointment and i could not help thinking
1,the acting and script is so poor it makes the,the film is a complete mess of a film
1,there are some good moments of humor and a,there was no plot line and the acting
1,of all the other movies i saw this is one to watch,of course it 's not the same thing as this movie is
1,the movie has some great moments in the end,the movie is very slow moving and not very exciting
1,the story is very good but it is very very very very very,the story was a bit thin but the characters were very believable
1,you can see the movie in its,you know what i am getting
1,i was surprised by the way the story unfolded and the acting,i do n't understand how this film got such a high score
1,the movie was made in a very small budget and it,the acting is good and i really liked that movie
1,on a technical note the film is very good,on the other hand the movie 's plot is a
1,the story of a young woman who is in love and is in her mother is a little bit too,the acting was terrible the script is awful the acting is bad the directing awful it 's all there
1,i do n't know how to describe a movie that has to rely more on the subject,i have n't read many of the other comments on the film but i think that the film
1,as a movie buff myself i was disappointed to,as a result the movie was very good
1,read a book or read a book,read the book the book and the book
1,it 's the story of a man trying desperately to get to,it 's a shame because it 's not a bad movie
1,first off the movie is not about the characters in the story the characters and the plot,first of alli the film was a little slow but i was n't really sure how it was
1,and it was n't that great,and i do agree that i have
1,a lot more than the usual hollywood movie,a lot of it has a lot to do
1,hence the film itself is very good,hence that the film is not a total
1,to make matters worse it is a movie about a,to make matters of the same is not true
1,this movie is a must see if,this is the best movie ever
1,the story of the film 's premise was interesting and interesting but i found this,the movie has some good acting but the story is not really that great
1,at one time the movie was made in the early 90s and was not only a vehicle for an,at one time the movie 's main character was the only actor i could see in a film
1,abominable and stupid but i think this is a very good and interesting show that has a,abominable and boring this is a great example of what happens when you 're a kid
1,if you have seen a film of this type you will find,if you want a film that 's worth seeing this one
1,the story was n't bad enough to be entertaining,the film has a lot to offer and the film
1,he 's a great director but i do n't think the movie is a real stinker,he has the best role in this film and is one that everyone should see
1,i do not think i can watch it over and done but i'm glad i did,i have to say that the acting is good and the story is very believable
1,melissa 's character is so unlikable,melissa is the most beautiful character in
1,but it was n't so much,but the film has no real plot
1,how could this movie been made as an action film,how many people do the movie makers have done
1,i was n't expecting much from this movie,i have never seen such a movie
1,of the three films of the same era this is not one of his,of the three films that i 've watched i 've seen this film
1,this movie is a great example for a movie and a very good movie to look out for but i,this is a film for all ages and i would recommend this movie to anyone who loves the genre
1,read the book the book by the author and the writer,read the book for the first half of the movie and then
1,without a doubt this movie is a complete bore,without spoiling this i have a hard way of saying
1,its a shame that such an opportunity to,its just a waste of my favorites
1,truly this movie is a complete waste of time and a total insult,truly this film is not worth watching for any of the actors
1,the story is about a bunch that,the acting and script were terrible
1,once the movie is set it becomes obvious why the movie is so bad,once again the film has a lot of fun and it does n't have any
1,and the movie is a total mess,and it does n't matter that the story
1,god knows how this was a movie that could be a good film,god knows that the film is a complete mess of an action movie
1,one of my alltime favorites is a film that has,one thing i noticed is a very interesting story
1,the movie is a little slow but the ending was so good,the story of the story of a man named sosuke who has been
1,that said this movie was a complete disappointment and should be,that 's what i would have expected from a movie
1,leonardo dicaprio is a great choice as his character and the film 's strength to be a bit of a shame that he was never given his credit is beyond his grave,leonardo dicaprio as a tough man in a supporting character is an actor that is very funny as a villain and is a likable person who is always a good actor
1,eventually he finds out about her past,eventually the two men get involved in a
1,kal penn plays his usual role in his role but,kal penn plays a young woman in this movie
1,a lot happens in this movie,a few scenes are just too much
1,besides the fact that the film is a comedy about an aging young woman it is also a very beautiful film,besides it 's the worst film that i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through and i would not have had
1,my favorite parts of the movie include the scene where the girl and her mother are sitting on the porch eating the camera and,my favorite scene is the scene when the girl is walking around a table talking about her boyfriend being raped by the camera
1,on the plus side it is not a movie to be taken seriously,on the other hand it 's a very nice movie and the actors who
1,in this movie he has a lot more than a few lines,in a way i did n't like the movie because it was so
1,the film has some good points but the,the acting and script is very good
1,scientist is a good movie that is not only the best of all it 's the,scientist is an intelligent character who 's a real person and is a good actor
1,it 's just a bad movie,it 's a shame that it is
1,i think this movie has been made in,i think that 's what it is
1,at first the movie seems like a spoof of,at first i thought it would get better
1,the story is about a group of people trapped in the woods of their country,the story is about an ordinary woman who is a woman and is a woman who
1,frustrated is a movie that is n't afraid that you 're watching a,frustrated to say the most of all the characters in the book
1,overall i would recommend this movie to anyone,overall i give this movie an 8 for a
1,none other than that i have seen this film and it was so bad it 's good but i did n't think the director was the director,none is that this is a good movie but it 's a good film that is not only the worst movie ever but it also has an intriguing
1,i was n't expecting much but i had to give it a 1 because it 's,i do n't think i 've seen anything like the other films in the genre
1,but it is a good film,but the movie has some of it
1,african born killers' is a movie that has a lot of laughs,african americans were a very popular group of people and they had to
1,sheba and her friend are a bunch that is n't afraid to go,sheba 's character is the best of the bunch of the film
1,noah is not only one thing that 's good in the first film and,noah and his friends are in the family 's home for a week
1,and the acting is n't as good,and the ending where she is a little
1,because i have n't been able into a horror genre since i 've read that the film is a little bit of an indie film,because of the fact it was a remake i had the feeling that i was in the movie for the first time and it was the
1,brown is the only one who has the guts to do anything,brown 's character in his first movie is a great actor but he
1,but the story is a lot of the usual stuff i 've seen lately and,but the film does have a certain point in it that makes it worthwhile
1,the story line was very interesting but it was not,the acting is good the writing and directing is great and
1,this is the first film to be released in the us,this movie is a great example of how a movie should be
1,just do yourself an favor to the original,just a few minutes later the story of the
1,to say this movie was n't made is beyond me,to be sure that the director has done so well that
1,but the movie was just a bad excuse to,but it is not the worst movie ever
1,a good cast of characters is given the opportunity of being able to act,a few years later she has been a successful woman in a long life and
1,all in this movie is not as bad as it was but i was,all the while the film is set up in a very simple manner
1,ok so i do concede the film is n't bad,ok so the movie was pretty bad but it was a
1,it 's a shame that the film never has been released in the us since the original is,it 's just a little too slow for a movie to be a comedy or a drama
1,but the film does have an excellent cast and it is the,but i have no problem with this film as a whole
1,he has a lot of fun making it,he has a good sense to make a movie
1,well this was a good movie,well the first half is just another
1,not to mention the fact that he has no idea what to do with his character,not only is he a bad actor but his performance was also quite good and he was
1,later in the film she is forced to leave her husband and her mother to be the mother and her daughter who has the same problem,later the film becomes the most annoying and boring movie that i 've ever watched but i have to say that the acting is good and there
1,the story is about a young man who is a little boy and a teenager in the world,the acting is horrible and the plot line seems like they had been thrown together by a drunk
1,the story of a young woman who is a woman in a small town who is,the story was very simple but the movie did n't make any sense at all
1,i do n't think i 've watched any of these movies before or,i was n't expecting much from a movie that was n't bad
1,the acting is good with all the cast members of a great cast and,the film is a little slow but it does n't have a lot
1,well i do not know what i am talking to but this movie does a good job,well i was n't impressed with this film but this one is not for the masses
1,so i guess i can forgive it for what i think it was a good idea for a horror,so the film is a complete mess of a story that has nothing new or interesting to say
1,and it 's a shame that this movie did,and the film does n't seem that much
1,you can tell that the actors are all trying to get the actors to play,you 'll have a lot of fun with this one as it has the best elements
1,he 's a little too old but he does have a few moments that are very good in a way he does,he is the only person that could be a hero or even a good man but he was a good actor
1,this was a very good movie,this is one of them that is
1,overall the movie is not worth watching but,overall this movie could have been better
1,bark is a movie about a man named melvin and a young man who is searching in a car crash,bark of a hat is an excellent movie that will keep your interest in the end of your seat for a
1,there is a scene where he is talking with his friends and they are trying to make a living,there is a scene with a guy who is a little bit too busy talking to the camera
1,this was the worst movie ever i,this is a very bad movie
1,it has been the same day for me,it has to be said to make this movie
1,now that 's a bit more of the comedy in the film but the film does a great deal of fun,now i know that i do n't like to watch it but i do not know what to do with it
1,she is a very good actress and,she has a lot of talent
1,i do think that the movie was very good in that it was the most boring film i have,i have seen this movie and the only one i have seen is that of the great hulk
1,there is a reason why the movie was so bad,there 's also some great music in the film
1,i was surprised to see how many movies were in this,i have never seen such an awful performance of hers
1,if you have n't read a biography of the book it will probably be a little misleading,if you are a fan and have read that it is the best movie you can find this
1,there are so much of the story lines that you could see,there is nothing wrong in this one but it is not
1,well it 's the only time it 's a movie that is so bad that,well i have n't seen the movie but this was just a great movie
1,chaney is a very talented character and,chaney is a very talented actor
1,from a technical standpoint i think that 's what this movie is about,from a technical point of view i was surprised to find that there are
1,it is a movie with no redeeming features,it 's a shame because this movie is a
1,they are the only one who 's been able for a long time,they are both a very talented and capable actor and i would recommend this
1,the film has some good acting in it but the script is not very funny at all,the story of the story was a lot better and it was n't a good idea
1,oh and i was so excited to see it again on tv,oh yeah it 's not that bad either the actors are good and
1,ok so i do n't know what to think of,ok so i was a bit skeptical about this movie and
1,on this level the film was a very good movie and i was very impressed,on this one the film has an interesting story and a very strong story
1,there was a bit of a sense to the story but it was a,there is a scene where he 's a little girl in the car
1,in the end i was hoping that the film could be more of what was shown in my life and that,in fact the only thing that is missing is the fact that there 's no real explanation for the story
1,i think that the best part in this film is the fact it is so funny,i think the reason for this movie is because it has been done so much better
1,his character is a bit too much,his acting was n't as wooden
1,mary pickford plays a character whose life is so different from other movies,mary is a good actress and is the only one who has to play
1,the movie was a complete waste,the film is a bit of a
1,it was n't the first time that,it is a very good movie
1,the story was so weak and the acting so horrible,the film is a bit too dark for words and it
1,my friend was a fan in a long time of the late 70 'searly 50 's early 80 about the movie,my advice to the director for the film 's title was the fact i saw this film in a cinema and it
1,and the ending is so ridiculous,and the movie is not a bad
1,the movie was shot at an hour of 35mm footage and the film is not very good,the movie was shot with the same name as the first film and that was n't a good
1,when you watch a movie you 'll see how the director 's commentary is so good that it is n't even,when you watch this movie you can feel the pain that the director of the film had on the audience
1,please please do n't bother with me,please avoid this at any time if you
1,they 're all in the dark and they have no chemistry in the movie they are not even likable characters,they have to go to the movies of the director to make a movie about a bunch of people
1,we have a lot more of this,we 're not talking about a film that
1,this is a very good and very very good movie that,this is a film that i recommend to everyone interested
1,i have seen it twice now in a very long time and i'm not too sure if it was the director 's intent or what was the point to the story,i do n't know how it got made in the early 80 's and early 90 's but that does n't make for an excellent movie and it certainly has some redeeming
1,considering the fact that the film does n't have,considering this is a film you should watch
1,and the movie was n't so great,and i was surprised that the movie is
1,unfortunately it 's not that bad,unfortunately it was n't a great movie
1,marking the movie 's premise is a bit confusing,marking the movie and then the film has a lot
1,with a supposed budget this movie fails miserably,with a lot more to say about this film
1,also the scene where the two men were in a bath and a few scenes,also the scene in which a girl gets her tits is not even funny
1,the movie was n't so much better than the first one but that 's,the film is about a young woman who has a crush on her
1,sadly it 's not a movie to watch if you are looking for an entertaining film,sadly i have never heard that the director was so pleased to find the original movie to
1,i have never read the book nor do you ever read a book that has a,i think it 's one of those movies that i think is a great deal
1,for the most of the movie i was surprised to find it in the theater bin,for those of the us who are looking for the movie to be a little bit too
1,however the story was n't that interesting either so why would the,however this was not a good movie and it is not
1,could have done a little research if it,could n't they have had the money
1,thank you for giving me a break,thank god i did n't get it
1,the story line was very good the acting and,the movie was a bit slow and boring
1,anyone who thinks this movie is good is the best way i can think about the film and its message to it,anyone who does not know this film was a little more sophisticated than the original movie and the first half of the film
1,he is not the only actor who could have done a better job,he is a very nice guy who has no problem finding himself in the
1,i have n't seen this show in my lifetime and i can only assume it was a very low budget film that,i have never seen any film that has been made as much as this but it 's not a good movie
1,like the other films of the same era the film is a complete waste of time and money and time,like i mentioned before it is not a bad movie and it does n't make sense but i do n't think
1,you have to watch it and you will be pleasantly surprised to find out,you know the story of a man who was killed in the end of this
1,a few years later the film has been released and i have to,a very good movie with great actors and an excellent story line
1,old fashioned movie about a young woman who is married and who is a woman,old man who is a man who has been killed by an evil virus and a
1,either the director or director of the film should be able for the director and the director for this travesty and the film would have been more interesting,either way it was a very nice film to see and i would recommend to anyone who likes to watch the movies and enjoy the movie and enjoy it
1,he was a great actor and he had great chemistry,he is the most talented person in the film
1,yes the movie is a bit slow,yes it 's a great movie
1,another thing that i found interesting was the way he was portrayed,another example that this movie could be made for a razzie award nomination
1,she was so good and the movie had a nice touch,she is the one who gets to do the best in her
1,clive owen plays an annoying and neurotic character,clive is a very talented character who is very
1,i was expecting the movie for the first time,i think it is the best movie ever
1,on the other hand the story is a bit too predictable,on this one the actors do not seem like they were reading
1,did n't he think he 'd have a chance,did n't you think that the real world would ever
1,firstly the film has a lot to do and is very entertaining,firstly it is the story that makes it a great movie
1,no one has ever done anything else,no wonder it 's not a great one
1,the film is a bit slow and,the story was n't very good
1,it is a very simple movie,it 's a pity that the movie
1,somewhere else is a movie about a man trying to get to the big city in,somewhere along comes the first half of the film is the same as the first
1,as a result the film was a total waste for me as a whole the film was a waste 2 hours,as i said earlier this film was not a total waste of money it is a waste of my life
1,well this is one movie i 'd love,well it 's a little too long
1,ive never heard of it until the end,ive never heard of the movie and it was
1,whole chunks are just plain bad,whole movie is just a bunch of
1,it is a very funny movie and i recommend that everyone should be careful about it and it is a must see,it 's a shame that the film is so bad that it 's almost impossible for me and i do recommend the whole
1,the story was so stupid and so lame it was painful for me,the story was a bit confusing at first because of the fact there was
1,he was n't a great actress but i,he is also a very good guy
1,then again the story is not bad,then the film switches to a very bad
1,and the movie was shot at a time when the movie is a little slow,and the acting is horrible and the acting is awful and it 's not really funny
1,either the director or director should have been,either way it 's a great movie
1,i have never seen any of his movies but i have n't seen this one yet,i think that the best thing about this movie is it is a complete waste of time
1,boy is it a bad film or does she know it,boy i love the movie and i think it is worth seeing
1,her performance is a bit overdone,her acting is very poor but she
1,the acting was terrible but it is n't bad,the movie was shot in a cheap digital style which
1,this is the kind that makes you want a good laugh,this film is a must for anyone who wants a laugh out
1,heston is a very good actor who is n't a great actor,heston is the only one who is able for the role of the
1,loc is the best man in the business and the movie 's only saving grace is the acting,loc is not the best character in the movie but his portrayal is not a bad one
1,because of the great acting the story line is very good,because of that i was n't expecting much of the story and
1,do you want a film to be a great movie and if you 're a fan you will enjoy this film and you will enjoy it,do n't worry about that but if i were a little bit of a fan of this movie i would have enjoyed the movie more
1,with the exception being the one who 's in the house with her boyfriend she is a little more than a bit of,with a lot of money this movie has a lot to say but i do n't want to spoil it for you
1,still this is a very entertaining movie with a great deal,still the movie does n't make sense and the story line is
1,i was expecting a great story and i was n't too surprised that i did n't,i think that 's a shame because the film does have a lot to offer
1,he was a little more believable and he could have been a bit more interesting,he 's the kind of guy who has to fight for his own life in order
1,if you want the movie you should check it out if it 's on dvd or just want,if i was n't that i 'd be in the middle of this film as i was
1,i was surprised to see that the,i was so impressed by it
1,this was a very bad movie,this was the best film that the
1,if you have n't already seen this one you will not be disappointed,if you have a masochistic stomach and are a bit more masochistic than you
1,kevin spacey is great as a man who is,kevin spacey plays the part he 's in
1,i have never been a big big fan,i was so excited to see this movie in
1,i was surprised to find that the movie is a bit,i do n't want it to happen in my head
1,wife and father is a very good film,wife is an excellent character study of a woman
1,walsh 's performance as his character is not,walsh is one that makes you think
1,this movie has the potential of having to,this film is a very bad one
1,his performance is very convincing as well and he 's quite convincing in this film but he is not the only actor that has to play the character he does,his character is a stereotype of a woman who is in love with a man who has a very troubled husband to do the same things she has to do
1,it is a movie that has been,it is a very funny movie
1,it 's a shame because it is,it 's not even the same
1,labeling it a great movie and you 'll be able,labeling this one on the imdb is a waste
1,the acting is good and there is,the movie is a complete mess
1,you know what 's coming from the first movie and it 's a good thing,you can see the director 's cut and the camera angles and lighting and lighting are
1,when you watch this show and you 'll be able to watch a lot and laugh,when he finally finds a way he is killed and the police officer is killed by a
1,as the movie continues we have to wait for the,as a result i found the story very engaging
1,in the end it is not a bad movie,in fact the film was so bad that it could
1,to me it was an interesting movie and it was a great,to be honest it 's not the greatest movie ever made
1,it 's the kind of movie you can watch in your teens 's basement,it 's not a good movie and it 's a shame that the film never
1,it 's not a bad movie but a good one at that,it 's not that i do see a film like that of any
1,but it 's not that bad either,but the film is not so bad
1,now that 's a good thing because i was n't sure if the,now i know that it is a movie that is so stupid
1,there are some very interesting moments but they are n't as,there are so much better films out in the us
1,the story line was good but it was n't,the film has some good points but it is still
1,carlos mencia is a great actor,carlos mencia was in the film and
1,the movie has a lot of problems but there,the movie is very good in the beginning
1,it 's a shame that this film is so hard to watch,it is a great movie and i recommend you do n't watch it
1,we 're talking about the same thing over and,we are supposed to sympathize with the characters
1,a very good movie with some nice actors and a good cast,a very interesting movie about how it is about a woman and the
1,a good movie to watch for a few laughs,a good film with an excellent script and an interesting
1,brown is the most famous and most of his films,brown is one that is n't a bad movie but is
1,as a movie this was one of his first films and the first one,as a matter the film has a certain charm and a sense of realism
1,he was the first person who had to be the most talented actor in,he is a very good character actor who has a very strong role
1,despite its shortcomings it is not a movie that is not only a visual film it is an,despite the fact it 's a movie about a young boy it 's a very interesting film
1,and the ending is a little unsatisfying,and it 's a shame because the movie
1,he is the only one that has to deal,he has the best lines in the film
1,the film has no real story to be found in any other movie,the story is about a man trying his hand at the world and the
1,really this film is not a good one,really the film 's biggest flaw is to make
1,the movie is about a young girl who has a boyfriend named jen who is married,the acting is horrible and there is no chemistry between characters in any other movie
1,jimmy durante is excellent as the lead character and,jimmy fallon 's character is just plain stupid
1,physically enough i found myself wishing that this would be more,physically he is n't the best actor of the bunch
1,outside of this movie the story is very interesting,outside of a few of these films i found it
1,he 's a good actor but his acting is n't bad,he is the only one that has ever seen him in this
1,he 's just as good and the movie as the title suggests,he has a good time and his character was a bit more likable
1,anyway the plot was very good,anyway i think the movie has a
1,sure there were some good points but i found the story line to have,sure it 's a great film but not a movie for everyone involved
1,the story line was so bad it was almost painful for me,the story line is a bit confusing but the movie is a good
1,the story of the movie is very good and the,the film is a little bit of the first
1,you can tell that the director and writer were not,you have a great cast and an excellent cast
1,it is a great story with great acting and a story line,it 's a shame that this was not released on video or dvd
1,i do not think this movie was made in a very realistic way,i do n't know what the hell was going for it i guess but
1,the movie is very well written,the movie has some great scenes
1,it 's not even the same movie as the first one,it is not a movie that i can only recommend to anyone
1,now the movie has a good cast and a good plot,now i do not know why i did n't watch a lot
1,i have seen it twice now in the theater in new zealand,i have to wonder if the director was trying too much
1,the film is a very good movie with a great story that makes it a must see for all,the story is about an ordinary man who has been sent into a life by a young woman
1,mateo is not only a little more than a loner but a very good one and he 's a good guy,mateo is an alcoholic who is sent to prison with a group of young people to help the poor boy who has
1,so if i were you i might not be able to see it again,so i guess the movie is a bit slow but the acting was pretty good
1,not only is it so much more interesting than it should be,not only is this movie a complete waste of money but the whole
1,i do agree but the film was n't as good,i think that it is a very good movie and should
1,the story is simple the characters are shallow,the acting is good but it does
1,what a shame that this movie has no,what 's the deal of the plot
1,after seeing the first movie in a few months the movie became a little more enjoyable to watch but it was not,after all this movie is n't about the people who have to be the best way to get out of it
1,she is also a great singer and a beautiful actress,she 's a very talented actress and she 's not a
1,andy lau is a good actor but his character was so annoying it 's hard to believe that he was the only person who could n't possibly have been more,andy griffith 's character is a caricature and the story is so full of holes that it 's impossible not to feel the need of attention to the characters
1,i have to say that this film has a,i was n't really surprised by this one
1,sands and the pendulum is the most boring and most overrated,sands of the seat and his work is the best
1,as the movie continues the movie begins to drag and,as a result it 's not a good movie
1,this movie is a complete waste of my time,this movie is one of many times that i would
1,but this is one of the worst movies i 've seen in years to come,but it does make a lot of sense to me as the story is told in
1,penelope cruz is a great actress in this film but she does have a very small role as a woman,penelope raines is a great actor and i hope she gets more screen credit than this one is in the beginning
1,most importantly it is an excellent film and i recommend this film to anyone with an open minded mind,most importantly the scene where he has a little girl and a girl in his bed was a bit of
1,in fact this is a very poor movie with no redeeming value,in fact the only thing good about this movie was the fact the
1,i do not think this is the best of the series,i think this film is a must watch for anyone who enjoys
1,all of the actors in this film were excellent in a,all in all a fun movie with a great cast
1,it 's a pity because it 's a very funny film,it 's a shame that such movies were never released on tv
1,everything in between the characters and the story,everything about it was just plain awful
1,the acting in this film was terrible and it was,the film has some of my alltime favorite actors
1,this film was made for the sake that the movie was made,this is a film for the whole world and should have stayed away
1,just do yourself the favor and rent the original,just do n't expect much to this film
1,the movie is a little slow paced but it does n't have the usual charm to make,the film is a complete mess and the film does n't make a whole new sense
1,why did the writers think they were trying too hard,why do we have to be subjected to the movie
1,corey haim is the only good character,corey haim 's character is so bad it
1,of course it does n't have a happy ending,of all of those movies this is a great film
1,simply put a movie is n't worth the time to view,simply put this is one film you can see in a movie
1,i think the reason why this movie was n't a success,i think this is the best movie of the year
1,that is a shame to say it,that 's a very funny thing
1,john cusak is the only actor who,john huston is a fine actress
1,needless up is an excellent film,needless to believe the movie 's main
1,the story of the story is not as good or original as it should be,the acting is good with the exception that it 's not a good idea to show
1,put it into the context of your average film and do not waste your time,put it this is the kind of crap i 've ever heard about the movie and
1,they are not in their midtwenties but they have to be one,they have the best actors of the day and they 're all good
1,it was a waste for me,it 's just so stupid that it
1,it 's the same old story that i did n't like,it 's a very funny movie that is not funny
1,coop is one of the best actors in the history group,coop is the one that makes him look good and his voice
1,if you want a real movie with a few good laughs and some great action you will find it,if you want the movie to get a bit of a message you 'll love this movie as well
1,hook has a lot to do and i think that is why the film is,hook and the film 's story is not a very interesting and interesting story
1,if the movie was n't bad i 'd have to disagree that the acting is,if i were to watch this movie again it would be a complete waste
1,but i have n't heard of the story so many years after seeing a movie that was a little too much to ask,but this is the worst movie of the year and the only one who has a good laugh at all is not that bad
1,the acting is very poor and the acting,the acting was good the story was ok
1,he has been the first of three great films to be released on the big,he 's the kind of guy that gets a lot of trouble with him
1,there was a bit of a good plot line but the movie is not,there is a very strong scene between the main character and a woman who is
1,apparently there is a lot more to say,apparently the film is n't a comedy
1,the acting is horrible the script is awful the script was horrible and the characters all over again,the story was a bit confusing and it did n't make sense but it was very entertaining
1,comic book is the first of the three films of,comic book is a great show and it shows
1,it is the best thing i 've seen for a long time since the last time,it 's not that i would n't have to watch it to see what it is
1,most movies are made in the same way as the originals and the story,most movies have a good cast and the characters were believable and believable
1,much of what 's happening here the characters were so bad they had to make the,much of it was made in 1980 the film is a little dated at best
1,while the movie is about the life of the two men it is also a,while it 's not a great movie i would recommend this movie to anyone
1,it has a great story and a good story line,it 's the same kind that i would have liked to
1,everything about it was bad and there is a scene in which she has a crush of her own mother who is the only one to get her,everything else is just so bad that you ca n't help but laugh and enjoy the movie even though you have to be the most annoying person
1,but the film has no redeeming qualities,but the film is a very interesting one
1,so the movie has a lot going it is a little bit too dark for me,so what i did n't see was that this movie is a bad film it was n't
1,then the story of the movie is about how a woman who is a woman,then there 's a few scenes in which the hero is trying to get a few
1,the acting is horrible and the story itself is,the film is a little over the top
1,at least the movie was n't funny,at least that 's what you 're thinking
1,as a result the plot and characters were so bad that they could n't have been developed,as the movie goes on its own the story is a bit too simple for a movie to
1,endless waltz is a very bad movie that,endless spoilers ahead there 's no plot
1,this is a very funny and enjoyable show,this film has the same basic premise as the
1,if it were a little more interesting it would have been a lot,if you want the movie you will find a lot of fun
1,when he is a girl in a car accident he finds a bag of water in the back of a hearse,when you watch it you can tell you that this movie is just a bad movie and it 's a bit of
1,i have n't seen a lot in this movie but i have to admit,i was surprised that this film was made in the early 80 years
1,if you 're a fan of the series i would recommend this one as it,if you have n't already seen it do yourself an favor do n't watch
1,whether you like the movie or not i am glad to say i did,whether or not it was the same thing that was in the book i thought
1,the story was n't bad but the actors and the actors were n't really good,the story of this story was a bit too much to follow and it did
1,i think that the movie was a little too good but the movie was so bad that it was actually a waste for,i think this is a great example for the film 's creator and the director for making a movie about the holocaust
1,really the worst film i can think of,really it 's a good film but the acting
1,the acting was terrible but the acting and the plot were so bad that it was almost painful to,the acting was horrible the script is bad the acting is horrible and the writing is just bad
1,the story of the movie revolves around the two young lovers of a man who lives on the farm and,the film was shot at an angle of the film which is the most important aspect of the movie
1,how could they have a film that has the same theme,how many movies can you tell you that you 're in for
1,so what 's wrong with this movie,so what i was looking forward for
1,she has the same role as she was in her first film,she is a good person and the movie has some good moments but
1,throw in some of the best actors i have ever seen,throw in a couple and a half of a bunch that 's
1,how can i possibly have to choose between them,how did the director think this is a good idea
1,the movie is about two men who are sent to the island to see,the acting is pretty good with the two leads being a bit better
1,naturally this is one of the worst of the series ever,naturally this is a great movie to see if only because it
1,the movie was shot in color and the editing was very,the story is simple and it is the same story
1,she is also the only one who is able to get a,she is a very talented actress and is a real joy
1,she is also a very good actor,she is also the one who is the
1,i think the reason why this film has a lot more depth is the fact the,i was so disappointed that the film was n't even nominated for a academy awards
1,alan rickman was great as the conflicted but determined,alan rickman was the best of the two
1,like the other reviewer who wrote that this is one of,like i said before the movie is not very good
1,other than that the film was a little too long to,other than that the movie is a little too long
1,is a great movie and one that,was the first of the three _EOS
1,let me just tell you that it has a good,let me start by saying i love this film
1,surely it is a shame because the film is n't a complete failure,surely it was the director of the book and the director 's name was
1,it was n't that bad it was a very,it is a very simple and moving movie
1,i think the film was a good choice for those of us that have seen this film and i have to say that i am a fan and have seen the original version,i have to say the movie did have a lot to offer the story line and the characters are believable to the point where they are trying to make the story interesting
1,we are shown to be a very harsh and gentle person,we are shown to the audience and the viewer is left wondering
1,i think that the movie is a little too long,i think the director 's cut is a bit too slow
1,this is the worst of all,this is the worst film ever
1,just as a film it 's a,just like the other two films
1,mr blandings has a very difficult role in his career and the supporting actor is also good,mr bean has a very small part as well and the acting is pretty bad and the story
1,he 's not only the best of the bunch but,he is a great director and a good man
1,like many others this was not one of them but the film was very well made and acted,like the previous reviewer said this is a good movie to be watched by a young audience who would
1,the film has a lot to offer and is very good to watch and it has a good story line,the movie starts with a very promising opening sequence where a man who is trying a cure in a bar in
1,at least it has a good cast,at least it is n't a good movie
1,i have to say i did not like it but it is a good family,i was n't really expecting the same thing to be said about the movie
1,arau has the ability to create an atmosphere of tension,arau 's character is a very likable and likable person
1,but this is a movie about the real,but this is a very good film
1,he 's not a good actor,he is the most talented actor of
1,finally the film 's main theme is that it is a film that has been,finally the movie is a little too long and the story is too predictable
1,so what do i know that this is a bad film,so the film is a little too long to be a good
1,at least it 's not a good idea and is not a film,at the end of the movie we learn how to be an outcast and
1,saturday morning live is an entertaining film and one thing i would recommend to anyone,saturday night fever is a very funny movie that i would love to see
1,he is not the only actor in the movie and he is not a very,he is the only person in the movie and he is a great fighter
1,by the end of the movie there was an,by the way i do n't know why
1,and it 's not a bad thing that it has been done,and that does n't make a movie a bad one either
1,on the plus of this movie i think i was a little confused,on the other hand if i were to rate it 0 i would have
1,matt damon plays his role perfectly,matt dillon 's character is a caricature
1,the acting is horrible and i 've seen better in a long while,the acting is good but the script was so weak that it was almost
1,the story of the film revolves in two of their best known actors and,the movie was shot in color and the camera pans in the background
1,so i was surprised that this was the only,so what do i expect from this film
1,i do n't think it was the best of it 's kind of film it was,i was surprised by the ending and i was really surprised by how it ended
1,i do not know why i watched this,i do agree that the film has some of
1,the film has an interesting plot and some good performances,the story is very weak and the characters seem to have
1,outstanding performances and an interesting story,outstanding and a very good film that
1,the acting and directing are very poor,the film is a complete mess
1,often i have to wonder what the director was thinking when he,often it 's the same story and the acting and directing
1,it is a very good story with,it 's not even worth renting
1,sonatine is a very moving film with a message that is not afraid of any of its literary themes,sonatine was a great show that was a lot more enjoyable than it was and it is very well done
1,a very interesting film that i enjoyed,a good movie to be seen by everyone
1,what i did n't like is that it was a little bit too much to be,what is more important to the story is the fact of the film 's title
1,the acting was good the script and the directing are good but it is not a movie,the movie has an allstar actor who plays a young and very young boy with the right guidance
1,it 's not that bad but it 's not a bad movie either it is not,it 's a great movie and it was a joy that i would n't have to go
1,that said this is the best movie i have watched,that was a good way of making a movie
1,has the movie been done by an outsider,has a very strong cast of people in their
1,this film does a lot of research on a subject matter,this film is one of the worst movies ever made
1,basically the film has a lot to offer,basically the movie is n't really a good movie
1,all i could do is laugh,all of these are the best i
1,but this is one movie that i have seen,but the film has some very interesting moments
1,in fact it 's the worst film i 've watched since gigli,in this case the movie is a complete waste of time
1,part 2 of the year is a film that has a lot to say about it,part 2 has a very good plot but i think it was a bit slow and boring
1,the story is a little thin,the movie starts out as a typical
1,not only does the story have its share of,not to mention that the acting is bad
1,everyone involved is in the same situation as the first one,everyone involved in the making comments should be required to make this
1,with a lot more to say than that i would say that,with this film he has to rely heavily on his own
1,we get to watch this movie as it is a movie that has no plot,we get the impression that the director is trying to make a film with his camera
1,shah rukh khan 's performance is the only reason i gave up on the,shah rukh khan 's performance in his career is a bit over here
1,you have n't even been able into a horror genre that 's a good one,you have to be a bit pushy and have n't read any of these other reviews
1,as a result it has been done by a,as a movie it fails on many fronts
1,apart from that it is an excellent film,apart from that it 's not even worth watching
1,this film is a must see for,this is a very good show
1,this movie is a complete waste of my favorites,this was a movie for me to be entertained
1,it has the best of it and is a very enjoyable movie and it 's very good to be able to see the movie,it 's the story about the life of two friends and their relationship with each other and the way they live in the real life
1,i do not think that the film is so good but it,i was n't sure why the hell was n't so much
1,eventually he 's a man in a hospital and is forced to leave and start with a man in a suit that he,eventually he is a very good actor who is a good actor and has a great voice to play in his films
1,regardless of this i do n't have the patience of,regardless of the plot the movie is very entertaining
1,so the movie is about a man trying his luck in a world war ii and his family,so if the movie had a good plot and the acting was so bad it would n't have helped
1,granger is the best actor of all times,granger and dunne are a pair of characters who
1,the story of the story is a bit of fun,the film is about a man who is trying to get

1,historically correct as an example of the film 's history and history,historically the film has an interesting plot and a great cast
1,aboard the train station is an excellent movie,aboard the other hand the film 's main character

1,now this was a very good film but i was not,now that 's a little bit too much for it
1,though it is a very good movie it is not a movie,though it 's not that bad it 's still a great one
1,frankly i do n't think this was a great,frankly it was a waste for the film
1,i was so bored by the story and characters,i have seen the movie multiple many times before and
1,oh and a lot more than the movie 's plot the acting the acting and overall the movie is a total bore from start to finish,oh yes i know that 's the only thing i can remember from this movie and i have to admit that i am not going through the
1,but it was not the first time we saw a woman 's body in this movie that she was,but the story was a little too thin and the characters were just too stupid to be true
1,the movie starts out with a bunch of friends who are in a car crash,the acting and directing was superb and the direction by the director was great and the
1,it is a great movie to watch,it 's not a bad movie
1,whereas it is a good film i have seen it several more times and i still love it more than i can imagine it 's a very good movie,whereas i have to admit that i was n't impressed by the fact that this film was made on a shoestring budget i could only give it a zero
1,the film 's plot is a little weak and the ending was predictable but it was a great movie to watch for a couple,the movie has some good acting in the cast which is a pity because the story is so bad it 's almost painful
1,cliffhanger has been done before but the fact remains that it,cliffhanger was the first time i ever heard of it
1,season 4 is one that is worth watching,season 3 is a classic example of why the

1,its a very funny film that i would n't want to see if it had a,its a very good film with a good story good actors good story great acting
1,the film is a very good example of the kind i 've seen and that 's not the case,the film has an excellent soundtrack and a great score that is not to be taken from the film
1,momma is an interesting and very funny movie,momma is a very good film with a lot
1,a lot of the scenes are filmed,a lot more than i expected
1,i was expecting a movie to watch this movie,i have to admit i was n't impressed
1,zap ventura 's performance was also excellent,zap 's father is the best of all
1,catherine deneuve plays an ambitious woman with an attitude for a married husband who has been,catherine deneuve as a woman and her husband as the mother is very well portrayed
1,another thing that makes me laugh is the ending,another thing that is missing is the acting and the
1,and the ending where he was in the movie was a good idea,and the acting was horrible the script was horrible the acting is bad
1,but i have to say that this is a great movie that i will definitely watch again,but this movie is so bad it makes you feel like you 've wasted a hundred dollars on
1,both are a good movie and i do n't want them,both films have a very good cast and are great
1,there was a lot going around here,there are some very funny moments
1,it is not the worst of all,it is not a bad film
1,and i do n't think that it is,and it is a very nice movie
1,it has a very good cast and it is a great film,it 's a very bad thing that this is not a movie for
1,great acting great acting and a story line that is not only a comedy,great film and good acting great story good acting good music a good script good
1,and i do n't think that it is so bad it 's funny it was just a waste of time,and it was n't that good either i would have liked it if i had a little bit of fun with
1,honestly it 's a good movie to watch,honestly the movie is not as bad as the
1,despite being a little too talky it 's still pretty funny too,despite being the first of the two films to be released on vhs
1,the story of the movie is a bit,the film has an odd plot line
1,nobody has ever been so inclined to do anything,nobody seems interested to be able to make a good
1,i was expecting a lot more than i did but i did n't like the movie,i was so bored by this movie that it was hard not only for the first hour
1,i'm not sure whether this is intentional or not as a comedy but as a comedy it has a lot more,i'm not sure if i am not a good person and i do not understand how the story is told
1,of course there are no more than one person who has a good sense,of this is how it is done with a great cast of characters
1,for those of you unfamiliar in the 80 's,for me this was a very funny movie
1,rani dixit has a small role but she does n't have the same,rani silverstone was good and i thought she had the best role
1,he is a man who has been in love,he is a very talented man with his own unique
1,my friend is a fan of the show but it,my favorite scene involves the scene with the woman
1,a good example of the genre 's,a lot happens to be seen
1,cinderella is the one that has the ability to make a living,cinderella 's mother is a great movie that is not for the kids
1,but it 's not a bad movie it is n't,but the movie is n't as good as the first two
1,the movie was a bit of an,the film is a complete mess
1,kelly is a great actor and is very good in the role he is given and he 's a great actor in the,kelly is a great actress and she is very good in it and is the only real standout character of all time
1,this is a very very bad attempt by,this was an interesting movie to watch
1,elsewhere the movie has a lot of good,elsewhere it is a very good movie
1,you can tell that this movie was made on an budget and it was made in,you can watch the movie with the lights and it is not a bad thing
1,after all the film has been made for tv and the,after all the movie is about a woman 's life
1,i was surprised at the end when the movie was released,i have never read the original novel or read the books but
1,rather it is the worst thing i 've seen,rather the film is not a documentary about the war
1,but this is not a good film and the acting is not good at the time,but it is a great movie and i think the movie is very good in its own
1,asoka is a great film that i think is an absolute mustsee for all of,asoka is one such a great film and it is the best of all
1,if you want to make something like this i think you 're not missing out to the contrary,if it was a little bit more of an old movie i would have been surprised by the story
1,i have never heard a movie before but this one was so awful,i was so excited that the movie ended up being so boring
1,that is what the film is about,that 's what makes this film so good
1,most of the movie 's characters and events were altered and the ending was just a bit too abrupt,most of the film is about a woman who has been killed and has a crush on her
1,i think that the best part in this movie is the fact that they do not even get to see a movie,i do agree but the movie is so good that i do not know where the film was filmed and it was n't
1,its the best of the series,its a very bad movie but it
1,instead the movie takes a turn for something like the characters in the first half,instead of the usual suspects of the world we have no idea what to do with
1,even the acting was n't that bad either,even the music is n't very well chosen to
1,here 's the spoiler i was n't sure why i watched this movie so,here we have a film about the lives between the two main players
1,seagal is a great actor who is n't the only actor in this movie that makes me want a movie,seagal is a good actor but he does have some good lines and a great deal to work on
1,if i had n't seen the movie i would n't even bother renting this film,if you have a choice for a film you can appreciate the fact that the story
1,in a movie that has a good story line the,in the end the movie ends with a bang
1,watching this film is a must see,watching this movie i was a bit skeptical
1,if you 're looking for something like that i would n't be surprised,if you are a fan you will probably like this one but if your
1,it 's the only way this film can get even more enjoyable,it 's just a bad film and it does not work
1,also a very funny scene where he is talking about a woman in,also the scene where he is in the bar with the girl
1,the film is a very good film and it 's a shame that the film is n't as great as this film,the acting is very bad and i do think this was a very bad movie that was n't even worth the effort
1,my favorite scene is when he dances up to a tree and the girl says,my favorite part was that the movie was made in the early 90 's
1,but it does n't have to do with the rest and,but the film is a complete mess of the original
1,both films are very good and are not,both films are a lot of fun
1,and the movie is a little over done and a good one but the film,and it does not take a long to realize how the movie was made
1,while i do not know why the film is so bad it 's a disgrace to a movie,while this movie was made in the us i was expecting a good film with a lot more than
1,every time i see the movie it,every scene is a little overdone
1,in the movie the main character 's father is killed,in a nutshell this is a very funny film with a
1,no it 's a good movie to watch,no one could ever accuse the director to make
1,filmgoers who have seen the film have a lot more to say than,filmgoers who have n't watched the movie are either missing or reedited
1,the acting was terrible the directing was terrible the editing was awful the special effects are awful the special effects were bad the special effects were awful the,the movie was made in the seventies but the film is very slow and the characters do nothing to dispel their motivations or their motivations and motivations
1,it 's not a bad movie but the acting is good enough and the acting was excellent the writing and direction was great,it was so bad that it could n't even be called a bad movie and it was n't even worth a dollar ticket
1,jessica alba plays the part of the mother who is a,jessica tandy plays the mother who has a heart attack
1,most of the actors are good and the plot line is pretty solid for a horror flick,most of the movie consists of various elements of the movie and the plot is a little confusing
1,i was so excited when i saw this,i have never read the original novel but i
1,toby and dave is a good movie but it,toby is a young man with his wife
1,it has the same kind to the movie and the characters are well developed to say their own,it is the best movie of its genre and is one of the most underrated films of the year
1,i do not recommend this for anyone looking for a movie to sit,i do think it 's the funniest movie i have ever watched
1,the film is a very interesting one,the movie is a complete mess
1,with this movie i have a feeling that the movie is not the best,with the exception that he has been in his own for the most part the
1,it 's a shame because the movie is n't really worth watching,it has a lot of good moments and it has some good points
1,you can tell that the director and writer were trying too much to make a film about a guy who 's been kidnapped by his,you know that the film has been a lot better than the average hollywood film and it 's hard not for the first two
1,a lot like the movie i saw the last 15 minutes of,a good cast of characters and the plot was very interesting
1,leonard nimoy was great as the villain,leonard maltin has a great talent for this
1,russ tamblyn plays a young man in the middle of a crowded car crash,russ meyer is the only one in the film who can act as a villain
1,as a result of a movie this one is just plain awful with no real plot,as a result i was a fan that was the only way i could have seen this
1,do yourself a favour avoid this movie,do yourself a big favor and skip it
1,she 's the only person that has,she has to be a woman
1,well the movie is not a bad film but i would,well i do not know how to describe the movie
1,if you have a craving for a movie that is not only a good idea for a movie it 's,if the movie is a good one you can tell that it has the potential of a good story
1,the film was shot on location in new york city,the movie was shot on location in the same year as
1,i think it 's a good idea to get a good film out there,i have n't seen this film in my life since i was in the theater
1,produced to be a film that is not a masterpiece or an interesting story or even a drama it has to be,produced to be a film that is a must have been a fan of any of the actors and the story
1,not only does he have to have his own hands but the film has the feel,not that i have any idea how this film could have made a good story
1,a good film with a very interesting plot,a lot of the film was filmed on video
1,this is the worst film ever made,this is a very bad show
1,there is a very funny line between the two,there was no real plot and no plot
1,the story of this story is about two people who have a relationship together and are married to their mother,the story is about two people who go to a house to find a new home in their home where their
1,the story of a young woman who,the movie has some great moments
1,he 's a very good actor and he 's a great actor,he is a great character and is a great actor and i love
1,it has a very good cast but it is n't a good movie,it 's a shame because the movie is n't really a movie
1,there are some funny moments but it 's,there was no plot to this movie
1,and it 's a shame that it is,and i was impressed by the story
1,carey 's character is a caricature of the film 's own but he,carey 's acting was so bad that i was laughing hysterically hard
1,it is a movie about the holocaust of life,it 's a shame that this movie did have some
1,the film was made for tv and,the movie is a complete bore
1,while the plot is somewhat original there is a lot more to the story,while it 's true that the story is not as bad it is very very
1,some of the acting was good but the script was so awful that i felt like it had a,some of these movies do n't make sense but it was fun seeing them in a different light
1,at the end of the film there are a bunch of interesting,at least it 's a good movie and a good movie
1,maybe he was just the one who did n't care much for him and he,maybe the film is just about the only thing i can think of that
1,i was so impressed when i heard that it would be a great movie,i think that the director should be commended to the director to give us the
1,it is not a movie that you,it 's a very simple movie
1,jean gabin is a fine actor and the rest is a bit stiff,jean gabin is a great actress and the acting in the film was very
1,this is the best movie i 've ever,this is the best of his career
1,the movie is a bit slow and slow,the movie was shot with the same budget and
1,i think that 's why i gave the film a 2 for a very good reason,i have never been a fan of any of his movies but this was a great one
1,tv series is a very interesting film,tv has a very good story and is
1,although the movie has a few moments of unintentional humor it is still funny,although i was impressed by the acting i found myself asking myself what was that
1,boring and pointless and not worth watching if you are a fan or you have n't,boring plot twists are not enough to make me want a refund to be made
1,so if i had the chance it would have been better,so if i had n't been able for the most part to
1,experiences and the other is one of those who have the audacity to make an appearance in the story and the,experiences and the fact that the film was made in the early 80 's was a bit of a stretch
1,the acting was good and i was able into this movie,the acting is horrible the story is worse the dialogue is worse
1,burton 's performance is also a good one and a bit of an,burton is a great actor but he has a very bad role
1,after seeing the trailer for a new version of a film i,after all it 's the best thing in a good movie
1,not only is it a great show but the actors who have a good time making this show,not only does it look like it is made in a very cheap way it looks pretty cheap but
1,i think this is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who loves action movies,i have n't laughed once and i was very impressed to find that the movie was not a
1,it was a good idea and the movie is a great example to see,it 's not a movie about an evil killer who has a crush in his
1,whoever wrote a comment should be appalled by,whoever wrote this movie should be banned
1,the acting is pretty good and the story lines were very entertaining,the story line was a little confusing but the movie is a bit
1,of the few movies i had seen the first one,of all things this movie is a total waste
1,what i did like was how this movie was released theatrically,what i did n't realize was that the director did so much
1,i was surprised by the fact that the movie was made in a small budget,i have to say that it 's one of those shows that is so funny and
1,the movie was n't so bad that i could n't believe the hype,the movie is about the man who is a loner who is a man
1,but i was n't expecting to see this one,but the real problem with this movie are the acting
1,this film was a waste of time and i have seen worse in my time it has,this movie is a great example of a good film and it has some great moments
1,towards one moment the film is shot with no real sense of what is happening,towards the end when the movie is over and over and over and over and over
1,other than that i would say it 's a very good movie,other than that the plot was pretty weak but the acting and the
1,its a shame that the film did not get released theatrically on dvd as well because it was a little too much for my liking,its not a bad film and the actors who play their roles are not very convincing and they do n't seem to be acting
1,how can you make a sequel with a good cast,how did they manage to get a movie that is so
1,abandoned in his own world he is able for revenge and the world he 's been experiencing,abandoned in his own life and in his life he is the most powerful person of our time
1,you 'll never know what the hell was that,you can tell that the film is not a comedy
1,as a result it 's a little bit too slow,as a movie this is a very bad movie
1,the movie is about as much of the same as a real movie,the movie was a little slow but the ending was very good and the
1,congrats to the director for putting the,congrats for the actors and actresses
1,the acting in the other two was pretty good,the story of the movie was a little too thin
1,i was expecting this to be a good movie but the,i have seen the film numerous times in my life
1,it was so stupid and so boring that i had no interest,it was so stupid that it made the movie a bit more interesting
1,the acting is good the plot is a,the film is a very good film
1,i do not recommend this film,i think that 's why this film
1,the film is about two women who live,the acting in this movie was horrible
1,like a lot to think that the director was the most talented filmmaker of the last ten minutes or a few seconds of,like the first movie it 's a little more of a drama than a horror movie and the ending is pretty predictable
1,i was surprised to learn that the story of the film is about the importance of life,i do n't think that this movie is the most original film ever to be made
1,there is no real explanation for the,there 's no reason for it
1,let 's face this movie the story line was a bit weak,let 's get back on track the film is a total disaster and
1,the story is a little thin but the movie has a lot of good things happening and it 's not a good,the acting in the first movie was so good i was surprised that the movie had been released in the uk
1,his performance as a character is so overthetop that it becomes annoying,his character is a stereotype who has been a loner and he is
1,even if the movie was n't bad it,even the music is n't as good
1,anyway i have n't read it,anyway i have a soft spot on
1,one of the most underrated movies i have seen,one thing is to say the least of it
1,scorsese 's the thing he 's a great actor and is also the most recognizable character,scorsese is the master of this film and the film does n't have any of the elements
1,the acting is good the script was good but,the story is very simple and very simple
1,all i know about this film was that it was a little bit,all the while the movie is set in the middle of nowhere
1,now i have seen the first one,now i have seen this movie and i'm
1,the story was a lot of fun but not enough for me,the story of the movie and it 's a little bit complicated but
1,this movie is a must for anyone with a sense for a,this is a film for the lovers of the late forties
1,for me i have a feeling of disgust for the director and the director and the director,for the first half of the movie the acting is superb and there are a few good moments
1,so if i had to give it a zero because the acting was horrible,so the film goes nowhere and it is not even a good movie
1,guiness is a fine actor and the rest of the cast is excellent and i do n't know why i never heard of this movie,guiness was a bit of a loser in a movie that was a bit more than a comedy but it 's not a good movie
1,interesting to see the movie is not as good,interesting and interesting and i do n't think that it
1,it 's not even that funny to watch,it has the most interesting character of the entire
1,shortly afterwards the film begins with some of a sudden meeting in the middle of the film and then we get,shortly afterwards he is a young man in a small provincial city in the early 1930s and early 1900 another
1,slander is an excellent piece of film noir and it has the potential to be the first,slander of the plot was that the movie was shot with the lighting of a car
1,after a while you realize the movie is a comedy,after seeing it i could n't help to get to the
1,in fact it is not even worth the time,in a way it is a great show
1,to make matters worse the acting was horrible and,to be honest the film is very good
1,he 's just not as convincing as a character who 's,he 's a very talented actor and a great actor
1,i do n't know if the director,i was n't impressed by it
1,but the film 's biggest flaw are that they,but the film is a little too long
1,i have to admit i was impressed by the movie,i think the movie 's main flaw is the fact that
1,jessica biel 's character has the same role as her sister,jessica alba plays the daughter who is the only person to be
1,an interesting story about a young girl who moves away,an interesting film and an excellent movie for anyone
1,before this is the only movie that has the potential of the original and it is not a movie,before i wrap up this i have the displeasure of watching a film with the same director and director
1,ok i do not know why i have to say it was the worst film i have watched in a while and i'm not going as far as i'm concerned,ok i do not think that this is one of the best movies of the year it is a great film and a good one for those of us
1,i think this is one of those,i think it is a shame
1,people who have n't been in the movie business should be warned,people who do n't know the difference between them but i have no
1,near the same time he has a very difficult task of finding out who the killer was,near the end of this film i thought it was a very poor movie and i would say
1,but the movie has a good cast,but the film 's plot is not as
1,not only is he a very good character he 's a very good guy who can,not only does the film have an interesting message but it is also quite entertaining
1,slowpaced is a good example for the movie 's,slowpaced is the only thing that i liked
1,it is not the best of all the movies i can say but it has a few good moments but it 's not that,it 's the story of a girl in a mental hospital who is trying to get her son to go to a school
1,the movie is about as bad in a movie like that,the movie was a bit too long and the ending was too
1,a very funny film that is not only for its visual value,a few years back i have a 35mm video of the show
1,reporter and the girl is a very good movie,reporter sam raimi is an excellent actor and he 's
1,and it is not a bad movie to watch and enjoy but,and i have to say that the movie is very good
1,this is one of those movies that i can only watch because of the bad acting the bad directing or anything,this is a movie for the whole generation of people that do n't have a lot of fun watching this
1,this is a movie for everyone who loves the book but it was a waste of my time,this film is a complete waste of time and money and time to waste your life on it and
1,the movie is a little slow paced and very,the film is a little bit too long
1,grease was one of the best films ever and i have never been able for,grease is a movie that will appeal to everyone who likes a good movie
1,4 the story of the girl is a little weak,4 a group that was in a car accident
1,well this was a very good movie,well i have n't seen this movie yet
1,the film has no redeeming features,the acting and direction were very good
1,the movie is about a man named sam a young boy and his,the movie was a waste and i was surprised to find it
1,the film was shot in the early seventies,the story was n't very bad but the acting
1,however the film is a bit slow at first,however the movie is a complete waste of time
1,i have n't seen the first movie but the original was a great one and i liked it,i have to say the film has a good deal of humor to it that is not only for
1,but this is a great film,but it was not a good film
1,this movie was a total disappointment to,this movie is not for everyone
1,all in the same way the actors were in the movie,all in all it 's a great movie that is a must
1,the acting is good and the direction is great,the film is a little slow paced with some really
1,bruce willis is the only one to come close to being the most likable and interesting and he 's a very good character,bruce dern plays a character who is not only an action hero but a very likable character and is a likable character
1,wonderful film about the holocaust and a,wonderful performances and the story lines
1,rita jovovich 's character is a bit,rita hayworth was a great character
1,the story is about a young boy who,the film has a lot to say
1,the film has no redeeming qualities to any one of the other,the acting is horrible and i have n't even mentioned it
1,if it had n't made it for the first ten min i would have been able into it and it would be better,if you 're going through the events in the first half you will find a lot more than just a bunch of other movies
1,it 's not that the story is,it 's a very good movie
1,this movie is one to see,this movie is so bad it hurts
1,based on the novel by john carpenter it has the same plot a good cast an intriguing story and an intriguing plot line that makes it interesting,based on a play by the author of the famous novel the film was written by a man named john a man in the same cloth as he
1,the film is not about the war but about a,the acting is horrible the story line is awful
1,this was the worst movie ever to have graced,this movie was so awful it was funny
1,as a result of the fact that it has the same plot as a typical hollywood formula it is a film that has a lot,as a fan i have to admit that the film is a little too long and i think it 's a very good thing
1,the film has a very good story and,the movie is a very interesting one
1,i think the film is a very good film and,i think that the best part was the ending
1,5 the acting is n't that great either,5 the acting in this is pretty poor the
1,lame acting bad acting bad directing bad,lame acting bad script terrible direction
1,i'm a huge fan and i do applaud the movie for the fact this movie sucks,i'm not saying that i am so disgusted that i have seen it in a movie theater
1,mccool 's is the only one that can make you smile,mccool has a lot of potential to make it and it 's
1,now that the film is going on the way i think that it was the worst film ever,now that i have seen it i have a hard time figuring out what it was about but i
1,i think the reason why the director was n't interested in,i was expecting a great story and i was surprised
1,general tilney is the only reason why i,general tanz is a very good film
1,it 's just a bad movie that 's a little too long for the mst3k version,it 's a shame to see a movie like that in this movie and it 's not
1,it was a good idea to make an interesting film but,it 's just so bad it 's good to me
1,the acting was horrible the directing is awful,the story of the film is a bit confusing
1,a very good film with excellent acting and good,a good cast is wasted on this one
1,2 the movie has a very good cast but the script does n't seem to be that interesting either,2 the acting is n't bad but i did n't think it was the script or the direction
1,it 's just not the same thing,it 's a very simple movie with the
1,so if you want to see a movie about an airplane in a country,so what do you expect from an independent film that is so bad
1,like the other reviewer i 've seen this one,like many other reviewers here have mentioned this movie is
1,however the film is n't so bad it is n't good,however i think the movie has been a lot better since the
1,based in the same vein the movie was made for the sole purpose of the first movie,based in the real life story of the famous american family the story of a man who is
1,the film has a very interesting story and is n't really a good film but the performances and direction,the movie was a waste of my favorites and i would have to say that i was disappointed
1,if you 're going to get a good laugh at the movie then,if i were n't that i would be able to overlook that
1,this film was not a complete waste but it certainly was worth the time to watch it,this movie has a lot of action and it 's not a bad movie but it is n't
1,the movie was a waste and i did not like the movie for the story,the movie was a little slow but the story was very good the characters were well
1,he was a little too busy trying,he is not a good actor
1,my friend and i were both laughing hysterically at how bad the movie was,my friend was in the movie and i was n't impressed at the same level
1,i think it 's a good movie,i think the reason why i gave this
1,people who have n't read the book should read the books and see,people who have seen this film are not sure who it is
1,but the film is a very good and entertaining movie,but it is not a movie that you 'll watch over
1,the film is a bit slow and drags out too slowly to be a thriller,the film is a bit slow moving and the plot is n't that bad either
1,beethoven was the only character who seemed like a good guy,beethoven is not as much an action hero as he is in
1,to me that is the reason for watching this movie is that it is a very good movie,to be fair i have n't seen it since the first movie i saw in the theater and i
1,i was n't really expecting much but it was n't that great to begin with,i do not think the director should be allowed to write an essay for the movie
1,suddenly the film is about a man trying to find a job for,suddenly the film becomes a big hit and the film ends abruptly
1,maybe i missed it but i think that is why i did n't like it,maybe it is the director 's fault to the point of view of a movie
1,there 's also a very good scene where the hero 's character is revealed to,there 's a lot going on here that 's the point of this movie
1,while the story is n't too original i do not think that the film is a masterpiece of the genre,while the film is a bit slow paced and the plot has some holes there was a lot to be learned
1,some people say this is a good show,some of them are not as good
1,as a result i was a little disappointed in this,as a result the movie has a lot more to offer
1,it 's a shame that the movie is n't as much of a comedy as it 's an attempt,it is not a film that will be seen by anyone with an appreciation for film making and the most
1,he 's just a guy with a lot to live,he 's a good actor but his character was so annoying
1,matt damon and the rest of the crew are just plain,matt damon plays the character who is a real cowboy
1,only the first half is the same,only a few people will be able to
1,the film has no redeeming features whatsoever,the story line was good but the characters
1,so what if you can find a better movie,so if i were to make an elaborate movie i
1,silly and stupid the first time i watched this movie i was a bit frightened,silly and pointless but the movie does a great disservice to its subject matter
1,it has the same kind of humor that i think the first two,it has a very good ending but it is not a movie
1,all in all it has a good plot and good acting but this film has a few good parts but it 's just a boring movie with,all the actors were very bad and the story was just stupid the characters were n't believable and the plot line had a lot of holes
1,i was expecting the same to be a great show,i think that it is a shame that the film has
1,13 years later the movie 's only purpose is to entertain and confuse,13 out of 4 stars but not enough to keep you watching
1,i do n't know how this got a pg rating,i think it 's a shame because the story is so
1,but the movie is so boring it 's not even funny it 's just,but this is a film that should have been released in the us
1,the movie is a very interesting one,the story is simple but it is n't
1,frankly the film was a waste,frankly the movie is n't as bad
1,i have n't read a lot that the movie,i was so excited when it came out
1,over the course of this film we see the young man 's struggle for his life and how he has been in love with him in the past and how he,over the course of this film there is an odd and unnecessary scene that will make you jump and the ending will probably be a bit too abrupt for me
1,there 's a bit to like here but it is n't a great movie either,there are many many things in the movie that i did n't like about this show
1,lieutenant is a man who is trying his own business and is a very rich man with,lieutenant is a man in the army who has a small part as a young girl
1,an excellent film and a must watch,an excellent film with great performances from the
1,as a matter there are a few good things about the movie but the acting is,as a result the film has no plot and it just does n't make sense
1,it was the best movie ever,it 's a shame that the film
1,this is one movie you do not want to miss out of and i do n't want to see it again and i will never forget that it was made,this is not a film that is a complete waste of your time and a complete lack of a better plot and a better storyline than the average hollywood movie
1,and i do think this is a great movie for everyone to see,and the movie is a bit too slow for a movie like the matrix
1,i do n't understand why the film is so good and so much of it is not that it 's just a bit slow,i was surprised to see that the first film was a bit of a disappointment but it was a great movie to watch
1,well i have to admit that it was the best movie ever made,well this was one of the best movies i 've ever seen
1,ok so this film was a bit,ok i do n't know why
1,in the first part we are treated a series of bizarre events that make no difference,in fact the film is not as bad but it is not a good film and it
1,to be honest the acting in this movie,to me it is a great movie
1,i was so bored by this movie that you could n't help it,i do agree with the reviewer that the movie does n't have a single
1,the acting in the other is good but the story and acting are so bad that it 's difficult to make it,the story is about a young girl who is a woman who wants a child and she 's been married to her
1,this film is not for those who want to be,this is a very good and very entertaining film
1,all the characters are likable and likable,all the while this movie has a lot
1,in fact the film is a little too slow and too predictable,in a nutshell the film was a little too much of an insult
1,brady 's performance is very good,brady is a good actor but i
1,mental health has been done in a way or two,mental capacity are the most interesting things to come out of
1,by the time the movie ends we 're left,by far the best of it 's kind
1,and the acting in this film is so good it 's almost as if the,and i do n't know what the hell was going wrong with this movie
1,a lot of people are talking about the story and it is n't a good idea,a very interesting story with a strong message about how the world of the war is going
1,the movie starts off with the first one being the same as in the first movie,the acting in all this is good but the plot is so bad that it is impossible
1,first of the first two seasons of season 1 the story of the series is a bit different and the series is n't a good episode,first of all the movie is not about the story of the characters or their motivations or actions and the events in which the characters interact
1,get it right now and then it 's just another movie,get to the bottom and you 'll find a new version of
1,haig has to have the best lines in the movie and the film does n't make a lick of sense and i think that the director should have,haig is an intelligent man and his mother who 's been kidnapped by a man in a mental institution is a very good idea for a movie
1,i was surprised to see that the film was a success,i was surprised to discover that the director was trying hard to
1,seeing the movie is an excellent experience and i hope that it will end soon,seeing this movie was like watching paint grow and the devil 's rain in the same
1,the movie is about a group of people who have been living,the film 's main flaw is to have a few laughs
1,additionally it 's not that bad it is n't,additionally the film is not a good movie
1,the movie was shot on location,the story is very good and it
1,after a long shot of the car the two,after a while the movie is a mess
1,by the third act it was n't that bad either but it was n't bad,by far the worst thing about that was that it did not even have any of
1,do not waste my money on this movie,do you think the movie is supposed to have
1,the movie is a complete waste,the story is a bit slow but
1,it 's just a bad film and i ca,it has a very funny and funny scene
1,second of course i was n't impressed,second the acting is pretty awful
1,are we supposed that the people in it are,are they all that really really really bad
1,as i 've said this movie is not the worst movie i 've ever seen but,as a movie it is not a great one but it is a great movie
1,i was expecting something like this to,i do not recommend this movie
1,to be fair there 's a lot going,to me it 's just another film
1,it is n't a movie that is,it 's a very funny movie
1,so if you 're looking at a horror movie,so what if it were a good thing
1,although the film has an interesting premise the characters are very well done and are all believable,although the movie is about a man who is trying and tries hard on his luck it is
1,the movie is very slow moving and,the movie is about a bunch
1,i have n't seen it so i do,i do not think that this was intended as
1,sure it 's a bit of an attempt to,sure it is a little bit too long
1,is that the only thing that makes it,is this the worst movie of 2008
1,kind of like the first movie,kind of an old fashioned and the
1,this is one of my favorite tv movies and i have,this movie is a complete waste of time to watch
1,it 's a shame because the plot is a bit thin and predictable,it 's a very simple and funny show with the most famous cast members
1,they are the only people in the world who are n't,they were all very well cast and i was impressed
1,as for the story it is a very good one,as for the acting it 's a good thing to say
1,these are the two things i did n't understand,these are not a bunch or two of the other
1,once the film started to drag it was just plain boring,once you get past this you have to be a sucker for
1,this movie is so bad i could not bear it but it was a total flop and i could n't stop laughing,this was a movie that i would n't watch if it was on tv and the movie was just plain stupid and i
1,instead it is an interesting story and a great one as is it 's a very very very very very funny film with a lot of laughs,instead it has some of the worst acting i 've ever heard in a movie and it 's the only reason i even considered it a 9
1,death is the worst film in my collection but it 's not that great either,death bed was the first movie i saw that i saw as an example for myself
1,why do n't we just do n't get,why do i give this a 1
1,the story is simple enough but the story is n't as bad and the actors are all good,the story is very interesting and it is a great family film with a strong story line
1,he is also in a wheelchair of the same cloth that is,he is also the only one that is able to survive
1,it is a shame because the film does n't have much of a plot,it is not even a film it was a waste of my money
1,and it 's not a good thing,and that was the only way to make
1,something like this happened when the movie started to drag,something about the film is that it is the first movie
1,she is also the only person that is a bit too much and her,she is not only an actress she 's just a little too cute
1,this movie is so awful it 's funny to see,this was the first time he appeared in the movie and
1,the film has a very interesting plot,the movie has an allstar actor and it
1,it has the same effect on the characters as well,it 's a shame that the movie did n't get more
1,though this was a very bad show it 's still a very entertaining movie,though i was expecting something more than the usual hollywood blockbuster i 'd say this
1,but the film is not about a group,but this is a movie about the real life
1,i do n't know how to describe this film but,i do n't understand the appeal for this movie
1,it 's just a bunch of kids who have no talent,it has the best of all the great actors and actresses
1,hmmm this is the most boring film i 've watched,hmmm the movie does n't have a good cast
1,this was the best movie of the 90 's that i had seen,this movie is so awful that the viewer will laugh at every joke and
1,regardless of this film 's plot is a bit too long,regardless the movie is a little too slow and slow for the
1,and the acting is n't bad at all but the story,and the acting in the movie is just plain bad
1,the film has some of the funniest lines i,the film has a lot of good points
1,the film was shot in a very small budget and it was shot in a small location,the story is simple and it 's a bit of an adventure to the point of the story
1,the acting was horrible the directing awful,the story is a complete mess
1,a lot of people have commented on the film,a lot of things are happening in the movie
1,after all this was a great show for me,after seeing the movie i thought the movie is very
1,the acting was terrible the directing is poor the directing is worse than anything i 've,the story was very weak but it was a good movie and it was fun
1,you have a very good movie that will be,you know what to do with the story
1,one of the best films of its kind that has,one of the best movies of the last decade
1,as for the film itself it has a very very very very very bad soundtrack but that is,as a result of a few films the movie has no sense of reality or purpose whatsoever
1,katt is a great actor who plays a very good,katt is one of the worst movies of all
1,always there is an interesting story and the characters,always the worst movie i 've ever watched
1,the story of the kelly brothers is a classic and it 's easy for me to,the film is about a young man trying to find out who his father is
1,the film has a very strong plot and a good cast,the acting was n't bad but the plot was n't really bad
1,if i was a kid i would n't have been a little more surprised by the film and,if you 're looking for something that 's not bad enough you 'll be bored and bored
1,nearly everything about it makes me want to watch this film for,nearly all of these are the same people in the movie
1,instead of being a little bit of an old man it is,instead it has a very weak plot and an interesting premise
1,a lot of the movie is a bit too long,a few years after this one was released i saw it
1,i think that the movie is a little bit too short but i found it very enjoyable,i think that the best of the movie was that the film was n't as much a comedy
1,so what if the film is n't bad it is n't that,so the film was a complete failure of the first movie
1,i think it 's not a good film,i have n't read the manga but it is
1,what is the deal of the relationship,what 's the point in this movie
1,it is n't a good idea for a movie,it 's not a bad movie but the acting and
1,seeking to avenge it for a long time,seeking to get out the door and get rid
1,but the film does a great disservice of making it,but the film has the best of the three
1,ratings to a few of those who are willing to,ratings 1 the movie itself is not very bad
1,unfortunately the story line and acting is very poor,unfortunately the film is a complete waste of film
1,the film was shot in black and the film 's color,the story line was good and the acting was good
1,gosh i was n't expecting a good film,gosh the story was a little weak
1,it 's the story of a man trying to find out who his friends are,it is not a film that is not for everyone but a good movie
1,a lot of the film is shot in,a few of the characters are good
1,edna has a great deal of time,edna 's character is so unlikable
1,something like the original the exorcist and the grudge,something about a man who is a little more than
1,the film is very well done,the film was shot in color and
1,to make this a good movie it 's not a good film,to make matters even less ridiculous the film 's plot becomes a convoluted
1,so if the movie is really really bad it 's the only way i could have done it better,so i have to say that this is a very good film and i think i 've enjoyed it
1,this' is a film of a movie that does n't seem to be a real movie it 's a movie about an evil and unfriendly man who is,this' is the most important aspect in this movie and the acting is excellent as the story is set in motion and the characters are all over
1,yes i have n't laughed so many times but it was just that bad,yes it 's a bit slow and the acting is n't bad either
1,not only does it have the most memorable scene ever filmed in the film but also the film is a complete mess,not only is the acting bad but the actors are n't really bad and it makes the movie unwatchable even more
1,this is a film that is n't even worth watching as,this is a very bad movie and a complete mess
1,of this type the film has a very good cast,of the few movies of the same genre i have n't
1,outside of the fact that it 's a great movie it does,outside a film with the same title a woman is killed
1,we 're supposed for the same guy who 's the hero and his wife who is also a reporter,we 're told that the story is not a good one but the movie has its own unique moments
1,the movie is a very funny movie and a lot of people have to watch,the film was shot with no imagination and was a bit of a stretch
1,another problem is that the movie is n't a comedy,another thing that is so bad was how much the acting
1,last and then i saw the movie and it,last but still not that it was n't
1,the movie is very well done,the story is very simple but it
1,i'm not sure if i was watching a movie but the acting is pretty awful the,i'm not sure why the film is a bit of an insult to the book
1,ca only have a good story but it is still,ca only have the same name as the first
1,this movie is a great movie,this movie is a great film for
1,lucas is the most interesting and intelligent character in the film and it is his performance that makes it so believable,lucas 's character in this movie was a bit of an idiot who has no idea of what happened and who he
1,he is a very funny actor but i do n't think he has done a decent performance as a villain who is not a bad actor but,he is the only person who can make it through this movie that has a few lines and a few lines but the film is not
1,considering that the story of a woman in love with a married lady who was,considering the fact that it was made for television it would have been better
1,i was so bored by the movie,i do not recommend watching the movie
1,first off the movie was not very good and i was expecting something better to watch,first off i was n't a fan like me but it is n't that good
1,patricia arquette plays the young woman who 's been kidnapped,patricia clarkson is a delight in her performance but she does
1,the film is a complete mess of a show,the film is about a young man who has his
1,don cheadle was a very talented director and the cast is great,don knotts plays the role of a very wealthy and humble man
1,in the first part of a series of events he 's a young,in this case he is the most beautiful woman of her generation
1,i'm not sure if it would end up as a comedy but if the director had a serious sense for,i'm not a fan of the original but i have a feeling that this movie has no redeeming qualities
1,this film was made by the esteemed director 's first movie and is,this is the kind that the film has a very low budget
1,the story of this movie is a complete mess with a capital of a plot and a plot that 's not even,the story was so weak that it could n't even be described as an insult to the viewer to the audience
1,this film was made for the sake that this is,this was the best movie i have ever seen
1,it 's not the most original film but it does have a good deal of humour in,it 's a shame that the director of this film never got a theatrical dvd release
1,when the film was shot in color i found myself wishing that the director could have made a better movie,when i first read the comments on the imdb page for this movie i thought i had to read some reviews
1,however the film is very entertaining and the,however the movie is not a comedy
1,if the movie had had a decent story line and a few actors who could 've played a straight part,if you want to see a film that will leave you with the feeling you should watch this movie
1,i do think the movie is a bit too long and i think that 's why,i do think it was one that was n't even close in any other way
1,a lot of the scenes in the movie are very well done,a few of them are not so good they 're all so funny
1,after seeing this i can tell you that it has a very,after the movie i thought it was a pretty cool movie
1,as a result the film has a lot to do to make the viewer feel,as the story unfolds we are left with an almost unrecognizable feeling of emptiness
1,another thing that bothered the film was the acting and,another problem was the ending and ending the story
1,did anyone know how the director was going,did anyone ever want the money back
1,but it 's not a good movie and,but this movie is just plain awful
1,bunuel is a genius and he does not disappoint,bunuel has created some of his best films and he
1,i do not think that this film is the best in terms for the fact it has,i have to wonder how the director could have been so much better with this movie
1,hazel 's performance is so bad she makes it difficult to believe she is a good actress and she is,hazel clayburgh was great in the role of a lifetime woman and she 's not just a bad actress
1,perhaps the best of them is the fact,perhaps this is the best film ever
1,maybe he 's a little more forgiving,maybe the director was a genius
1,this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and the only thing that is worth seeing is the performance of,this film has no redeeming qualities at any time and it 's not the best of the bunch
1,this film is a must for anyone interested on the subject matter,this was the first movie i saw i would like to watch
1,a very good movie that is n't really worth watching and is a mustsee for fans,a lot of it is the first time that we see a movie about the life of
1,an example that the filmmakers could be in the film industry,an interesting premise to be found in a film about the holocaust
1,i do n't know why i have never,i think this is a great movie
1,as a result the film was very much a bit slow and the acting by the whole was horrible,as for it 's release i was n't sure what was going to be a bit of a spoiler but
1,unless it 's a good idea to make a film that does a good job with it,unless you 're a diehard collector of the original and have a great time with the film i
1,immediately he is a man who has no problems in his own life,immediately the film is a little over a long time and the end is
1,there was a lot of action and some of the action scenes were good,there are a number of other films that are so bad it is funny and
1,by all accounts the story was a bit weak and the acting and the plot was terrible,by the time the movie reaches its conclusion the movie is a bit of a letdown to begin
1,although i do agree with the other reviewer who said it was a bit of the fun to,although i do n't know what to do with this movie it is n't that bad either
1,he has to go through the whole,he is a very talented actor
1,i was expecting the movie that i would have seen the,i do n't know why this movie is n't available
1,now the film is not about how a man can get to the bottom of the world that he is a loner,now i have a fondness on the film and its a good movie to watch but i do n't think i have ever
1,the acting was terrible the directing was worse and the directing,the movie starts out very good but it 's not
1,to be fair the movie was a complete failure and i was surprised that this is a,to be honest i was not impressed by the story and the characters were n't believable
1,it is n't a good movie to begin with,it is a shame to hear a song in the
1,this is one of my favorite tv shows,this movie has a very good story and a
1,i do n't know how this movie got released theatrically,i think that this is the only movie that i could
1,the story was n't bad and the,the movie was shot in black
1,we are shown a little too much of what,we have the first film in the series
1,but i have no idea what this film is,but i think the film was a bit too long
1,the acting was horrible the script was horrible and the plot just,the movie was n't a complete waste for the whole family
1,the acting is horrible the directing is poor,the film is not a documentary of a book
1,so what 's it all all about,so what do i know that 's the
1,but the story of this movie has some very nice twists and the ending,but it 's a shame because this movie has a lot going for it and
1,this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever,this was the first film to make me
1,i do n't think that it 's a bad movie,i have never seen a worse film in the entire film
1,this movie does n't have a lot going for it it is just a bad movie,this is a great film for those of a certain type to be a good movie and
1,now i know i 've seen a few movies in,now i am not a fan of this movie
1,from the beginning the movie has a lot going from start till the very last minute of the,from the opening shot of the movie the film is a complete waste of time to watch
1,catch up on your own and watch it with your kids,catch a glimpse and enjoy a great deal of time
1,in a way it 's just a bit of fun to see,in fact i think that the film was shot in a very tight
1,this is a film that is a little too long for the viewer,this movie does not even have a plot to make a good film and
1,i was so disappointed with it,i do n't think that the director
1,i think it is a good movie,i have n't seen the first movie but
1,i do n't know how this film got made but it was n't,i have n't seen the first movie but the first movie is pretty good
1,i think that 's what i thought was that the director had to do a lot of,i do n't know how it got going but i guess it 's just a movie
1,the acting in the film is superb,the film 's premise is a bit of
1,even though it 's not a comedy there are a few chuckles,even the actors are not the best actors in this movie
1,he is a very talented man and he is a good person who is not afraid of a man,he is a man of sorts and he has been in love with a woman who 's not a good
1,the movie was made up for the rest of it and that 's why it 's so bad it makes the,the film is about two men who live in the same house and have a different relationship with each other
1,the film is a complete mess of the first,the movie was shot with the handheld cam
1,or maybe it 's because of the lack of a decent plot and a few good actors,or the fact that it was made on a shoestring budget was the inspiration for this film and
1,the movie is not about the characters,the movie is about the man who was
1,a good example of how to make one,a few scenes are very good but they 're
1,i was surprised to discover that a movie like this could have made me want to be,i do n't know what to think of the movie is that it is a comedy
1,well the story line is very interesting the,well the film has an interesting premise
1,the story is about the love of,the film is a complete mess
1,there is also a scene with the young girl who has a crush on the young man and her lover,there is a lot to like about this show but it is still a very funny movie and it 's fun
1,as a result of his past he is the embodiment of his life as he is the dominant figure of the,as i watched this film the first time it was shown on television and it 's a very interesting thing
1,this film is a must have to see,this film is a very good example
1,scalise is a man in the middle of a,scalise 's father is a very nice guy
1,it has a lot to say about a group that is not a big fan,it is not a movie that is so much of a cult classic it is an
1,i have n't seen this movie in years and still i am glad it was made,i think the reason for this is that the film is a complete waste of time
1,since i have n't seen it yet and have been able to locate the film for the first half of a week i,since this is a movie i do have to say that it has the best actors and the best actors of all
1,assume the movie was a complete failure to watch and i was bored by the story and the characters,assume that it is n't a movie for the masses it is a very good and very entertaining film that
1,a very enjoyable movie with a great,a good movie to be seen
1,i do n't understand why this movie has so much promotion and it 's been released theatrically,i have never seen the original but i 've seen this movie twice in its entirety
1,either the acting is bad or just the,either way it was n't that good
1,a few minutes into his career and his performance i was surprised at the fact that,a few scenes are very good but the rest just did n't work at all
1,the acting is horrible and the script is,the acting and the script are horrible
1,christopher lloyd is great as a man and the movie has an endearing,christopher walken is excellent as a man and a very funny guy
1,the acting was good but the story was weak,the story is simple but not very interesting
1,this is a very good movie,this was the worst movie i have
1,for the rest the film has no real purpose or purpose whatsoever,for those who have never read a biography of the original novel and
1,i have never been so impressed by it as the first movie,i think this is a very good film but it 's just not
1,problem is the script was so bad it was almost laughable and the acting is just horrible,problem with the movie is that it 's so bad it 's funny and the actors are all
1,in fact the whole movie was so poorly acted and poorly acted i could n't,in a nutshell it was a great movie for those who like the original
1,the movie was made in a very short period of time,the film has some good acting in the supporting role of david
1,even though the film is a bit slow it does have a few interesting things to say about the movie it,even if you have a yen for the original and do n't know what to think and enjoy this show
1,none the more he 's a very good actor,none of the cast is good and the script is
1,and it 's all so bad that it 's funny it 's just not bad,and the ending is so bad that you wonder if the writer was going to be
1,whereas the movie is a complete mess it 's a shame that the movie is still not a complete failure,whereas this is not a movie i think it 's a great film and a great example to the genre
1,being that the movie is about a group of young people who have to deal and live in new jersey and have their own problems,being the first to be a classic film in the uk and a new one i have been waiting for it to come across as a
1,john cusak was a very good director,john wayne is the most beautiful character ever
1,it 's not a movie that you should watch but you 'll be,it 's a pity that the film has a few more laughs
1,i do n't think i 've ever laughed so much throughout my life,i have seen this film and have seen many many other movies
1,there 's a bit to the movie but it 's not a bad movie it,there was no need for the characters and the characters were just too stupid
1,i do agree that this movie was a total disappointment to sit,i was expecting something better from a film like this one
1,this is a movie about a young woman named seita,this was a very good and funny movie with the usual
1,instead we get the usual and annoying ending that i found annoying,instead of the typical hollywood clichs they have a lot more money than
1,what i did like is how they are in a different place and they 're trying hard to be different and different from their own life,what i liked about it for the most is that it was a bit of a bore but that was the only reason i gave it the
1,the film is a complete mess,the story is a simple mess
1,this film does not have a lot going it is so bad it 's almost laughable it has,this is a great movie for everyone who wants the story to get to the bottom line
1,ok i have seen a few movies but the film is a complete mess,ok i have n't heard of this show since i saw it on cable
1,recap a lot more than that the film has a very,recap the first one is a bit slow and boring
1,the movie is a little slow but,the film has some good acting
1,we get the feeling that we 've never seen the film but you have to see that it 's a great deal,we get to the point when we get to the end of this movie which makes the movie more interesting than the first
1,it 's the kind of movie that,it 's a very good story
1,one thing that is missing is the fact it was made by a man with an iq and a few of the scenes in it,one thing i noticed about it was that the story was so weak and the acting was so bad that it could have done much better
1,i was n't impressed with this film,i think it is a good movie to
1,mattei has a very good sense of humor,mattei 's the film is a classic
1,the acting was horrible the script awful,the film is not about an evil family
1,the film is a complete failure and the only thing that makes the film watchable are the performances of the actors,the movie is about a group of young people trying to get married and have a very difficult relationship to the life
1,yet another thing that is so bad is why this movie was released theatrically and,yet the film has a very strong and interesting look at it 's own
1,the film is about two people who have been killed and killed,the story of the movie is about a man named benjamin
1,but the real reason why it has a good,but the story is a little too long
1,the film 's main character has to rely upon the fact that it is a complete waste,the film is a little bit of the same for the whole series but the film has an
1,i think the film was a bit too much,i think that 's why i liked it
1,it was a very funny film but i found it to be a bit slow,it 's not even that good and i ca all agree with those who are n't
1,a very enjoyable film and a great movie to view with friends of mine,a few scenes of dialogue and dialogue were n't enough to save this film
1,left to go to the next scene,left behind this film is the same
1,i was so bored by this movie that it 's a wonder,i do n't think i have any qualms of the plot
1,spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead the ending of a twist ending was n't really explained but it,spoilers the plot of a man who is a young woman is a very interesting character
1,apparently this movie was n't meant to be,apparently the film has no real purpose
1,this is the first movie that i have watched that 's as bad a bad movie in my collection as i was watching this movie,this was a great show that i was able to watch over and over because i was so excited when i saw the movie and i
1,and the acting is pretty poor and the plot was just,and that 's the only reason to watch this film
1,we 're told that he will never be able to get away from,we get an idea of what the movie 's plot is like
1,so i was n't expecting a good movie,so the movie has its own problems
1,she is a very good character and she 's very likable,she 's a great actor but the movie does have a few
1,it 's a very good film,it is not even worth the time
1,or even if you are a huge john lennon fans,or maybe it 's a good idea that a movie can
1,the film was a bit long for me,the film 's premise is to be commended
1,both the film and movie memento are the best,both of these films are not very successful
1,but the real problem with this film the most important is its predictability of,but the film is not so much that i ca n't believe it
1,not to mention a few scenes in which,not to be missed by the end
1,helen is not as bad as the other actors in this movie,helen hunt is a very talented character and is a very talented actress
1,everyone is just as bad and the bad things get worse,everyone in the movie was a caricature of the film
1,i do agree but i have to admit that i have,i do n't think this movie is a good thing
1,the film has some good points but that,the movie was a waste of time
1,this movie does have the same problems,this is not the best film of the
1,the story of the film is very similar,the film 's main character 's motivations are not
1,pick up your local library with a beer,pick up this movie and then get a copy
1,and it is the worst movie i,and it was n't that good
1,she is a great actress and a good one,she was n't in this flick but she did a
1,all of the characters were believable the story is simple,all the other actors are all excellent and the story is
1,it 's a great show for kids,it was so funny to hear that they
1,we 're told the story of two brothers who were born in the same year and are still living together in the,we 're supposed to sympathize and sympathize with a bunch that is n't a good thing but that 's not enough
1,a very good story and some great actors,a good movie for the entire cast
1,they are both a good idea and a good combination but the film does not make any sense and the characters are just plain awful and the characters seem underdeveloped,they 're just plain bad and i think that 's why i hate this movie so i did n't see it in the theater but the first half was very good
1,the film is about the same thing,the film is very well done
1,who cares what happened in real life,who would think the film 's title character
1,there 's a scene where the killer is shot and then the scene is cut,there is a scene where she is talking about her mother and she says it all
1,the acting was horrible and i was surprised to see that the movie had been produced by a group,the film is about a young boy who is sent in prison for a life of his own
1,to say this is the worst film ever to do so is beyond ridiculous,to make a long movie about the real mccoy the film is a total failure
1,i do think the movie was a bit too slow and i,i do agree but the movie has a very good plot
1,the movie was a complete failure,the acting is very poor and there
1,this is the first of three films that i have ever had the pleasure,this movie was not a good idea for a movie to be made
1,rather than the usual suspects of a young man the film settles through the screen as if it 's the best film of its kind,rather it is the fact that the director and his wife have a different understanding of what it is like to make it through the film
1,in this case it seems like it is a spoof and it is,in the end it 's not a movie to make a movie
1,some of the acting in this movie is so good that i have to say that this movie had a very bad script but the actors are so bad,some people are so stupid that you ca only have a movie that is so bad that you do n't care if the movie has any redeeming value
1,i do n't want to give anything more away but i have n't seen this movie since the late 80 another,i have n't seen the original series but i do recall that it 's a bit different from what the original version
1,i was n't sure whether the movie is supposed as a serious comedy or a drama,i have n't seen a more recent version and this is the one that made this so
1,the movie is not about the evils of the people of,the story of the movie is a lot of fun
1,she 's a great actress and she does n't seem to be acting,she was so cute to me that it 's hard to believe that she
1,it 's the story of a young man trying his luck with the help from,it 's just a shame to have a movie that is n't worth renting
1,this is a great example of a movie with no redeeming features,this film is a very bad attempt at a slasher movie
1,christopher plummer 's performance as a man who gets the girl in a bar and a man who 's been trying to get to his home,christopher plummer is a fine choice to play a woman who has a very good role but is a little too old to play a character who
1,the story is a bit confusing and it is n't,the story is about two young adults who go to the
1,we have a very strong story about the struggles and feelings of the people who have been affected and jailed for,we 're supposed the crux of the story but we are told that we are in for some good reason
1,basically the story line is very good,basically it is the same thing
1,kal ho naa is a wonderful movie that is a perfect example to anyone with a heart for the genre,kal penn is a great actor and he plays a character who does n't seem to have any range of emotions
1,this is a movie i would watch again and i have,this is a movie about a woman and her mother
1,too bad that this movie was made in the first place so it 's not even,too bad they do n't get to show the real story in the first half
1,there are a few things that do not really make sense,there are a number in which a character played with a depth
1,the movie was shot in the same location as the first movie,the film has some of the most memorable sequences ever captured on film
1,i was surprised that the film is not available on dvd and the dvd is a waste,i think this movie is very good and i would like to know what the hell was going
1,heck the movie was shot with the camera lens of,heck i have a soft side of this film
1,at first i thought that the movie would get a lot better,at least i would n't have had a refund for this
1,i think this movie should be shown in a more serious,i think this is the best part of a movie
1,the acting is very good and the,the movie is a complete mess
1,also the ending was so predictable,also the ending is so ridiculous and
1,to me this film is a must watch for all fans and for,to be fair i have seen the movie and have to agree
1,also i thought that was the only good,also a few moments are very interesting
1,i think the director was trying to get the audience to think about the,i think that it is not a bad movie and it 's not
1,in the meantime it has a good plot and a great cast,in this case it is a film about two people living with their
1,he 's not a bad guy but,he 's a very talented director
1,no wonder he is n't the only one,no matter how bad a person who is supposed
1,it is n't a good movie,it is a shame that the director
1,also the scene where a man with the head arm was a,also the film is a complete waste of time and time
1,another reason is that the movie is a bit slow at best as it is,another example is that this movie is not a comedy or an action movie
1,and it is a shame that the movie,and i was n't impressed by this
1,while the film was shot in a small budget it 's a very poor film and not very good,while this is a good thing i think that the movie would have been more interesting had the director been
1,however i do think that the movie was a bit too much of a stretch,however i do have the feeling it was the intention that this film is so utterly
1,because it is a great show for kids and parents,because the movie was a little too long for its own
1,it 's not the worst movie ever,it is a very funny film
1,there was no need to be made to have the slightest impact on me,there are some very nice moments in the movie but it is n't
1,i was so impressed that it was so bad and i had no idea of the real world 's history,i have n't seen a movie in my life so much as i have seen a lot more of these films
1,poor acting poor script and poor editing and editing is just plain awful and the,poor script and direction of the film and the actors are all very amateurish
1,some of the acting is bad the acting is awful but the story,some have commented the fact i have n't heard about this film
1,what i got was a movie with an,what is this supposed for a film
1,there are some very funny scenes in,there 's no plot no action
1,the movie is not about people and their lives,the movie is a bit slow but it does have
1,overall the movie was good but the acting and script was terrible,overall i would say that this is a very bad film
1,amants the most beautiful is the fact,amants a mano is the best
1,but it does n't matter that it is n't a good movie but,but this movie has no redeeming features at least it 's not
1,sure the movie is a little dated and it,sure this is the worst of this movie
1,one thing that makes this film so special was that it did not get a theatrical release,one of his most underrated movies was the one where it was filmed in the first film
1,this is not a bad movie,this is a movie about how the
1,attenborough 's direction was a bit too dark for the audiences but i think that the director should have had a bigger part,attenborough 's direction was so bad that he had been reduced by the director 's vision to the story and his work
1,the film is a complete bore and it is the only one that i 've ever seen in a movie theater,the acting in the other actors was good the story was ok but i was surprised at the end and it was
1,to be a big star i was not disappointed,to me this is a very funny film
1,your average viewer is a good movie,your average viewer is a little confused and
1,big fat greek is a good movie and it is n't the worst movie i ever,big brother is a good guy and a good actor who can do the best
1,instead the viewer is subjected by the characters to develop them,instead of being a little bit more than the sum we see
1,sunny puta has been a very good film,sunny is the most beautiful woman i 've ever
1,this is a film that is a complete mess,this film is a must see film for all ages
1,same thing for a few seconds,same as this one is the first
1,tunes are n't as good and are n't the best,tunes are used as if they were written on the wind
1,unfortunately this is not what i would do,unfortunately the movie does not have a lot of
1,i was expecting a movie with a good story line to work with,i have to say i have seen a few movies with a similar sense
1,this is not a movie that will appeal but it is,this movie is so awful i ca n't believe it
1,yet the movie is a very interesting and interesting experience of a,yet it 's not the most important movie of all times
1,granted it is a little dated but that 's all there are,granted there is some good acting but there is no real story
1,the acting and directing are horrible,the story is very interesting and it
1,half a century after the movie is over the last scene has been a long long haired,half the time you get to know what 's going to be done in the end
1,until the last few minutes the film is n't really worth the effort to sit down to,until the final showdown scene we see the two of them go on a road trip
1,no one is a good actor,no it 's not a good movie
1,the story of an american girl who has been a child,the film is very well done but it is not
1,all i could think was that this movie is a total waste,all the characters are likable and the plot line has a lot of
1,anyway i do n't understand how this film could ever be released theatrically,anyway i think the film is very good but i think it is very
1,the acting was terrible the directing horrible,the film has an excellent soundtrack and a
1,this is a film that is not,this movie is a must see
1,although the movie was not as good as the first movie and it was n't the best,although the movie is a bit dated it has some nice twists to it and some nice scenery
1,also the scene in which she is supposed and she has the same facial expressions and the way she is treated,also i think that the director and his wife should not have to have the same problem with the story
1,i'm sure that the film is not as bad as the first but it 's,i'm a fan of this movie and have never heard of the film before
1,all of them were a bunch,all the actors were good but the
1,i was expecting a movie about a group of people and,i think that 's the best part of the movie
1,the film is about the same subject as the first one,the film 's story was a little weak at the start and
1,i think it 's a great movie to view it to see if it 's a good one and it,i have never heard a movie before but i do not understand why this film did so many things
1,from the opening shot the film looks like a cheap video game with the camera and lighting,from the first scene of the movie and how the film ends the film abruptly builds up the
1,until the very last scene in which the hero tries his,until this film is about to go to the cinema
1,two years later he 's in a coma and he has to be a man who 's a man who has a gift,two of the most memorable moments were the first time when a man and his son were sitting in a chair and the camera
1,eddie murphy plays the part with a,eddie murphy was a great choice
1,if you 're a diehard horror fan this is definitely the movie for you but it is definitely worth checking,if you 're looking for a good movie with an excellent story and great actors you will love this movie and
1,mckenna 's character is the same,mckenna is the most beautiful character in
1,the movie is a little slow but that 's not the only reason to see,the movie is a bit slow but it 's a great film to see if not
1,i think this is one that i would recommend watching it for the first half of the movie,i was surprised that this was a film that was made to cash in on a career
1,the movie is very slow moving and it 's hard not to like it,the story is a simple mess and a few of the actors are very good
1,our hero is a man who has been living in the past with his family,our hero is a hero who is sent into a prison and is forced
1,what is more interesting is that the film is set in england,what i found interesting was how the movie ended with such poor acting
1,as a result of the film it is a,as a movie this is a good film
1,wow i do n't care if this is,wow i have n't seen this movie
1,obviously this movie is not for everyone and that 's why they should,obviously this was the case with a few people in the movie
1,not only did he not have the money to make it,not to mention the fact it has no redeeming qualities
1,but the real star was the performance of the director and the director,but the film is so bad that i ca n't even begin watching it
1,it was a very funny movie and it 's a shame to see such a talented performer,it has a good cast including a few of the supporting cast including a young seth green as
1,his character in the movie is a real,his performance is a joy to watch
1,it was the first movie i saw in the last 15 minutes,it is not a movie about how the people who made this movie
1,but the real reason why the film was,but it is a very good film
1,i do think that this movie was a complete disaster,i do n't know why but i have to agree with
1,immediately the story is told in flashbacks and the,immediately he 's a little suspicious of himself
1,the acting was n't bad but not bad,the movie is a bit too slow for the
1,this is not the case in the film,this movie has no redeeming qualities at all
1,if you are a diehard collector of hers i 'd recommend this,if you have a masochistic fascination with it you should definitely see it
1,swept away from the movie by the director and writer of the film it seems to have a lot to do with its,swept away from a mental breakdown in the first film the story of the film was very interesting but it was not
1,so what do i know i do not,so if the director is a real person he
1,like a lot more than a few seconds of the movie it was n't that great,like the other reviewers here mentioned this is a great movie and a great one
1,i think that the best part in it all,i was n't sure what was going on
1,when i watched this show it had to be one thing to say,when the film finally ended the story of the film 's success
1,whatever the case it is the fact that the film,whatever the case i would recommend it to anyone
1,columbo is a man of the cloth and a woman in the process,columbo 's character does have the same effect and the same character
1,it 's a very good story,it 's a very funny movie and
1,just as the first one has the exact opposite of being a,just like the rest i was surprised to see the movie
1,john goodman is a very talented director who,john goodman 's character was very funny
1,you have to see it for its own stunts and the fact that the movie has a lot,you have to watch it to believe it or not it was a waste of my time
1,for a film of such a great book it 's a shame,for those who do watch it i would have given it an 85
1,the acting is horrible the plot was awful even the actors were,the acting and directing is superb and the acting is great
1,i have n't read a book so i ca all be this one to be honest,i do n't know how it 's possible to get a good laugh when the actors do
1,in this case he has a good time,in a way it 's a bit more than
1,i have never been so disgusted with such a film,i was surprised to see that the film is not only
1,i have never seen the original so much,i was surprised to learn that this movie is
1,the movie is very well made,the acting was terrible the directing was
1,this is one of the best movies i,this film does have some redeeming quality
1,i do n't want my money to be spent on the dvd,i was expecting the worst of this movie to be made in my
1,the story is very interesting the characters,the film is a complete mess
1,overall i give a 10 out of 10 for this movie,overall this was an excellent film and i recommend it to anyone
1,i'm not saying the same thing but i have to say it,i'm a huge fan of movies but this is the worst
1,however the plot of the film was n't that great,however it 's not a good film it 's very very
1,the film 's main weakness is that it is not the first film,the acting was good enough but the script by a different director
1,it 's a very good story,it was the first movie that i
1,i have never heard a movie where it has such a great cast,i was so excited to find this one on tv in my library
1,but i do n't think that this is a good movie,but the movie is not so good as it was made for
1,i was surprised that i did n't get it,i was so excited about the film and i was
1,it 's the story of the same name of the famous american family,it was a waste and i was n't sure whether it was a comedy
1,jack lemmon 's role as his wife is,jack frost 2 has a great soundtrack
1,i have to wonder why i have not read any of the reviews,i do n't think i have seen a lot more than this
1,i have n't read any comments about,i was expecting something like this
1,complimentary is a very funny movie,complimentary is a very funny movie that
1,i think this movie is a masterpiece of art and i am not sure whether i,i have never seen the original series but it is still a very enjoyable show
1,however the story was very good the actors did their usual excellent job and the script made me want to go to,however the story of a woman 's life and her life as a child is very different than the film itself
1,all in this movie 's worth watching,all the other actors are excellent
1,kutcher and his friends are both in the film and they are in,kutcher was a very good actor and he is a great actress
1,i do n't understand why the movie has so many positive reviews,i have never seen any film that has been made as much as
1,i do agree that the film is very good,i was expecting a movie to be done with some
1,while it is a bit slow at times it is still very enjoyable,while i was n't impressed by this one the film seemed very very very
1,imagine this film is not for everyone but for those,imagine the film 's success in its own right
1,these are not the best of the films that have been done in the past,these were the two best known films i have seen in a long long and long
1,and the ending was so predictable,and the acting was good and the
1,she was a little over the top and she was n't really the same actress,she is the only one to have her name in this flick and i hope she
1,this movie was a waste for the first time i,this was one to see in the first film
1,but the story line is so ridiculous,but this is not the movie for you
1,yet the movie was not as good as the first,yet the film 's main flaw of it was the fact
1,her character is a bit dim,her acting skills have been so bad
1,and it 's the best thing about,and the acting is so bad
1,by the end of the movie i was really looking forward into a movie that i could have been a little,by the end of this show i could n't believe the movie was n't even made in the slightest time
1,the story is simple and it is n't a bad thing,the movie is a very good film and it has a very
1,this is the worst movie i ever watched,this is a great movie and i hope it
1,the film has a lot to recommend it but it was n't a good movie,the movie is about the struggle of a man who is trying his hand at the
1,it is the best film i 've watched this,it 's a great film to be sure
1,how many people do you have a chance to be able to see this movie,how can a woman like the one that is the only thing that can happen in
1,as for this film i have no idea what the point is and how many people are commenting,as a matter of fact the film is a bit of a bore but i found it very entertaining
1,the story is simple and it is n't that bad but i do n't think that 's what this movie is,the acting and the script were terrible but the movie was n't really good enough to give it an 8 out 10
1,why did they have to make it a film,why is it so stupid that this is a very
1,pg13 rated movies are a 410 because the plot,pg13 rating pg13 for violence and language language
1,all in one movie that is so good,all the actors and crew were good
1,the acting in all of his films is superb,the story line of a man who is in the
1,this movie is so bad it 's bad,this was an interesting movie to see in the
1,my friend is a fan of the tv series and this episode shows that the series is still a great episode of columbo 's play,my friend was in the theater and i saw this movie on video and i have n't seen a movie so many years after seeing it
1,writers have a certain amount to spare,writers of the movie are the ones who
1,and i do n't care if the director 's intention is to,and the film does n't even have the feel to it
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film was shot with a handheld
1,it has been done before in many,it is a very interesting film
1,the story line was very good and the characters and relationships were so realistic,the film is a little slow and boring at the end but it really makes
1,once the movie begins you realize you are watching a movie that you can barely,once again i think this movie was just a waste for the first half
1,i have seen it many years and it still has a great deal of humor in my face and i love it so well that,i do not recommend this movie for all the kids who have n't seen the movie but it 's a great movie for adults
1,even when they 're trying to make a movie out of the story it is not even a good one,even when the story was n't a little farfetched the movie was just plain boring to me and that 's not
1,one thing that i liked about this film was the fact i was watching it,one of the best movies i 've ever watched and the best thing about that film
1,what i did see is a film,what is more interesting about it
1,most of the time the film is set in a small town where people live and,most of these people are so bad i do not know what to think of
1,the story line was a joke,the acting was n't too bad but
1,this movie is not a comedy it is n't even a comedy,this movie was a complete waste of money and i would rather spend
1,at first i thought that this would be an interesting movie,at least it 's not the best movie ever made
1,but the movie has some good performances,but the film is a very good movie
1,actually i think the movie is a bit too long,actually the acting was pretty good and the acting is very
1,do yourself a favour and avoid it,do yourself the same ol and worn up
1,i'm a fan of movies and tv shows but,i'm not saying this is a great film
1,they 're the best actors in the world,they are both the same and that is the
1,raiden and his wife are all very good,raiden is the best character in the film and
1,censorship is the only one who has a sense for this movie,censorship is not the case here but it 's still very entertaining and
1,the movie was shot on video,the film has a great cast and
1,but the movie is so much of the same,but it 's not a bad thing it 's just
1,he 's not a good actor but his character was so bad,he is a very funny character and he does not disappoint
1,i was n't sure if the movie was going to end but i was n't expecting a good movie to be made i was disappointed with it because i was,i think it is one of the best movies ever made and i have seen it twice in the past 20 years and it is one of my favorites
1,nick is the only one who is,nick nolte plays the lead character
1,i have never been a big fan of hers and it has been done in a very long time but it was not a good movie,i was n't impressed at the time and the story was very weak and i was n't really sure if it was going to be a comedy
1,on this note the movie was a little too much of the,on a technical scale the film looks like an amateur film
1,you have the recipe of a good actor who 's just plain bad in the role,you have to see it for its own sake of the story of the characters
1,nothing about it was a bit interesting and,nothing really happens to be the same
1,the acting and direction are so bad it is laughable to watch and the actors do a pretty good imitation of the film 's script which was n't,the acting is good and i think the movie is very entertaining and very funny and i think it 's a good thing to watch this film
1,yet the film has a few faults and a few moments of unintentional comedy are,yet i still ca n't believe that this is the best of the three
1,basically the movie was made in a hurry,basically this movie has no real story
1,yes i know that this movie is not the worst film ever but it 's still not bad,yes it is true the story has some holes in it but the story itself does n't seem very
1,trying hard but ultimately fails at being the best movie of,trying to be funny and funny is just a joke
1,on the whole it is a very good film,on top this was a pretty bad movie
1,her husband 's father and her son have been married to her father and his son,her character has a great performance as the mother of the young woman and the daughter
1,when i first heard that the movie was going to end and was a,when you see this film it is a very long and boring film
1,the film has some very good scenes,the film is a complete waste
1,later i saw the movie and i thought it was a very good movie,later on he finds out he has a brother and he is trying to save
1,fondness the movie and the film for its richness and its message,fondness for that is that this movie was made in canada
1,there was also some good gore,there 's no reason that the film
1,learn to act in the same manner as in the first film,learn a lesson and a woman 's life and her own life in
1,i have never heard of this movie and i was so bored that i was n't laughing,i think it 's a shame to hear that this is a film that is not even available
1,there was also a lot in this story that did n't make up a good story and a good cast,there are many things that are so stupid and pointless that i ca n't even describe the movie as a bad
1,with the title song and dancing in the movie you get an idea that,with the exception being a bit of a stretch the film does manage
1,from the very beginning of it i felt like i was watching a documentary,from there i found myself asking myself why i was in trouble with this one
1,the acting is very bad and it 's not a good,the film is a complete mess of the original movie
1,freeman and the rest of the gang are just as funny as,freeman and the rest of his gang are very well cast
1,i think that 's the reason why this movie is not for anyone,i think that it is one that i can watch for a few days
1,i was expecting something more like the movie to,i think this is a very bad movie
1,in fact i think the only good part was that there were so many funny parts of the movie that you would never have guessed,in the end the movie has a good cast and a nice pace and a good story line but i do n't recommend the movie as
1,this movie has a very funny story and,this is not one of those films
1,the film was shot in the seventies,the movie was a little slow
1,c'mon the movie is n't bad but it is n't bad,c'mon i know that the director is not going on but i
1,obviously it 's a film of a few people who are not in the same room as the ones in the movie,obviously the director of a lot better than this film is but it was n't the worst film i 've ever seen
1,jody 's character and the other two are so much better and the story is a little confusing but the movie,jody is a great character and she does not seem to be the only person who has to be one
1,the film has a great cast including the two leads,the story is about two people in love and a married
1,but this movie was so bad i was n't even sure if it would be,but it 's not a bad idea it 's not a movie to make
1,the acting was terrible but i thought it was a great film,the story of a young woman named anna 's daughter who has become
1,any movie that could have made a great deal better than this,any one with a brain will find it impossible and the film has
1,i do agree but it is the most important thing to come about,i think that the best way to go to the movie is to see
1,how could it be so bad if it was,how can you make such a good film
1,so what if you 're going to get a movie,so the movie was n't bad but it 's just a
1,i was expecting something more than a movie but i was n't expecting a lot more,i do not know why i have never been so annoyed by it as the last episode
1,i was so impressed by it i could not believe it,i do n't think that the actors are good enough for their
1,in the first half of the movie we learn that the killer 's daughter has a crush in his face but the rest is not as much as he is a man who is,in the end it is the most beautiful and haunting film i ever seen in the history of cinema and in my humble opinion it was a great film that is a joy
1,you can see that the director and his crew were,you can tell that it 's a real stinker
1,do not waste my precious time watching this film unless you have a masochistic fascination of what you 're going to be,do n't waste my time or time watching it unless i am just a fan of hers or i do n't want the
1,as for the story it 's very interesting but i think it 's a very good movie that is just a good movie to watch,as i said the only thing that kept me interested was that it was n't a comedy or an attempt to get a movie
1,the movie is about as funny as it is and it 's funny how it,the acting was good and the story line was great but it 's not
1,i was n't expecting a movie to get me started on,i have seen the movie several times in my life
1,has a very limited amount and a few scenes in this movie,has the movie makers been a little more creative in this film and
1,together the movie is a complete mess,together with the first one the film is
1,ravishing in a way that makes me feel that i was watching the movie with a little of her face but the film did,ravishing and very moving and the film is not a total success but i found myself wanting more than i could ever imagined
1,but i think that the film is a little,but the film is a little too long
1,whereas the plot is a little thin and the story is very predictable and predictable,whereas the plot has been done by many of its other characters it 's not a
1,evil is the worst movie i have,evil dead man was one hell
1,regardless the movie 's title was very misleading,regardless of the fact the director was n't able
1,this is the best movie of all,this movie is not even worth the money
1,i think it 's not worth the effort i,i was so bored when i saw it
1,it has a very good story,it was a waste and i would
1,otherwise i 'd like to say this film has the,otherwise it is n't worth the money it takes
1,in the first movie we are treated to a bunch of obnoxious characters,in the first film the main protagonist was in the first one
1,it 's a shame because it 's a,it 's just not a good film
1,also the scene with her mother 's mother is just plain bad,also i think that the actors are very good and i think they
1,some have commented the fact that it is a very low rating for all of the above mentioned movies,some of them are not as good or as bad as the ones in the movie which are pretty bad
1,if the movie does n't have a good story it is a good movie to watch and i would recommend it,if you are a fan of the genre and you like the original then this one is a mustsee to anyone interested
1,i was expecting a great movie to watch but i was wrong in the,i think this was a great show for me to be able into
1,i have n't seen it since the late 80 other than i was watching it,i was n't really expecting much of the plot and i was surprised that it did
1,it was a waste for a movie,it is n't a film that 's not
1,lucia is a young woman living in a small,lucia is the best thing about this movie
1,this movie has no redeeming qualities to it,this film is not a good movie but is
1,there are some great performances by the two,there are some great scenes in it
1,why does n't he have a clue,why do n't we have a movie that
1,when the movie is over and you have the chance,when you see the movie you will be amazed by the
1,if the movie is a bit slow at times i will say i was n't bored but i was n't expecting much from it,if you want a good film that will make you want you to laugh at this one you 'll be disappointed by this
1,this film has the best of the worst,this is the worst movie i 've ever had
1,it 's just a bunch of random things happen in a,it has a great cast and the acting was good
1,it 's a shame that this was,it is not a good movie
1,i have never heard a movie where i have a feeling,i was surprised to discover the movie was a success
1,we have to watch the movie to find,we 're told to watch the movie
1,the story line is a joke and the characters are n't developed in a way they,the acting and directing were excellent but the story and the script were very weak
1,through the movie i felt that the movie had a little bit more action,through the years i have been looking for something more to the show
1,in the first half of this movie the viewer feels like a,in the meantime he is a young woman and a womanizer
1,i do n't think that the director intended a good idea for a film to have to rely on it 's own,i was surprised that i had wasted my life with this one and that was the only way i could ever see it
1,even the most ardent of actors could have done the same,even though it 's not a bad movie it does provide a
1,firode has done a great story and i,firode has a good sense of style
1,maybe it 's the best way i 've ever seen it,maybe it was a little too long and it was n't that
1,did anyone know how to get the money,did i mention the fact that it is a
1,arthur 's performance is a very strong performance in this film and he is very good at playing an eccentric role but the rest of his character was not believable at the time of his life,arthur 's father is a bit of a jerk and the rest of his character seems to be a bit too unlikable to be believable in a movie where his acting is a bit stiff
1,i do not think this is the best film of the series,i think the director and director have done some research in this film
1,the film has a very good cast and a nice cast,the movie starts off ok but the acting is n't bad at
1,in fact the movie is very funny but it 's,in this movie it is a very simple movie
1,not to mention the fact it has the best actors of our time,not a bad film to watch but it 's still pretty good and worth
1,i do think the director should have done a better movie instead of a film that was so awful and so boring and so boring,i have to admit i am not a big fan but i was impressed to see that this movie is a waste of time to sit
1,he has a very good sense to be a good actor,he is the only one to be killed by a car accident
1,willem dafoe is a great choice as a villain and the rest was a great actor,willem defoe is a very talented director but this film is n't even worth seeing
1,in the end i was surprised at how bad this movie was,in fact it is n't the worst movie of the decade
1,now i do know that it was a movie that i would,now this is the first of its kind of a series
1,neither of the actors ever played a,neither of them is particularly convincing
1,rated pg stars and nominee for that,rated pg13 stars out 10 stars
1,the story was a little too thin but the story was so good and so funny,the movie starts off with a bunch and the usual action scene in the movie
1,and the ending was so bad that it was just a bad movie,and that does n't mean that it was a complete failure to watch
1,it 's a shame because the movie is a complete waste of my life and not even the,it is not a film about a man 's death or a man who is a woman
1,shortly after a few minutes of a movie i was,shortly thereafter the movie has a very interesting story
1,i think the reason i watched this film is to find the,i was surprised by this movie because it was so stupid
1,if you have n't seen this one you 'll find it,if you 're not a big floyd purist fan you 'll enjoy
1,this was a very good movie,this movie is one that you should
1,so if i were you i would have to have,so what i did not see was the story
1,well this movie was a waste of money,well this film was a bit of an attempt
1,some of the scenes are so stupid that you ca only make fun of the movie and you will be surprised to see the,some have commented that the movie is a bit too long but the story is very well written and the acting was excellent
1,the film is very well done,the movie has a lot of action
1,the movie is a little bit too long but there is n't much else in the,the story is very interesting but the acting is so bad it is n't funny
1,i think it 's one of his better efforts and,i think that this film has some redeeming value
1,of all of the other movies of this period,of course it was not a big budget
1,i have never read a book by this film but it,i was expecting this movie to be an epic film
1,rogers is one such an underrated director but he is not a very good director or even the,rogers 's acting in the film does n't seem to have any acting ability to work with
1,no one is going to have the slightest clue,no one could have pulled this movie off
1,samir 's character has been reduced by the police and his investigation is the result as a child,samir is not a great actor he is not only one of those movies he has a lot more
1,however this is not a film to be avoided,however this is a movie that should be seen as
1,i have to say this is my favorite movie of the last decade,i think the film has the best of its type of humor
1,finally the film is set to a very good climax and the ending is very abrupt,finally i saw this film at a theater in the uk and it was one of my
1,interesting to see a movie with a strong cast,interesting to see him play an older role in the
1,if i had a choice for the movie it might have been a good film but it was just a little too much to bear the,if i were a little bit prejudiced about the movie i would have been a bit confused but i did not care about this one
1,we are left with a feeling for a film which is so bad and that i do n't know what to say i just do not get,we have the first one and we are treated to a bunch of people who have been killed and have no idea who the killer is
1,there was a good deal about the film,there is a lot of violence and the movie
1,considering the fact that the film does a great job of depicting the real events of a film it is a,considering the fact that the director was not the most successful person of the genre this was a great film
1,the film is about a group of people and their lives,the film is a little slow but that 's it
1,i do not think this movie is worth seeing,i have never seen such bad films before
1,yes there were some good things going but i was wrong and i did,yes it was a great movie but i was n't expecting much more
1,all i can say was this movie was so horrible i could n't even watch the whole,all in all i think that it is worth the effort to buy it for purchase
1,being the most prudish i 've seen this movie is a,being the first movie i was impressed with the ending
1,he is a man of the age of innocence but his character,he is also a great actor and a very funny one
1,there was a lot to like about the movie the plot is pretty basic the,there 's a scene that is supposed to have been filmed with an arrow
1,the acting and the story is so,the acting and directing are horrible
1,son of dracula has the best performance of his career,son and son is one of the funniest horror movies ever
1,and it is n't the same thing that i 've seen,and it 's not that it does n't have to go to
1,in this case it 's a little slow but i,in the end he does not have any problems
1,he was the most popular actor of the movie as the,he 's a very nice actor and a good actor
1,supernatural horror movies are not a good idea to begin with,supernatural horror is a movie about the lives of the characters and
1,he 's a great actor and i can understand how the director could,he 's just as good a character as the one in this
1,if you are not a fan you 'll find the story to have a lot of interesting things to say and i think it was very well done and well acted,if it was a movie about an old school man that would have to do it in the hands of the people who would have been a part of it
1,it 's not a bad film but it 's good,it is a movie that you should n't watch
1,none is a good movie but it is still good and i recommend it,none is really really good or even the slightest hint of the story or the
1,there are so much more to this film,there are a lot more of the characters
1,i think it is a shame that this film has not got a theatrical rating for the movie and that it was released,i was expecting a movie with a lot more than just a few words and a few lines that would have worked
1,the story is very simple and it is a little too simple to,the film is a bit slow but it is still very funny
1,i think this is a very good movie to see,i was surprised at how bad it is and how bad
1,please do n't go watch this one and do n't waste your life,please do yourself a favour and do n't watch the trailer or read a
1,janet mcteer is the only reason i have n't seen,janet blaine as the mother is a real pleasure
1,other than that i was n't impressed with this movie,other than the fact that the film is n't a total
1,great performances and a great performance by the always,great performances by all involved in this production
1,there was a lot of nudity and nudity,there is a lot of violence and gore
1,the film has some of my favorite characters in my,the film is about the power of the characters
1,the story is about a young girl whose father and daughter is married to her,the acting in the other actors was good the script was very good the directing is
1,reissued in a time when it 's not as funny as the original,reissued in the us and early seventies and the us government was the prime
1,i do n't understand what the director was saying about the movie but,i was so bored when watching it i could n't stop laughing
1,fats is the only one that can be blamed for his own personal life in,fats is the only person that is n't the only one to be killed
1,this is a very funny movie,this is not a movie that will
1,riding the streets are not as exciting as the other films but they are very well made,riding around a campfire in an abandoned building and the girl and his daughter are killed in a
1,inevitably the film 's only flaw is the lack,inevitably the story is not very good either
1,trapped on a remote ship in new jersey city is a very good film,trapped in the rain is an old fashioned and very illuminating version with the exception
1,i do n't know if it was a comedy and a drama but i think it 's a good thing to make a movie with a,i do agree that the movie is not about a man who has a wife who does nothing to get her husband to be married
1,wow i have a feeling that i would n't have had a clue,wow it 's not a movie for the faint of a good time
1,the movie is a little slow and the,the film has a very interesting premise
1,she has to be one that is so bad that you can almost see her in her,she is the only person who has ever graced the surface and she does n't even get to
1,even the most ardent fans are n't going and have the same reaction as,even the actors are n't as convincing as the actors in the movie
1,what i did see was a good,what a great movie this is
1,and the ending was so lame,and i was n't expecting the usual
1,not to be missed the whole time and the film is a bit of fun to sit through because of its flaws in the first part,not only was the plot a bit too thin and the story did a little farfetched to follow the characters and the plot but the acting and
1,from this moment i was a bit confused at the time when it was released theatrically in my childhood,from a technical perspective of this movie i found myself wondering what would be the worst movie ever made in
1,unless it is a good idea to show the world the world the world,unless you have n't already seen the movie it will be worth seeing
1,not only is it not a comedy it 's a satire of how the,not only was this a bad movie it was just a bad movie
1,putting the two together together in a movie with no plot and characters who are not likable,putting a bunch of people in a room is one of the worst films i have ever watched
1,cult movie fans should n't have a blast,cult films have a lot to offer
1,had he not been a little more unlikable than he had ever been in the film i could have been more surprised,had it been made in an early 50 's it would have been much less interesting to have a sequel with a little
1,it 's the same kind of movie,it is n't a good movie
1,and that 's not the only reason why,and the acting is n't that terrible
1,meanwhile the two leads are a little too much,meanwhile the two leads are the only characters that are
1,but the movie was n't so bad it was good,but the real reason why the film does have a good
1,grandma is a good character and she 's not a bad girl but a good actress in this film,grandma and son are the only ones in this movie that will make you feel like a child you are
1,at least the original was a good idea to show the movie,at least that 's why i gave this film a 2 because it
1,the film was shot on a low budget,the story line of this story revolves upon a
1,javier bardem is a fine actor but he 's just a bad actor,javier bardem is the perfect choice for the role of the detective and the
1,sends it to the big screen for the first half hour of a movie that is a little too much to ask,sends the film to life is an interesting story about a woman who is attracted by her husband to a woman
1,i have n't seen the original version but the original was still a good one,i do not think that a film can possibly be done in the same manner as
1,based upon the novel by the great author david lynch who was the director and director and the director of photography,based upon the novel by arthur conan this is one that i 've seen and i have seen it twice before
1,for a movie that is not a complete waste for the movie,for the first half the movie i had a good laugh when i
1,but i have seen the original version of it and have seen many others that have made,but it is a very good movie to have a great time and a good time
1,the film has no redeeming qualities,the movie has a very good cast
1,thats a shame because it has the same,thats not the case in this one
1,absolutely no suspense no thrills and no suspense no real action no thrills no suspense no action no,absolutely nothing is said and the characters seem to be there to talk in the same way
1,but the real problem here was the lack of a coherent story,but it 's not that good and it 's not even that bad
1,one of the most interesting movies i have seen in years is the story,one thing is that it 's just not a great movie to begin with
1,as a result of the film i found the acting and the plot very weak,as a matter of fact i was so disappointed that this was the first of three
1,you 'll see it in this film but it,you have a good cast and the characters
1,i have to say i have to say i was a little skeptical when it was released,i was so excited when i heard that this was one that i was looking forward to
1,personal born and the film 's success is the acting,personal and psychological impact in the end is a great way
1,ok so i do n't want you but i 'll,ok it 's not as bad as it is
1,i do think that a lot more money is spent on the film,i have never been a big big fan and i do not like movies
1,she is the one that makes this movie so funny,she was so bad that she could barely have been a
1,it 's a shame that this movie has been so,it was so bad i could not stop laughing
1,i have seen this film several many times and,i do n't want the movie to end
1,although the story is not very interesting the acting was n't good either and that was the only part of the movie,although the film was shot in the seventies it 's a very very low point for the film 's production value
1,then there 's that scene where the killer is shot in his face while the camera pans off the,then the movie starts with a bunch of kids who have been trying too much for a movie
1,i think that it 's not a good idea to have seen a film in a long line of,i have never seen such a bad movie and i do n't want to give away the ending
1,mind you it does n't have a lot to offer,mind the movie has the best of the best
1,so if you are looking to watch a great horror thriller with a,so if it is n't for you it 's worth the wait
1,of this film the only one who is able in this film is to get a lot from it,of course the film does n't have a lot of action and the plot seems to go on and over
1,the story is simple enough to be a little slow and the characters do not have much to work with,the acting and the plot is a little thin but the movie is a real treat for me to watch it
1,nobody else is able to get into,nobody else is a real star
1,that is why the film is not,that is what this film was
1,none of these things are explained in the movie,none of them are funny and the acting is terrible
1,that 's the problem i have for the first half of the movie,that 's what the film is about the characters and the situations
1,it 's just a shame that they,it was n't a good movie
1,apart the two men are the best and most memorable scenes of this film,apart the fact of the matter is that it is not as good or interesting
1,the movie is not a good movie it is n't a great one but it has a very very good story,the acting is pretty good with the exception of the always dependable timothy dalton as a man of the heart
1,okay so this film is a total failure,okay so i do commend the filmmakers for giving
1,unfortunately the movie was n't as funny as it was,unfortunately the film 's biggest flaw was the fact it was
1,with all of the other actors the movie is not all that bad and i,with the possible exception of that the movie is a complete waste of time
1,donnie yen is an amazing character,donnie winters is a fine actor but
1,unlike many films this is a great piece of work and i have to say i did enjoy it and would love,unlike the first film i thought that the acting was pretty bad the story is weak and the acting is bad
1,it 's a shame that the film never got released,it 's a shame because the movie was made in a
1,i think the movie was a good idea,i have seen a lot of movies and have
1,she is a beautiful actress and is a wonderful actress,she is not a great actress she 's a very good
1,thank you for giving this movie a chance to redeem my enjoyment of the story and i do not think that the,thank god for this show and the fact that the contestants in it are so stupid they are n't even likable
1,if it 's not for a good performance by the young menjou who plays his role with a little conviction,if the director was n't so stupid he would make the movie bearable but it just was n't funny
1,i was so bored by the end that i had n't,i was n't sure why i was watching this show
1,both the story and the story were very good,both of them have been in love with each of
1,yeah it was a good show but i think that the acting was,yeah i have to say i 've seen this film twice before
1,after seeing the trailer i was surprised at how many times i 've watched this i 've,after seeing the movie the first time i was a little bit skeptical about this movie
1,gus van sant was in the same vein,gus van sant is a genius and the film
1,2054 is a movie with a great cast and great acting,2054 's story is not as good as some of the other
1,men are the only ones who can,men are always in their twenties
1,the movie is a bit of a mess but the plot and the characters were all very interesting to me as well as being the best,the film has some of those moments that are not even funny and i think that the movie is a waste over a movie ticket
1,you know it was n't going near the end of,you can tell that this is a good movie
1,the movie has the same feel as if it was shot on location in the same location in,the film is a complete waste of time to watch and not even a waste of time
1,the film is a little over a long time and is a,the movie is a bit slow but i really enjoyed that
1,but the real reason i did n't give it 1 star is because i have seen it several times,but the real problem with this movie are the special fx and special makeup that are n't even worth mentioning
1,what a great film this was,what i did like is that it
1,all the actors are excellent and it,all the actors are all excellent
1,when i saw the movie i had no expectations of it,when he 's not a little girl she 's a teenager
1,this movie is one that i would recommend to everyone,this was a very funny film with some great actors and
1,so i guess i can see why i do n't know what the film has,so if it is a movie about a bunch that is going through a series that
1,one day the girl is killed and the woman is killed,one day the girl gets a chance to get rid and then
1,sorry for the good of a bad bad movie but i do not recommend this film,sorry to say this is a good movie and i would recommend it for any serious fan
1,i do n't know how this film got released theatrically and i can say it is not the worst i can ever watch and i have seen it twice but,i have seen it three or five times and i can still remember it vividly i am a fan of the original and i have seen it many times
1,this is not the type of movie you should watch but it 's a good one,this film was so good that i could n't even get to the theater and walked out
1,and i do not believe the director 's vision of the,and i have no problem suspending disbelief in the end
1,at one point in the story we see the young man 's body and he is reunited in a,at the end i was convinced of a movie about a group called the filthiest of the two
1,the acting was horrible and the plot is just plain stupid and i do n't even,the film is a little slow but it has a very interesting and interesting story
1,walter brennan is excellent in a role,walter matthau is a revelation as he is
1,in fact it 's not that great,in this film the actors have a great
1,btw the movie is n't really a comedy,btw the film has no real plot to speak
1,i have seen this movie several times and i still love it so,i was so impressed by that and i had to watch it
1,there is a very good scene in which the two guys,there 's no need of any explanation of the movie
1,i was expecting a movie that i would like but i,i was so excited when the first one was released
1,i have to say the acting in the whole movie was great and the writing is very believable and the characters are all very believable especially,i think the reason i gave it a 1 is because it is a very poor movie and it 's just not a good idea
1,entwined with the help of an attractive woman who is the only one who is a bit of an achievement and a very attractive one,entwined with the help of a young woman who is the only reason to see the film the first thing that i have to do with
1,and it 's not that the film is bad,and the acting in this film was horrible
1,antonioni was a master director and a filmmaker,antonioni has a great sense of humour and the
1,performance was a little weak in the movie but it was n't that bad to be expected,performance in all of these movies is a very interesting and very entertaining film that will appeal to
1,the film is very slow and slow,the acting in this movie sucks and it
1,since the film is a complete mess it has a good story,since the movie is so much better than it should be
1,a few years ago i saw it again and it still holds a place to me,a lot of the scenes are shot with the camera and lighting but it is a bit
1,also a few of the characters were interesting and the movie did have a few moments to keep it from going into a coma,also the film 's main drawback was the lack of a coherent story line and the fact it is not a comedy or drama or
1,there are some funny parts but there is n't much to it,there are a lot of things i do not like about this film
1,crow 's is a very funny movie,crow 's character has a very similar role
1,the movie was n't a bad movie,the story is a simple one
1,in the end i felt the need of an extra of the same kind,in the end the story is not so good it is not funny
1,and that does have a lot of problems,and it 's not a bad idea to make
1,i was surprised that the movie was not made available in the uk but the director and producer decided that it was a,i was so disappointed that this was a movie that was so stupid and stupid that i could n't even finish it
1,the story was so stupid that you could n't even care less about the plot line or the acting,the acting is good but the acting is horrible the script is awful and there is no plot at any
1,i have to say that i was very impressed by it and it is a very,i have to say the film was a waste of time and money and money
1,i do not know if it 's just the fact that it was made in the first place,i do not know if it was intentional to get to the point where they were making it but
1,obviously the film is set in the same location as the first one,obviously the film 's biggest success was the fact the film had to do
1,the film is not only the most controversial movie ever but it also has,the movie was a bit too slow but it was n't too good
1,last and not the first time the movie is a long time it is n't a great movie,last year i was able into a film that had been done by the author and i have been
1,how did the guy know how to tell you how to act,how many of us have been able to find the remote
1,people have to say the movie was bad,people are saying that it was the best film
1,the acting in this movie is terrible the script was awful,the film is a little slow and boring at times but the
1,i have n't read the book yet but i think it 's a good idea,i think it 's a shame that this is n't the best movie ever
1,charlotte rampling is the best in the film,charlotte rampling plays the young woman with her own
1,hey it 's not the worst film ever,hey i 've been watching the movie
1,beyond that it was the worst movie i,beyond that there are two main problems
1,what i did like about this movie was the fact that it 's a very bad thing,what i got was a film with a lot of potential to make up a minute
1,at first i did n't think that this movie would be a good movie but it is,at one moment the camera is on camera work and then it is on the verge
1,it has a good plot and a decent cast,it was the first movie to have been made in
1,the story is a little weak but there is some very good action sequences that have a good cast,the movie is not a bad film but a very interesting and entertaining film that is not only a vehicle
1,the movie is a very funny movie that i would watch if you have not seen it yet,the story of the story of the famous man is a little too familiar for a movie of this
1,it 's the only way i would,it 's a very bad thing
1,i have never seen a worse actor,i do n't know if it is the
1,ben stiller is a fine comedic genius,ben gazzara is one great character and he
1,now i do n't have the words that the film is supposed for,now that i have seen this film i have to say it is a
1,the story was very simple and very very very very interesting and very interesting,the story is about two people who go to a house to find a new
1,anyone with a modicum memories and the ability to see this movie will,anyone interested in the genre or any other film will be delighted
1,last year 's eve is a great show,last year i was looking for something to watch
1,ok i do n't think that the film is a masterpiece,ok it 's just a bunch that is a little over
1,if i was the only child who would have liked this film the acting would have been better,if i were a fan of the book i would have given this one an 8 if i was
1,wells 's direction and direction is superb but it 's a bit too slow,wells 's direction is a little slow but the film is so bad it makes
1,in fact it has the same effect as it was in this movie it 's not that bad,in the first film the main character is a man with a conscience and he does n't want to
1,aside from that the movie does n't make a lick of fact,aside this was a pretty good film with some good action
1,i was so disappointed with the movie,i have seen a lot worse than this
1,as a result it 's not a movie that is n't worth a rental,as a movie it was a bit of a disappointment and i would n't recommend
1,i have seen this movie many times over the years as it is a classic of,i was surprised to discover this was made in a small town in the uk
1,overall it is n't a bad movie but it 's still good,overall this is not one of the best movies of the year it
1,i think it 's one of my favorite shows,i do agree that i am a big fan of
1,the film is about the same thing as the first movie and it 's just not as much fun as the other two,the film has some nice moments in the movie but there is a bit of a lot more than a couple of other characters
1,an excellent movie that i enjoyed,an excellent film that is worth watching
1,a few of the characters are good but the story is so weak and predictable that you 'll find the,a lot happens in the movie but it is a very good film that makes you laugh and cry
1,stray is the most beautiful movie i ever saw and,stray from hell i 've heard about the movie
1,yeah i know it sounds like a bad film but it 's still a good movie,yeah it has a lot of good things to it but it is a very bad movie
1,apart the fact that the director of photography was,apart from that the story is pretty good
1,this is one movie that i will never forget about it,this is a film that is a little over the top in
1,a few scenes are very funny and funny,a lot happens in the movie but i do
1,anna paquin is excellent as the heroine of the movie,anna is a great actress but i was so bored
1,i was so bored that it would n't even make sense in the end of my review,i do n't want my money to be wasted but it is the best movie ever made
1,in the first film we get the same feeling of the same old man who 's,in this case the movie is about the power of the people in the movie
1,viggo mortensen was a bit over the top and i thought that it was a bit overdone at first,viggo ackland plays a young woman who 's been married to an older woman who has been married
1,although i was not impressed with the story and the story the characters were all believable and the story line,although the film is not a masterpiece it 's still a very enjoyable movie that has been done well
1,yes it has a lot going in but the plot is very good,yes i know it is a bad idea but it 's not
1,the acting and the direction are very poor,the movie is a very good example for a
1,several times the film is set in a small village where a couple,several of the characters were very good the story is very good
1,in the end he is not the best actor in the world but he 's,in the movie he plays a very good and very very very straight guy
1,there are so very many movies that are made in the,there is no plot to be found in the film
1,i think it 's not a bad movie if it is n't bad enough for it but it,i think that the director should be ashamed for his own work in a more mature manner
1,he is a very good actor and is a great character actor,he is not a bad guy but he has the worst of a
1,the story is very good but the acting and the plot is so bad that i ca n't believe i wasted,the acting is good and i think the director should have had the director and editor of the film more
1,i was expecting something more like a remake,i think the film is a little more enjoyable
1,avoid this movie at your cost if your a fan of,avoid this at all unless you like a good movie
1,my favorite parts in the film are where the girl 's daughter is trying to get to the house and she,my favorite parts were the ones where the two boys are talking to the guy that they are talking about
1,i think the director should be commended for this,i was n't sure what to watch but i was
1,the movie was a little slow but it 's not a good story,the film is a very interesting film and the director 's direction is excellent
1,i think this was the worst film of the decade,i think that it is the worst film i 've ever
1,it is the worst of the series,it 's the kind of movie you should
1,basically a movie that is n't even a good film,basically it 's a very good story with a great story
1,then the film starts out with a,then there was some nice cinematography
1,if you are a huge fan you will find this movie very disappointing and not even worth a rental,if you want to see something like the real life of the director then you should definitely see it
1,fortunately the film does n't seem to have the same impact of a real life as the other,fortunately i have n't seen the original but i do n't think i 'll ever see it again
1,after seeing this film you will have the impression that the,after seeing it i thought it was a good movie
1,the film has a lot of problems with the main plot but i think it 's a great story,the acting is horrible and i do think that they are supposed as though it 's been done in a
1,imo it was not as good as i,imo it 's the same old movie
1,get to see the first one and then the second and final chapter of this film is just plain,get to watch it and you will be laughing at the end when you 're talking about it
1,in fact it has a lot of problems with the,in the end the film is not as good
1,at least i would have been more impressed with the movie,at least the actors in this movie have a certain amount
1,all the actors were good in a movie,all i can say is the acting
1,widmark 's character is a little bit too unlikable but the film,widmark is a very talented actor and is the perfect actor
1,another thing i liked about it is its lack of realism,another problem is this is n't a very bad movie
1,spoiler the movie has a few good things about it,spoiler alert it has a very interesting plot line but the
1,i'm glad to see that this movie has a good,i'm not saying that it 's a bad movie
1,the film was made in the seventies and,the movie is not a good movie
1,but the real thing is that the film does not feature much in,but the film 's main weakness lies in its lack of focus
1,the film is about a woman trying,the film has an excellent story
1,much of the film was made in color in a small rural village,much more than the usual fare it is a film that has a very
1,for me the best part of this movie however is the way,for a while i was surprised that this movie was made
1,but it does n't have the same effect as the other two,but the film has a very interesting story that makes it hard to
1,pay attention to the film and the story,pay attention and then the movie is about as
1,i do n't know if this film was intended to appeal but,i do n't think that the film has any redeeming features
1,acting was good the story was good and it had a good story line,acting is bad the story line has a very weak plot and the acting
1,i do n't know how it 's going for the movie to make sense but it is a movie worth watching,i think the director was making a movie about a bunch of teenagers that are not a dime and a bunch
1,thank goodness for the first hour and a quarter of the film,thank god i did n't pay for this one and that 's all
1,and i do not know where the movie was filmed,and the acting in the movie was very poor
1,for me i have a feeling of disgust for the director and the,for those of us that like me you will probably enjoy it
1,i think the reason i did this movie was because it had to do,i have n't seen the first two but this movie was very good
1,would you want a film to make a movie about how bad the movie is,would n't you know that there was a real threat in the world of this film
1,it 's not a bad movie it 's just not good,it was the most boring and boring film ever made i have
1,that 's the only reason to see this,that is why this film does not get a
1,my favorite parts of this movie were the first two,my advice to anyone who enjoys watching this show
1,but the film 's main flaw with a film that is not a film is the,but i think this is the best movie of the last decade of my life
1,what 's more the movie 's main character and his friends are the two leads who do n't seem to be very,what is the deal with the story of a woman who has to deal with her own life as a child
1,this movie is not for everyone,this is a very good and very
1,but the film is n't so bad it 's good,but this is a great movie and i think it 's
1,she was n't the most likable person i have ever seen,she is a good person but her husband and daughter are so
1,her character is so annoying that you wonder if the director intended to be an intelligent person,her character was so annoying and so unlikable it was almost impossible for me to watch
1,to say that this movie was a waste for the first time is a good thing,to make matters worse i was surprised to find this film was not even a good idea
1,i have to admit that it was a great movie,i have never seen the original but it was the best
1,those of you interested with the same thing will probably be,those who are not familiar with the story are missing
1,i have n't read a lot of books and seen them on tv in the early days,i was surprised that it did n't get a theatrical release at the time and i have n't
1,there 's no plot and it does n't even come close to,there was a good deal to be found in the original
1,every time i watch this show i was laughing at the jokes that,every time i watch it it is so bad it is good
1,however it 's not a movie,however this is not a movie that
1,this film has the best of all,this is the best film i have ever
1,in a movie like this i think it was a mistake,in the end the movie is a little too long
1,the movie was a complete failure to watch and it 's only,the film has a very good plot and a good story
1,if the story is about the same guy who 's in the movie,if i were to rate the movie as an 8 i would
1,and i do not believe that this is,and it 's a very good idea
1,then the two meet in the middle of the night and it takes them all,then the movie is a bit of a mess but it is still a good film
1,belle is a great character actor who has a good role,belle is a young actress who 's not a very good actress
1,there are some good points but the rest is just a,there is also a lot of violence to the film
1,when i first heard that this is a comedy about the,when i saw this i was very excited and disappointed
1,for those who do not like this film i would highly appreciate this,for those who like to watch a movie with no real substance and no
1,at least that 's why the movie is a bit long,at one point the movie is a little too much for the
1,mask and the whale has a lot of action to it which is why i liked this,mask is one of the worst movies i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through
1,the film is a very good movie,the story of an aging woman who marries
1,by the end of the day it 's a movie that i could n't,by the end you 'll have no idea how to make this movie
1,also i think that the movie has a lot of good points to it and,also i think it is very hard not to compare it for a movie
1,instead the viewer gets a sense as they go through the motions and the film takes the viewer out with it,instead of being a little bit too much for me it 's a bit of a shame that the movie never got
1,erm i have to admit i was n't impressed by the movie,erm i have to say that i was n't expecting anything more than
1,zombi 3 was a huge hit in 1993,zombi 3 is one of my favorites
1,the story is simple enough to warrant the viewer attention from a young man who 's been kidnapped,the movie has a lot more to offer and more than just a few moments of dialogue
1,ok so i do concede that this movie is n't a total waste of time and a total,ok i know that 's a little unfair but this film was n't a good one either
1,wow i have to say i was,wow this movie was a joke
1,the movie is a complete mess of a story that is not even worth mentioning,the acting in this movie is horrible the script sucks so the movie has a lot
1,it 's just a shame that the film is not available for sale,it is a great show that is a must see for any fan
1,another problem is the lack of a plot and characters who are not even developed in a realistic way and are completely underdeveloped and boring,another problem is the lack of any real story and character motivation that is the main reason i do n't like lucy 's character
1,this movie has a lot of action and some of it is pretty well executed with some very good action sequences and a great ending to it,this is a film that is not a total waste of time but it does n't make sense and it is a great movie to see for all
1,well it is n't a great movie it 's not a good movie it just is n't a bad film,well i have to say it has a lot of problems but it 's a very enjoyable and enjoyable movie
1,when i watched this movie i felt like i could n't stand the movie in any theater,when you have a chance you can find a way to go on and make you feel the
1,goodnight and a lot of the same thing that made it so great,goodnight is an example of what the movie is trying to accomplish
1,let 's face that the director did n't have a clue of what the director was,let 's just start by saying that the film has some good actors and actresses
1,the movie is a complete waste of money it is not worth the effort to be a fan,the movie was a little slow and the ending was predictable as well and really really bad
1,you can see the actors playing the same character,you 'll never know what the hell was wrong with
1,it 's not even the best movie ever it has been a long long time since the last movie,it is the worst movie i 've ever seen and i do agree that it is a total waste of
1,i think this movie should 've been made in a,i was surprised to find this show on video
1,and that 's the only thing that,and the movie is so boring
1,now that the story is set out for a long time and the characters are n't the same,now that 's a good thing but it is a very good movie and the acting is good and
1,but the film does have a few redeeming factors,but the movie is so bad that you just want
1,there are so few movies i have seen that,there was a lot to like about it
1,one can say the acting is n't that bad but the acting,one of his better films in the world of the genre
1,strangely it was a very funny and funny show,strangely enough the film does a great deal of research
1,i'm a fan like a good guy who is a little too much to be,i'm a fan and i am a fan of the series of the series
1,a good film for a sunday afternoon,a few scenes of the film were filmed
1,yesterday i was in the mood of this film,yesterday the movie is set in the us and the
1,i do n't think this is a good movie,i have n't seen this film yet i do have
1,but the real star was not that it 's a film,but the film is so bad it 's almost embarrassing
1,hey the film has some nice shots but there,hey it 's the best of the bunch
1,this is the first of a trilogy,this is a great film to watch
1,why did the writers not give us the opportunity,why do i think this film was made for tv
1,however the film is n't really a good movie,however the film is not about a young girl who
1,handsome and beautiful is one such an excellent film,handsome people in a small town and the local police
1,he was n't a good guy and he was n't a,he was a little too much to be ashamed of
1,this was a very bad movie and the acting was terrible,this movie has a very bad script that is just plain bad
1,i do think that the movie was very good,i do not recommend the movie as a whole
1,and the film 's plot was a bit too long and the ending is too confusing to follow,and the movie is so bad i ca n't believe it was made on dvd so that i could
1,you know it 's gonna take a,you can get into the story
1,if i had n't seen it the first time i could have been,if you want a good movie that 's worth seeing and enjoy
1,some of these are the most interesting parts of the show that have a few good scenes and some great acting from everyone including the main character,some of them are just so bad that they just seem to show the actors in the end and then there 's the fact of a good script
1,please do n't waste your time,please do yourselves a favor and rent
1,while the story was interesting it 's just not a movie to make,while it is a bit dated it 's a bit slow and slow at
1,dustin hoffman is a good director who can make the movie accessible and he does a good work with the material and his performance,dustin ifans is a very talented actress and is very convincing in his role and he 's a very nice guy in a very small
1,he is the most talented person in hollywood and that 's why the,he 's just plain bad and he has a very bad voice
1,in fact it 's a shame to see such a great movie,in the end he is the most annoying and stupid guy you have
1,the film is a complete bore and it 's just plain stupid to watch,the movie was shot at the same location and the camera angles were pretty grainy
1,in the first film there are many things that have,in a way it 's just a good movie
1,the story is very simple and very funny but not a good,the story is very interesting and there was some good acting
1,after all this is a movie about a group who is a bit of a joke,after a while i was n't expecting much from this movie but it did n't
1,all in all it is an enjoyable film,all in the family 's films are the best
1,young and old are the best things about the movie,young man is one that i would love to see
1,it 's just a bad idea to make a movie that,it 's the only thing you can get out there
1,i do n't want to be a fan but i was a,i think this movie should be watched as one to watch
1,time is not a movie for everyone,time was spent on the film but it
1,the acting is good the writing and directing is good,the story is very simple but not a bad one at
1,evil dead 2 was one that was so good that i actually felt like i,evil dead ii is the most boring and dull horror film of the year
1,it 's a shame because the film was a bit too much for the first hour of it and it was a little too,it is not a movie that i will never forget but i have a lot to think about the film and the acting
1,they were all in a very good movie,they 're the kind of people you 'd want
1,two of the main stars are all good,two of the characters are so likable it is
1,anybody who has seen it will want it to have been made available in the uk,anybody interested to see the film would be a fan of the film 's history
1,so if you are a fan of this kind you will probably,so what if the director was trying to make a film
1,i have never seen such an amazing film in a million days,i think the director should have made the movie more interesting
1,i was surprised to see that the movie has no redeeming,i do not think that the movie is so good
1,the film was a waste on a movie but the,the movie is a very interesting and interesting experience
1,thumbs up and do n't get it,thumbs away from the film and the story
1,either way it 's not that bad but it was a bit like the first movie,either a few scenes or the other actors in a movie are n't really good
1,i think the movie is a little over the top but it does have its charms to,i have n't seen this show yet but it 's still a good movie to view

1,there is no way to make this film a masterpiece but the acting is excellent especially the one where the film is a real treat to watch,there are some good performances in the film but the movie has a very good story that is n't really about the evils of a war

1,despite the title of the film it 's a pretty good movie and i liked it a little,despite the presence and a good performance by everyone who was involved with this film it was a waste
1,the story is a bit confusing and it has a lot to do,the story is about a group who are trying to get married to a
1,his performance is a bit stiff but it is,his wife is the one with her son
1,it 's not even the best of all,it has a great cast of great characters and
1,the story is a complete bore and the,the film is not a bad movie
1,moreover the movie has a good deal of action in the end but it 's not a bad movie either as,moreover i think the film was a bit slow and i did n't really get to see the whole movie
1,maybe it would 've been better but it was not,maybe it was the director 's intention to make a movie
1,there 's also some great scenes in which a man is murdered,there are many scenes that have nothing going for it and they are
1,in a movie that was supposed for children and adults alike,in the end i did n't think that was the best of
1,i think the reason why i gave it 1 stars is because of the fact that the,i do agree but i do n't think that the director could be the same person

1,this movie was a waste on a movie,this was a movie about the evils and how
1,the movie is about a young woman,the movie is very well made
1,the film is very well acted and,the movie has a great soundtrack
1,sylvester is one who has a crush on the young man,sylvester is the only character who seems like he was a real
1,i have to admit that i am a huge believer,i think this was an awesome movie for me
1,at least the original version was a little bit of the same as it was,at the time of this one 's release i was n't sure if it is going
1,i have to say that it is a very enjoyable,i have never been so disappointed by a movie
1,it is a shame that this film,it was so funny to me
1,the acting was horrible but i was n't expecting much,the film is a little too talky to be enjoyable
1,it 's not a bad idea for an action movie and the actors are n't very convincing and the plot seems to,it 's just that a bunch of kids are talking about their own problems and the whole world has been forgotten
1,saw this film at the 2005 sundance international film festival and was pleasantly surprised at,saw the trailer for this film and i must admit the acting was great
1,its not even the best movie ever,its a shame the movie is so bad
1,the film is a little slow but the film does n't have,the movie was a complete waste for me but i did

1,as a result of this film 's popularity it is still,as for the film it 's not a bad movie
1,whatever you think it was the worst movie ever made it 's a,whatever it was i was n't expecting a lot of the movie
1,bingley is a good character actor,bingley is the only one to be
1,the movie is a bit of a mess but the plot,the acting is good but it is a bit bland
1,i have n't read the manga so far and it is n't even worth mentioning that it was a bit too long,i do n't know if this movie really was a bad attempt to make the movie seem like they had to be made
1,i do n't understand why they did this,i have seen the movie twice and i can
1,uncomfortable to watch a movie that was n't bad,uncomfortable with his own family and the family
1,are they really supposed to be a little bit different from,are the characters really supposed to care about each character
1,mary steenburgen plays a character who does,mary astor plays her usual role
1,none of this is particularly interesting,none of the characters were believable and
1,we are left with the same impression as this one is in the book,we 're supposed for a film to be a comedy and it does not work
1,some of the acting is n't that special,some of the scenes were so bad i thought
1,in this case the director has no idea what to expect,in a way i do n't know why i was in the
1,studio execs have done a good job,studio executives should be embarrassed to be able
1,but the film 's only redeeming value to,but the movie is so much more
1,if the movie is a good movie it would have been a great movie,if it were n't that the film was made in the first place it was
1,this film has a very good cast and the story line is very good too but there are some,this is a film that i would recommend to everyone and anyone interested in the genre should see
1,i was expecting a movie to get a good laugh,i have to say that i 've been a huge fan
1,as i said earlier the movie is a bit too dark but the film is a bit too long to be a thriller,as a result the plot is pretty weak the characters seem to be trying to be a little too clever to make it a
1,as a result of his own life the family is a bit more than a bit too eager,as a matter of view i was n't impressed at the end when the credits rolled up
1,nothing really bad happens at this time,nothing really bad and it 's just not
1,there 's also some good action and the acting is excellent,there is also some great performances by the supporting cast including the
1,chris farley was a good choice for the role of a young stud who 's been a little too much for the last 15 or 15 seconds of this film and i do n't think he 's the only actor that is the least bit convincing in this movie and it 's not the fault that i did n't see him as the lead,chris kattan plays the father of a wealthy man and his father and son and father is very good and the story itself has a great cast that is very well done but the story and the characters are all so predictable that they are just boring in their roles and they 're all just plain stupid and stupid and stupid and stupid
1,so what if they had to be done,so if i had to pick up my brain
1,this is the kind to make you think,this is a very good show for a few
1,there is no way that the director should get,there are some very nice moments in it
1,he is a good actor but he is just plain awful and that 's,he is a good man and is a real person who is willing
1,by all means the film is a must see for any fan,by now the film is a bit over a hour and the film
1,dan aykroyd was a good choice as the villain,dan aykroyd 's acting was excellent as the villain who
1,whoever wrote this script should have had a chance of seeing the movie for,whoever wrote this script should be ashamed of the need of a sequel
1,of course there is a certain amount to it,of course there is the usual hollywood style of the
1,screenwriters have been able for a few,screenwriters have done a good thing
1,tears and geeks do n't get me wrong i love this one but i do not think that a movie is better,tears and ears were not always the same but they did n't really have the same strength as it could be
1,naturally the movie does not have to have a lot to,naturally this is a movie with a lot of laughs
1,this is a film that will make people cry and laugh out of it as,this movie is a great piece for a movie and it is very good
1,hardly a movie that could n't even,hardly the best of the bunch
1,i do n't know if the movie 's makers were,i do n't know what this movie is about
1,actually this is a good movie,actually i think that it is a
1,somerset sinatra is the only actor in a role who is able to convey emotion in the film as the film unfolds with,somerset is a man who is a master of his craft and he does n't want the money to be in this
1,it 's not even the worst movie that i can think it,it was a very interesting movie that had to be made
1,good thing about the film is that it 's not,good luck is the best movie i have seen
1,if i were to give this movie a score i 'd be generous to the director and director,if it was n't for its lack of budget it was probably better than most of the budget
1,most people will not be able for the movie,most of these movies are so bad they 're bad
1,his character is a little bit annoying,his character is a caricature that is a
1,bill murray is a fine choice,bill pullman is great in this movie
1,the film has some very nice scenery and some nice touches,the story is a little thin but there is a lot more
1,dressed up as a very nice and very interesting film the,dressed in a black robe and sporting a white mask
1,i do n't know if this film was made for the reasons that were so popular in the us but in the us it was very,i think it is a shame to see such films as these are so few films that have a good cast and a good script
1,it 's a shame that the movie was made in the early 1990s,it 's a great movie and one you 'll definitely appreciate but it 's
1,i have seen it several many times,i have n't seen a movie that has
1,prey is a film about an aging man who finds himself embroiled by a group of people who are a group of people and,prey has a great cast and it 's a shame that the film has not got released theatrically in the uk and released
1,in the end it 's not a bad idea to make,in a way the film is not a bad thing
1,we 're supposed as if the director wanted to see the first movie,we 're not supposed to feel sorry about the characters in this movie and
1,instead of the usual suspects they have a,instead it 's a very boring movie
1,its a shame because i was expecting a lot from the film i was n't disappointed,its a shame that the filmmakers did n't even have the decency to do it
1,did they have to have the money and the money and spent money to get it,did i get the feeling he was the only one who had to deal with his character
1,she is the one and only actress in the movie,she is the one who gets killed by a werewolf
1,the acting was n't great but the acting was ok,the movie is a complete mess and the acting is atrocious
1,however the film has no redeeming quality and is n't even a good movie,however the movie is a little too long for its time as the story is
1,the acting is very poor the story is weak and,the movie starts as one thing is the same
1,well it 's a movie with some good acting and a great plot and a,well i do n't want to spoil it for anyone who loves the book
1,the story is simple but the movie is a little,the movie was a little too long for me
1,ten minutes into this movie i was just hoping the film could get worse the plot,ten years later the young man is murdered by a gang that has been murdered
1,the film is a little too long for its subject matter but the,the story is very interesting and it 's easy to understand why
1,the movie is about a man who is,the film has a very good story
1,his character is a bit underdeveloped and it 's a bit of fun to sit right through the whole movie without being too stupid,his character was the only one that could have played the lead character in this film but he was n't given a chance to play
1,the acting is good and the story line is good but it was n't that bad,the acting is good and the story is good but the acting is horrible at best as
1,every time i see it it is so sad to see the whole world,every time he appears in the film you 'll have no idea how he feels
1,the story was so stupid and predictable that it was hard for me,the movie is about a bunch of people who are sent to a party
1,the movie was made in the early seventies and was probably a little too long for the most of us,the film is not as good and is not a good film but the story is good and it 's not
1,did anyone know where to start,did n't you ever see the movie
1,very little to say except that the movie is not a complete waste of your time,very little of the same goes for a good movie and i really liked this
1,jack lemmon is the best of all,jack nicholson is a great actor
1,as a result the film does have a few moments but the plot is n't really a lot of the time,as a matter of seconds i have to admit i am glad to say this movie is a little bit of an
1,as the movie opens we are treated to endless scenes of the main protagonists walking,as a result of the film 's popularity it was a very good film
1,it 's a very funny film and the acting by all involved is,it 's not a good idea to be taken from a film
1,bradford dillman and james coburn were the perfect complement to each other and their performances were excellent and their acting is excellent as is,bradford dillman is excellent in his role but his character is so bland that i do not understand what the director is trying
1,so i guess it 's unfair to compare,so i do n't have a problem
1,the acting is pretty good and the story lines really make sense,the movie is about the same thing as a child and a teenager
1,so if i had n't seen it it would be the same,so if the film was n't for the good of it i might
1,may be the first film to be,may not have the same plot
1,both films offer the viewer to see the film in a very different context,both of those films were made with a budget that was so bad that it
1,i think that it would have been a good choice if the film had more,i do think that this film should be shown on a rainy sunday night
1,let 's face the ending the ending is a little anticlimatic as the ending contradicts itself as a whole the movie has no real connection between it,let 's just say that i have n't seen it in a long time but i do n't think i have ever seen a worse film
1,still i do enjoy the first two movies and this is one of the best of the lot,still this is a great movie for the entire cast and crew of the movie to have a very
1,in the first half the movie was shot in a studio and was shot in,in the movie the actors were not given much to do with the script
1,this is a film of sorts and a great one,this movie does n't have a lot to say
1,creative license and you have to see it to believe the film is n't,creative license to a very low level and the film is n't a total disaster
1,precious little boy 's mother is an,precious little girl in a movie
1,add to this the excellent performances from all of the cast and the story is a real winner,add to it the fact of a couple of scenes where the killer 's character goes to the house
1,watch this movie for its own sake and you can tell that it has been made by the bbc,watch it with the kids on it and you 'll be able to watch this movie and enjoy them for
1,you have to watch it to believe it and that it is n't,you have n't even heard about any movie that is n't so good
1,however i was not expecting much more than this,however i was n't expecting much of this film
1,we get to know the man who killed him but he never knew anything of it,we have a lot of people who are trying to get their lives together and the story
1,maria has a nice relationship that is n't quite as complicated as it is a film of a kind and a good one,maria and her husband are both a bit of an awkward and affluent couple who have a relationship with a woman and a younger
1,there are a number in the movie like the first one,there are so many things wrong here that i could n't bear
1,watered up and the movie is a complete waste of time and money,watered up and the movie is about as much a classic a snapshot in
1,if you want to see a good movie that 's a bit too slow for me,if you have n't read the book you will find the story a little weak
1,in the end the movie was just a bit of a letdown,in fact the film is not only a vehicle to be on a
1,after seeing it the movie is very entertaining in its approach but the acting and writing were so bad i,after the film was over i was n't sure if it was a bad idea or what it was
1,i have never been so disgusted by this film and the only reason i gave it 3 is that it 's not a total disaster it is n't,i have to agree with the other reviewer comments that this was a very poor movie and i think the only reason that the movie was made was because
1,within minutes the movie is set up for a very long time,within the same time the film has a great cast of characters and
1,then there 's the scene with the dog,then the movie is set in a lab and
1,this film is so bad i ca all,this is a very bad attempt at a film
1,that said i did n't care about the characters,that was one reason to love this movie
1,the movie is about a group of people and the hardships of a man who has been killed by a man,the film is about a group who are trapped in a remote island where a group of survivors have been evacuated
1,there is no reason for that and it just does n't work,there 's nothing in this story to be taken from a book and
1,so what if it was n't,so i do concede that this is
1,however the plot was so weak and so predictable that you ca ca n't even tell,however the film 's only redeeming value is that there is not a moment of originality in
1,it has been said that the movie is not about the same kind of character as the book,it 's a shame that this is n't a movie for everyone who wants to be entertained and entertained
1,the film has some nice shots but the story does not seem to work well,the story of the movie is based solely around an old man who is trying and
1,we 're supposed to feel that the film 's only purpose was to make a point,we 're told to believe that he 's a man but he is not afraid
1,the story line of course is a little confusing,the film has some nice moments and some good acting
1,in fact the only reason i gave up on this,in fact the movie is not a good one
1,though the plot is a lot of fun to say the least the movie was pretty good for the time,though the film has a lot going on it is a very enjoyable movie that is a must see
1,first the film 's title refers to a lot of people 's,first of the film is a bit of fun to watch
1,director robert benton 's direction was so poor and so bland,director robert benton is a director of the original novel
1,the story of this story was very good but the acting was terrible the story had a,the film 's main drawback is to make a movie that 's not even remotely entertaining
1,for a while it is a little slow and boring and not even remotely funny,for those who have never seen this movie you can see that there are some similarities
1,he 's a good director and he has made a lot of movies,he 's a great actor but he does n't have a lot to say
1,one of my favorite films ever,one of the few movies that could
1,it was a waste of time and time,it has a lot more to offer and is
1,and that 's what makes the film,and the ending is very abrupt
1,after all the story is a bit of a mess,after all these things are not explained in the film as
1,we have a very young woman who is not only an innocent woman,we are left with a good sense of the story and the characters
1,it 's the story that makes it so great and the characters all are likable and believable and it is easy enough,it was so bad that the only good parts of that were that it was n't even a good movie but it did
1,another thing that i did n't notice is how much the story was,another reason why this is the most boring film of all time
1,does anyone know where to start with this movie,does he really have a good body to work with
1,as a result the movie has been released in many schools but i do not recommend the movie to anyone with a sense,as i said the film is n't a great deal of work but it is still a great movie and i think it is
1,there was a lot to like about this movie,there 's a lot to like about this movie
1,if you have n't seen it then do n't,if you want to see the real world of the
1,meanwhile the movie begins with some of its most gruesome murders but the rest stop the film from a completely dull,meanwhile he meets a group of kids who are n't even in the first movie they are the best ones
1,at the beginning of it all the,at least the film is entertaining
1,hopefully the next time i watch it,hopefully the movie was released somewhere
1,you 'll never know that it is n't the best,you can see the actors playing a different character
1,the story of the movie is a little weak but i think it 's a good,the movie was a complete mess of a story and i did enjoy the film
1,i do agree with the reviewer who said this was the most horrible film i ever had to sit through i,i do n't think that the film was ever intended as a comedy but it was very funny and funny
1,moonwalker is a film that has a great cast and it 's a shame because it is so good and so good,moonwalker 's character is the most irritating and most annoying character ever to grace the screen and it makes no sense
1,no it 's not that bad,no it is the worst movie ever
1,if you 're looking for the worst horror movies ever seen in the history this is a must see for you,if it were to make the film look realistic and i could have a bit better i 'd be a little more
1,location is a good thing but not a bad movie,location is a very good film and the music is fantastic
1,i have to say the movie was pretty good but i,i think the movie 's best asset was the acting
1,that 's what the movie is about the film is not about the evils of the world and how it,that said the film was a total waste and i was n't sure whether it was a bad movie
1,in fact the only good part about this movie,in this case the movie was a very good movie
1,a very good movie with a very good cast but it 's a,a good movie for a good laugh at it 's unintentional humor
1,this is the best movie of the year,this is the kind of movie that i would
1,and it 's not the least bit of a comedy but the fact that it is a film that is a complete mess,and the film 's main problem is that the film is n't a complete failure and it 's not even worth the time it
1,i think the film is quite good but it is not as bad,i do not know how this film could have been so much better than
1,the story of the film is a bit confusing and is n't as interesting or interesting but the story is a bit,the movie is about as much a documentary as the book of kells and the film is a very good movie
1,horrible movie that was not made in,horrible acting terrible script terrible acting
1,the story is about two men and the relationship between two men who are married to each other and,the film is about a young man who lives alone in an isolated hotel in a remote town
1,sometimes i think the director should have been shot in an old school and the actors were n't so much better suited to a better script,sometimes i think this movie should have had a lot to do with the first two thirds of the movie the plot and characters are very well
1,there is also an excellent amount more than one scene where the characters get into a conversation with each of these people,there is a scene with a man in his underwear who is a little nervous and the scene where he 's talking about
1,the movie is very funny and it 's not funny it 's just plain funny,the acting is horrible and i 've been watching it many times since the beginning
1,i think that the film was very good in a sense,i was n't really expecting much from it but was disappointed with
1,we get a very interesting glimpse of a young man trying to survive in the world of his own life,we 're talking about how the movie is going to be funny but it does n't have to make it into
1,incidentally the story is not a little bit of,incidentally it has a very long running gag
1,unbelievable but the movie is n't bad,unbelievable and stupid this is one movie i
1,anyway this movie is a waste of your talent if you 're a huge collector of bad movies and,anyway i do n't know what this movie really is about but that is not saying a lot
1,that was the most ridiculous part,that 's the only reason to watch
1,i do think this is a great movie to watch if you are,i do not think the movie would have been so much funnier
1,of this film is the fact that the movie was a complete mess,of course the film 's main character 's name is a bit eccentric and
1,a good film that i would watch over the years,a very interesting film with great actors and an excellent cast
1,however the plot is a little weak and the ending was n't even remotely satisfying,however the story is n't too good and the acting was n't very good either
1,i have never been a fan of the show and i do n't like,i think it 's a shame that this film is not for everybody
1,think of the fact that the director and writer of this show is a very talented writer,think of a better movie and a more enjoyable movie to watch and i have seen better acting
1,having seen this movie i was surprised to find that the director did a great injustice,having seen the trailer for the first time i had to see it to find the right
1,helping to get the message across the country,helping the viewer to find out who the killer
1,apparently there are some of the best movies of the past few months but i think it is one of the better,apparently the film 's success in the us version of this movie is the same as a lot of other films of this
1,this movie is a must see,this movie is a great example for
1,the film is a little bit boring but it is a fun movie to see,the story of a girl and his daughter 's relationship is a very interesting and very
1,i think the reason this show is because it,i think the movie is a great film
1,hats down for the movie to get you to think about it and you 'll have to be a big fan to find it anywhere,hats off to him as a man who has been in love and has a crush on his family who is a very good guy who
1,babes are the best thing in this movie and it 's not that it 's not,babes are n't always the most popular and the movie does a good enough to make the
1,2022 is a film about two men who are,2022 is one of my alltime favorite movies
1,and the film 's plot is a mess,and the film has a very nice cast and
1,to me it was n't a good film,to be sure that i was in a theater
1,the film has no redeeming feature and i would recommend this to any horror buff who is interested in the history and culture,the acting is horrible the story is awful the acting is awful and the story line is a little weak at best
1,i have n't laughed once and never will,i have never heard about this movie and i
1,mr bean has a good time in the movie as the lead character,mr and mrs smith is a good actor and is very believable as a
1,carradine is the most annoying actor of all time,carradine plays a young man who 's been diagnosed for
1,but it does n't matter that much of the movie 's story,but it is a good film to be seen by all
1,and it is a very good movie to see if it is n't for its technical qualities,and the movie is a little bit too dark for its own little purpose and not to have
1,the story is simple and the story line has some interesting twists,the acting was horrible and the plot is just plain stupid
1,i think this film has a lot of problems with the script,i do n't want the audience for this to be a good movie
1,for a long time he has to be the one who is in the movie,for the first half hour the story takes a turn for a little more then the
1,as a matter the film is not only the worst film i 've had,as i said it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,naturally i was expecting something more of a horror,naturally the film does have some good parts
1,it 's a shame to watch this movie again and again,it 's the story and acting of this movie that makes it
1,it 's not that i think this is one movie you can watch and,it is the story that makes this film so unique and so compelling
1,the story line is so bad that it makes you,the movie was a complete waste for my life
1,if you 're a big fan of the series i recommend this movie for all ages of all,if it was n't so bad it was funny and it 's not that bad but it was n't
1,still it was n't a good idea to have a,still the film was a great disappointment to me
1,on the plus side the film is a very interesting,on top it all is the same old time
1,the film was very well done with some,the movie has a lot of potential
1,here 's the plot of a man 's life and the world of his own,here 's a few minutes you 'll never get out of your seat for a second
1,what is the deal with this movie,what 's worse is this was the first
1,they 're not even the slightest ones,they have to be in a movie that
1,i was n't expecting much from the movie,i think this is a movie for kids who
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and money,the movie is about a man named benjamin who is in
1,i was surprised that this film has been made by a group of other people,i do think the director should have made a movie like that in the future
1,the movie was shot at that time and i was,the acting is horrible but that does n't matter
1,bart is a young man and the father of,bart is the best thing about this film
1,her acting was pretty bad but i was really disappointed with the acting the whole movie is a mess,her character is so annoying that i ca only imagine that her character would have played a character in her
1,the story of the movie is very simple as well,the film is a little slow and boring at times
1,it 's the only thing i can,it 's not a bad film
1,william holden and john cleese are excellent as always but i ca do not think they 're the best in it,william powell and his wife are the only good things in the movie but the movie does a good job
1,as for the film it is n't a great film but i think it 's not a bad movie,as a result the film is n't very good and i do not recommend this movie for anyone interested at
1,i have n't seen the first two films but i 've seen this movie,i think this movie was a waste on a razzie and it was n't even
1,bonafide films like this one are the only redeeming quality of the film,bonafide movie goers have to admit the movie 's shortcomings are the ones that
1,you 'll be surprised by this one and you 'll be able into seeing it,you know what i mean but i ca n't imagine how this film could possibly be
1,but i think this is a good example of how to do,but i have to admit that this is a good movie
1,looking at it for the first ten years i thought that this film,looking for it on dvd it 's a must see for all
1,this is the kind that makes the movie so good and the story is so interesting,this was a movie that could have been better if the director had been in a position
1,laurent is an excellent actor and a great actress,laurent 's character is a real hoot to me
1,this is a very very funny show,this movie is a must see
1,no it was a good idea,no one could have a movie with
1,honestly i would n't recommend this movie to anyone but,honestly it 's the worst movie i 've watched
1,instead of the usual hollywood fluff the story,instead it 's a very boring film
1,this film is not worth a look for,this movie was so bad it was good
1,i have never seen a movie where the characters are all so annoying,i do n't want the movie to be made in the us
1,the story line was a joke and,the film is not a comedy
1,the film has no atmosphere and it is n't even a story,the story of a girl who has been kidnapped in a brothel by
1,to me this was the best of all the columbo films and it was a very good film,to be sure i would n't be able into the film but i do not want it
1,i think it was a waste of time,i have seen this movie several dozen years ago
1,when i was a child this was my first time,when i saw the trailer for the first time i saw
1,the film is a very interesting and entertaining film,the film has a very good soundtrack by james horner
1,i think that 's what this movie was like,i think that the movie is a bit over the
1,what is with the way he 's portrayed,what is this movie about the story of a
1,however this is a film that will not disappoint,however the story of a man 's life and his
1,multiple maniacs are the only ones who can be excused,multiple people have been in the business for a long time
1,pintilie who has the most important part of a film is the fact it,pintilie is the best character in this series and he does it well
1,i'm glad i was n't in the mood for the ending but this film is so bad that i could,i'm not sure why this movie is not a remake but a film that has a very good cast
1,this movie was not for everyone who saw it,this is the kind of movie that i can watch
1,the movie has an allstar cast that is not very well suited for this type of movie,the story of the movie revolves around a bunch of young men in their late 20s and early
1,i was so bored that i was so irritated that i was able,i was expecting a great story and i was pleasantly surprised at the ending
1,the acting was good and the story was pretty interesting,the story is simple and it has a lot going for
1,a few years back i was looking for a good,a very good film with some good action sequences
1,the film 's plot revolves around two young men in the middle of an,the movie is a bit too long and too long and too predictable
1,i think that the best part is the scene when the two girls are talking about how they 're going to be in,i do agree with most other comments about how this movie is a bit slow but it was n't a bad movie
1,this movie is one that i can only imagine that the makers of this garbage thought was making a movie,this movie was a total waste and i would have to disagree that the film is a total waste
1,spoilers spoilers ahead the plot is n't that good and the acting was n't good either but this movie did,spoilers ahead i was a fan of his work but i was n't really expecting much more from it
1,a few years later the film is a bit of a disappointment,a few years back it was a bit of a letdown
1,it 's a very good story and the acting and writing,it 's a pity that this was n't a movie
1,the acting in general was good,the story is very weak and the
1,the movie is not a comedy it has,the story was n't too bad either
1,foolishness is not a film about the war and its aftermath,foolishness and other factors of the movie are the ones that are
1,this was an awesome movie that i had watched,this film has no redeeming features at least it is
1,36 minutes long it 's just that the movie is so bad,36 minutes of the movie is a bit of a waste
1,the movie starts with a bunch of guys who get killed off a bunch and,the story is about two women living in the same country and each other
1,whenever i was a little girl i was so bored i wanted to watch,whenever it 's supposed the story line is n't really about the action
1,but i have n't seen the original version but i have seen the original one but this one is so,but the film has a very good cast and a good story and good acting by all concerned actors
1,how can you go wrong and the film does n't have to be that bad,how many times can i say that i have to say i am so impressed by
1,well it was n't a bad film but it 's,well it 's not as good as the book
1,yes there is a lot to say the least but the movie is n't as funny as it sounds,yes it is true to life that the movie is n't as much fun as a film but it is
1,consider this a good film and i hope you get it,consider the fact this is a movie about the real world
1,i think that the director should 've been more interested if he,i was surprised that the film is a bit too long
1,if you are a big fan like myself you will probably like,if the movie was n't bad it was n't that bad
1,most of them are just plain stupid,most of it is a little slow but
1,all the actors are excellent and i do not think that a good actor would be able in a movie to,all in all a very good film with great acting and a very good story that is very well written
1,during the course of this movie you get an idea that is not a good idea,during the movie you see a bunch of people walking around and talking and talking
1,zissou is an old woman with a severe heart and a conscience,zissou is the only person who can be forgiven for his own actions
1,i was so excited that the film had been released,i have seen it many times and have seen a lot
1,if you want to see something that is n't a great film,if you 're looking for something that is n't bad enough you will
1,i do agree but the movie is a bit too much of what is needed and is a little bit more interesting,i have n't seen this movie but i did find it to the movie to be one of those films i would like
1,nearly every episode is about the power of the characters and the situations of each episode,nearly every episode has a few moments that are so funny that you will laugh at every
1,abel is the only person who can identify with his,abel 's character is not a very good one
1,should i be able to see the same film as this,should we be grateful to the people in their life
1,recognition of the director 's chair is the fact that the movie is a complete failure and,recognition of course was the fact of that the film was made for the sole studios
1,we have a lot better to work on,we get a glimpse of a young man 's
1,it 's just that bad and the acting,it 's not even the same movie
1,just a bunch and lots to make this movie a masterpiece of a classic classic,just as the movie starts off the way we 're treated by an interesting and interesting
1,if the film does n't get any better it 's a great movie,if you are looking for something to watch in the past then you should
1,she is the only person that has ever graced the surface of his own life,she is a very talented actress and she is very believable as the woman in this
1,they are both funny in a very funny and,they have the ability to make a movie
1,but the real reason why this movie was not released was the fact that it,but the movie is so bad that you just ca n't help but laugh
1,and the ending was just a bit too predictable,and the film is not about a group that has
1,all of this makes the movie even,all in all a great show
1,this is a film that will be a lot like,this movie was a complete disaster in my book
1,ever the less the movie was shot in the same location,ever again i have to admit that the movie has some good
1,then there 's the fact that the movie,then the movie is about to start
1,granted it has been done in a thousand ways,granted it 's the only thing that makes a film
1,all in the name of this movie is a good one to watch and i do not know if i was watching it or if you are a big fan,all the other characters are very good the acting and the direction all contribute a lot to the film that is n't as exciting or interesting as the other
1,it 's a pity the filmmakers did not make a movie that was made in the first place,it was n't a great movie but the fact it was so funny and the actors were so funny
1,it is a shame that it has n't been available to dvd,it 's not a bad movie but the acting is good and the
1,now the film is not a comedy and the acting is n't bad but there are some pretty awful special fx,now i know that it 's the best movie of it 's kind and the best of all it 's the worst
1,needless to add to this film it is a film that will,needless to say i was n't expecting much from this movie
1,eric stoltz plays an excellent actor,eric stoltz as usual was the perfect
1,based in the book this movie is a remake of thunderball and it is the story of a man who has been,based on this one i was expecting a great story with great actors great characters and a story about a man
1,the acting is pretty awful and it 's not even a good movie,the movie starts as a comedy with a few laughs and a lot of
1,i think the film is a little bit too long and i would have,i have seen the original and it has a lot more of it
1,but the story of the movie has been told and the film is,but it 's a good thing that i have to say it
1,when i saw this movie i did n't know how i was going,when he finally gets the courage to go into the night club and his
1,unfortunately the film 's plot is n't really a good,unfortunately it does n't have a lot of laughs
1,i have n't read the novel and it 's not as good as the book,i think it is one of his best movies and it is a shame that he
1,izo was a very good film and i liked this film very well,izo was an excellent film that i had seen in the past
1,she is a great singer but i,she is also in a class
1,do yourself the favor to the movie and you,do n't get fooled by the critics here
1,the acting and direction were so bad i could,the acting and the story are very poor
1,check out this movie if your a fan,check out this movie for the fact that the
1,we 're told that he 's a werewolf who is not afraid to be the killer and,we get to see the first film in which the film takes itself far less seriously
1,this film is a very good one and i hope that you do n't get it,this is the worst movie i 've ever watched and i have seen it several many times
1,everyone else is either a stereotype,everyone else was either a bad guy
1,the film has a few moments where a little bit more of a comedy but the film does not flow well,the acting is horrible and it 's hard to see why the actors are so bad they 're all good
1,he 's the only person in the movie,he is a very talented actor but i do
1,first of all i have n't read the novel,first of alli is that the only good thing in
1,it 's a shame that such a great actor is wasted,it has a very good story and the acting and acting was
1,however the movie was n't bad,however the movie is a very entertaining
1,was it a dream for me,was it a comedy or an action
1,for a movie made by someone in hollywood it is a great film,for those interested into the history this is the film for everyone
1,the film is a complete mess and the acting and script was terrible,the story is about a young woman who is a little more mature and
1,it has a good cast and a good cast,it was the first of the series to show the
1,they are all so good that they are all good actors,they 're the only two people in their life who are willing
1,andrea is a great actress and she is perfect for the part she plays,andrea and her husband are the two roommates who are the ones in the family
1,but this is one of the few movies,but it 's not a bad film
1,this was a very good and very good movie,this movie was made for tv in the early 1980s
1,job of course is that the film is a,job is not a movie that is n't
1,when i was watching this film i realized that the film was a complete mess of mine,when i saw this i had to rewind it and i was n't impressed by this movie and
1,do yourself a favor watch the original,do you know what i mean
1,not only is he a great actor it is a very good film that is a must see for anyone who enjoys good movies,not only does it not work on its premise but it is still very entertaining and very funny and the acting performances are good enough
1,even when the movie is over and over the whole thing just makes me angry,even though it was a complete failure and i was expecting a little more than i
1,you can see that the director is,you have to see this film
1,although the film is not as good or better than it is in the first half,although the film is not the best of the lot it 's still pretty good
1,he was a good guy and he had the,he has the best lines in the movie
1,the movie has some great moments and some really nice moments,the film has an underlying sense to it and it is a
1,as a movie it 's just a waste of time,as for me i was surprised that the film had such
1,it is a movie that is n't a total waste,it has the feel that it was intended to
1,plus the movie 's plot is very interesting,plus it 's a very good movie
1,she was a great dancer and she is the only one that,she is a very good actress and i really love her
1,however the movie is very entertaining,however the film is a little bit
1,no one can deny that the movie was made for the sole purpose,no matter how much money i paid my money to rent a dvd
1,how many times have we heard about this movie,how could it have been that a little better
1,nowhere to have been a complete success in this film,nowhere else in this movie you have an improbably and utterly
1,noone has a problem with the story and the story line,noone is allowed to accept the fact he 's not a good
1,one can only imagine a movie like the original the first and the second is n't as bad as it is but the movie,one of his better films and a lot of his work in the future was a bit more fun than most of them
1,ac 's character is a caricature of a man who has a crush on his own and has,ac is the best of this movie as he is the one that makes him a character
1,some have commented that it is n't a good movie to me,some of them are so bad that it 's funny to see them
1,soon the film starts with the same story of the first,soon the young man returns home to a new home
1,she was the only one that kept the,she 's just plain annoying and annoying
1,this is the kind that the movie is trying,this movie was a total waste of money
1,the movie is a very interesting one,the movie is not a complete disaster but
1,the film 's story is about a woman named kisna who is a woman,the movie is very funny but i think that the film was made in the
1,poets canyon is an excellent example of the kind of film that i would recommend seeing,poets is the story about two men in paris who live together and have a relationship with
1,this movie is so bad i just could not care less,this was one to see the first two episodes and i think
1,knowing the real world is not the greatest movie of all time it,knowing that it is not the same person as in a lot
1,why do we need the money to make movies,why do they have such an awful relationship
1,visually it 's the kind of movie,visually it was a good movie
1,that 's what i got to be a fan of the original,that 's a shame because the movie has a lot going for them
1,stay far away from this film and,stay away and avoid this movie
1,but it is a very good movie and it has the feel to it the way,but the film is not about the subject matter or it is about the characters
1,talking to the camera and a couple of people in a field and,talking about the movie i thought it was a pretty good film
1,very little is said to be the,very little of it was made
1,i think that 's what i got,i was so disappointed that it was canceled
1,paddy considine was a great actor and i think,paddy considine as his wife was very good
1,incest was n't the only scene that seemed like a real snuff movie,incest and violence are all there and are all the more disturbing
1,great acting great acting and the music is,great film and i recommend the following
1,wagner is a master who has never seen the light on screen and,wagner and his crew were also a bit too much for me
1,the movie is a complete mess,the acting was n't too bad but
1,watching this movie is not a good thing to do,watching the show again on tv is a delight
1,kiefer pleasence plays a very good character,kiefer sutherland was a great choice to play
1,there are some good moments in the plot but it does n't work,there was a good deal in my life but i was n't really sure
1,i was surprised at how many movies that i have watched in the theater,i think this is a movie that should be watched by everyone who enjoys a
1,i do n't know how this movie ever got a,i do not want to give this film away
1,if you want to watch something good this film will be for you to find,if it was n't so much more then the first film it would have made the
1,songs are very good and i do n't,songs like a rock song and dancing
1,yes the film does n't seem to be a complete waste,yes it has a good story and some great actors
1,i do think that the movie was a bit of a stretch for the viewer,i was expecting a movie about a man who was killed by a woman
1,too bad it did n't get a higher score,too many people have n't seen this film
1,nolan is the only one in his entire career who has been able at the end and his character is not a good guy but he is,nolan 's direction is also very good but the script is very good the actors look very good and the script is a bit too thin
1,it 's not even a movie,it 's just a little bit of
1,well this movie is not a great,well it is n't a movie
1,movie is not as bad but the acting is good,movie is not the best but it is definitely not
1,to me it was a good movie and a lot of fun,to be fair i have to say i have seen a number of
1,all i can say is this one was a complete disappointment to me,all i have to say about it was that it was a good idea
1,naturally the plot is very weak,naturally it 's a bit slow but
1,one thing that really bugged the most was how they were all,one of the best things about the movie is the music
1,this is one of the worst horror films ever made,this movie has the same kind as a lot more than
1,so what i was expecting was the first time i saw it i had a good time and did n't know what i was seeing and i was n't bored,so the story of a young woman who is a little over a hill is a real pleasure to watch but her character is too old to be believable in her
1,peter o'toole plays a character whose name is based in the novel of the same title,peter falk was a great actor and i thought he did a great job of acting
1,the film has a lot of action scenes but it 's not a good movie either as a,the acting is horrible the script is awful and the direction was horrible the camera is awful
1,kids and dolls are n't bad enough for a movie that has no real connection to the original,kids are not the only one who has a crush on the film and it does n't have the
1,two of my favorite movies of all time,two of the best movies ever made
1,as a result the movie has a very good ending,as a movie it fails to make any attempt for a
1,as a result the film is a bit slow moving but it is n't as bad,as a result the film is not only a visual feast but a good one
1,chuck connors is a great actor and,chuck connors is a great actor
1,the movie is about a group of young men in,the story was a bit too weak for me
1,i was surprised to see the trailer for the film,i have to agree the first time i have ever been
1,naturally it 's not a bad movie but it has some funny moments and some really good acting,naturally the film is a bit slow but i think it 's a very good film and i recommend
1,dead calm was a good show but it is n't,dead bodies is a movie that i can only watch because
1,overall i think this is an interesting film,overall it was a pretty decent film
1,thank the norse for bringing the world of war on the streets to be a great place,thank god i did n't get to this movie at all and i was so disappointed
1,the acting in this is terrible,the story is about an aging young
1,that 's what i was thinking,that 's why it 's so funny
1,but the film is n't so much of that as it 's a little bit more than that and the story line,but i was n't sure what to say i was n't expecting the usual suspects to be a bit too stupid
1,the story line is very simple the acting was very poor,the movie is a complete mess with a few laughs
1,who would n't like to see this film on dvd,who cares about the characters and how they 're going to
1,using his own voice to the role of a child he 's a real person in this world,using a lot like the other two thirds is a great example for a movie that is not only
1,that 's the best thing about this show it is the same,that was a good thing because the story was so weak and so
1,much of the film 's dialogue comes across as contrived and contrived,much like i said i did n't care for the characters
1,i think the movie 's biggest problem was the acting,i have seen it three times now but i do n't
1,despite the fact that it has a few good moments it is n't really a good,despite the presence of the actors it 's a very nice film to look for
1,at the same time a young woman is killed by her parents and is confronted by her,at least the original had a good cast that would have worked if a little less
1,it 's a very bad movie,it is a very good movie that
1,i do think the movie would 've worked if they had n't had it in the first place,i was so bored when i saw that the first film i was n't expecting to be a good
1,what i liked the movie though it is the fact that,what i found interesting is that it has no plot
1,as for me i would have been a bit,as for this movie it 's not bad
1,what 's more interesting is that it is n't so,what 's more i can say about the film
1,more than just a few scenes in which the characters are introduced as they 're being shot and the,more like a movie that 's supposed and it is a movie with a few twists and turns
1,the film is about a young boy who lives in a small town with the family and is constantly living with his parents,the story line is a little weak but the characters were likable the plot is intriguing the direction is excellent and the direction is
1,the film is a bit slow at best,the story was so predictable that i could barely
1,happy gilmore is a great movie that is,happy days is a very good film
1,the film has a very interesting and interesting premise to it and the story of how it is going to be a little bit of a good thing,the story of this film in my humble view of the life in the book was very interesting and i thought the ending of it was a bit too
1,my favorite character is that of a man named missy who is the only person that,my friend was a fan of his work and he was a very talented man
1,even the actors were n't bad enough to be a good movie,even when the movie was n't as good it 's just a bad
1,hence it was n't even that funny at all and i think it 's one hell of a ride,hence that is a very good film and i do think that the film is very good in the way
1,there was a scene in which the hero is talking about a man in the woods with his mother,there 's a scene where the hero 's daughter is killed in a car crash with her boyfriend
1,the acting and directing was superb,the film is a very funny one
1,when the movie is over and the acting is horrible the movie just seems to have been,when the movie is about it 's the music it 's the music and the music
1,the acting was horrible and there was a lot more of them,the film 's plot is a simple and confusing mess that 's not
1,there was a scene in which a man in a mental hospital is asked to be killed and then a man,there is a scene where the two men are in their undies and they are forced to leave the room
1,when you watch this show it 's not that it 's not,when i watched it i had to rewind the video store
1,the story is very simple and the characters all have a real feel of their lives,the story is simple enough to warrant a few minutes of the time and the characters are
1,oh yeah it 's the same guy that made me a little girl,oh and the last 15 min of the film are pretty good too
1,to me it was a waste of my time,to be fair the movie was pretty good the plot
1,no it is n't that great and that 's what the film does n't,no matter what it 's the plot is so thin that i do n't think
1,when i first saw the trailer of this movie i was a little,when the movie is n't over the head you get the point
1,this is the best film i have seen in quite some long time but it is,this film is one that you should watch for the first forty or 10 minutes
1,though it 's the first film i have ever seen in the history of the genre,though this movie was made in the early seventies it was a very good movie
1,we 're told that the story of the movie 's history is,we 're told that we are not supposed for a sequel
1,i do n't think that the film is a masterpiece,i was expecting a lot more of this movie
1,with the exception of that it is a very good story with a very good story but it 's still very enjoyable and,with a few minor exceptions the movie is a bit of a stretch to the eye but it 's a fun movie
1,the story of this movie is so simple it 's almost a satire,the film is about a woman who 's a little girl who is a
1,if you 're a fan of the genre you will find the movie very,if you want to see a great film that is a good one
1,finally i found this movie to be a complete waste of time to waste,finally the film is a little too long and the ending is a complete copout
1,the movie starts out as a typical slasher thriller,the story of an innocent man who is a young
1,someone else is just as good,someone who has a heart and love
1,however the film 's biggest weakness of this was the lack of originality,however it 's not a great idea to have a film that is so
1,the story of this movie was just as well developed,the story is about a group called the lost world and
1,he was also the only one to,he 's just a bad guy
1,it is a movie about the hardships of life and the pain that,it 's not that it was n't bad enough to be funny
1,the film is a complete mess,the story line is very interesting
1,this film is a great example for the first time and,this film is a must for fans of the genre
1,this is a film that will not be forgotten by anyone who has ever seen a good horror film,this is a movie for everyone who likes the book and if you 're looking for a good movie
1,i was expecting something from this movie to be a movie,i do agree but i do have a problem in this film
1,considering how many people have been involved this movie has been done so well that they can do,considering how much the film does n't do justice to the book it is not a movie
1,it 's a shame because the movie is n't as great,it 's just that the movie was n't so good
1,they are not the best of all their stories and,they are the most interesting characters in their life
1,i have to say that it was very funny but i think this movie,i have seen this movie and i have never seen a worse movie
1,i think it is a very good movie,i was so disappointed that this was a film
1,film has a lot of good ideas,film is a very good thriller
1,it is the best movie i 've seen,it 's a pity that the movie is so
1,this movie was a complete disappointment and the only good part was,this is the kind to be made in a movie theater
1,in fact it 's the most boring film ever made,in this one the main character is a very good guy
1,with the help of an attractive young woman she is a bit too old to be able into this world,with the exception being that the film does n't work out well at least the filmmakers have a good time to
1,however it is not as bad as the first one,however it is the best movie i have seen
1,and it 's not even funny,and the film has the feel that
1,it 's a pity that the film did get released on,it was n't that bad it was a bad movie
1,only the acting in the film is n't bad,only a few scenes are funny and it is not
1,uncharacteristically the plot was n't that bad,uncharacteristically i think this is a very low
1,that is the only reason i can remember when i watched this film and it was a very pleasant,that 's a shame to say this is one of the worst horror films of the 90 's
1,sadako 's character has a very small role,sadako 's character is a very interesting woman
1,gypsy is an intelligent man with a heart of mind,gypsy 's father is a little too eager for the role
1,these are the two things i 've seen from the first film that i 've never seen in my life and i have seen,these guys were the ones that gave the movie a lot to be a little too long but they had a good script
1,total crap and not worth renting for a rental rental of,total recall i was surprised at the number of people that made
1,he is a very good actor,he 's just a bit too old
1,bill pullman is a good actor and he 's very good in this role,bill pullman 's performance as the main villain is just as good in this film
1,again the film has a few funny,again this is a great film
1,other characters in the movie are the most annoying people in,other characters are introduced and they 're not as funny
1,howard 's character was the most interesting and interesting thing he did,howard brackett is a good director and he is a great actor who
1,still this is the best movie i ever saw and it 's not just that it 's not the best,still it 's the worst film i have ever had a headache in your eyes and i 've been waiting till
1,the movie is a very interesting one,the story is very weak and the characters
1,i'm sure that the movie would have been more entertaining if i was in my teens,i'm sure that i am going through a lot of movies but this is a great one
1,not to mention that the film is a bit too long to make you want to spend time watching the movie,not only is this movie a complete mess it 's a complete joke and i do have to say that it has
1,but this is a film that is n't a complete waste of time,but the real reason why this was the first of the series is the
1,star trek episode is an excellent episode of the series and is a,star wars was the first of the series to be a classic
1,behind a camera he is a very good guy and he,behind a few minutes the film is a complete mess
1,perhaps it 's because of its low,perhaps he is a good person
1,a good movie that is a good film,a good example was how the movie was made
1,it is not the same as in other shows,it is a great movie that is not for everyone
1,a lot of the scenes are shot in slowmotion,a very interesting story with great acting and a good
1,actually the film does n't have to have the right balance between the two main protagonists,actually it does have a very good cast of good actors but they do not make any
1,the film is about a group of men that are,the acting is horrible and the plot is ridiculous
1,rebound is the only film that has the power and soul of its predecessor,rebound was an excellent film and i hope that it is available to the library
1,even the music was a bit too long,even the acting is awful the directing and directing
1,i think the director should have been more careful,i think the film is a great film
1,or maybe he was n't a good actor,or maybe the movie was just a vehicle of
1,i do not think this is an example to,i was so excited to see this movie
1,one can also say that i have a problem with the movie,one of the most underrated actors in hollywood is the legendary orson welles
1,george c scott plays the young man and his,george lucas is a genius in this one
1,but the film is so boring and the acting is so awful,but it 's a shame because the movie is so boring that it
1,dakota fanning is excellent in her part,dakota fanning is a great actor
1,i was expecting a movie with the director and director but it was not that bad,i was n't expecting much but i was surprised at some of the negative reviews
1,oh and the scene in this one,oh yeah i know the story of a
1,i was so impressed by that,i think the director 's intention is
1,now i am not going into this film but i do n't think it 's the worst movie ever made but i,now i have to say that i am a huge believer and have been watching this series since the first season
1,i do n't know why but it is not a movie to me,i was so excited when it came out in the early nineties
1,i have never seen such a terrible movie,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,mr beetle was a very good choice for the role he was given,mr and silent bob fosse is a great actor who has made a great
1,code 46 is the most boring movie i have ever had the displeasure,code of fury has a lot of potential to be a classic
1,shot in a small budget it 's a film that is not a very,shot in the early 1800 's the film has a very low score
1,funny and funny but not as bad as the,funny and sad and i do recommend it
1,first the acting was horrible and there was a,first of all i would like the movie
1,all in all a very enjoyable movie,all in this movie was a great show
1,if you are looking for a good action flick then this movie 's worth a look and a lot,if you have a choice for the movie you 'll probably enjoy it and you 'll be disappointed
1,oh yeah i do applaud the actors for having a good laugh,oh and it 's not that i do n't like it
1,he is a man who is trying too hard but is,he is the best actor ever to grace the screen
1,the acting was n't too great and it 's hard not like a movie that has been made,the acting in all of his films is very good but the script is n't bad enough for a
1,check out his films in the future,check out the film and the book is
1,in the first half hour of the movie the viewer is left feeling cheated by the story,in fact the film was shot in a time in which it is set and the camera moves
1,robbed by this film i was expecting a lot of the same kind of humor as the other two installments but the first,robbed of the fact the movie is set in a very small country and it 's not the same as a movie
1,cecil 's direction of this movie makes me feel like a voyeur in the sense that he is a very good actor and he 's,cecil b mayer is a good actor but the film is so boring it makes the film a lot less enjoyable than the first
1,a few years ago i watched this,a good cast of the film
1,and it 's all very good to see,and it 's not a bad movie
1,there are so few movies that are n't even funny and this,there 's also a good deal of suspense in the story
1,i was n't expecting a lot,i was n't really expecting anything more
1,i was so disappointed with the film and,i have seen a lot worse movies
1,so the film is a bit slow and slow but it really makes you think,so what if the movie was n't so bad it 's just plain boring
1,the movie is a bit of a mess,the story is simple but it has a good
1,many people think this movie should be a cult classic and it 's a shame because the movie is,many things are not really explained in the film but the film does n't have any real plot
1,and it is a very good movie,and it was n't the same
1,the film 's main character is a caricature of the young and old woman of a woman who lives in her apartment and is a young woman,the story was so predictable and so predictable it made it difficult not only to entertain the viewer but also for it 's time to be taken from
1,with the exception that it was made in 2001 the,with the exception of a lot to talk about
1,i do n't think that the director was aiming on a film to tell a story but instead of the characters the characters,i have never seen a film that has a linear story and a lot more action and action than the original film
1,he was a great actor and he,he is a very talented character
1,my favorite part is the one that is the only one that is worth seeing,my only complaint with the movie the acting is that the script is so bad and
1,could have been more effective and more believable,could have done without any of this
1,the acting is good with the two main actors who have done better in their careers,the movie is about as bad as the acting and the plot is n't really good
1,viewers of all ages will be delighted by this film,viewers who have n't watched this will be able
1,they are not the best actors in the movie,they are the ones i hate to say
1,it has a great story line and good characters,it 's a shame the movie is n't so much
1,in the first half of this movie it 's,in the end i felt sorry for him
1,worrying that the director and his crew have been making the film for the first 10 years,worrying to the audience that this is a film that will be remembered for its rerelease of the
1,not a bad film but it was good enough to make,not a great story but it 's a good one
1,miller is a great actor but the movie does n't,miller has a lot to do with the role
1,probably the most memorable scene is when the woman,probably the most interesting thing in the film
1,a few of the scenes were filmed on video,a very funny movie that i thought the movie had
1,the movie has some of the most,the acting in all is terrible
1,it is not that i do n't have to watch this film again,it is a shame to see such films as the last of the best
1,then there was the scene in which,then again it has to do
1,as for the film i was n't impressed with the film but the acting was very good and i found myself enjoying the,as a result of this movie 's success it has become a cult following and it does have a very good cast
1,the film has some good points but it does not,the story is simple the characters were likable and the story
1,it 's a pity because it 's a,it is a movie of the week
1,pair the film 's main protagonist is the most famous of all,pair of men who are a little too much to think of and
1,there are some good moments in the plot and some of which were n't as well done as in the book,there are a lot of movies that are so funny and funny that they are all funny and fun to sit through
1,but i do not recommend this movie to any one person who has seen this movie and i have never seen any of his other works,but the film does n't really have a plot or plot it is a complete waste and a complete mess with a capital of the worst movie
1,why do they make movies such a good movie if not a good,why is this movie a little more entertaining and interesting at times
1,you have to see the movie to understand,you have n't got any of them
1,however this is not one of those,however i was not impressed by it and
1,the movie was a bit slow and the acting is not bad,the movie has an interesting premise but the execution and acting are so
1,its a great movie that will make you laugh,its not even worth mentioning the fact it 's the
1,the story of the film 's plot revolves on two men who have been married to a man who has been murdered,the story of a young man who is a bit over an hour of his day and his wife is a very interesting
1,this is not one of those films,this film is a must see
1,there is no real reason for that because there is n't a single,there are some great moments in this one but it is not
1,superman is the worst character in any of these movies but it does,superman is the only film that can be made for the sake that this
1,i do not want to spoil anything about the plot because i have n't seen the first movie but i did n't care,i have n't seen the original version of this movie and i have never seen a movie that is so much fun
1,bolo yeung 's performance is the only reason why this movie sucks so bad,bolo thurman is the most talented actor in this movie and she 's not just
1,now the story is about the man that he meets and the family is in love with,now this is a movie about a bunch of people trying to get to the bottom
1,there are some funny scenes in it and it 's a bit of fun,there are some good moments in it and the end of a movie is just
1,ayesha silverstone is a great choice to watch,ayesha takia is the only reason to make her
1,i do n't think that the actors were able to act like the actors in it and the actors did a,i do n't think that the film has any point in the story but it is still an excellent film
1,yes it 's the worst thing i can remember,yes it is n't a great movie it was a
1,there is nothing wrong about this,there are many things that i liked
1,however the story is very simple and it 's hard to understand why,however it 's still pretty much a little slow and the acting and direction
1,seriously it is n't a bad film,seriously this was a good idea to make
1,the story was n't too bad,the story is about a young woman
1,the acting in this film is excellent,the acting is pretty good with a few
1,the acting in the movie was very good especially,the film is a bit slow and slow
1,in the end it does n't seem to be that the film does n't have the same plot as the book but that 's about the only thing it 's going through,in the end it 's a pretty bad movie that does a good job of explaining what 's going on and the ending does n't seem like it 's going nowhere
1,blah blah i was n't expecting much of a movie,blah blah i have to give you an example of the
1,the film is a bit of a bore and it is hard for a viewer to understand it,the movie has some nice twists but i do not think that the director intended to be a good
1,well this is the first time that you see it and it 's a shame that you have to be in the mood,well i was n't impressed by this movie but i was expecting a lot of fun but i did enjoy the original
1,but the real problem was that the movie was so bad it was,but the film 's biggest flaw was the casting of the actors
1,for a long time i was looking to see what the director,for me it 's a good movie for a few laughs
1,there are a couple scenes that are so bad that you 'll wonder if there are,there are a number of other films where the main character is the main character
1,2 out there the movie was just,2 the story is so simple
1,there was a lot of nudity and violence in the whole story,there is also a very good scene in which the main characters are
1,none other then a few other films,none of this is a problem with a
1,extremely funny and very funny and a lot like the,extremely well written and performed by a young woman
1,when i saw the film on the shelf it was the same thing,when i first heard about it i was very excited that it had n't
1,are we supposed for a real horror movie,are they trying to make it look like they
1,if the director had a chance to do the research of the film he would 've been able to make it a more interesting film to make it,if it were n't enough to show how to be a little more than an hour and a half i 'd have been able for a refund
1,a few of the characters are good and the acting was great especially,a good film for those who want good fun and good fun
1,but the film is a little slow,but the movie is a complete mess
1,however it 's the best movie of the 90 's and i think that,however this is a film that will not be remembered for many reasons
1,aqua is a great actor and he 's not only the best actor of his age,aqua and the rest is just a little too much of an excuse for the film to
1,he is a very talented actor who is a very versatile character,he is a very nice man but he does n't seem able at
1,it was n't a bad film it was just awful and boring and it 's not even worth the effort,it is not even a comedy and it shows that there is no way to go to the movies
1,this movie is a must have,this is not a movie that is
1,spoiler the film is a complete mess,spoiler alert the film is about the battle
1,on the way home is attacked and the police find the killer 's,on a technical note it 's a pretty dull and tedious movie
1,there is a scene that has a little bit of nudity and nudity but that is,there is no way that it is possible to make it to a wider theater
1,this is a movie that you 'll love for a few hours,this is the first of a series of movies from all the great
1,i have seen it three times now and i am amazed that it 's not available on video and dvd,i do n't think that it would be as bad if they did not have it on the air
1,at one time he was in a coma and he was a little bit scared,at first i thought that it would be good but it did n't have the same
1,i was expecting something like this to be a great film,i do n't know if i can see the movie or just
1,all the characters were all very good but they did n't make it like they were in the original movie,all i know is how many people have been involved in this film and it 's a shame they did n't
1,coulda n't you just have the option of watching the trailer for this,coulda n't the producers of any other movie ever got the funding for the
1,this movie is not for me,this was the first of the three
1,in fact i have no idea what the movie 's plot was,in fact it 's a shame to watch this movie again
1,verdict spoilers ahead the movie is about a group of people who have been in a prison for a long weekend for the first time in a,verdict the movie has a few moments of humor and a few moments but it just makes the audience feel like it should have been done
1,so if you 're looking for a movie to watch and enjoy,so the movie was made in the 80 's and the early 80
1,some of them do not seem to be a lot of fun to watch,some people have complained on this movie and it is a great story
1,david carradine 's character was so annoying,david cronenberg is a great writer
1,it 's just a bunch of people trying their best to make,it was n't that great but i found it very entertaining
1,humor was the only way of getting the message across the board,humor and drama ensue in a long long way and the ending is
1,it is the best of its kind,it 's a pity that the film never
1,had the film done it better before the movie,had i not seen the film in the theater i
1,tim robbins plays the part of a,tim robbins is great as always
1,needless up of course it 's not a bad movie,needless to add in the fact that the story was n't
1,joe pesci plays the lead as well but,joe don baker is a great director
1,but the story was very interesting the characters,but this movie is a complete mess
1,all the actors are great and the story line was excellent,all in all it 's an excellent film with some very good
1,ok so the movie has a good premise to be funny,ok so the plot was pretty good the acting and the directing
1,i have never seen such a bad film in a long long long time so this is not what,i do think it 's the best of the two films i have seen in a long time
1,i think that the director should have done more research to create the film,i have n't seen this since but i do have some doubts about the movie
1,almost all of them are the same but the rest of the movie,almost every scene is shot in a way that you can see
1,the story of a young girl who is in,the movie is a complete bore to watch
1,the film has some very interesting scenes but it 's not the same as in the first one,the movie is a little slow and boring and i could n't help but feel that there were some
1,in the end it 's just a movie,in fact it is the most difficult and funniest
1,not only was it not for the faint it was a bit too long for it 's own good,not to forget the acting and the script is so bad that it 's not even bad enough for the
1,considering the budget constraints of this movie i do n't want to spoil,considering this is a film that is a complete waste of money
1,you can see the director mateo who was the one responsible for a few years after his own death,you 'll see a lot in the way this was made and it was n't the case with the film
1,john cusak plays an excellent actor and the only good thing about the movie,john goodman 's performance was the only redeeming factor of this mess and i think
1,the story is very interesting and the characters in the story were believable,the film 's plot is a little convoluted and it is n't a surprise
1,so if you are a big fan like,so the plot is not that bad
1,almost all of them seem to be the most interesting thing i 've seen in any movie,almost all of this film is set up for the first time but then the story goes on
1,final verdict i do not recommend this to anyone,final verdict this is one of the most boring movies
1,no one could have pulled this off,no one can tell him what he is
1,i think this is a great show for kids who have n't seen it since the simpsons,i think the reason why i gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is because of
1,arrange to see it again i can only hope to be able,arrange to be the first movie i 've been looking for
1,well the film has some of its most memorable moments but it,well i was really surprised that it got canceled and released
1,i do n't want to spoil the movie for you but i did n't care for this movie,i think that it is a very accurate and interesting film and it is a must for fans of
1,arguably the worst movie i have seen this is,arguably a bit of a stretch for me
1,by the end you will see the whole movie,by far one thing i did not know about this
1,the acting is good and i really enjoyed the way it was,the acting is pretty good and i liked this one too
1,so what i was expecting from this movie is,so i was n't impressed with this movie
1,all the characters and situations are just a bit too dark and the movie is,all the while the film is a little bit slow moving and very slow
1,is it possible to make an attempt at something more,is this a movie or a drama or something
1,that 's the only thing i can do about this movie i think that is the best thing about it it 's not even the,that is what this movie is all about and it has a great cast that includes the likes of john wayne and john cassavetes
1,based on the story by a young woman who was born to be married with a married woman she has been married with a young woman,based in the book by john wayne and the first of the two films this is an absolute mustsee film to watch with a group that is
1,i have n't laughed out aloud in many movies and i can,i have to agree that i was n't impressed by it
1,if you are a fan of the book you might like this movie but it 's not worth the money,if the movie is n't bad enough to be good the plot is just plain awful with the usual exception of
1,but the movie was n't really a good movie it was n't,but this one has the best of the worst in the genre
1,please please let the kids know it 's a good,please do n't bother renting or buy this movie
1,this was an interesting story about a young woman in the middle class of her family,this is the kind that i have n't seen in years and i 've been a big
1,this is a very funny film and a great one at the same category,this film is a great example of what a movie should be and a good
1,it was n't a bad film either,it 's not even the same
1,he is the one who gets killed and is forced to kill him,he 's not the only one to do it in a movie
1,i do n't know if this is a comedy,i have n't read a book so i ca n't
1,i think it was one that the director of this,i think that it is a very good film
1,i think this is an important point for me,i was n't expecting anything else from this film but
1,this film is one to watch,this movie is a must for all
1,typically this is a very bad film that is n't funny,typically this film has been done so many things in the film
1,if i were to make a film about the subject i should have been left with a good feeling for my,if you want the best movie you have ever seen and you 're a great fan you will be disappointed
1,for a movie that 's supposed as a satire of the book i was surprised that it was a sequel to this film,for the record i would n't say it was the best movie in this genre but it was a very enjoyable film
1,i do n't know why i did this but i have n't been able,i was surprised to see that the director did a good job of bringing the
1,to make matters more clear the plot is not very interesting,to be honest it 's not even worth the time to watch
1,dull and pointless and not worth mentioning,dull and boring and not even worth a
1,i do n't know how to describe this,i think the director should have been more interested
1,my favorite part of the show,my only problem i had with this
1,the acting is pretty awful and the story line is so stupid,the film 's premise is a bit of a stretch but i guess
1,the story is about the adventures and the difficulty of the young woman who is in a mental illness,the film is a bit long but it is a very good movie with excellent performances by the cast which
1,minghella was also the first of the great directors of this type and he 's not the same,minghella 's first film and he 's not a good director and the film does n't seem to be
1,i think the movie was shot at a time when the director was making an attempt to make a statement on the subject of the film,i have never seen the film and i do n't think it was a waste of time to be able i would have to say the ending
1,i do agree but it 's not that i do n't,i think this movie should be seen to be enjoyed
1,salman khan 's character was very good,salman khan plays an annoying man who is
1,the movie is about a bunch of friends in a,the film is a little too talky for me
1,the movie was shot in a very small budget with the exception of some of these actors,the movie was a waste for me the first time i watched it i thought it was a
1,as a movie this was a good movie but the story was so poor and i did n't care about the main characters,as a result of his work he is a little bit of a jerk but the film has a lot of problems
1,the story of an innocent boy and his family in the,the acting was horrible and it was just plain bad
1,oh and the last scene in which the guy who was supposed to,oh yeah the film was shot with the camera lens and editing
1,if the movie was n't that good it would have made it more watchable if,if you 're not into watching a movie you have to watch this movie
1,in the end it was a little bit of a surprise ending,in fact the whole movie has been done before and since it was
1,i think the film has been released on vhs in english,i do think that this film was very good and the acting
1,i was so disappointed that the movie had a few moments,i do n't know what to do with this movie
1,this is a movie that should have,this movie is not worth watching
1,jerry springer has a very low budget,jerry is a man of the cloth who
1,as i mentioned above it is not a bad movie,as for the acting it 's not bad but not as
1,the film is a very good example for a director who is not a talented,the story is about a young girl trying her luck with a young woman
1,having a great cast and crew members and a very young,having a good cast and the actors is also good
1,that is the only thing i did,that 's what the story is
1,if you want something more interesting than you might want to see a film,if you 're a fan of the genre you will probably enjoy this
1,one day he meets a woman named pooja,one of the most underrated movies of all times
1,fortunately it 's a little too long to be a,fortunately the film has a lot going for it
1,in fact i would have given it a zero,in fact the film has no plot and it 's
1,this is a movie for those of you that have never seen this movie,this movie does a lot to describe what i have seen on tv
1,raymond chandler is a revelation as a man of a man in his early twenties who was a little too,raymond massey plays an eccentric young man who is trying too much to save his son from the clutches
1,it 's just so bad that i ca all be entertained by it,it 's not even the worst movie ever made and it 's only worse
1,any of those things are really funny or funny and they are n't funny and the plot line was so stupid,any movie that has been done so much better than this and is a must see for anyone who enjoys a good
1,unfortunately this film has no redeeming features,unfortunately it is n't as much a classic
1,this is a film for those with an open mind,this movie is a must for any fan of the genre
1,the story is a bit slow but the ending of this movie is very satisfying and the story,the film is about two men trying desperately for the love and the one with the other
1,her character is a caricature and the movie 's plot is very interesting and interesting to follow,her character is so stupid it 's impossible not only because she is the only person in the
1,the film is about a young girl who is married and has an accident,the acting is good with a great cast and the characters in their own way
1,true the movie was a bit over rated,true to my review i was very excited about
1,i was expecting the usual suspects to be,i think it 's a great movie
1,and the movie is a little bit slow and slow,and it 's not the worst film ever made but it
1,i do n't know what to say,i was n't sure whether i was in
1,whitney bainter is a woman of a young age,whitney bainter was great in a very small and pivotal
1,indeed the film was n't bad enough to be a good,indeed the film is a complete mess of an ending
1,sure it 's not a great idea for a film and i guess,sure it was a bit cheesy but that was the whole point
1,aside the movie is a complete mess and it is the most annoying,aside from that there was nothing to make a movie like it
1,this movie was a waste of money,this is a very bad film
1,they are not in the film,they 're just not the same
1,in the end it does n't make you laugh and you 're,in a movie like the one that is supposed for children
1,also it is not the worst movie ever,also the movie is a complete mess
1,by the end of this movie i was just wondering what happened,by the time the movie ends i thought that this movie was going
1,it is a great film for all ages and a must see movie,it is a movie about a man who is in a mental hospital
1,the acting in this film is very bad and i do n't think that 's a,the movie was a waste for me and the ending is a bit too long
1,it is not a bad movie,it was the first time i ever
1,exactly what it was is a film with,exactly like that the acting is horrible
1,thandie newton plays an excellent role as her husband,thandie ifans was the only reason why this movie is
1,bourne is a good guy but the movie,bourne is the best of the three
1,but it 's not the best film of,but the movie has no real plot
1,that was the first part of the film that,that 's what it was about the movie
1,the film is about two women living together in their lives in new york and in the middle ages and their friendship,the movie is very slow and the plot is so predictable that it 's not even worth a watch and it is n't
1,the film was shot in a very grainy manner but it did,the film is not as bad it has a few laughs
1,he was a good guy but the movie was so horrible,he is not a very talented director and i did n't know
1,i do n't think that this movie is a waste of,i have n't seen this since the late 70 's
1,i have never seen such films as this one,i have never seen a film so bad that i
1,as for the story line well it was n't,as i mentioned earlier this movie is not a comedy
1,i do n't think that the film is a masterpiece in the,i do think that a movie like that should be seen
1,having a great time i was n't disappointed in the story,having a good time in it i could go on for some
1,anything about this show has the worst acting ever,anything is a good idea to get the film
1,although it is not an oscar caliber movie,although i do agree that the movie is not
1,and that does n't mean it was,and the acting was so awful
1,soviet union has been released on dvd in a long time to come to the united states of the united kingdom and the us government,soviet cinema is not a great movie but the story is very good the acting is great and it 's not a movie that you will
1,the acting in this movie is so awful that it hurts the movie for anyone to see,the story of the kelly gang' in the first of three chapters and the second one is about
1,for those of you that are n't interested at all in movies like this one,for the most diehard fan of the genre i recommend you watch this movie
1,i have never been a fan of any of the actors and the director has done an excellent job,i think the reason why this movie is not the best movie ever is the fact that the director and
1,he has a great sense for the part of the movie and he 's very good at playing the role of a young man who is a bit more interesting than a lot,he is not only in the end of this movie but his own beliefs about the film he 's not a hero and his wife who does n't seem like an old woman in
1,it 's a very bad movie,it is not a movie for the
1,debbie reynolds plays the role as the mother of a rich woman who is a little,debbie rochon plays an actress who gets to be a good actor in the role
1,nevertheless the film is very good and the story is very good,nevertheless the story was n't that interesting and there was nothing original in
1,who is the killer and the killer,who cares about the people who were killed
1,his character is a little annoying,his performance is a joke and the
1,the film is a very good movie and i recommend it for all who like the genre,the movie is a very interesting and touching film with a great cast and a nice pace of
1,second of all it 's a movie about a man who is,second the movie 's plot line is very simple and interesting
1,he is the most interesting character i 've,he is a very good character actor
1,while the movie has a few moments of comedy it is still very funny to watch and the characters are very,while the story was not as good and not the worst i 've seen it 's still a good movie
1,but i think the film is very good,but it 's not a great film
1,for a long time i have seen the movie,for a while i was able to find the movie
1,not only is he a good director but,not that it matters in this movie
1,i have never heard anything about the film before but,i do not recommend this to any one interested
1,when i watched this film i was n't impressed,when the movie starts it 's all downhill
1,i do n't understand what to expect,i think that the best part in this
1,and i do n't know what else the film 's budget could have,and the ending is a bit abrupt as it 's a shame
1,of course the story is a lot of fun and the acting is excellent,of this film is not the best of all the films of the same year
1,the acting was terrible the plot is stupid but it 's not a movie,the story is very good and the acting was superb and it was very good
1,but it 's a very bad idea,but it is not a film that is
1,so i was expecting a great movie,so if i had to give a zero
1,and the movie does not have a happy twist ending that is,and i do n't know why the movie did n't work
1,i was so disappointed that it was n't even nominated for a academy awards,i have never seen any of the actors before but i do admire the movie
1,it 's a very good film and the director 's commentary is very well written,it is not a movie for everyone but the whole family is a bit of fun
1,ok i have to admit i did not enjoy this one too much,ok the film is about a guy named kenny who gets involved
1,in fact the whole movie is so stupid it,in the end he was a good man
1,they are not the best actors in this world,they 're not the best of them but the movie
1,as a matter of view i have a soft idea of the film 's,as the movie goes i thought it could have done a lot better
1,of the three movies they have the most memorable parts in which the two characters go to a,of course the story has some holes and the plot does not make a movie any better
1,the movie was shot on a shoestring,the movie is very slow moving
1,there 's no reason for this to have such a good script,there 's no need that in the film to be the first one
1,our hero is a hero who has been kidnapped with a secret agent,our hero is a young girl who is married with his daughter
1,this movie was a great movie,this was the first of the three
1,too bad it was never released,too often it is not a good
1,so the plot is a little weak,so what if the movie is n't a
1,vito 's character is a bit of fun,vito 's character is not the least likable character
1,bugs bunny and his family have been on a,bugs bunny and his friends were all good
1,the acting is very bad but the plot line is so bad that it is impossible to make a movie like this,the film is about the man and the woman and it is not a bad film but it is still a great film
1,it is not a movie that i 'd watch over all times and never tire of it but it is not a bad film,it 's just that there is a lot more to it and that the characters are n't as interesting as the first one and that
1,the film was very good and the story was interesting enough to keep me interested and i was very,the story was so predictable that i was hoping for a great story to get a good idea
1,pretty much every aspect is just a bunch,pretty soon i found myself asking myself what was
1,however the story was very good and the characters are all likable,however the plot of this film has a lot of problems
1,perfectly photographed with a nice score by pino waxman,perfectly directed by the director and director robert de palma
1,the film has some very good actors and,the film is not a complete mess
1,patterson 's performance was the only redeeming factor,patterson 's character has a lot to do
1,whereas i am not a mormon fan it was a very accurate film,whereas this is a film that is not only a film it is a
1,the movie is a very good movie that will keep your attention and it is worth watching,the acting is good and there are some good performances from all concerned and good characters and a
1,a few years ago the director of photography is still very well known and i think it would be a good thing,a few of my friends have seen this movie so it 's a bit of a shame to see such a poor movie
1,though this movie is not the worst i 've seen this movie is a total bore and i have no,though the film has an intriguing premise and some interesting performances the film also feels a bit too rushed
1,there 's a bit too little of the movie,there 's a bit to say there 's plenty and
1,you know that this is a bad,you have to watch this film
1,i think the film is very good,i was n't sure what to expect
1,what i found most interesting about the film are those that are the most important and most important points of view of how they are going,what a waste for this movie and the only one who has to watch this movie to is the only person who is a fan
1,freddie 's character was a very good one,freddie 's character was so stupid that it was
1,i think that 's a good thing,i was so impressed with that
1,it has a very funny and touching ending that is very,it is n't that it is n't a good film
1,a lot more than the sum above it,a few minutes later we have an unlikable girl
1,robinson is a very handsome actor,robinson is a fine actor but i
1,one of the best things about the film,one of my favourite scenes of all is the
1,the acting and directing are very good and i have seen many movies that are so great that it makes me feel that this film was a waste of time and money,the film 's main weakness is that it is not the first movie that has a lot to do to get the viewer to watch it to the very beginning of the story
1,he is a very funny character,he is a great character actor who
1,imagine the first movie and then the one,imagine the film for its own sake
1,and it 's not a bad movie,and that was the best way to describe
1,and the movie was n't even good,and it does n't have that same theme
1,it 's a pity that this film is only a 2,it is a movie with no plot and no twists and turns
1,as i said before i did n't know that this,as for me this movie is a total bore
1,it 's the story of a man,it 's not even that good
1,as a result the movie does not have a good story,as i said before i have a soft tolerance for a movie
1,we are left to ponder about the film 's story,we are shown in a different perspective and we see the
1,this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever but it 's a good movie and i recommend it,this was an excellent and very enjoyable show with a very good plot and good acting and it
1,if you are looking for a good movie to watch and you can enjoy this movie i recommend you check out the first,if you want a film that is a little bit like an adventure movie it is n't a good choice to start with it
1,the story of a woman who is,the acting in this movie sucks
1,this is not the case with the movie but because the story is n't so bad as,this movie does have a few good moments but it 's still not worth the effort
1,everything is illuminated and the film has no meaning,everything about it was bad the acting was bad
1,and the ending is a little too abrupt,and the movie does not have to be the
1,the movie has some of the most beautiful and poignant scenes ever filmed,the acting in this movie is very good but the story is so bad
1,of all the movies that have made this one this movie should,of course it 's the same old man that he was
1,in the end he is a good actor,in fact i think it was a very bad
1,but it is not a film,but i was n't disappointed by the
1,being a big fan like myself i was very excited when the show ended and the end was so,being the first to die the movie is not only a little bit different but a great film
1,but the film 's main weakness is that it is,but the movie was just too slow and boring
1,the film is a very moving and touching portrayal,the acting was good the story was interesting and the
1,one thing is that this movie has been done by a bunch,one can see the film as a metaphor for what it means to
1,maybe the movie would be better if they had been shot at the same,maybe the movie 's biggest flaw lies in this film and the director
1,perhaps it 's a good idea to make a film about a young girl in a small town,perhaps it 's because the movie was made by a group of friends and they had a lot of
1,the film was very entertaining in parts but it is n't a comedy,the film was made by the same director who made the film a success
1,they were so bad they made me want the,they 're the same people in this one
1,initially the story line was so bad that the film would have made a much more interesting and,initially i have n't seen a film that has the ability of the viewer to be able
1,that was the most stupid part,that 's what makes it such an
1,the acting and direction of the characters were excellent but the story line is,the film has a great cast and the actors are all very believable
1,laughing at the antics that were supposed and failing in the end,laughing at the bad guy who 's not a good actor
1,board the first movie and i have seen a few of the other ones,board the story of two men in the city who are separated from their jobs
1,but it 's not a bad idea to begin to make,but the real problem with the film are the performances
1,when i first read about this movie on the cover of the cover i thought it might be,when i first watched a preview of it i was expecting a good movie to be made
1,i think the reason i was disappointed by seeing the film was that they had to use the camera,i was so bored that it had to be seen to believed that the film was a little bit slow
1,ok so i was really disappointed,ok so it 's the kind that
1,the movie is very slow paced with a few twists thrown at you,the film is a little too long for its time and not for the
1,sage is an excellent movie that is not only for those of us who are fans of musicals and are not,sage 's the best of the three movies but the acting was n't as good as the other two movies
1,this is not a movie to be missed by any other person,this was a good idea for the movie and that is what i
1,mariel hemingway is the perfect woman for,mariel woodard plays her role well
1,the film has a great cast,the acting is good the writing well
1,most of the movie is spent in the middle of a crowded desert building,most of them were not even funny and they were not even funny
1,the film is very slow but it does n't really matter that there is a lot going about this film and the story,the acting was good but the plot was n't as bad and the acting as the movie was horrible and the script is n't
1,after seeing the film and watching it i was amazed,after a long time ago the show became canceled
1,it 's a great film to see,it 's the story about the life that
1,he is a man who has a very good career and is able to,he 's just not the kind of man you 'd want to know
1,i have to say the ending was a bit abrupt,i was n't expecting a lot of this movie
1,i think that the director 's decision for the film 's director is too much to make a,i was expecting the usual suspects to get a little more of them but it was n't
1,could n't they make a better movie out to this,could n't they have done more with the story line
1,the movie is about a man trying and the girl who loves him but the girl has to get to her,the acting is pretty good and the story line is good but not a good one at that it is a little
1,inspired by an allstar cast and a story of an aging,inspired with a very low budget and some decent acting
1,that 's what the movie should have been,that was the first part of the film that
1,this movie has the potential that is the best of all of them,this is one of those movies that you have to watch with your friends
1,i think this is a movie for everyone involved,i was so excited to see the movie in my
1,the acting was good the directing was great,the story line was good and i was expecting
1,two of us who have seen the first movie have a similar understanding,two of the most famous films i have seen in my life
1,this was a movie that i would recommend seeing,this is one of the best movies ever made
1,the acting in all is excellent and the direction of the movie was very good but the acting was so horrible that it was just embarrassing,the story was so stupid i could n't believe the outcome was n't even remotely funny at all and i was n't sure what to expect from
1,sennett 's direction is a little uneven at first,sennett is a genius and is the perfect choice for
1,these are not the ones we see in the movie,these two men are not very good and the movie has
1,they are all very good and are very well made,they are not the best in the world of cinema but
1,third i think that this was a very bad movie and should,third of course it 's just a bunch of bad guys
1,that said i would n't recommend this movie,that 's the only thing that is good in
1,what a waste that it is,what i got to see was a
1,lombard and the rest of her family are in the same room with the same man who is a little bit too,lombard is not the only one in a small town and she is the perfect person for this kind of movie
1,as a result the story is pretty weak,as a result the film is very slow moving
1,ms and her friends are all very good,ms and her boyfriend is a little girl who
1,i think that the movie should be seen as an allegory on the evils of,i was surprised to see that it was n't released on video and dvd
1,hey i do concede the movie is not as bad but it is not that bad,hey i have to say that i was n't impressed by this movie but this movie was
1,so the movie was shot on location with the camera angles and,so i guess that was just a bit of a stretch
1,a good example is that the filmmakers are not able to create an intimate story with the same characters that are in their own lives in the first movie,a very good movie and a good movie to see if only a few moments of hilarity are in the film as it is a bit too long
1,and it 's not that it 's a good movie but a good one,and the acting is horrible as is all that the movie is n't
1,i think this was a good movie,i think this movie is a great example
1,yet it was a very good movie to watch and i was impressed,yet it does have the feel of an early 90 movie and it 's
1,it 's a shame to see this show in such format,it has a very funny scene with the main characters in the
1,he was a good actor and i thought the movie would be,he 's a good guy and he 's a great actor
1,an example of how the filmmakers were able to,an excellent film and a very good film
1,now i have n't been a huge fan ever to be a fan,now i am a big fan of this film but this is the one
1,and the film is so bad and the saddest that i,and that is the only thing i do n't think
1,i do think it 's a great movie,i have never been a fan of the genre
1,so the story is n't too bad but the acting and the story are so good,so the film goes on to be a little more interesting but it 's just a little
1,and it does have the best acting in it,and the movie does n't make sense to the audience
1,even though the plot is n't as bad it 's still a good movie and it,even the most ardent fan base will enjoy this one as much as a retrospect
1,and the movie was a bit too much,and the movie was n't that bad but it
1,his character was a real person,his wife is a little bit too
1,for the first time the cbc was still trying to make a movie about the dangers of war and the consequences that were put,for those of you who have n't seen the original you will be able to see that it has a very similar theme
1,the film is a little slow and the story itself is n't as bad,the acting in general has a good cast including the leads of the leads of
1,i think that the best part is when they are trying to make a film,i do not want my time back but i do n't want to give away my
1,but it 's a shame that it has n't been released commercially in a dvd release of,but it 's just a little bit too slow and too slow for a horror film
1,it has to do is a great movie that is a must see and for,it 's not a movie to be missed by the end of the movie
1,did anyone else notice the director and his actors,did i mention that the film was shot in black
1,bitch and i 'll say it again,bitch and the beast is a very good
1,it 's just a bad bad movie,it 's a pity that the movie did
1,i think the director should have made it to the end of the episode,i think this is the only film that i have seen that made me want
1,other people do n't know how they can make a sequel,other than that the movie was n't even bad it was just
1,one of my favorites is the one that is the most interesting of this movie,one can also identify the dots in a different way that is a very good way
1,anyone who has seen this film will agree that they are in,anyone who does n't have a clue is a good idea
1,so what if it 's not for the good acting,so the plot and the characters were all believable
1,you know what you should have done with the movie,you have to wonder what happened to the characters and what
1,also the scene where a man gets killed by the devil is a joke,also a very interesting scene in the beginning where he says the word of the
1,i was expecting a lot from the movie but i did n't expect the movie as i thought that it would get,i was n't impressed when i watched this film and was amazed that it was not available on video or dvd
1,this movie was a waste of time,this is a very funny show
1,just like i did n't get to see a movie with such a low rating,just as the movie is about as much as a documentary of the world it is
1,the story of this movie in a very,the story was a bit too weak
1,but it is not the worst,but it 's a good idea to
1,i do n't understand how anyone who can be so impressed with such crap can be so angry by such a terrible film that i ca ca n't even,i was surprised to find myself being assaulted by the film 's end of the film and i was surprised by the fact i had n't seen it
1,out on the streets i was expecting something more,out there the movie is a very bad one
1,what i found interesting was that i had a hard time believing,what a shame that the movie was made by the studio
1,s character is so annoying that it 's impossible to believe,s not the best thing to say about this movie
1,it was a very good movie,it 's the only movie you will
1,also the scene when she 's in the movie is a joke,also i have a soft spot on the film as well
1,i have never been a huge fan but the fact remains this is a great example of how to make an action,i have seen the original movie and the original was so much better that i had a lot of fun watching
1,i do n't know if the film is,i think the director was a genius
1,and that is the reason why it 's the only reason why this is the worst horror film ever made,and that 's the only explanation to the film that the film has the same amount to the story of the
1,again i think the movie is a bit of a stretch to the eye,again i have to admit that i did n't have a clue about what to
1,it 's just a little slow and boring,it was a waste of a great movie that
1,marty and her boyfriend have the best lines,marty 's father was a bit of the jerk
1,george brent is one that is n't a big fan,george c scott was the best of the lot
1,after the movie 's title danglard 's character is revealed as a very selfconfident character,after the first hour you 're not sure what it all takes place on but you
1,i have to say i have to say that i was n't a fan of any of the other movies i saw,i have n't seen the film in the last 15 or 20 years so it 's worth a look at all
1,and the movie is a little over the heads of the director,and it 's not a bad movie it 's just not good
1,i think the movie is a little too long for the most part but it 's a good one too and i,i was surprised to see this in theaters and i think it would be great to see it in a theatre
1,you have to be a fan to get a good laugh,you can see the film as a metaphor for the film 's
1,ricky is the only person that can save this,ricky has a great job of making it a great
1,see a film with a lot less of,see this if it is on cable
1,unfortunately the film 's only purpose in this movie is the fact,unfortunately i did find this to the movie 's strongest strength
1,the acting is good and i think the actors are all good and i do,the movie is a little slow but the story and acting are very good
1,a very good film with excellent performances by both the,a good cast of characters and a great cast
1,we get a few glimpses of how we get the idea and the way it is presented,we get a lot from the beginning of this film and we are not really happy at the
1,i think that this movie was a mistake to see,i have seen it three and four and it is one
1,the acting is good but not the best of all,the movie starts out with some interesting scenes and a few
1,if it had to be a bit of an attempt to be,if the movie is n't a good thing it 's not
1,gay men are not the only ones who are n't the least attractive,gay is a very interesting and interesting story of a young woman who is
1,when the two of these actors were killed and the camera,when you watch this movie it 's not that bad
1,i think the film is quite well done with some of,i think it 's a very good film to watch
1,as i mentioned the film is a bit slow and drags too slow,as a result the film is n't very good at the beginning but its
1,well the story was a bit thin but the story is a bit,well it 's a great film to watch but it 's not
1,burt lancaster plays a character who is n't a bad guy,burt reynolds was a very good actor but he 's a good
1,your average person is a little too unkind to be a little too much to be true,your average movie buff will enjoy this film as much a fan as a film should
1,you 'll be amazed at this film and its a good film that is n't even a movie,you have to be a fan and you 'll have to watch this movie to find the end of
1,at the end of the day i was thinking oh my god this,at least the original is one that is n't a good idea
1,anyways i have to say i have n't read,anyways the movie does n't really make sense
1,the acting in this movie was horrible,the film is about a young girl named
1,the story line is very interesting and there are some interesting twists and turns in this movie,the film 's story line and characters have a lot more to offer but the story is n't
1,it is n't even the worst film,it is a very simple movie
1,the acting was terrible the story is bad,the movie is not a complete failure
1,sadly i do not know where to,sadly it 's not that bad
1,another example of a good idea was how it got made for television movie and was,another example of the film is that the film is set in the present day
1,there is a lot of action in it and the ending was a bit abrupt,there are some good points in this film and the movie is a complete waste but
1,instead of being the worst movie ever it was the worst movie ever made in this country,instead we get to see a very attractive young actress who plays a woman in the beginning of
1,woman who has to do a good deal of her life is a,woman who has to be the most beautiful person of her generation
1,the film 's plot involves the same woman 's daughter and her daughter,the movie was shot in a very small town in the late 1980s and
1,i think that the movie is just a bit too long,i have n't read a book so i ca all be that
1,they 're all a good thing to watch,they have no idea what to do and that
1,she is a beautiful young girl with an amazing talent,she is a great actress and she is perfect in this
1,matched with his usual style of humor and the result is one that has been done,matched by an interesting script by a very talented director and a very good director
1,there are many scenes that have a lot,there is nothing wrong about the movie
1,this movie is one of the most beautiful and touching pieces of cinema that you have ever seen,this is the first film to be released in a year and so it has a great deal of
1,now that is the case of this film and the fact of,now i do n't know what to say about this movie
1,his character has the same name as the first,his character is not the most important character in the
1,shepard has to be a little too hard,shepard is a very funny actor and is the
1,finally the story is about a bunch that has been in a mental institution,finally there 's some pretty cool stuff in this movie that is not the case
1,the movie has some of the worst acting i ever heard and it 's just plain,the film is about a young girl trying to get a job and her life
1,first off the acting was horrible but it 's not bad,first of course i am a sucker of a film that is
1,but i do not want the movie,but i was n't impressed with this film
1,this film was so awful that i could not even finish my eyes,this is one of those films where you can watch the movie over and
1,in this case the film was shot at that very early 90 minute in the early 70 minutes,in fact i was n't expecting much of this movie and was n't really disappointed at all
1,i do agree to give it a 10 because it 's a bit of a bore but it 's still a good film and a good,i was expecting something like that but it was a bit like a remake of the original movie and the movie is n't that funny
1,it 's a shame that this movie did n't get released theatrically in theaters,it was a good film but i would n't have had a chance on this
1,society is not the best of our heroes but it does,society has a very strong and very very very very small budget
1,this was the first movie i 've ever walked out of,this movie is not worth watching as a film noir is a
1,the acting in general is very bad,the acting is good and i really like
1,anyway it 's a very good show that i would recommend to everyone,anyway i have seen the movie and i do n't think it is the
1,he is a great character actor and he 's not a good guy he 's just plain stupid,he is also in his own right hand and is a very nice actor and he has a lot
1,one day i was looking for a movie that had me hooked on the screen and the acting,one can only assume that this is the best film of the year and it is not even worth
1,do not watch this movie unless all is a bad thing,do you have the chance of seeing a good movie
1,not only was the story a bit of,not a bad idea to begin with
1,the film is about the power of love and the struggle to overcome the life of the young and powerful and powerful young woman who,the acting and directing are very good and it 's a shame the film was released theatrically in the united nations and the dvd
1,i was n't expecting much from the film and i had n't seen it before,i was surprised to see this show in the theater as the first movie i saw
1,i have to admit this is a great example of why a film can have,i was n't sure whether i could find the movie or read a book
1,i was so disappointed when it was on the air,i have to say i was n't a fan of this
1,the story is simple and the characters are very,the story is a little thin at first
1,the movie starts off well with a bunch of people walking around in,the movie is a very interesting story and a very good one
1,oh and it is n't the only movie that makes it to the end that i have never been,oh and a few minutes into this flick i was wondering why they did n't make the ending
1,the film has some very interesting moments but the film never drags,the film is a very funny film and i recommend it to all
1,they are both a little different,they are all so funny that it
1,but it 's not as much fun,but the film is not so much a
1,suicide is a great film that is a must for anyone who,suicide is a movie of a certain level of the film
1,the movie is not a good movie it is not a good one,the movie is a complete bore and the acting and directing is terrible but
1,have the producers not even attempted to make,have i seen this before the original
1,this is the first of the series that i 've,this is a great movie for the whole time
1,for those who are interested in seeing this movie i highly suggest to watch it,for a while i did n't care for any of this movie and i did n't
1,there are some funny parts in this one,there are some very funny parts and a lot
1,haunted by a group of men who have been in the military for the first few months and are killed in a car crash and later they find themselves in,haunted by the same plot and the fact that he 's the only person in his family he does a great job of making this movie a great film
1,why do they keep doing this to,why does he do so many
1,the movie has a great cast and a great story line and the cast is,the film is very well done and the acting by the cast was superb
1,an excellent cast of actors and a great cast of,an excellent cast of characters and an engaging story
1,but the real problem is that the plot is not a very good movie,but the film is a bit of an excuse to get a few chuckles from
1,he is not a bad man,he 's not a bad guy but
1,it 's a shame that it was not nominated for,it is n't a film for everyone to see
1,it was so bad it made me laugh at how bad it was and how it,it was so bad and so boring it 's almost funny watching the whole thing
1,the acting in all the movie sucks,the acting was n't as wooden
1,generally the movie has the worst acting ever to grace the silver lining,generally i do have a soft tolerance of the story of the movie and
1,but the real problem with the story is that it is not as good and the acting of a group of actors is a,but it 's a great movie and it is a great movie to see if you have n't seen it in the theaters
1,in the end i found the story to the very,in fact the whole thing is a complete mess
1,tv is a good thing but this film is just plain bad,tv shows are the same as the ones in the series and i
1,i think it is an interesting and entertaining movie,i think the film is very good and is not
1,for the first time i saw this show and i must confess that this is not the worst show,for a movie like it was made in the early 90 's it 's a very low point
1,his character was a bit too unlikable and the story was too predictable for a movie,his character in the movie is the only one who can save his life from the evil
1,the story was very simple and the characters were believable but it did n't make sense at all and did nothing for me and it was just too bad,the story was very good and the characters were likable enough and the characters are likable and believable and the characters all were believable and i loved it
1,this is not a movie for you,this was the first time that he did
1,is it the same way that the movie is set up,is it the bad acting the directing or the acting
1,one of the worst films i have had the misfortune of watching,one of them is a very good one and the other actors are
1,as a matter the fact that the film 's title was a very good,as for it 's a very good movie it is a great show
1,this is a great film for all ages especially,this movie is so awful it is hard
1,the story of a young man who has a very difficult task of finding a cure for his own life,the movie was made in the early 80 's when the film was made for television and it shows that it
1,one of the worst films i have watched in years and,one thing i liked about this film was its title
1,like the other reviewers who said that the film had,like the other reviewer i 've seen the movie
1,the movie was n't a total failure,the movie is a complete bore that 's
1,gabriel and his friends and their friends,gabriel is a very good movie
1,running around with an old flame in the woods and the other one is the one that makes the most memorable character in this movie,running around the house with an axe and a few seconds in front of the camera and then we 're left at the edge
1,even though this is n't an accurate film i think it is one of the best,even when the first film was made the same year i saw it and it was the
1,donna 's mother is a woman and she does not have to deal,donna is the only person that has ever played her role in the role
1,sean connery is a good actor as well,sean astin was great as the evil villain
1,but it 's a shame that this is the kind,but this is a very bad attempt at humor
1,i think it 's a good idea to make an interesting movie about the evils and tribulations,i think the reason i gave this show 3 stars is that it has a good rating
1,as for the acting it was n't that good but it,as i said earlier i was n't impressed with it
1,in fact this movie is one that should be avoided,in the first part the movie takes a turn for the
1,i do n't know how it ended up being so good,i have never read the novel but i have seen the movie
1,in this movie it 's a very good story with,in the end he 's a little too old
1,that is the best thing i can say about a film that,that was a very nice surprise and a very good ending
1,even though the movie is a bit long i do n't know what,even if this was a low budget film it was n't bad
1,we have a movie with the title of an american werewolf in,we get a few laughs in a scene that is funny
1,his performance is the best of this movie,his character is so annoying that he becomes annoying
1,even the acting is n't bad,even the music and the music was
1,it 's a very funny movie,it 's a shame that such a
1,and the movie is a total mess,and that does have a good effect
1,anyways i was a bit surprised by the way the movie is shot,anyways the story is a little too predictable and the characters are too stupid
1,uncle john gielgud is a very funny actor and he 's a good director and he is very,uncle kirk was the only one that had a good time and he did a good job
1,i have never been a huge fan but i do n't think i would like this movie to a,i do n't know why this movie is so bad but it 's a good film to see
1,more than anything i have to mention the acting,more than just an action movie it 's a bit
1,credit for all the cast and crew,credit must go to mr smith for trying
1,an interesting premise and a nice surprise for the whole family,an old man who was born in the early 80 's is
1,like a few other movies i 've been able to,like the other reviewer mentioned it is an insult
1,the film has a lot of potential and the film does n't have a,the story is about a young girl trying her job with her mother
1,i think it was a great movie,i do agree with the other reviewer who
1,i'm glad i did n't pay to see this film,i'm not saying that the movie does not make me think
1,this is the first movie i have,this is a movie for everyone
1,i think it would have been more,i do not want the film
1,cinema has been a staple since the early days but the film is not so much as the first one,cinema is not the worst movie in the history it is a very bad movie that 's just plain bad i
1,shia labeouf plays a young man in,shia labeouf is a great director
1,do not waste your time with this,do n't worry that you do n't want
1,the film has a very good cast including the likes that includes the likes of the two leads,the movie starts out as a typical slasher flick with a bunch of characters that are not funny or
1,the film is about two men who are married and married,the film is about the same subject as a typical hollywood movie
1,hsiaohsien 's direction and editing are so bad that the film is n't even remotely,hsiaohsien 's direction is a bit too long but it 's also quite good
1,santoshi 's direction was a bit too high but the film itself is a bit slow and the story is very weak the acting is terrible,santoshi is the only one in the film that can act like a real man in a rubber suit but the movie 's a little too much
1,a few scenes are filmed in an attempt at humor,a lot of the humor and humor of this is the
1,this movie was not a good movie,this movie was a great movie
1,if you are into movies you have to see this,if you want something to laugh out loud a few minutes
1,this is a very good movie,this is one that should n't be
1,you have n't seen this movie yet,you know it will be a good idea
1,i think the movie is a great deal better,i was expecting this movie to get worse as the
1,you 'll see a few of these films that are more than just plain awful,you have the feeling that it will be a good idea to show the world of
1,injun of dracula is one of the,injun ventura is a great film
1,8 out in ten and a half hour and a half of the movie,8 the plot is so bad and ridiculous that it 's almost laughable
1,to be honest i do have to say this movie sucked,to me it is a great movie and one that i recommend
1,i was n't impressed with the story of the movie,i have never seen a movie like the first
1,it 's a shame because i was surprised at how good this,it is not a good movie but it does n't matter
1,the story is very simple and very simple,the story is about the love of a man
1,his wife is the one who has been killed,his character has been given a few laughs
1,shortly after the first episode of season 2 i had to,shortly thereafter the movie is a bit slow and boring
1,however the story line and the characters were all very good,however the story of the film is so much more than that
1,of the three movies i 've seen this is one hell of the best,of all the movies that i saw i have n't seen this one
1,ok i do admit the acting was bad but that 's not the point of,ok the film is a little slow but it 's not a good movie
1,in fact it was the worst film i had ever seen,in fact the movie 's plot was a lot less fun
1,i was expecting a good movie but this one was so awful it 's funny,i do n't understand the point in the movie that the director and writer are trying
1,in the meantime the movie has the feel of the movie the first one is about,in a nutshell this is the best of all the movies that i have seen
1,this is a film for the whole family,this is a movie for all people who want
1,the film has a very good story but it has to do with a good plot and the characters are all so bad they just do n't make it like this,the film is a very interesting portrayal and it shows that the characters are different and more important than the ones in the original movie and that 's what they are all
1,i'm not saying it all that i would have liked to,i'm not going and say it 's a good thing
1,well this is the first of the three,well this is a very good movie
1,but the film 's plot is not so bad it does it 's job,but the film is not so great it 's not a good film
1,for me the film 's best asset is the scene of the woman who is the one with the woman,for the most of me the film is a complete mess and i do not recommend this for anyone who likes
1,if it 's the same way as it does in the first two movies the one that makes me laugh,if you want the real seung of the film you will be able for the movie and you will be disappointed
1,the story is about the adventures that are used as a backdrop for the movie to be told,the movie starts with the same old woman getting killed and then she goes to bed with her father
1,the story is simple and it 's not a bad thing to say,the acting in this is pretty good but the plot is so bad that
1,it 's a great film for a rainy day,it is a movie with the best of the best
1,his character is a caricature and he 's the only one who has to deal with the situation that is the,his character is a caricature that is a bit more than he is but his character has to be seen
1,where the hell are you waiting to,where did he get his inspiration
1,this movie does not have a lot of action and it 's not a comedy,this movie is not a movie for anyone who wants to be entertained by the end
1,it was the first time that i saw this film in my local library,it was a great movie and i liked the ending but it is just too
1,even though it has a few faults and the acting is very bad the plot is,even the most seasoned actors do n't have a clue of what they are doing
1,copy of a book by the director and writer of the,copy the film for the good of a bad movie
1,anyway this film was not a total,anyway the movie was a waste
1,what i got was something like the original version that is n't a classic,what 's the purpose of making a film about the evils of war
1,her character is not believable and the story is n't a little bit farfetched but it has to be the,her character is so beautiful that it makes you feel like you are going to be in a movie
1,watch this movie and you will have a lot more,watch it if you want something to laugh at
1,in the end the film becomes a bit more enjoyable and the,in this case the film was made in the late 1980s
1,the story of the movie and the story of the characters are so bad that it 's difficult to believe that,the film has a very interesting and interesting story and the acting is excellent and it is a great story
1,holly was n't a bad guy but it did n't work,holly is a good actor but he does not have a chance
1,an interesting and intriguing movie that i enjoyed it for the sheer silliness,an interesting story of two men who go to a remote cabin in the
1,all of this is the first time i watched this movie,all in the family and i do not want my children
1,i think it 's a shame,i was surprised that the film was
1,but the story line was n't that interesting,but this movie is a must see
1,but it does make you feel like you have been watching a bad movie,but the film is a very good one with a lot more laughs than most
1,nancy is a very good actress and she is perfect,nancy michelle geller was also very good and i thought she
1,he was a little too young and too much to get to grips,he 's the one who 's the best thing about this movie
1,we 're told that there is a lot more,we 're supposed the interplay of the characters
1,ballad of the killer snowman is an excellent horror film that is n't only a horror film but a very,ballad is the only movie i saw on the shelf with the trailer and i was a little surprised
1,director michael mann has made a very good film,director david cronenberg has made a film that is not
1,but the real problem is the script and the direction and the,but the film 's plot and acting were all very poor
1,i was expecting a lot of the same old stuff but the film has a lot,i was expecting the movie to be more like it but the movie is n't
1,the movie has some great acting,the movie was a complete mess but
1,basically it was a movie with no real story line it was a complete bore and the actors were n't bad at least they were just plain,basically the film is not a comedy and it is n't even a comedy it 's just not funny and the jokes are lame and predictable
1,the acting is good the writing and direction are very good,the story is about a young boy who lives on his own
1,also the movie has a very good plot and is a great film,also the scene in the bar where she is in the car and the
1,overall it 's a very good movie,overall this is not one of them
1,i think that the film is very good,i think the reason why i gave this movie
1,perhaps the film is not a masterpiece but it 's still a great film,perhaps it is a film for those who want more and more of the genre
1,apparently the film is a little bit too much to ask,apparently the filmmakers had to be making a movie about the evils
1,but the film is a very interesting film,but i was surprised at the ending and the
1,and that is what i do not know,and it was not the worst movie i 've
1,so i was surprised to see that the movie was n't a complete waste,so i was n't disappointed in the film but it did n't matter
1,the acting was n't bad but the script and acting were horrible and the story line sucked so badly that,the acting is horrible the directing was poor and it 's a shame to watch a film like this
1,and the acting in all of the actors and actresses was good and the script was good enough,and the movie has some of the funniest scenes of a movie i have had the pleasure to see
1,which was n't the case with this movie but that was a lot more,which brings us to another movie which is about a woman who has been kidnapped
1,from there i found myself wondering what was that the movie was about,from the very beginning i thought that i would be a fan
1,those who are n't familiar to this movie will be able to relate with the fact they have no idea of how to make a film,those who have seen the movie know that it is n't that bad and that 's not the way it is in fact it 's a good
1,this is a great example to the director 's career,this is one movie where i would have to be surprised
1,there was no plot to speak of,there is also an excellent performance by the
1,lest i mention it was a very funny movie and it 's a very enjoyable show that should be watched for no good laughs or laughs,lest we say that it is a movie that has a lot to offer and is n't a great movie it 's not a movie that makes
1,the acting is horrible but i think the,the movie was a little too long
1,the acting and directing were horrible the script was bad the acting worse than anything i 've,the movie is very well made and it has a lot to offer it 's plot
1,i have n't read any of his books,i have n't seen the film yet
1,then the movie is a bit too long and it really makes no,then the two main characters are in love and they get together
1,revert to a great deal and a few of the actors involved in it is the,revert with his wife who is the only survivor he is able in his family
1,there are some funny moments but the movie is so boring it 's hard not only to laugh at how funny,there is a scene where a woman is raped and he 's wearing the same clothes and the same clothes
1,cat is a good film but it is not,cat is the best of the three and it 's
1,i do n't think i can remember a movie,i have n't laughed once and never will
1,the story is a bit thin but the acting,the movie is very funny in the extreme
1,the story of this story is about a young,the acting in all the movie is excellent
1,but it is a very enjoyable movie and i recommend you to see it for free,but the film is not about any real story it 's rather a very simple one which
1,and i do not want to spoil it,and the ending was a complete copout
1,perhaps the film is n't as funny and the acting as it is,perhaps he should be able to make the film as an exercise
1,i think the movie was very good,i think this movie was a complete waste
1,i think this was a great movie and i hope you get it on video,i was expecting a movie that would be good and entertaining but it was n't that
1,therefore the movie is n't a bad film and the actors seem forced by their acting,therefore i have to say i 've never seen a worse actress than her character
1,hence the movie is a bit boring,hence that 's a good thing
1,i was so bored by this movie,i think that the film was shot in
1,my favorite character is a guy in a suit,my friend and i went to the theater for this
1,the movie is about the man who has the ability to be,the film has a great deal of suspense in my eyes
1,i do n't know why i watched it,i do not know how this film got such
1,i do n't know why i was so disappointed,i was so disappointed by this one i could n't
1,i have never seen a film that i can honestly like and i do so yearn,i do n't know how many times you have a chance to see a sequel
1,so the plot is not so good it 's just not funny at all,so the plot is n't that bad but the acting and direction are terrible
1,and the acting is n't too bad either as the acting is atrocious the plot is awful and the acting,and it 's not that it does n't work for me it does n't have a good story line
1,there 's a scene where the hero and her daughter have,there was a lot of good acting and good acting
1,the film is about a young woman named caroline who has been married and is forced in a life of prostitution,the story is about a young woman named seita who lives in the city of new york in her apartment and is
1,and the movie was shot in a very grainy manner and,and the film is not so bad it is good
1,as a result of the story it becomes very clear and very boring and the characters do,as for it 's a very bad movie it 's a waste of time to see
1,to me this is a very good and very funny film,to be sure it was the worst movie of all times and
1,the film has a lot of potential and a few good scenes and the story has a very good twist,the acting was n't too bad but the script was pretty bad the acting and the directing sucked so bad that
1,other than the few good things this film has got to say about the film,other than this there is a few moments of dialogue that make you feel like it
1,which is a good reason for me but i think it 's a very enjoyable film,which is a pity as to what the film 's director is trying to convey
1,there 's no real explanation of the movie 's existence it just seems,there are some good points in this film but it 's not
1,i was so disappointed by that,i have n't read the book yet
1,the story line was so predictable i could have cared for,the film is not only a comedy but a comedy
1,i think that 's the reason i wanted to watch a movie about a girl who was so bad i,i have seen this movie and i can only say that the film is a bit of a bore
1,do n't be put in the same position as the first one and the third,do n't be put into the hype of this movie you have the worst movie ever
1,maybe i am not a fan of,maybe it 's a good film
1,i think this was a great movie,i do n't understand why this movie was
1,and the movie is a little bit of a,and the film has a very nice touch
1,pino is one of the most beautiful characters i can ever remember in my entire life,pino oberoi is a good actor but the rest is pretty good and the story itself really
1,it 's a shame that such a low budget film could,it is n't a bad movie but a good one
1,decadence of a man 's death is a great film,decadence was the first of the three films to have a
1,its just a bunch to watch and it 's not,its a good movie and the acting was good
1,the film is not a comedy but rather an action thriller,the movie is not a complete disaster but it 's worth seeing
1,the film is not about a man trying to be,the film was shot in a very grainy manner
1,the movie is a bit too slow for the whole family,the acting and directing is excellent and it 's a great movie
1,i have n't read the novel but it is a great,i think that the director should be ashamed of himself
1,apparently the filmmakers have n't read anything from this film but they do n't make it any less,apparently the film is n't a bad movie it 's not even good for a good reason it is
1,for those of you unfamiliar between the two movies of the late eighties early seventies and 70s,for the record i would have to give the film credit for that it is a good movie
1,it was a very interesting film and the director was a very talented actor,it was n't the worst film of the year and it was n't until it
1,if you have a masochistic sense to do it is the movie for you and if the film was not for,if you want something a little more exciting to follow then this movie is a mustsee and worth checking up
1,he is a great director who has made the transition,he is a great actor and a good actor
1,she is also the only character she can relate to and the story has a certain depth,she 's just a cute guy and i have to wonder if she was the only character who
1,if you 're looking for something more interesting to watch and watch this is a film that will make you cry and you 'll laugh,if i was the first person i would n't want my children to watch it again it might seem to be that they were all a
1,the movie starts with a bunch of friends and their friends,the movie is not a complete waste but the story is good
1,the story was so stupid that the movie could n't even get any worse,the story is about a young girl trying desperately to get her son to live
1,maureen o 'donnell is a wonderful actress,maureen o 'donnell as a man with a
1,i'm not a big football fan but i have to say this movie is one i 'd like to see,i'm not sure if it was the director who was trying to make it look good but it just did n't
1,i have never been more disappointed by a movie,i think the film 's biggest problem is that it
1,gray is an excellent film with a great cast,gray and me' have a great deal to offer and
1,a lot more people have said that it is a very funny film and the fact is that,a lot more people would have been a lot better if the movie had a good story
1,when i saw it at the sundance film fest the audience is not,when you watch this movie it will be like a real shame
1,solely because the film is a bit of the same as the first one and the third half,solely because the director and writer were trying to get a little too much of a story
1,what i got instead is a movie that,what a great cast and the actors
1,radu 's father and his wife have been killed and the son of a family is killed,radu 's character is a bit of an eccentric jerk who is a little bit of an idiot
1,although the film is n't the most interesting movie it 's not as good as it is it 's not,although the film was a bit slow the movie is not as funny or entertaining either as the first
1,i think this is a very very bad film but it is not a bad film,i do not think that the director should have made this movie to a point
1,this movie is a great film for all ages especially,this is one of the most underrated films ever
1,part 1 is a movie that is,part 2 is one of those
1,helena bonham hill is a great actress,helena bonhamcarter is perfect as a woman who
1,you have to see a film to enjoy,you 'll be surprised by this movie
1,i have seen the original movie but i 've seen better,i do not want my kids but i do admire the movie
1,these two are the same actors who play their roles very different,these were the only things that kept me watching this film
1,a good cast and a good cast,a good cast is the only reason to
1,john wayne 's acting is excellent,john cusak is a great choice for
1,all in this movie was a waste for my money but it was a waste of a good idea,all in all a very enjoyable and enjoyable movie about a man who is trying and who he has been
1,his performance is very convincing but he is a good choice for his role as the detective of,his wife is a man who loves him and has to deal with a very difficult relationship
1,his character is the only one who can be identified by his own,his performance is very good and the film is a real winner
1,the acting and script is very good,the movie is a little slow but it
1,i was n't expecting much from the movie,i do agree with many other people who commented
1,blows up the dvd of this film and it 's a very nice movie,blows the movie up with the best of the worst and the most godawful movie
1,this is a very good movie,this is a movie about the life
1,they are both very good actors and actresses who,they are not the best in this movie
1,it is the story of the life that was told in this movie by the author and the director of a film that is not just a vehicle of the film,it 's a shame the rest of us did not see this as a comedy but i do n't remember the name of the film and i think the movie was very
1,not only was he a total jerk but he 's just a little too old for his role as the villain,not to mention that the film was shot in the early seventies when it was released in 1969 the director 's cut
1,he is not a bad guy but is still not a good actor but,he is a very nice guy but he 's not a good guy
1,this is the best movie ever to be released,this is a movie about the life of a young
1,it has to be one thing to be done,it is the best of the three shorts
1,this is not the type movie that i would like for anyone who likes,this is a film that will not disappoint and it will be remembered
1,i do n't know why i watched it,i do agree with the previous comment that i
1,i was n't expecting much but it was very well executed,i was n't sure why it did n't make me feel like
1,the story line is a little confusing at times and the,the story is very weak and is n't very good
1,also the scene where the girl is in her bed is not funny,also the scene in this episode is very funny and the whole idea of
1,when he finally meets a woman she is rescued and he has a very difficult relationship to her,when i saw a preview for this on tv and i was expecting the usual movie to get it
1,this movie is not a bad film,this movie is one of the best
1,not that it is a bad movie and i,not a single solitary moment in this movie
1,i was so excited to see the movie in my,i have seen this one a few years ago
1,being the only person i knew i was seeing a lot of this movie i,being the only film i saw this was the best one i have seen
1,this film was a great example of how the film 's success was to make this a classic,this is a movie i have never seen so i can understand why i would like to see it
1,fortunately the film is so bad that it is difficult for me to sit down and watch the film again because i do not think it is a,fortunately this is not a movie that you 'll watch once you will see the same thing again but it 's still not a movie for anyone
1,for me the film is a great example of how a film can be done and,for those who have n't read it i would suggest this film to the public
1,this movie was so bad it was good and it was so awful,this is a movie for the whole time and should be watched
1,i do n't know why i watched this movie,i think that the film is very much a masterpiece
1,looking for the next big screen adaptation,looking forward at this movie 's time i
1,he has to make his own decisions,he is a man of a kind who
1,later in the movie he is a man who is a loner and he is a man,later i was n't expecting to see the film but it did n't have to be the worst
1,i have n't laughed so hard since the last few minutes,i think the film is very very good and i have to
1,however i think it 's not a good movie,however the film is not a bad movie and it
1,the acting is good the story is a bit too complicated for words but i do n't know what to do here,the story is about the lives of three men who go into a different type world where their lives and their lives and
1,it has the same kind as a typical hollywood movie but the director has a good eye on it as well,it 's a great movie and i would recommend the film to anyone who likes a good movie with great actors
1,goku has been a big fan of the original film,goku 's character is not so much as to say a
1,i was so bored that this movie was not a good idea to begin with and i was,i think this is a very funny movie but it is not funny it is not funny
1,no wonder the director was n't able,no matter how hard you try it is
1,there 's no real explanation for this movie and it 's not the worst movie ever,there is also the usual suspects of the two sisters who are not in their relationship with
1,fleming 's character is a caricature of the human spirit,fleming and his crew are a great director and the actors
1,an excellent film with a very strong cast and a nice score,an excellent cast and an ensemble cast that is not afraid for the
1,notice that it 's a great show,notice it as one of the best films
1,and it was the worst movie that could ever happen,and that 's what it is like when a movie is
1,so i was surprised at how many times the story line was so ridiculous and predictable,so the movie was shot and edited by the director 's cut and the camera pans on
1,this was the first movie that made me cry,this was the worst movie i have had the displeasure
1,i have seen a lot worse movies,i think it 's a very bad movie
1,some people have commented that this film is a bit of a joke but it was n't,some of them have a very small budget that makes you think of a good movie
1,dunaway was a bit of fun but she did n't really get to me,dunaway is the best thing about this movie and she 's not a bad actress
1,i have to admit that i was very impressed by the film,i have n't laughed so many times i 've been able
1,its just a bad bad movie,its a great movie for everyone who
1,this film has a very good cast and it is a great movie,this is a film that i can not watch again and again i have
1,to me it seems that the director was a,to me it was the best movie ever
1,the film is a little bit too slow and the pacing of it drags on to a halt,the film 's premise of an assassination mission is quite interesting but it 's not a film that does
1,we get to see the movie,we 're supposed as a couple and
1,roundtree is a good guy but the movie does a good job,roundtree and his cohorts are the most powerful and funniest scenes in the
1,the movie was made for the sole reason i watched this,the story of a woman who gets involved with a woman and
1,he 's just plain bad and the only good part of the,he is not a bad actor but it is n't bad
1,why do they make such a bad film and why,why does he have a cameo in the film
1,my friend and my family are watching this movie and we have the same experience,my favorite scene is a prolonged shootout where a couple of people are attacked and then
1,i do not think that the director was trying to convey the essence in,i have seen a few of the movies that i have n't liked
1,daughter and daughter do n't know what it is,daughter 's character is a caricature of her own
1,my favorite character has to be the mother,my favorite scene is when the woman is talking
1,i do n't know what to call it a movie,i do n't know how it ended but the story was
1,in a way it was a very good movie,in fact i was n't impressed at any point
1,i have never been a fan and have never seen such a bad thing in this film,i have n't seen a more recent movie but i do have a problem with that
1,all i can remember was the acting,all in all it is a great show
1,i was so bored that i did not get the impression that this,i was expecting a great movie and it was n't that good
1,for me this is an excellent film,for the first two thirds of this series
1,a very interesting and entertaining thriller about an escaped convict who has a mental illness,a lot more than the movie itself is a little bit slow and boring
1,the story is very simple but the story line was so bad it could have done without the action or the action scenes that were supposed to make sense,the acting is good and the direction and acting are superb the directing of the movie is very good but the story is not very good at all and it
1,take it a heaping risk and make a film that will never be,take the time of the movie and you will be laughing out
1,something about this movie i was looking for a good film in,something that i do have a soft spot on my face
1,besides that the acting was horrible and i could have had a headache,besides the fact of the matter that is n't that good the film is
1,they are both funny and funny,they are all very good actors
1,the film is a complete mess of a film,the film has a very good cast including john wayne
1,the movie is a little slow but the story is n't too bad and the acting,the story line was a bit farfetched and the plot was very predictable to begin
1,most of the time the actors seem to have a problem in this story,most of the actors are n't really acting or the actors that have the ability
1,i do not think that the actors were able to speak their names,i have n't read the book but the book is based upon this book
1,i was n't expecting much from it,i have seen it several many times and
1,i do n't understand why the director was,i think it 's a great movie
1,how did they get to the point of making such a,how did the producers know this was a real stinker
1,another problem is the ending which is not surprising but it is n't that good,another thing that i have to say is that the story was so stupid and predictable
1,a good cast including robert downey jr as the sheriff and an actor with a little more depth,a good film for those who have n't seen it and are willing to suspend the disbelief that it
1,i do agree with those who have not heard that this,i have to say i did not like this movie
1,i do n't know if i was a fan or not but the movie is just so bad,i was n't impressed by the story but the acting was so good that the film had no impact
1,unfortunately the script was so bad it was laughable,unfortunately the film is n't as good and is as
1,where the hell did i get this dvd and the fact it,where the hell did he get his inspiration for his work
1,most of these films are a lot of the same thing but it 's a very enjoyable film and i recommend that everyone will enjoy the first one,most of them were not so much of an improvement as the movie is a very long shot in the head of the film to be taken to the
1,but it was n't a movie,but the movie has the best of
1,these guys are n't bad enough for a good,these are the two adjectives of this movie
1,hedorah is one of them all the more fun,hedorah 's character is a very likable character
1,there are some great performances in this film,there was a lot going around in the movie
1,it 's not a movie that is a little bit of an action movie,it 's the kind of film that i would like and i would like to
1,the film is a bit slow but that is what makes it a good movie,the acting is pretty poor and the script was n't very interesting but the acting was
1,ray sharif is a fine choice as the lead villain but he is very likable as a tough guy who is a bit of,ray liotta is a very talented actor and i think he was great as the joker but he was n't really that great
1,leader of an old friend and son who has a,leader of the group is a very funny movie
1,however the film 's only purpose is to entertain,however i was n't disappointed by this movie
1,typically it is not a bad movie,typically it 's a very good movie
1,the film has some nice moments but the rest was so boring that it would make,the movie was made for tv and it shows the real talent of this film
1,to be a little too much for the first time i was,to be fair it was the most expensive movie ever made
1,and i do n't know how it was going to get better,and it 's not that i do n't want to give away the
1,depending on the plot of the first film and the second one,depending the film at a time of crisis and its subject
1,she is not the only person in the movie,she was the one in the movie to make her
1,well it 's a movie that i can watch over and on again and i have n't even,well this is a movie that i can only recommend to those interested with a good story
1,amid the film 's plot it has the same feel and feel that it is in the original,amid the other two movies this is a very good one and the movie has the best one in
1,you know it 's going down,you 'll be able into the characters
1,i do not recommend this movie to anyone who wants something to laugh about and the fact is that it is a film that will make a lot less sense,i do n't know what to think about it but it 's not a good film to watch but i do n't think that the director 's cut to a film
1,what i found was an intriguing film,what i got was a movie that could
1,it 's a shame to see a film that can only get so bad that it is good for,it 's a shame the movie was so good to watch it with the lights and the lights
1,i think that the director should 've made the cut out the window,i was so disappointed by the movie that you would have to have a
1,leo is the one to blame for this film and the film is not,leo mccarey is the master and he has a good sense of humor
1,despite the obvious lack of a coherent plot this is a movie for the whole family,despite the fact that the film was shot in black white the story had some very interesting
1,although the story was n't the worst of the two,although the story was very predictable and predictable the story line
1,and the ending was so stupid,and it was a very funny movie
1,i think it 's one that i have seen over and over and never really understood what was happening,i do not think that the film is a masterpiece of art but i do n't think it is one
1,one thing that makes this movie is the fact that it is not a comedy and a comedy,one thing that really bothered me was when they were trying too hard to get the point of making
1,one of the worst i have ever seen,one can see the director 's intent on this
1,go see it if you can,go see it if it comes on
1,it has a great story line and great acting,it 's a very good film and the actors are
1,only the title character is a real jerk,only a few minutes of the story are n't
1,rita hayworth plays her mother in a very,rita hayworth was excellent in her role
1,he was a very funny guy who was a little too,he is the most beautiful character i 've seen since
1,this film was made by a bunch and the film,this is the kind to be a classic movie
1,sure the movie does not have to be made at the box office but it is a,sure it has a good plot and some interesting twists but it 's just plain dull
1,unfortunately it is the only thing that makes it watchable for the whole family to watch,unfortunately the film does n't seem like that of any other film in any genre and the
1,with all this said the movie is a mess but the acting is good and it 's very well done,with the exception that the movie is a bit slow at times the film does a good job of keeping the
1,now i have seen the first movie and i have seen the original,now i am not a fan of the book but i was surprised to
1,this is one of my favorite tv movies,this film was a waste of time
1,as a matter i have a problem with that,as the film goes on we see the two main
1,cheesy acting bad directing bad music bad music all in all a terrible movie,cheesy dialogue and acting that is n't really funny at times and the film does
1,all in all i think the reason this movie was so bad was because it,all i can think of is the fact that it has no redeeming qualities
1,each time i watch it i have a headache,each of the three leads in the film are a
1,as for me i was impressed by it,as i 've read the book is the best
1,this is a movie that you should see and enjoy,this is a movie for those who like the kind of
1,basically the film is n't as good and the acting is bad,basically a film about a young woman who has a crush of a
1,warning spoilers the movie has a very good plot,warning the movie is not a bad movie
1,much better than the first two movies and the same is not,much of it 's charm and its humor are not funny
1,he 's the one to blame,he is the best thing in this
1,it 's a shame the film has such an amateurish rating,it 's a pity that they made it to the end of
1,sadly this is a film that will be forgotten and not only will smith fans,sadly the film 's only redeeming value is the cinematography and the direction of the movie
1,but this movie was so horrible,but the story line is so bad
1,she is a very good actor who has been in a very good film since her breakthrough performance and i have to say it 's,she was so bad that it could not get the job to be a movie that she would have had the potential to be
1,the film has a very good cast including the leads who,the story is a bit slow and drags in places
1,the story of the film revolves around a young boy who is a young man who is sent to a mental hospital in the,the story is about a group of young people who are trying to get married and have a relationship with a married couple
1,the movie was a little slow at best,the acting in the other two is excellent
1,i was surprised to see how the movie is going on the same level,i do n't think it 's the worst movie in the world but i do
1,comparisons are the most important thing in the film to make it a success,comparisons to the book were a little misleading but the story was a bit too
1,in the end it 's not that the movie is n't bad,in a way the film does have a lot of action sequences
1,the story of the movie is about two people living together and trying to,the story is a little too thin and the ending is too predictable
1,a lot more of a good cast,a few years later the two men were
1,what a waste of talent and money,what i did not know is the way
1,it 's a shame to have a sequel to the original series but this sequel has no real reason to go to,it has been said that i have to agree with me that this movie was a complete waste of my time
1,he has to do this to make sure he 's the only person that can be,he is the most talented character in the movie as the movie 's main protagonist
1,other than the aforementioned of the film i have to mention the ending which,other than a brief cameo from robert ryan this is a great film
1,there 's no real reason that it is not,there was a bit of humor but i did not
1,the story is a little weak but the acting is pretty decent the script,the film is not a complete waste of time but i recommend it
1,it 's not even that good,it 's a very good movie and
1,duh it 's the best i 've,duh it 's a good thing
1,this is the first film that has a very good plot line but it 's not that great it was n't bad either,this was an excellent movie and i hope they do n't try to get out of the world 's most popular film market for
1,meanwhile the girl is forced by the police to find out who 's going to die but she,meanwhile he 's not even a good guy and the two men are n't even remotely likable
1,we 're supposed for a film to be a little more enjoyable and interesting,we 're supposed as a big fan and have a lot of problems
1,the movie was a waste and the film has a bit,the story is about the same thing as i said
1,we are shown in the middle of nowhere and we see that,we are not told that we are in for the best
1,the acting was good and i was surprised to see how the director was able to get,the acting was horrible and there 's no real plot development and no character development whatsoever
1,they are both the best and most memorable in the movie and the,they are not funny at least not as good as they are
1,it 's a very good movie,it 's a very good movie
1,punch and the beast is one film i will not watch,punch is one of those rare movies that has no plot no
1,during a brief scene in the film where a woman was killed by her boyfriend and a woman she is strangled with a gun,during the course of his journey his mother and his wife are murdered by the local authorities who are forced to fend for themselves
1,one day a young girl comes across a woman named delia who has the exact same task,one of the best things of this series is that it was a very funny show with a
1,hmmm i do have a problem,hmmm it 's a little too slow
1,the story is simple but there 's no real plot,the story is a complete mess of a movie that is
1,it is not the worst movie ever but i think,it is not a film to be taken seriously
1,of course there is n't much to this film and that is what i would like to see,of all things considered wrong i do n't know how it is a good movie to watch
1,naturally it was n't a bad thing,naturally the film is n't even remotely good
1,an old friend is killed by an unknown woman,an interesting story about a young boy named angus who
1,there 's nothing wrong in making a film about a bunch of kids,there is also some very funny moments and a few good moments
1,i do n't think this movie is a masterpiece,i was expecting the worst film ever made
1,how did the director and his writers think that this was,how can you have such a good time and place
1,the acting is pretty bad the plot has a lot to do with a lot of action and some really stupid special fx,the film has a few moments of comedy that are funny but it is not a movie for those who enjoy watching a movie
1,and the ending where the two are reunited together in,and it does not matter what a film is
1,as the movie continues the film becomes increasingly boring and boring,as a result of a series the plot is so bad that
1,but the movie is n't as good,but it was a great film
1,the film was a little bit slow and it did not help that the plot was n't a complete mess but the story,the acting is good the story line is great but the acting the directing the script the story the music the dialogue
1,like i was n't a fan i was n't expecting to get the impression that it is a comedy,like the rest i found it difficult for me because the film is so boring it hurts me
1,the movie was n't bad at least,the film is very well done
1,even if you are looking for the worst horror movie ever to watch and,even if you are a fan of the original i would recommend it
1,it 's a shame that this movie did,it 's not a movie for everyone
1,it has been the last of my many movies that has made me want a lot,it is not a film for anyone interested in the history and its subject matter
1,i have never seen the original version but i can still remember the original,i was n't impressed by it because the movie was a complete waste
1,another problem is that it is so bad it was funny to watch,another thing that i did not understand is that the movie has no real
1,he is the most beautiful woman in history,he is a very talented actor and he is
1,the movie is very slow and the story drags slowly along,the movie is about a young girl who goes to the house
1,the story line is a mess but there is n't a single scene where a guy is killed and the guy is a victim of,the acting is good and i think the movie has a lot of good points to it but it 's not a bad movie
1,he 's a good director but it 's,he was the first of a kind
1,despite its flaws and the fact that the characters are not the most interesting characters are not the same characters that they play,despite the title this is a pretty good flick and it 's not just a movie it 's a very good movie
1,then the story is a little too long for the characters,then the movie is a bit too slow for me
1,it 's a shame to watch this movie,it is n't a good movie and it is
1,if you have not seen this film you will probably be disappointed by,if it was n't so obvious it could have been so good
1,his character has a lot of potential,his wife is a little too young to
1,michel vaughn plays the part he is in the beginning but the movie is just too bad,michel vaughn is great here he has great screen chemistry with a young woman that has a heart
1,ellen 's performance in this movie was very,ellen burstyn is the most talented character
1,not to mention that it 's the only film i 've watched that 's as good to speechless,not only is it the best it 's in this genre but the movie is n't bad at least
1,to be sure i was a little disappointed,to me it was the worst of all time
1,the movie starts with a very promising premise and the acting and the story is so well executed that it 's,the movie starts with a bunch of people walking around in the woods talking about what happened to each other
1,jack lemmon is one that i would like to know but the rest of the cast was n't that great either,jack lemmon and his wife and the rest are both very good and i think that this is a great show for
1,snacks in the middle and end up being the,snacks and the film has some great performances
1,and it 's a good film to be seen,and it 's a shame because i think the movie
1,why do they have such a bad reputation,why does the movie makers think this movie was
1,we get a very interesting view of a young boy and her mother who is a child,we get a lot to love about this film and it 's a very good movie to watch
1,was he trying to get out with the woman he was in,was it really necessary to get the message of this movie
1,what 's the point of this show it has no real plot and,what 's with the whole thing about the way it ended abruptly
1,of course the film has some of its moments,of course he is a bit of fun and it
1,cohen has made a film of a similar theme,cohen has been a master of filmmaking since he directed
1,nearly everything about this movie is awful,nearly every scene has a distinct effect on
1,when i first heard that this was a movie of the week i,when i saw this film i thought i was watching a parody
1,and i think it would be the best,and the acting is n't too awful
1,this is a film about a young,this movie has no real plot
1,gene wilder has a very good sense of humor,gene tierney is the best in the movie but it
1,too much to think about it,too often i do not understand why
1,michael caine is also good and his portrayal in his acting,michael moore 's character was a bit of an actor
1,despite its shortcomings the film does n't really do anything for me,despite being in a class i do n't know what to say but
1,the acting is good the plot was ok and there are plenty better movies in the past few decades and the ones,the story line of the movie is so bad you 'll have a hard time figuring out how this got going
1,in fact it 's not even a movie,in fact the only reason this movie was released
1,valeria 's father is a bit too long,valeria is a young woman and she is a
1,yet the film is a very enjoyable film,yet another thing the movie has a lot of
1,american psycho 2 the first thing that i noticed was that the film did not make a movie,american psycho is one of the most boring movies ever to have graced a few years of horror
1,the movie is a little bit too slow for me,the story of the story was very interesting but the characters
1,basically a film like the one in the book and a few other films of this ilk are the ones i 've,basically the movie was a complete waste of money and i would n't be watching the movie for the first time
1,heres to the director 's vision and you 'll be able into a movie that will not be a good one,heres the same movie and you 'll have to see it to find out who 's responsible the most part
1,the acting is horrible the script and the direction,the story line was good the characters were interesting and
1,i have never read the book but the story was a bit weak and the ending was too abrupt to be,i think it is the best of his movies that i 've ever seen and the best of it all
1,apparently the movie is a bit of an insult for anyone,apparently the movie is a little too long for me
1,such as that is not a problem,such a film could be made
1,that was a very good thing,that said this movie is a must
1,the story was n't that good,the movie is about a young man
1,typically the plot is a mess of the imagination of,typically it 's a good thing to be able
1,yoda 's character has a lot less than a little more than he is and he,yoda was an excellent actor and he is the only one that has to do
1,it 's a very bad story with no redeeming value to it,it 's not even a good movie it just does not work out
1,i think the reason for the movie 's existence was that it was a bit,i do agree with the other reviewer who said the ending was so horrible
1,tidbit the movie is about the man who 's in his own right,tidbit i think the director is trying to get the audience to see it
1,a very good and very very funny movie about the evils,a very enjoyable movie that should be seen by many
1,then the film goes on and on and we get to see the whole thing,then again it 's not a bad idea but i think it 's a good movie
1,nick stahl is a fine choice for the role,nick broomfield 's film was the first of the many
1,you 'll see it coming in the end,you 'll be amazed by this film
1,someone who has n't seen the movie know that this is not the movie that,someone has the ability of a character and the audience to see the film
1,this is one of those movies that you can watch and,this is a film for those interested to the genre
1,but the movie is not as great,but it 's just that bad
1,the acting was terrible the directing is,the movie was shot in black
1,my friend was in the theater for no reason at all,my favorite part is when the two guys meet in the woods
1,o'toole is the best actor in this movie but the rest is not a good one,o'toole plays a young woman whose husband and her husband 's husband have been married
1,what is more important is how the film,what is the deal with the character
1,rating 12 points for the acting,rating 12 stars out of 5
1,the acting was n't too great and the plot line was very bad,the acting was terrible and the plot line was so bad i could n't
1,so if you are a fan you will not be surprised,so i do commend that the movie has no redeeming qualities to
1,the film is very well acted and is a good film that is a must see if your looking,the story is about two young adults who are living together and each other in their respective lives
1,i was surprised that this movie is a,i was so disappointed by the story
1,so the movie starts off as an interesting and funny,so i have to give credit for the performances
1,we 're supposed to believe the characters and,we have to watch it for yourself
1,the acting is very good and it 's a pity that,the film is very well made but it is not
1,sorry but this was a very bad movie,sorry for the poor acting and the fact of
1,this was the worst film ever made,this movie is not for people with any
1,guy pearce plays the role he is in the first movie and that is the only way he could have played a,guy pearce 's character was so bad that he could n't have been more paralysis he 's not a bad guy
1,this is a film for those with a sense about what to do,this movie was not a good film but it was a good film that
1,i think the film is not a good idea and it 's not the best of its predecessor it 's not the worst,i was surprised to see this in the first few weeks and that is the only way i could possibly enjoy this film as
1,there is a very good story in this,there was n't much of a story
1,the story of this is a good thing,the story is a bit of fun
1,i think it 's a great movie,i do n't think i 've ever heard
1,in fact it is not a good movie and is just a waste on a,in fact it 's a shame that it has not received a wide audience
1,anyway it is a great show that will never be forgotten and will always be remembered by all,anyway it is a very good story with great acting and great music by the legendary composer
1,hank 's character is not only a very good movie but it 's still not a bad,hank 's father is a great character and he is very funny and is very good
1,he was the only person to die in the movie because of this,he has a great sense to make a movie about his own life
1,naturally the movie has some good moments but it is still a pretty good film to see in its entirety,naturally the film is not only a vehicle for a few scenes of violence and violence but also the most explicit
1,the film is a bit too long for a thriller but there are some very funny moments,the film 's premise of a serial killer is n't too much of an explanation to his character
1,she 's a very beautiful woman and a great actor,she is a very good actor who is not a bad
1,not to mention the lack of a coherent script to make this movie work even more,not only is it a complete mess of the film but it is a very good film
1,when the two of them are on screen they are all,when i saw this on tv it was very good
1,but the film is a very good movie,but i do not think that the movie would
1,i'm not going to spoil this movie,i'm not sure whether the actors are trying
1,not to mention the fact that this was a low budget movie made by professionals,not only does the film restore a few of its contemporaries but a lot to it
1,a good movie with great performances from the actors,a good film to watch with your friends and friends
1,elsewhere the movie 's plot revolves on a young boy who is sent to a remote island to assassinate the,elsewhere i was expecting something like the other two films i have n't seen but this was n't one
1,i have n't seen the first two movies,i think this is an important part for anyone
1,the movie starts out with a bunch in a bar and the,the acting in the movie was good the acting is good
1,but the real problem here is the lack of anything resembling the characters and their actions,but this is the first time you have seen it and it 's not the only one
1,but it 's not a great movie,but the film 's biggest problem with it
1,the film is not a documentary but rather a film noir and an attempt to recreate a film that,the film has a lot more to offer but it 's just so much better than it is
1,even the actors who played this movie were not bad and were n't good either but i was surprised to see that it was,even though i do n't have much to compare with other horror films i have to say that this is a good movie
1,a few years back i was looking at a tv show that was a little too much of a stretch,a good example is when the movie starts out with an old lady who has a crush in her head
1,it 's not even a bad movie but it,it was so bad i was so angry
1,i was so impressed by the movie that i,i think that it is a great film
1,the movie is a complete mess with the usual plot holes,the story is simple but there was n't enough action
1,but it is n't the same as the one,but this is not a movie you can watch in
1,what a shame the cw has done,what a wonderful and beautiful film
1,the film is very well done and is,the movie is a very good one
1,not to forget that the director has made a movie that is a bit too long for me,not only does it not take the cake for it to begin with the viewer 's interest but also
1,the film is a very good film,the movie was a little slow but it
1,i was n't expecting much from it,i think that the movie is a little
1,rob schneider plays the role of the detective and he does his best with a very convincing performance as the villain and the rest is a real pleasure to see,rob lowe plays a very good character actor who plays a role in a movie like this that he can play a man who has a good heart but does nothing
1,the story is simple and is n't a complete loss,the movie is about as much a documentary as a documentary
1,the film is a complete waste of,the acting and directing is horrible
1,there was no plot line and the acting was n't very good,there 's nothing inherently wrong with this movie and it 's a shame
1,where the hell did they have to,where the hell was the music
1,but i have no clue why i would n't watch this movie,but it 's a shame that this movie has n't been released theatrically
1,naturally the movie was a bit slow but it was n't,naturally this movie does a lot of things and it 's not
1,i have never seen such a bad movie in my life,i have never seen any other films of the genre that were
1,decided that he was n't in his element,decided the director had no knowledge about the story
1,it 's not a bad movie but i have to disagree with other reviewers who say that this film,it 's a very good movie and i hope that you get to watch the whole thing again
1,how can i not get the dvd,how can i say this film was made
1,and i have no idea why,and the film 's ending is so
1,unfortunately the movie does not have a chance for it and it 's a little slow,unfortunately the script and the script is so bad that i could n't help but laugh
1,sci fi channel 's film is one of the most popular films of the 1980s but,sci chaney is the best of the lot and it was a pleasure for me
1,the film has a great cast including john carradine,the acting was n't too good but i did not
1,sure the film was made in the,sure it 's a great movie
1,heroes and the lunatics who were the only people in town who knew what they had had to do,heroes are the most powerful of the bunch and their lives in their respective destinies are the real deal and
1,the movie starts off with the two leads of their own and they,the story was n't very good and the acting was n't bad
1,and the ending is so ridiculous and predictable that it 's,and the movie is not a total waste of time
1,i do not want to spoil the film but it 's not a good,i think the director was a bit more interested in making this movie
1,this is a film about a group of young women who are,this movie has a very good cast and a nice cast
1,well it is n't that bad but this movie is n't bad it is just bad,well this is a film that will make you laugh and you can do it
1,some people say it 's a great film but that 's what it is,some of it is not as good or interesting or memorable as the other movies
1,the film is a complete mess of an hour long long,the film is a complete mess of mine but i do n't
1,dont even get into this mess of a film and i would have to be the,dont have the same problem as the first movie and the ending is pretty good
1,the story of the movie was very good and was told in a very realistic fashion that it was a real treat to,the film has a lot more to offer than it 's predecessor but the fact remains a very very very dark story
1,movie is not as good and as a film it,movie is a movie that is n't a comedy
1,i have to say that i was n't impressed by the,i do not know what to say about the film
1,i do n't think that a good thing could be made in the first film,i have to admit that i am not going for a movie that i would like
1,so the movie was made for tv but there was no,so the film is a complete waste of my time
1,the film has some of the most beautiful scenes in the movie,the story of a woman who is a little too much for a
1,they were n't all bad guys,they were all very good in the
1,a few of these movies are a bit too bad but this one,a very interesting story of a young woman in her early twenties
1,another thing that is so bad is that the movie was so bad,another thing the music was good too and i was impressed by it
1,i was n't sure why i wanted,i was n't expecting a lot
1,i have n't laughed out loud at a,i was n't impressed by a film
1,the film has an odd plot and the acting is very wooden but that is n't the case,the acting is pretty bad and the script was so bad that i could n't believe it
1,world wide is a film that has a lot to,world war ii is the first of the many
1,the movie starts out with the girl being killed and the woman 's sister says the name is not so much of a surprise,the film is about the power to be the main character and the film is not as good as some of those films it was
1,so i guess it is the same old same old same old time same,so if i had a copy of this i would have been warned
1,how did they get it right,how can anyone tell a good story
1,judge reinhold is the best actor in hollywood and the most impressive performance by the man in his early years,judge reinhold 's character is so unlikable and he is so unlikable that he does n't seem to know what to
1,nevertheless i was surprised to see that there were a,nevertheless i think that the director should be commended
1,memories are the only things that can,memories are always a bit harsh
1,this is a great movie for those who like the genre but you should n't be warned,this is a very good film and a very good example for a comedy and is a very
1,read the book and you will be very disappointed,read the book and you will see how the film
1,this is one of the most beautiful,this is not a bad movie
1,bad guys bad accents bad accents bad music,bad movie and not the worst of all time
1,bonnie is a good actress but she does n't,bonnie and pumbaa is a very good film
1,the story is simple enough to make you think,the story of the movie and its plot and the
1,but i was so disappointed by that,but the film 's only redeeming factor is
1,however it 's still pretty much a movie that has some redeeming,however the film is a bit too dark for its time
1,other than that it 's a pretty bad horror movie,other reviewers have commented on the accuracy of the movie and
1,with the title of this movie it 's the only way to get this turkey,with the help from a few other sources the plot is not very original either but
1,i was surprised that the film was not available on,i have to say i am a huge fan
1,hmm i do not have the patience of watching it again and again and it 's a shame it 's never,hmm it is a little bit more of an attempt by the director but the film is n't that bad
1,i have seen the first movie,i think the director should have had
1,just like the other reviewer said this is a good,just do a good job of making a movie
1,he is also a very good character in a film that is not just as good,he was the only one who had been able for him to be a hero
1,please i beg you to do it with,please please do not watch this movie
1,it was so bad that the film had a very bad script that,it is a shame because the film is n't a great film
1,i'm not a prude and that is the way the story unfolds but it is a great movie,i'm a fan of the series but i have to admit that i was n't disappointed in it
1,others have a good sense of humor and the movie is a bit of a stretch,others do a lot of research to make the point of this movie a bit too bad
1,it 's a very good show and it is a great show,it was n't the most original of it but i did enjoy the
1,actually it is n't a movie for everyone,actually the film was n't so good it was
1,together with the first two films the story of this is a very interesting one and a good one to watch and is a must,together they are not a bad movie they are all good and i do n't know what it is about them that is the only good
1,it 's a pity that the film has a lot of action scenes and the movie is,it 's a pity the filmmakers did n't have to be a fan of the genre
1,if i was a fan like me i would have been a little confused,if the director was trying to get to the end the movie would be much
1,i think this film is one that i would recommend for those interested in the work that is the subject matter,i have to say the movie was very well made and the acting was good but i liked this film and i
1,the acting and script is a joke,the acting was horrible but i really liked
1,yet another movie about an evil killer,yet the movie was so good
1,he is not in this film but he 's not as bad in the first film as he did,he 's a very good guy who is not afraid that a person is killed by the devil
1,they 're the kind to make this movie,they are both the most talented people of the
1,if you are a fan you 'll be disappointed by what you see,if you 're a huge fan and have been watching a movie that has
1,also a good idea of the film is that they are all good actors,also i thought that this movie was really bad it was so boring that i
1,and the movie was shot in a,and it 's a good movie
1,however it was a little too slow for me,however the film has a very nice and interesting ending
1,but it is a very good movie and,but it is not a bad movie
1,all the other movies have a plot that makes a good story,all in all it 's a pretty good film but it 's still
1,while i do n't know what to think of that it was the most popular film i saw,while i have seen the original movie and the movie and the other comments i have noticed that the
1,it 's just so bad and the acting was so bad,it 's a shame that the film has n't received much praise
1,but this movie does n't have a good cast and it is not,but it does make a good movie and i have seen better
1,this is a film for all ages,this movie is a great example to the
1,c'mon i know that the movie has,c'mon i have seen this movie
1,sure there 's a few good moments but,sure it 's not a good movie
1,the acting was n't great and there was n't much else,the movie is very slow paced and not very funny
1,the movie is a very good example for a movie,the story of the movie is a good mix of comedy
1,there was no real plot and the acting was n't,there is no reason for this to be made
1,likewise this is a very good movie and a good one at it,likewise the film has a lot of good acting and a good cast
1,you can see the actors in the movie and they do n't know what to think or how they are going,you have to be one of the best to have been a fan of this film for years and years
1,directed by john woo who wrote the script and the screenplay by david cronenberg,directed in a way that makes you wonder if it was a comedy
1,they are not funny and the film does not seem as funny or,they were all very well executed and i would like this show
1,elizabeth shue is the best actress in the movie,elizabeth shue plays the role of her mother and is
1,how did he get to make this movie in a theater where he was in the theater and,how could it have been a little more interesting to have the movie makers of the original
1,a lot happens to have been shot in the head with no one 's left,a lot more than the average movie that is n't even worth the effort
1,it is not the best movie ever made,it has a good plot line and good acting
1,holly is a great actress who has,holly is a very good character
1,and the film 's main character is the most annoying,and the film has a lot to be funny
1,4 the plot was very weak and,4 the story was very good
1,each time i see the movie i will say i have seen the movie and it has to go to a lot,each time he gets into a job of a man and the girl and the two lovers go on the road together the
1,you know the drill is going to be the only one in this,you 'll be surprised that you 're not in for a treat
1,if you 're looking to watch a good film with the same story you can do better than,if you 're a fan of the genre and the original series you 'll enjoy this film
1,i have never seen a film that has been told so strongly,i was surprised to see that the movie was made for tv
1,perhaps it was just the fact that the movie was filmed in the early seventies,perhaps the most memorable aspect of the film however is the fact that the film is
1,ok the acting in this movie is horrible and the script is just plain awful but i think that the actors are all good,ok so i have to say i was a bit skeptical when i saw this movie but i was very disappointed with that one and
1,its the kind of movie that makes you feel bad,its not a great movie but it is not
1,it has a great cast of characters that i loved in my opinion and i loved it so much,it is a movie of sorts and it is a very enjoyable movie and it 's a very good family
1,not to mention a few things about a man 's body,not only was this movie bad but they were n't good enough
1,do n't be fooled by this review,do n't worry to see it in theaters
1,what is this movie about the subject of,what is the deal with this film
1,there is a lot of violence and,there are some very funny moments
1,my favorite scene was when the kids are trying to escape the girl and the girl is trying her hand at the door but she 's just not a bad guy and she,my favorite scene is where the girl is sitting on a bed and talking to her husband and says that he has no idea how the girl is going for her life
1,you have to be kidding me to watch this show,you can see the movie and its a great deal
1,rockin' a film about the life of two young men who are not the same,rockin' the first film in a long time and a great movie for the viewer and
1,louis gossett is one great character,louis malle is a genius and a
1,what i did n't realize is the fact it is not a movie that i would like to see,what i did n't like was that the movie had a very good plot and i was surprised to find
1,i have never seen a movie like the first,i have n't been able to see any of the
1,we 're talking a little too late,we have the movie that is a lot
1,i was n't impressed with it,i do not think this is a
1,and i think it 's a very good movie,and the ending of it is a little anticlimatic
1,it is not a movie about a group that is in love,it 's a great movie and one that is worth watching
1,plus the movie is not a good one,plus it has a lot of great actors and
1,i think the director should be ashamed of himself,i think this is the best movie ever
1,it is a movie with a very good message,it has a good cast and it is very funny
1,however the movie was not very bad and it 's just a,however the story is a bit too thin to be true
1,horror movies are n't bad but the ones they are n't good are just plain bad,horror movies like the exorcist but it 's not that bad either it is just a waste
1,also the film 's main theme song was the,also the movie was shot in black white
1,sandra bullock 's character is so annoying that i do not know how she could have been so good,sandra bernhard was the only reason to watch this movie and she 's the best actress in the film and
1,i have to say that this was a,i was so excited about the movie
1,this is the kind of movie you would like if it were n't for,this movie has a very funny and very good performance by sean connery
1,this is a very very bad show,this film has been done so much that
1,and it does n't even have that much,and it 's not that it does
1,guess what the hell was going to happen but i was,guess what the film is about the plot and acting
1,dressed as an excuse to be a great film,dressed in a black cloak and sporting an oversized shirt
1,now the movie is about an old lady who is,now i have seen a lot of bad movies
1,it has the same kind that i did n't know about the first,it is not the worst movie ever but it is still good
1,the story is a complete mess and it 's not even that,the movie starts off with some interesting scenes but is not
1,his character is a bit underdeveloped and the plot line has nothing to do with the plot at least for,his performance in this movie has to be the funniest thing about this movie that is n't really funny
1,people who have been watching the show have been in the minority for years and,people like the people who made this show should be allowed by the parents
1,full moon has a very funny cameo and i think that it 's not a bad,full moon is a movie that i would love to see again in my life
1,to me it is a very funny,to me this is an insult
1,woodbury 's character was a little too much and too much to be fleshed out,woodbury is the only person who is willing to be a little bit of an actress
1,but i do think that the film is a great deal better than,but this is a great film for those who enjoy watching movies
1,i do think that the director 's intention is that it is the only way to make a movie that has a good script but,i do n't think that the actors are good enough to be a good actor but the script does not have the same level
1,compare it with other movies of the same genre,compare this film to the classic hollywood classic
1,richard widmark is a fine director and his work is not a complete washout,richard widmark plays a character that has to be seen as a character
1,on the plus side there is a bit of,on this occasion it 's a good movie
1,it 's the kind of film where a film can make the viewer feel uneasy,it was n't even the first one but it 's still a great movie that you
1,the movie starts out with a bunch of friends and a bunch of,the movie was n't a complete disaster it was a complete mess
1,fonda 's performance is also excellent,fonda is a fine director and he
1,however i do think it is one that is so much better than,however it is a very funny and enjoyable movie that i enjoyed
1,the acting in this movie is horrible,the acting is good the writing is great
1,i have seen this film several times and i still enjoy,i was so disappointed that this movie was n't released
1,remember that it 's not that the film was shot in color,remember it was a movie that i had to watch and i was
1,this is a movie for all people,this movie is so much better
1,i do agree with the previous reviewer that this film had,i do not know if this is a bad film
1,you can see the movie as an excuse,you 'll be able for a laugh
1,the acting is pretty bad but it,the story is a bit thin
1,the movie has some great moments but the,the film has some very interesting elements
1,judy garland was the best actress in the movie but her character did n't really have much of,judy davis plays a character who 's a bit more interesting than her usual and selfish husband
1,his character was a caricature and a little too unlikable to be credible but he was,his character in the book is a little more complex than the character he played
1,her performance is the most interesting aspect in a film,her performance in this movie is very well done but it
1,some of the scenes are very good,some of these are not bad but they
1,i was surprised to discover that this is the first of three,i do n't want to ruin the film for everyone but i guess
1,very few movies have been done so well,very little of that is the point of the
1,how could it not be a good idea to get the money,how many times do you think it 's a good thing
1,both of the leads in the cast were great in their roles as they did in this,both of them are a real threat to each other but the story of the characters is so
1,thirdly this is a great movie and i,thirdly it is a very good film
1,both of these characters were the best i have ever seen in a movie,both films are not very well done but this is the most memorable
1,fave was the only one i could think of,fave was the worst i have ever seen
1,i have to agree with the other,i have never been more disappointed
1,ian holm is a very talented director,ian mcshane is a very talented actress and
1,almost every scene in the film was shot in a very different way,almost all of the actors are all fine except for a couple that were
1,and the film is a bit slow at,and it is n't even that good
1,it is a movie with a lot to do to get a good message,it is a movie that has a few good moments in the beginning
1,it 's a great movie that will leave the audience wanting to watch a lot of movies,it 's a shame because the plot was n't very original and the actors were n't very convincing
1,there are some good performances but they are,there 's also some very funny scenes
1,the acting is good and i really enjoyed that,the story of this movie was a lot more interesting
1,episode 2 is an excellent episode of,episode 4 is one of them
1,tomato jawed movie with a very good cast,tomato bahrani 's direction was very impressive
1,we have seen a few movies that have n't aged in a million ways,we are not talking about the story or the characters but the story is a
1,blu kinnear 's performance is the best of the bunch and his portrayal,blu kinnear is the most convincing in the business of the film
1,other reviewers have pointed this out but i do agree,other than that it is not a good film
1,if i was the one who wrote the book i would,if the movie was n't bad the acting was terrible
1,betsy palmer is excellent as a woman,betsy milano is the perfect actress
1,films are not the best of this genre,films like the thief of zenda and the shining
1,all in this one is just plain bad,all the other reviewers have commented on this movie
1,the movie is a very good example of how a film can be done in a way with,the movie starts off as a series of events in the middle when the characters start talking
1,in a nutshell the movie is about the power to be an ordinary and powerful person who has a very difficult time,in fact the only redeeming quality in this entire production is the presence that the director and writer had to pay for this
1,serbs are shown to a group called,serbs were not the same age
1,do n't get me out of the movie and the fact that i have to admit the film,do not waste my money to see it if it is on cable or dvd for free
1,embracing a movie for the sake of seeing the first movie,embracing the other comments i have to say i was a huge
1,and the acting by a young demi clarke is,and the film is a very interesting one
1,is it that the movie was n't made by an actor,is that a real shame that i was n't able to find
1,the story is very interesting the story is interesting and the characters in the film have a good time to them,the acting was horrible the plot was bad the acting is awful the effects are bad the story is ridiculous and just
1,dust was a good film but not as bad as i thought the first,dust and the beast is a film about the lives and the fall
1,but the film 's plot is not as good as it sounds and is n't a good movie,but the movie has a lot more to offer and the story line was so good that it was
1,the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever,the film is about two men in their
1,the story of the movie is a,the movie is not for everyone
1,as a fan of this movie i thought it would have made some more of,as a result the film is very good in the way the characters interact
1,first of the time i was in the theater and the movie,first off i was a little disappointed in seeing the movie
1,i was expecting a lot of fun but i found the movie very boring,i have seen a lot of movies and i have seen the original but i
1,now i know that it is a movie that is a complete waste,now the film was shot in black but it did n't work at any
1,i do not know if the director is trying to cram in the intentional humor but it is just not funny,i was surprised at how much i enjoyed the film so much as i did not like it at all
1,these are some things i hate to be a fan of,these two are the two main actors in this film
1,this is a movie that i can watch over again with my friends on vhs,this is a film that is n't afraid for all that the movie 's purpose to
1,to say the least the movie is about the power of a young man,to say that it 's not a comedy is a mystery to me because it
1,right now the movie has a lot of action and a good story line to keep the viewer interested in the action scenes,right away i had to go to the cinema to see the movie i was disappointed to find out what it 's like to
1,as a result it 's not the same as the one,as i watched this movie i was n't sure if it was
1,but i have to say that the film is very good and it 's a great,but the film 's only purpose is the acting by a few of the cast
1,the story is very weak and it,the acting and directing was terrible
1,this movie is a complete failure,this is not a bad movie it
1,the story is simple and it has a very good cast that includes a,the movie is a little bit slow moving and it 's too slow
1,to make matters even more ridiculous it does not work,to be honest i do n't know why i was so
1,in a nutshell the movie has a lot of potential,in the end i was hoping the movie could be a
1,george clooney was a great choice to play the part,george c mcginley is a genius in this movie and he
1,the acting in this film is superb,the story line was good and the acting
1,of course there 's no doubt that there are,of course the film does n't really work
1,the story is a little weak and the characters are n't believable either and it seems like,the film has some nice shots and it 's a great film that i would recommend
1,with this film i was a little skeptical and i was not disappointed by this one at least it 's not a good movie,with the possible plot twist and over the top acting the film is a bit slow but the plot twists and the acting are excellent
1,nothing is ever said about it,nothing about this movie makes any sense
1,this was a movie that was made in a very short amount of,this movie was not for me and it was not the best
1,this is a very good movie with,this movie is a great film
1,it 's not a movie for everyone to see and there,it has to do the same with every other character
1,anyway the movie is a bit too long,anyway the movie is n't that great
1,the movie has some good points but the script was not so bad it was good the story had potential,the film has a few moments where the viewer has to sit through the movie and the story is a complete
1,it has a good story line that is n't afraid of the story of the characters,it 's a shame that such a bad movie is n't given a chance by the director
1,sure it 's a bit dated but the movie is a complete mess of its own,sure it was a bit of a shock to sit there and it 's hard to understand
1,the story is about a group who go through the motions,the story of a woman in a small town and a woman
1,the film has a lot going on and it has a very interesting ending,the acting is horrible the plot is stupid and the acting is bad
1,the movie is a complete mess,the acting is pretty bad and it
1,to be fair there 's no real reason that it is not a,to me this is a film that should be seen by everyone
1,overall this movie is a must see,overall it is a very good and entertaining
1,all in all this film is a waste on a rainy afternoon and it 's a shame that this movie is not available on dvd or vhs release,all in the name of it is a great movie for those who like the music and the music and the songs in the film and the music score
1,as a movie it 's not as good as the first,as the movie opens you can see why it is a film
1,i think the director and director of this film should be commended,i think that 's the reason i did n't go out of my
1,i think it is an important point to see the first two films in the past decade,i do n't know how to describe a movie that is n't bad but not in a good
1,and the acting in this movie sucks the acting,and i was so impressed with the acting
1,but it 's not that great it 's just bad,but it does make you laugh and it will leave your
1,the movie is a little bit of fun to watch,the movie is a complete waste of my time but i
1,they are the best actors ever and they 're all very likable,they are the most interesting and interesting characters in history history
1,an interesting film with the exception of the first half of the film,an excellent example of how a talented filmmaker who could make a good movie
1,think of the film as a comedy,think about the fact i did not see
1,the acting is good the script well the story line is good the story was good the story line well the story lines were good and the,the film 's plot involves a young girl who works in her apartment with a wealthy woman who 's not even a good woman at all
1,wanting to make the film as an excuse,wanting to see a lot of movies
1,i was surprised to see this film at the sundance festival,i do n't think this film is a good example of how
1,first i was a bit disappointed in a movie that was so,first off the movie was not so much of a surprise
1,it 's not a bad thing that a lot like the movie is in the book but it is,it was n't even funny and i did n't even get to hear the dialog and the dialog
1,of course there are some great scenes in this movie but it is n't a great story,of all the movies i have made i have a soft side of the movie but i do
1,when i watched it on television it was a waste,when i saw the preview i was expecting a good movie
1,yes i have a lot of fun,yes the acting is pretty bad
1,which brings us to the movie and it shows how the director is in the process that he has to do something with his camera and his ability at the camera lens,which i thought it would be a great movie to see but it is not for everyone but if you are a fan of the series you should see this one
1,i do n't want my time again to watch this film again,i do not think that the film is worth the money
1,he is a great director and a,he 's not a good guy
1,that is the best part in the movie,that 's why i love this show and it
1,i do n't know if it was a,i think it is a good movie
1,even the acting and direction is terrible as well and there are some really good actors,even though i have not read the book i do n't think it 's that bad
1,in the end he is a great character actor,in the end i felt that the movie had a
1,but the movie does n't work,but i do think that this is
1,william powell plays his usual self and he is very good in his part as a,william holden and john wayne are the only ones who have to deal and cope
1,imperium 's character in the movie is the only reason i can think of a good film,imperium 's character is a bit of an obnoxious idiot who is a bit of an obnoxious character
1,now the film was made for a very,now the film is a total mess
1,exciting and interesting but i do have a problem,exciting and funny the film 's message and a good
1,too often they 're not funny,too bad it 's not even a
1,although this movie is n't a complete waste of time it 's still pretty,although the film is a good one it 's still not that bad
1,it 's not a bad thing,it 's not the best movie of
1,unfortunately the movie was made for television,unfortunately the story is not so much the
1,it has been said that i was n't a fan,it was a great film and i loved that
1,matlin is a very talented actress who does n't look like a normal actress but,matlin 's performance is the only reason why she is not the main character
1,considering the talent he has to offer the audience is still in awe of him and his character and the way he treats them,considering that this is not an action film the plot was n't too good and the ending did not make it any better
1,folks do you know how many people you can hate and,folks i think that 's why i liked this movie
1,i do n't know why i did n't see it in a theater,i was expecting a movie about the hardships that were supposed but the movie
1,this is the best movie i 've ever watched and i have to say,this was a great movie for me and my friend and my girlfriend
1,our heroes were not the only thing we did not know existed,our hero and his wife have to go through the motions
1,whenever i saw this film i had to be a big to see this,whenever i saw the movie on the dvd i had a great idea
1,a few years later the film was shot in the same year with the same actors as,a few of these scenes in the movie are so bad it 's funny to watch
1,as a matter the movie is very good but it,as a movie it fails to be any more
1,good luck to see the first two movies,good luck for a good film but not enough
1,if it was on the big budget it would have made it to a high end of my life but the fact that i have seen this movie in a theater i can only hope that it will,if it was n't that the movie was a bit more interesting it was a bit of fun and it was n't as bad but the acting was so bad that it made me angry at all
1,i think this is the best part i 've seen for a long while,i do n't know if it was the same thing that happened to me
1,the film has a lot more to offer and it is more than just a drama,the film was shot with an open mind but that 's not enough and the movie does
1,shot on video in new york it 's a very good show,shot in black and white it was a bit too slow for the
1,ah i have a feeling of gratitude for this,ah the film is about a group called the filthiest
1,the acting was good and i loved it,the film is a very interesting one
1,dragons and the snowman are the only ones who are able to survive and,dragons is one that is not worth the trouble of renting the dvd
1,all in all a great movie,all the actors in the film are
1,her performance in a movie made by the director of the film is so good that she is n't even close to the level,her performance was a little stiff but she was very believable and i was surprised that her character did n't get the slightest bit of
1,in fact it 's just a bad film,in fact i have to admit that the film
1,but the real problem with most of the films of the film is that it is so boring,but the film is a very entertaining and enjoyable film and a great example to the director
1,the story is very simple the characters are likable and the plot is so intriguing that it 's not even worth a watch,the movie is a little too short for its subject matter but the movie does n't seem to have enough time to sustain any
1,but it 's a good thing,but the film is so much fun
1,the story line is very interesting and it 's a,the story of the movie was interesting and interesting
1,robertson is the only one who has ever seen this movie and it is a great shame because he 's a great talent,robertson 's performance is a bit too stiff and the film has no real redeeming qualities at least not for the good acting and
1,it has to have to be one that has a lot of action and a few twists but the movie is a complete waste of time,it is not that it 's not a bad idea to have been made to be a movie about an american woman who was born in a
1,you can tell that this was made for tv and that,you 'll never know what is going to happen next
1,bakshi 's direction was so low and low that it 's almost a shock to see him in the,bakshi has made a good movie in the past and it is a very enjoyable one to see
1,as for the rest i have to admit that i was n't disappointed,as a result of the fact that the movie was made in a small
1,in the first part the characters are introduced to the characters and,in the end it 's a very good and enjoyable movie
1,this was a movie for the kids,this was a very bad movie and i
1,however the film 's only flaw is that it is a little too much,however the film 's only redeeming quality to the production is to look at it
1,the movie has some nice scenes and a great cast,the acting is good with a few exceptions but it is
1,it 's a very bad movie and it 's hard to believe,it is a shame that the film has been so hard
1,is it possible to make a film like that that is so good,is this a movie for anyone who enjoys movies with a few twists
1,thanks to the cast for a good story,thanks to this film it 's a very interesting
1,and the film has a lot of fun,and it does have some good acting
1,some of the actors are n't that great but,some have commented on it as a movie
1,i think this was the first time,i think it would be great
1,mathieu is a young boy who is a teenager,mathieu is a very good actor who is very good
1,actually i do not think it was a good idea to have this movie to the same extent,actually i have to admit that i am not a fan of either the book nor the movie itself
1,i think the movie was a little too good for the first ten minutes,i have never heard of this film before and have no qualms on the imdb
1,but it 's not a movie,but this movie was a big disappointment
1,it is not the best film that i have yet to watch,it 's the kind of film that makes you laugh and cry and
1,but it 's not a good idea to show the movie to a very,but it 's a very bad movie and the ending was pretty bad
1,he 's a little bit too old for a good movie and i think he 's a good choice for the role,he 's not a bad guy but he is a good man and a great actor who can act in a very bad
1,also it 's a very nice film that the,also i thought this was a good movie
1,i have never seen such an amazing performance in a film as the lead actress,i think it 's the best of the series but it 's still a good movie
1,lee is the only one who seems to have a clue about the whereabouts of his son,lee is not as good as his character but he does a good turn of the film as
1,what i found interesting is that there was a lot of the film in the book,what 's worse is that the director is so inept that it 's almost laughable
1,the film is a complete failure to watch,the story of this movie is a bit too
1,such a great movie that i could n't,such a movie is a good idea
1,this is a very bad attempt at a,this is the worst of the three
1,well i have a lot of respect for a movie that is so bad that,well this movie is not for everyone and i would recommend it to anybody
1,he 's not even a very good actor but he is a great talent,he 's a little stiff and has no personality but he 's a little too
1,perhaps the film was shot entirely at the studio,perhaps this is not an easy task to watch
1,now i am not going to go into this detail as to be expected but the movie is not,now this film is a must for those looking for a movie that is a little over rated
1,its not a movie about the holocaust or the life or the world or its story about the world war i,its not that i do have to say it is the worst movie ever made and the acting is terrible
1,it is n't the worst film ever made,it was n't that bad but the movie is
1,the story is about an aging family who are living with the family who,the movie was a bit of an action movie but it 's not
1,sure this was a good movie but it is n't,sure the movie does n't make any difference but there 's
1,the story was very simple and i liked this film as much if i was a fan,the story line is very good and the characters are all likable and the story line
1,the acting was good but the story line is so bad that i ca all be,the movie is a little slow at times but it 's a very entertaining one
1,i have seen the movie several years ago,i have seen a number that is a bit
1,though the movie is n't as good as the first two it does n't even seem as though it 's a good,though the film is a bit slow paced and not too slow paced at all times it does n't really matter
1,a very interesting and very funny show,a very good film with a strong cast
1,whatever the reason it was a good idea,whatever the reason for the story and the acting
1,but it is not a good film and it 's not even,but it is a good film that i recommend to all
1,the story of this movie is so,the movie is a complete mess
1,it 's a very good movie to,it 's not a bad thing
1,i have to agree on the plot and the plot but it 's not a good movie to,i think the reason this show was so funny was that it had a few funny moments
1,how did he get a job on,how did this movie get made
1,otherwise the film is a complete mess,otherwise this is one of my favorite films
1,sean penn 's performance is excellent and the story is,sean connery plays his usual cocky but wellmeaning role
1,i was n't expecting much of this movie,i do n't understand the appeal of the story
1,i was so disappointed by this show,i have to agree with the reviewer who
1,of course the story is n't that good,of course the movie does not have any real
1,the film is a bit too slow and slow paced for the audience,the movie is a complete mess of a story and the characters seem to
1,raul russo is a great actor but he does n't have the charisma to carry this movie,raul russo was a genius and he 's not a great actor but he was a great choice
1,this is a film about a group,this movie is one to avoid
1,try and find the real story of the film,try and make a movie about a movie that is
1,but the movie does not make a whole lot,but the film 's main character is a young man
1,it 's a shame that this is not a film for everyone,it is a shame because the film was so good that the director
1,but it 's not a good film it 's very bad,but it 's not a bad movie either as it has been
1,instead we have a very bland story about the war that is not a war,instead it 's not just an ordinary movie that 's just a bad idea for a
1,i think it 's not a good thing to say that the movie was bad,i do not know how many movies i saw this year but it is one of
1,for the first time i have seen the movie in the theater and the only reason i gave it 2,for those who have n't read the novel this film is not for everyone who has seen the film
1,in the end the story was n't bad and it did n't work,in fact i was n't impressed by the movie 's plot and the characters
1,for me it 's a very entertaining movie,for the rest it is a little more interesting
1,i think this is one of those movies that is so good that it is n't even worth renting for its own sake but it,i do not know if it is a spoiler but i have seen it again and i have to admit i was n't bored
1,joel mccrea as a man with a,joel mccrea is a great actor
1,but the film does a good job at explaining,but the film is a bit too long
1,central character development of a man who is a man of the,central characters and characters who have no depth and no sense
1,the story of this movie is very good and the acting is excellent and it makes you feel like the real world,the movie was shot on video and it was filmed on a budget in the same location as the first movie which was
1,barbara steele plays a young girl who is sent by an older woman and her son,barbara stanwyck was a good actor and she had a good chemistry with the character
1,however it 's not a great movie,however it 's the same thing
1,nurse snowblood is one of those rare movies that has a lot of action and suspense,nurse helen is a beautiful and sexy woman who is a bit of an angel
1,for those of you that have n't watched it i would highly recommend it to anyone who loves,for a movie that is supposed to have some interesting characters the movie just feels very real
1,do n't be fooled if you 're looking for an intelligent,do n't worry about that because you 'll be disappointed
1,but the film 's plot was n't that great,but i think this is the best film of its
1,seagal is one of his most underrated actors in this movie,seagal is a good director but he is so obviously not that
1,ugh i have to say that i,ugh this movie is so horrible
1,not to mention that this is a movie that is,not to mention the lack that is the case
1,the story of an aging woman who has a secret affair with the family and is very much,the story is a bit thin and the acting and the script is terrible and the acting
1,the acting is horrible the story is awful the acting is bad,the acting in this film is excellent and the direction by robert de
1,because the movie is n't bad it is,because the movie is a complete mess
1,and the ending was just too stupid for me,and i have seen the movie numerous times
1,we have a lot more to do with the characters,we have seen the movie before and the story is very
1,i was n't really expecting the usual suspects to be the,i think this movie should be shown as part one
1,nothing happens in the movie but the acting and direction are all pretty good too,nothing about this movie is funny and it does n't even make much of a difference
1,rob reiner is a very good filmmaker but i think he 's a very talented filmmaker,rob lowe plays a young woman who is a struggling man in the world of her life
1,i think that the movie is very good and it 's not a bad movie,i have never seen a more mature and underappreciated actor and this is the best of
1,an example was when the first episode was announced,an example of how a movie can be made and
1,one can also say i liked the movie but,one of them was a very good movie
1,and it is the story of a man who loves the,and i do not know why this movie was made
1,i was n't sure whether it was a spoof or an a parody,i think the movie was very entertaining and it 's very funny to watch
1,i think it 's the best of the series,i was n't sure whether this movie would be a
1,i was n't expecting a lot of this movie,i was so excited to find out what i was
1,info is a good film but not a bad one,info to the director 's commentary on the film
1,it is not the worst movie i have yet to see and i'm sure i 'll,it has a great cast including a young seth green and the aforementioned vic stiller
1,a lot like the movie i have to say it 's a good movie but it is not a movie,a good example is how the film is shot in the first place and it looks like they had been shot
1,it is a movie about a man trying to survive a girl who is not a very good,it 's not the best movie i can remember and i have n't seen any of it
1,but the film is so bad that i actually cringed at it because,but this is a film for those who have seen a movie
1,it was a very good idea for the film,it 's a pity that it was n't available in
1,and the movie does not make a good story,and it is a very good film to be sure
1,norma shearer and james stewart were the only two good points to me,norma desmond 's character is a caricature of the young woman who is a
1,a very good and very enjoyable film that i enjoyed,a very enjoyable and enjoyable film that should be seen for
1,most movies are made up in this world of movies and they are not even good,most people who have seen this film have been warned about how they should be allowed it
1,this movie is a must see,this movie does not even deserve a
1,we get to see the film in the end of the film but i did n't,we get to see the film as the main character 's wife and the son
1,so i guess that 's why the story was n't so bad as it,so the film has some nice moments and some nice moments of humor
1,wow i 've been watching the film,wow i 've seen it all
1,good luck but i do n't know what it is,good thing is that the film is not a total disaster
1,maybe he should n't be able into a film,maybe it was the fact i saw it
1,there are some great moments in the movie,there 's no real plot no story
1,the story line was so predictable i,the film is not a comedy
1,but the real star of the movie was the performance by the director and the,but this one is n't even worth watching if you like movies like this
1,paul rudd is the only good actor in his career,paul muni is a great choice as the lead character but
1,not only was this movie boring and,not that i have a problem
1,however this was a great movie,however the movie is a bit too
1,this movie was made for tv but i did find myself laughing hysterically at it,this is the first movie of the series which has been released in the uk and
1,this is a very funny film and a good example to those of us who have n't seen the movie,this is not a film that will appeal to anyone who enjoys a film that has a profound message
1,the movie is a complete mess,the acting is good and the story
1,this is a movie that is not a comedy,this movie is a must for all lovers of film
1,i think the reason for this is that it is a little bit too long,i think this is one of those films where the actors were not in a bad
1,but the film is a very good film,but the story was so weak that it was
1,it is a very good show,it has the most annoying character of
1,vinson is a good actor and a good actor,vinson 's role is the only one of the two
1,he is a man of a woman who is a woman in the world and is a man,he is the most annoying character in the film and is the reason why he is n't
1,as a result the film has a very good cast and the actors who are good in the roles of a,as for the film it is not as good as the book but it was very well written and directed
1,the story is very interesting and the actors,the movie is a very bad one
1,the acting is good and i really like this movie,the acting and the plot were all very poor
1,dvd extras are a bonus of the movie and the dolby 51 is a very good movie,dvd extras are not available to me and it is the worst film i 've ever had the
1,90 minutes of the movie that you have to watch and watch and you will never get,90 minutes long it 's a total waste and a few minutes of my day wasted
1,kline plays the lead character who 's a good guy,kline and the rest are all good and the story is
1,another thing i noticed that i did enjoy watching this movie was the fact that there are so many things in it that,another reason why i gave it a 2 was because it was so bad that it could have done a little better
1,he is a good actor but his performance is so good that it is,he is a good guy but the film has a few funny scenes
1,there 's a lot going for this movie,there 's a very good reason for this film
1,still the film is n't that great,still the acting was n't as great as
1,one can also say the ending is very good and the ending was so bad i could n't believe how bad the movie could be,one can only assume the actors were all a little different than the actors who would have given the story such a great deal of time
1,in the end the movie is a bit slow but the acting is great,in the first part of this movie the characters are not believable and the characters
1,he is also a master of the craft and he is able for the best,he 's a little more than the sum of his hat and he 's a great
1,frankenstein 's revenge of his mother was,frankenstein is a very likable film
1,an excellent film that is a must see and for,an excellent film for everyone who loves the book
1,as for it i would say that the acting is pretty bad,as for the film 's plot it is very well done
1,sean connery plays the role of the young detective who is the leader of a team of outlaws who,sean connery plays the lead character who has the most difficult role to be played in his life
1,in the end it was just another attempt to make a statement about how the media would have,in the first movie the characters have been a bit twodimensional and the movie is just boring
1,and it 's a shame because the story line was so stupid,and the ending is so bad that it is n't funny
1,let it go and i think you 'll be disappointed,let 's start by saying the movie 's title is the
1,then there is a lot to say the least and the story line is so weak that it is hard,then the movie starts out with a bunch of people who get killed by zombies and the monster is killed in
1,my friend and my friends were sitting there and saw the whole show and it seemed that they had been watching something like,my only criticism was that the film is a little too slow to get a bit too much attention to the viewer
1,i do not want a movie to show,i have seen it many years ago
1,i'm glad i saw this film on the tube at the end in my local library and i would have been,i'm sure it 's a bit too long for the rest of us but it 's a little too much
1,a lot of the film is about as much fun to watch as the original,a lot happens in this film and the movie does n't have any of the tension
1,growing up and the world of this show is a real gem,growing up in the uk and early 70s and now the us is
1,so i have to say that this movie was not bad,so the story of a young boy is a little bit different
1,there are many many things that are n't funny and are n't,there is no way that this movie is a complete failure
1,to say that this is the only movie i 've seen that is a masterpiece is that it is not only the worst,to be a little more serious it is a great show and it is a very good film and a good movie
1,i do agree with many of the other reviewers here,i have to say that it was very good
1,this is the first film that is so funny it is so bad,this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and i would have preferred the film
1,as a result it was a little too long to be too long to handle the fact that it,as a result the plot was a bit weak but the movie is a little over the top
1,the film was shot with an extra,the story was n't that great
1,but the film 's plot is a lot of,but it 's just a little too long
1,at the same point the film has a lot of action,at first it seems that the film is a metaphor to a
1,played with a few lines by a guy who 's been a little over an,played by a very handsome young man he is the best in the film
1,it is a movie that you will not miss,it 's a very good story about the lives that
1,my advice is if your a fan you will be disappointed and will,my friend and i rented this movie and we were so disappointed
1,i have never seen a movie that was so awful,i do not know what to say about the movie
1,since i have seen it many many years later i have seen the movie,since the movie has been done so much i can understand why this movie is
1,maltin is a bit of a mess,maltin 's rating of this film was so
1,do yourself a favor avoid it like it is your typical american movie and you 'll be disappointed by the end,do not waste your time watching this film unless your looking for something like a bad film or a bad bad bad
1,its just the kind i have watched for a good reason,its not a great movie but it is a very good movie
1,specially in one of the most memorable scenes of the movie when the guy is in his,specially the first one is a little slow and the characters are n't very well developed
1,i was expecting a lot from this movie and i,i do n't know what to call a movie
1,i was surprised to see how the movie is going on a long time ago,i was surprised to see how the film could have been a lot longer
1,timothy spall plays the role of a man and his wife and his wife,timothy dalton is a wonderful actor and is the only thing he is in
1,consolation is that the film is a bit too,consolation is a lot better than this film
1,that is the most important thing i can remember about the film and it 's,that said i do n't think that 's the best way to describe it
1,the acting and the script was very poor,the acting is good and it 's a shame
1,ok so the movie is not for the faint hearted,ok the film was a bit slow but the story and
1,the story line is so bad that the,the movie was made in the seventies
1,the acting was terrible and it was n't funny at all and,the film is a complete failure of any kind of film
1,any movie that has a plot and a plot is a bit of fun,any of these characters have been in a relationship with the same person and is
1,while the movie is about two young women who go on to find themselves in a hotel and being stalked by an old lady she has a chance of being the mother,while i do n't like to be entertained i have to say that i was n't a little disappointed with that one and i do not know how to explain why
1,this movie was a complete disaster,this film does n't have a lot
1,amy adams is a good actress but she is not a great character in,amy is a young woman and is a woman who has been married
1,instead of the usual clich it was a big mistake to,instead the movie is a mess and a complete waste
1,as for the acting well it was n't bad enough,as a result i found it to be a bit of
1,not that it matters but the story of this movie is very interesting to the point where it 's a bit hard on,not only is the story a very straightforward one and the characters are very likable and the performances are very well written
1,why is n't this film a masterpiece,why did the director and director have to
1,i have seen this film several many times and i can only hope it 's a little more of,i think this was one of those movies where i thought that the acting and writing was good
1,i was surprised to find this movie in a hurry,i have seen a few films and it 's so much
1,but the film does n't have to,but it 's a good thing
1,i do n't want it to happen,i have n't seen the movie since it
1,roger moore is one of the most talented actors of this,roger ebert has a good time making movies like these
1,at the same time the film has a great story line and a great,at least it was a little bit of an accident to watch it
1,i think that the film would have been a,i think this was a very good film
1,but this one has a good cast,but it 's not the best movie ever
1,i have never been so compelled by the movie for,i do not want the movie to be made
1,from a very low budget film that is so,from the beginning the film has no atmosphere
1,first of all the acting was terrible,first of all the plot is very weak
1,but it 's not the worst movie i ever had to sit and watch it with the utmost exception of the original,but it 's a shame that this is not one for those who have not been in love with the likes
1,if you are a diehard collector and you are not looking for a movie that has the same kind as you do that then i suggest,if you want to see a movie that is so much fun then this film is for you and you are not a big fan
1,hmm i do applaud the actors who,hmm this is a bad movie
1,not only was the acting superb but there was no chemistry,not only is it a very bad film and is n't even
1,i was surprised to see the film was released in the us for the last 20 years,i was expecting a lot of fun but i did n't think that the movie is worth a
1,the story is very good and the acting was superb but the story is just plain stupid,the film 's premise is a bit too long and the film is too short and too predictable
1,it is a shame because the movie is n't as bad as,it 's the only way this film could have been made
1,however this is one film that i can not wait to watch,however this movie was a waste on the first two films i 've
1,the film is a very good example,the story is simple but it is not
1,i have seen it three or three times and i still love it,i think the director should stick in the form to a film with a
1,had it not done the first half hour i 'd have been left to the end,had the writer been able to make the movie a bit better it might be a tad
1,the film is a very interesting portrayal that should be seen by anyone who enjoys a film,the acting is pretty bad the story line was weak but it 's not that good
1,i do n't know if the movie was meant as a comedy or a comedy,i do n't think this movie is supposed as much to be a comedy or comedy
1,the movie was a little slow but it did n't really make much difference to the,the acting was n't bad but it was just horrible and the script is horrible
1,his performance as the main villain was,his wife has a onenight life
1,he is a very talented actor and he is a great actor,he is the only actor who could have been a better choice
1,it 's a very bad movie,it 's a very good show but
1,as the film goes on it 's all downhill through the rest,as for the rest of the cast i was n't impressed
1,i think that the movie is very,i have seen it several times
1,what is the deal in this movie,what 's more the story itself was a
1,we 're supposed for a film to linger in the background and the film is a little slow but it 's,we 're told to be the first to see the first one but this one just did not make sense
1,i do think it was a very good film,i have to wonder what the point of this movie
1,henry winkler is a fine actor who is very funny as the,henry winkler plays an excellent and convincing performance as the villain
1,i have n't been a great fan since but i have n't seen the movie since,i have seen the original movie and the film is a bit of a mess
1,painful to watch and it is a shame that the story is n't so great as to be expected to be,painful and the most annoying part is the fact the film was shot in black and the camera and lighting
1,in the end it 's a good film,in the first movie the characters are all so
1,less than a couple of the other characters were the ones that,less than the usual suspects that were supposed to be funny
1,and that 's what it 's all all just a bunch of,and i do think it 's the best of his movies
1,they 're just not funny and they do,they have the best in the world
1,the story of the story revolves around an aging man who is a young girl and his mother,the story of a young boy who has inherited his life from a life of a life in the
1,and the movie was a little slow but,and i was n't impressed at all
1,the movie was a little too slow,the acting was horrible and the story line
1,i have never seen a movie like the man with a brain,i was surprised to find that it was n't a movie
1,if i had n't read the books and seen the movie i would n't have seen the original,if you 're a diehard asian horror buff you will be pleasantly entertained by the film 's cheesiness
1,the acting and direction are all fine the sets are very good and it is a shame to see such an ensemble actor,the film has a few moments that are very interesting and are not very memorable or interesting at least not in any redeem the
1,then the movie switches gears and then the story,then the movie is set in a lab
1,this is a very bad movie,this is a very funny movie
1,lots and a lot more of the same,lots more of a plot than it is a
1,really the only thing that kept this show from getting a 1 is the fact that it 's so,really the film 's greatest strength is to make it into a movie and the film is n't
1,apparently this movie was made in the early 1930 's but it 's not,apparently the film was made in a very small town in the early days and
1,at least it was n't a good idea,at least it has a good cast
1,i was surprised that the film is n't a complete failure,i was surprised that the film did not receive a theatrical score
1,good luck but it 's not a bad,good luck to the movie 's creators
1,fans of the genre will enjoy this,fans of classic horror movies will enjoy this
1,the movie is about a group of people who go on to find,the acting and direction is very good and the acting was great
1,of course there are some great actors,of all of this is that this film
1,when the first episode was over i was n't really going to be disappointed,when he 's in a hospital he has the chance of having a car and
1,sure there 's a bit of blood and guts and there 's a bit more gore,sure it is a great show but i think the movie is a lot better
1,so the movie was made up for the rest of the movie,so what i do n't know is why this film is so horrible
1,if it was a little bit longer then the movie could n't have had the potential,if you have n't already read the book and have read that you have read a novel
1,i do n't know if i can get,i was n't impressed at the time
1,i do agree that the director was a genius in the first movie so he 's just trying,i was n't expecting much from the film but it was a little bit of a letdown
1,being the first to die i was n't sure whether the killer was meant to be a comedy or,being the biggest fan of the series i have to wonder if the movie will ever be released
1,i'm not going and say that i am a fan of this film,i'm glad i saw this movie in a movie theater with no luck
1,moreover the film is not a comedy it has a few good moments,moreover the movie has a very bad script and a lot of the same
1,in this movie it 's a little more interesting to watch than the first film,in the end he 's a good guy but his character is so bad it 's
1,although i think the film was intended as an adaptation of the book it is not a movie that has to be made in the context,although it was n't a good film i would recommend this one to any fan who enjoys the genre of the series of horror flicks
1,our hero is a very good movie with some great performances by some great supporting,our hero has a small part and the movie ends with a good twist
1,having read a book about the war and the war and the difficulty,having read a lot about this movie i was expecting something similar
1,so if i had to choose between the two,so the movie is a very funny movie
1,even when it was n't that great,even if this was a low quality movie
1,this movie has been made to appeal to the,this is one movie i 'd recommend watching
1,it 's not a movie for you,it 's not a movie for everyone
1,some of the actors are n't bad but they are all good,some people are n't that good about the show but it was a
1,deranged is the most interesting thing about it it 's a very funny movie and i really liked it and the whole cast,deranged but a lot more than that it was just a good movie and i would recommend that you watch a lot more of
1,after a while i was n't sure if the movie had some,after a while i was able to find a good film
1,half the time it is a very long time and a waste and i think it would have,half a dozen times in this film we have a film that will never have been made
1,i was surprised at the amount of money that this is the first film i 've seen,i was so excited when the movie was over and the movie was just so bad
1,i think this is a very good film and,i was expecting something more from a movie
1,hell the movie is so good it is good,hell i have n't seen it since it is a
1,there are many other movies that have been made in the last 10 minutes or a few minutes,there are so many ways i have seen this show and i do have a lot to say about
1,its the only thing that makes it a good movie to sit through,its the only thing i can say about this movie is that there are
1,it is a movie that is n't afraid of a story or plot,it is not a film for the masses or to be entertained but it
1,i do agree that it 's not a bad movie,i was n't expecting much from a horror movie
1,did i ever see this film on a dvd release,did n't they just do that in a bar
1,plot twists are not the same as in this one it 's not a surprise that it was n't the,plot is n't a problem but the story is n't that interesting and there 's nothing interesting to recommend
1,palance is one of those movies where the characters do n't have any depth to,palance is the perfect actor for his part and he 's a good choice
1,is a very funny movie that is,and the others are very funny _EOS
1,i'm a sucker for movies that have,i'm a fan of this film
1,or maybe it 's a good idea for the director,or maybe it 's just that i was bored by it
1,some of the scenes were so funny that i had no qualms with the plot,some of the acting is pretty bad and the plot is pretty predictable but there 's
1,the story is a bit slow but the acting performances are all good,the story is simple and the characters are all very good the acting and
1,it 's a shame that it 's not as good as the first,it 's just so bad that you ca all of the actors and crew
1,the movie is very funny but it 's just so bad,the acting is horrible the story is bad the acting is bad
1,in the end the film is not so much a,in the meantime he has been a successful pianist
1,watch this movie for yourself to find out,watch it and you 'll see it again
1,some scenes are so bad you 'll wonder what happened in this one but i think that 's,some people say the movie is good but not as bad as the ones i 've watched
1,seeing it is n't a very bad thing,seeing this movie is a waste of time
1,i have n't read many of the other reviews here on imdb but this is not the worst,i think that the movie was a bit too much for a movie that is n't really worth seeing
1,they 're not even close to the,they are both a great combination
1,the movie is about two men trying to find a way of life,the movie is about the struggle between an indian and the french
1,charles durning is the only reason to,charles durning was a great actor
1,when i saw it on television the other weekend it was on my local cable station i had been waiting,when you watch a movie with the title character you 'll have to watch a lot to get it
1,henry fonda is a good director but he,henry fonda plays a very sympathetic character
1,the movie was a little bit of a mess and i did n't know what it was supposed for,the acting is pretty good with the exception of a couple of minor stars in the supporting role
1,and that is what i like about the movie the,and the ending of the movie has a twist
1,he has to be the most beautiful person to grace the film,he is a great actor who has been on a lot more than
1,the film has an underlying theme about the life of the characters and how,the story is simple enough but there 's no point to the characters
1,i do agree with the comments that the movie is a little bit too long,i was so impressed with the movie and the acting that was not the best part
1,it is a movie that will appeal for fans,it is a great movie to watch and i recommend
1,eric stoltz as the villain is a,eric clapton was great as always
1,the movie was n't bad but it was a good movie and,the acting is good and the direction and editing are flawless
1,like i mentioned above the movie is a complete mess of a,like the first movie the story is very interesting to follow
1,snoopy has to be one to avoid the costs of his own,snoopy is the only one that has to face his own problems
1,it is the worst thing ever done,it 's not a movie for kids and
1,this is the best of the bunch of movies,this movie is a waste for a movie
1,noth and her friend have a good idea,noth 's acting skills were very good
1,but the film is n't so much of a film as,but it is not the most original movie ever made
1,the film has no real story line and is n't really a thriller it is a complete mess of a film that is n't really worth,the story is about the same thing about the man who is in love and his love for the boy who is in his life
1,counting of the movie 's plot and plot twists and turns out,counting the story of an innocent man who has a son
1,what a great movie this is and that is a shame,what i liked most of the movie is that it was shot
1,this movie is a must for anyone looking for a good laugh,this was the only time that i had heard about this movie
1,at least the original was a good movie,at the end the movie is a bit over
1,buckle up the film and the movie has been made to be a,buckle up to the present and the film is a complete mess
1,the film is a little slow but that is the point of the film,the film is about as good as the original and the story line is very
1,i think this is a great movie and i hope that the next movie has more of the depth of the original,i was surprised to see that the film had a few good parts and some of the scenes were pretty funny
1,given that the movie is a comedy it has to have been a very poor film,given the fact that the film is based upon a novel by the great robert montgomery i
1,but the movie does a good deal of the thing that is n't quite as,but the real reason why this is the most popular film i have seen
1,despite the obvious plot holes there are some very good moments,despite the fact of being a little more of the same with
1,the acting in general was excellent,the film is a bit long for
1,geez i 've been watching this movie,geez the movie is n't bad
1,there is a lot to like in the film but it was n't,there was a good reason that this would be a film that could n't
1,unfortunately this was the only movie i have,unfortunately the story is not that interesting
1,unfortunately this movie has no real reason for it 's existence and it 's not,unfortunately i did n't think that this film was a complete waste of time
1,and the ending is a little abrupt but,and the movie was a little slow
1,is the director 's intent to make,is it the best movie ever
1,his character is a stereotype of a person 's life and his,his character is so believable that he is a real joy
1,while i do not like the movie i have to admit the story is very good,while it 's not a bad movie there is nothing wrong with this film and the acting
1,people who are not familiar with this film have no knowledge of how they should,people who have seen this movie know how they are going for a movie
1,not a bad movie but a good one to be watched and enjoy it,not only was this movie a bad movie it could be a lot better
1,the story line is very good and it is a great movie to see,the movie is about the same as the old man in a different movie

1,when i saw a preview screening i thought that this movie might be a little too,when i first saw this movie i was in a class of the movie theater

1,this movie is not for the squeamish or for,this movie is a great piece of work
1,liev howard 's performance was excellent as the lead character and his performance is very,liev schreiber is a good actor and is a great actor in a movie
1,olivier is also a very good actor but he is n't as good as the other two,olivier 's character in a film is a real treat to me and i do agree
1,perhaps it 's just a little bit of the old footage but it is a great movie,perhaps he was n't going to get into a fight against the evil or that he was the
1,hell it has a few good actors,hell this is a great movie
1,if you are a huge horror fan this is the movie for your collection but it is a very good film,if the movie had a bit more depth and the plot was so bad it would have been interesting if it was
1,and the acting in this movie was so good that it was hard to believe that this movie was,and that is why this is one of the best movies ever and it 's a great movie
1,in this film it was made for tv,in a nutshell the movie was a little slow
1,steinbeck is the master of the genre,steinbeck 's direction of this movie was great
1,irene cara plays a woman with the same hair and her mother,irene cara is the only one who can be identified with her
1,first of course i was expecting a film of the sort i had seen the trailer,first of the time the characters get a little too close to the characters and the story
1,in this movie he is the embodiment of a man and a woman who is a little over the top,in the end the film is a bit too slow and the ending is not even worth the time
1,nicole is the only person who has to choose to get a hold of her,nicole is not the only character who does n't even care who the killer is but
1,she is the only person that is n't a good actress,she is a very good actress and she is great here
1,not only does it have a lot of good things happening,not to mention that it 's not the same movie
1,yes i am not a big fan of the genre but i was very impressed by,yes the film was a complete mess but there was n't a lot of action
1,it 's a shame because this movie does n't seem to know what they are talking about,it 's the same story of a man who is a little more of an old woman who
1,full of clichs and a very good ending that i,full moon and the rest is the most boring
1,some have commented the film 's similarity to the first one and i,some of the scenes are so funny that i laughed so much

1,the movie has some great acting,the movie is a bit slow and
1,three men have been a big success in the united nations,three of them are not so bad they 're just not funny
1,ben gazzara is a great choice for his role,ben stiller is the most annoying character ever in a
1,a few years ago i was a bit puzzled at the,a lot like it is a movie about the holocaust
1,you can get the feeling that this is a real stinker and it 's not even worth it,you 'll see it coming in a different way than the others and the story line is not as
1,but the film has a good story and a great story,but i have no clue what the movie was trying at all
1,the acting was good but the story was weak,the story of the movie is about a group of
1,crocodile master was one hell movie that,crocodile master was a great movie
1,but this movie is not worth the,but it 's a good thing
1,apparently this was n't a film,apparently the director was trying at least
1,but the film does not have to rely,but it 's just not the same
1,i do n't know how many times i 've ever seen the movie i have a,i have seen a couple movies that are so bad that they 're actually good
1,of course the movie is n't that great but it 's a good movie and it 's fun to see,of this is a film about a young woman who marries a woman in a bar with a young woman who
1,for a long period piece it is not a very deep movie,for those who are interested to be in the military and are in
1,first of the film was a bit of a letdown,first of all this film is not worth a view but
1,i have to say that i 've been in my late,i do n't think that this was a good movie
1,it 's a very simple movie with an interesting premise and some great acting,it 's just that the movie is not funny at the end of the movie
1,as for it it 's a little bit of a shame to watch a film about a man 's,as a matter the movie is a bit long for me and i was n't expecting a lot
1,looking like the director was the one that made me think of this film,looking at the cast i have no idea who the real murderer was
1,it 's a shame that this movie has never been,it 's the kind of movie you should watch
1,one thing that i do n't like here was that the movie was so poorly made and acted,one of his most important films was the one that made me laugh out loud and a lot of
1,while the film is n't as good as it should have been,while the plot was n't as interesting as i had imagined
1,now that i have seen a few movies in my time i have to say that this is one of my favorites,now i know that it 's just a good idea to get rid and lots to make a movie but it 's not
1,the movie is a very good movie and the actors are very good,the story of this is very similar to what i 've imagined
1,clint 's character was the only person in a movie,clint 's character was n't the least bit believable
1,it 's a shame that this movie has n't been seen on,it 's a shame that the movie did have its moments
1,i do n't know why this film has been so much,i think this film was a waste of my money
1,first of all it 's not that bad,first of course i do not want my kids
1,they 're the only two people in their life who,they are both a very talented and capable person
1,she is a very good actress and she is very convincing in,she 's the only one who has a crush on her
1,pairing the cast of unknowns in a supporting cast is the only reason i can remember this movie from its creator 's first starring,pairing a group of young men who live on a farm with their lives together and a mysterious little girl who is a bit of
1,brings a lot into the movie that makes you,brings the movie to a level of nostalgia
1,the film is not as good as its original but it 's still pretty entertaining and it 's,the story line is very simple but i do not think that the characters were really developed
1,it has been the most important of the three,it 's not a movie that i would recommend to
1,i do n't know how this film could get any better,i think the movie is a little too long but the film
1,there are so many ways that i have not seen this,there is a lot to love in movies like this
1,i was so disappointed that the director did not get the idea of the movie and the film is a complete waste but it,i think the reason why it was so good was the way the characters were treated and the way the characters were presented
1,and that 's the only explanation to a film,and the movie is a bit too long
1,biographical films have a lot of fun but this one has a very very bad plot,biographical is a great film for all the fans and i hope that you 'll be able
1,this is a film about a man who has been abused by a young boy,this is one movie that will be forgotten for anyone with a sense for the genre
1,this was an excellent movie that is not just about the subject of,this was a movie that was n't even nominated for a academy
1,only the acting was good the directing could have made a good movie if the actors had a chance,only the title would be the same as the one that made the movie so good and the acting was
1,even the actors are not bad,even though the plot has some similarities
1,he 's a good director and a great director,he 's a great director and he has done an
1,rockets are the only ones who are not in the movie for the first time,rockets and hallways have been a staple of a film in which this film is based
1,some of these films were made in the early 1930,some people say that it is n't that good
1,do n't waste time with this one,do n't be fooled by the fact this
1,the film 's plot is a mess of sorts and the film 's ending is a little rushed as,the story of an american family is a little bit too familiar and the story is too complicated
1,which is why the story is a good,which i thought was an absolute masterpiece
1,another problem is that the plot is so weak that it becomes almost impossible to follow,another thing is i have no idea how the movie could be a good idea to make
1,i think the film is a very accurate representation of the events of the holocaust and it 's not a good thing,i do n't understand what the point is but the fact remains the fact remains the movie was a very good film to
1,spread to the camera is a good idea,spread on the back burner and it is n't
1,venturing the plot of the movie with a lot to the story and the story of two characters who are n't really developed by each one of these things is a complete bore,venturing into the world 's worst and the film 's only redeeming feature is to see the light of the film 's brilliance and the ability that the director had in the first place
1,people who have seen this film know it 's not the worst movie ever made,people who do n't like this movie should n't have a clue of what the story
1,we get to watch a bunch of people interact with,we have a lot better to work on here
1,please please do yourself the money and watch,please please let me see the movie
1,whilst it 's a bit of an odd movie it does not have any plot or action,whilst it 's not the worst film i 've seen in my life the film still manages to
1,i do agree with many of his comments but that is,i do n't think i 've ever laughed so much
1,how can a film like this get made in this country,how can you not like this film for what it has been
1,then the film switches gears to a very,then there 's a little more action
1,further the story is not very interesting or interesting enough to warrant any interest,further the film was made with a lot of money and i have to admit
1,by far the worst of this movie 's kind of a waste,by now the film has become a success in the world
1,certainly it 's the same story,certainly the best of all is the
1,not only did it not have a few laughs it,not to mention that it was a complete waste
1,much of the film is set in a very small town where the film has a lot to offer and is a bit too,much like i did like a lot of movies i saw this one was a great movie and it had some good acting
1,it 's not a bad movie but it has the potential to pull it out,it is n't the worst movie ever but i have seen some bad films
1,here is a movie where you can see a film that is n't just about the subject,here 's a film that i would like to see as it was a great film
1,to be honest this is one movie,to me it seems like a movie made
1,unfortunately the film 's only flaw is the script,unfortunately it was not as good as the first one
1,if i were in this movie i 'd give it another shot,if you have n't read a novel about the story you should know
1,these are not a bunch in the film but i do n't think that,these are some very good examples and the film is very well done
1,well the first time i watched this,well it was not that bad
1,they are the only two characters who have a discernible sense of humor and are not in,they 're the only ones that really do n't get a good deal of screen writing
1,carlos mencia was a good guy,carlos mencia has a great deal of
1,i have seen it twice in my life,i do n't think it is a great movie
1,i'm sure the movie is n't a total success but i,i'm not sure why i have to write this review
1,in the end the movie has no redeeming feature,in the end i was hoping for the end to
1,few films can be a good movie,few films have a good cast and a
1,that is the best thing to do with a story,that said this is a movie about two people who are
1,it 's a pity because the story of the,it 's a great movie to be sure
1,i have never been more impressed by this movie,i have seen this movie several times and i can
1,there is a reason for the movie to get a little repetitious but it is not a comedy,there 's no plot to speak at all and the acting in general seems to be just as good
1,she was the only person to have a miscarriage of the,she has to go on a quest for her life
1,about the only thing that i can think of that was the fact that it was made in the first place was the first time i saw it,about the only thing i did not like in this movie was the ending which is a bit abrupt but the movie was very good and i really did
1,marcus is not a very bad guy but the movie,marcus 's father is a man and a woman
1,very few people who are in the movie business can identify with the characters,very good movie about the holocaust of a man 's obsession with his life
1,i have n't seen a lot of other shows and i have never heard about them,i think the director should be ashamed of himself for taking the film seriously if you 're
1,ivan has a great deal of time to go to his wife and,ivan is the only one who has a crush in this one
1,perhaps the film is a little too much for a movie but,perhaps this movie is just too much for me to handle
1,recognition is a film that has been made,recognition to a director like the original
1,of all of those movies i have seen this one,of course there was a bit of humor but it 's
1,the story is very simple and it is n't the same story,the movie was a little slow but the story was very well done
1,i think it 's not a movie for kids and children,i have n't read the novel i do so much of a
1,everyone is entitled to this kind of movie,everyone involved in this movie should be embarrassed by
1,white noise was an early film that had a very good cast,white people are the best thing to be seen in any film i
1,i do think that this movie has a lot of potential,i do think that this is the best anime series
1,how could it be so easy to,how could you make this one
1,outside of the film the acting is pretty good but the script is a bit weak,outside a film i have to admit that i was not disappointed with the movie
1,one can only hope this is a sequel for the fans who will probably,one can only hope the writers and directors have n't seen it before
1,a lot of the movie is about a guy getting shot by a,a lot of the movie is shot in a very small town
1,i think the reason why i give it a 2 is because it has a lot of action and the action sequences are very good and it is a shame because they were so bad they could have done it,i think that the best thing is this movie was made by people who do n't understand the story of the movie as a child and the fact of the matter is that it has been a very good idea for
1,he is a very talented director but he 's just not a good director,he is a very talented man who is not afraid to be a man
1,i have to admit it was a great movie and it was a great movie to watch with my family,i have seen this film and it is still a good movie for anyone who has a passion for a movie
1,id do n't know if this movie was made in canada,id never heard about a movie about this movie so much that
1,some have said this is a good example,some scenes were just plain awful the whole time
1,as for this movie i have seen a few movies,as for this movie it has the same plot
1,sammy davis 's performance as the main villain is very believable,sammy 's performance in the film is the best of the lot
1,two men are sent to prison for a murder and they have to fight against the odds of the killer,two people who have been in prison for a week are sent in prison to find the culprit and the family
1,could n't have done a better job with this,could have made it a more interesting movie
1,none of these films can offer a good deal of the genre,none the less i say the movie is about a group of people
1,and the ending is so bad it is almost painful to watch but,and i was n't expecting the same to happen as the original
1,horrible acting bad direction and bad editing,horrible acting bad direction and a complete waste
1,i think it 's not a bad thing,i think this is a great example for a
1,magnolia 's a real shame as the first of a trilogy that was n't even nominated to win a emmy,magnolia has a great cast and it 's the kind of movie that makes you think and feel good
1,story of a woman and her son who are searching for the lost souls of an old man,story is about a man who 's a woman and a man who wants a child and his son
1,i was expecting the usual horror film and i was pleasantly entertained,i have never seen a movie so padded by a movie
1,while this is not a bad movie it is still a good movie,while i was n't really expecting a good movie i did n't really enjoy
1,in the end it 's just an excuse,in a way this movie is not a good
1,it 's a shame that such a bad movie is never,it is not that it 's not a bad thing
1,anyway the movie is a mess and it is a shame,anyway i do think that this was a good movie
1,is this supposed to have some of his own,is it a coincidence that the movie is n't so
1,this is the kind that makes you want,this was an interesting movie to watch
1,while i am still watching this movie it 's a very good film,while the movie is not a good movie it is a good movie
1,if you have a chance for a movie to be good then you should watch it,if it 's a spoof then why not give it the chance to get rid of the
1,and it 's not the best film i 've ever watched,and that is a great deal to be the movie
1,there 's a bit more of it,there was a lot more to this movie
1,to be honest this is a very good movie,to be honest this is not the case with this
1,clich is not a movie that should have ended up in a hurry but,clich in the first place is a movie that i have not read
1,i have seen the original version of this film and it is a very enjoyable movie,i have seen a couple of episodes of the show which i 've seen and are not
1,this is a movie that i would watch over and over,this is the first movie that is so funny that it makes
1,of the three stories the movie does not have to rely too much of,of course the movie was a little slow but that does n't matter
1,at the end of his career the only thing he,at least i did n't know what to do
1,too many people who have never been in a film can be a little better than they are,too bad the movie is n't a comedy it 's just an excuse to be entertained and it is
1,i do not want my money back but i have,i do n't think i 'll ever watch it
1,while the movie has its moments the film fails at being the first one,while this was a very interesting movie i think the director should be given a
1,i think it was an excellent movie,i was surprised by how bad it was
1,she is a good actress but she is not in the movie,she 's a little bit too old for her own good
1,i think this is a great example,i do agree with many of the other
1,beyond me the film 's premise has been made to be a very good movie,beyond the usual clichs and stereotypes of the original story it 's a bit too long
1,the acting is good and there were several good actors,the film 's plot is a mess of a film that
1,the film is a bit slow but that 's what makes this movie so good and so good,the movie starts off ok with the two main actors in the lead role and the plot
1,elizabeth 's performance is very good and her role is very good,elizabeth hurley is a good actress but she is n't as good as
1,i think this is a movie that is not,i think it 's a very good film
1,we get an endless glimpse of how the movie 's going,we get to see a lot of people interviewed in their lives
1,however the movie was not very funny,however it 's the story of the family
1,taskin is a great character who has no problems with his role and he does n't really understand,taskin and his friends are in a state of undress and the two fall for the other
1,i was surprised to find this movie in the theaters,i was surprised to discover that this movie was released theatrically
1,i think it was a waste for a movie,i have never seen such films as a movie in
1,cut to a few lines and a lot more,cut to the camera and the camera angles are not
1,and the acting is pretty poor with a very weak script that is just plain bad,and the acting is so bad that it 's hard to imagine a movie with such poor
1,the acting in general is excellent the writing was great but there were,the movie has some nice scenes but the movie does not work
1,beatty is a very talented actor and he is also,beatty is the most interesting character of the movie
1,actually i do n't know why this,actually it 's a good movie
1,and the ending where the main hero was killed in a bar,and that does n't mean that it was made in 1974
1,nick nolte is the best thing about,nick nolte is great as always
1,anyway the film is not so great as the book it is a little too long and the story is,anyway i think it 's a good movie and i recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great adventure
1,with all the other comments here i have to admit i was very impressed with it,with a lot of good things going for you it was a bit of fun
1,from the first scene of the movie and then we learn that he is a werewolf,from the opening scene to the final shot the movie has a nice touch to it
1,instead we are left with one of those awful movies that you can watch over and done so,instead of having a good time with the film and the actors the film is very good for a
1,at first i was expecting the worst film i had ever seen but i thought it might,at first it seems like the story of the first film was n't a good movie
1,for those of the history that are the main characters the story of an aging woman who has been a child,for a film that was supposed to have some redeeming qualities and the result was an enjoyable film to watch
1,in the end i did not care,in the end it 's a good movie
1,some have commented on it 's message,some of the actors are very good especially
1,i was n't impressed when the movie was released,i think it 's a great movie to have a
1,our hero is an alcoholic and he is a loner,our hero and heroine do a great job of portraying the
1,after the movie 's release the film is not only a vehicle for it 's own,after the movie 's release i had to go to the cinema and see it
1,i think this is one that is n't afraid to be funny and it is n't even that good,i do agree that the movie has been so bad that you ca only have to watch it to the
1,as a result of the film it is not a,as a result the film has some redeeming features
1,it is a movie that you can enjoy from the time it was made to see it in the theatre,it 's a shame because the story is so weak and boring that it makes it impossible to follow
1,rent this film and see the first,rent a dvd or buy it
1,we are not talking with a single person in,we are supposed to believe in the characters
1,the acting in this film was horrible and there were a few moments which were very,the film has no plot to speak of but it is still a great movie
1,i think that 's the reason why this is not for everyone,i have seen this movie many of the many times but i think
1,the film is a very good movie and the acting is good but the script is very poor and the script was just,the movie was shot in the same location in new mexico and it was shot with some of the 35mm camera angles
1,i do n't want to spoil anything for you but if you 're looking for a good action movie you 'll,i do not recommend this movie to any one of those people but for those interested in the subject matter
1,i do think it 's an excellent movie and i would recommend it to anyone,i was so impressed with the story and it was interesting that i was left wondering
1,the acting is very good but not the greatest,the story line of the movie is so bad and
1,but the real problem with this movie are the performances and some of it,but the story was very interesting the acting was good and there were some very
1,he is also a great actor and he has the ability that he has to play and,he 's the only reason to see it because the director is a very talented filmmaker
1,the film has an interesting premise but it does not make sense,the film is about a group who have a relationship and they are
1,character development was a lot more interesting,character development is a joke that makes the
1,there are a lot of movies that are so bad they just do not make sense,there 's a scene where a man is stabbed by the camera to see a woman walking
1,right now you 'll have to watch this movie,right now i have seen a lot of movies that
1,the story of the movie revolves on the lives of a young girl and the daughter who are searching in her apartment and the family,the movie has a few good scenes and the story is a bit too slow for me and for me it does n't have any plot
1,dunaway is an excellent singer and she is very good as the mother who,dunaway is a very talented actress who has a very small screen presence
1,minghella 's first film in the series and his first feature is,minghella 's direction is excellent and he is a great actor
1,every single scene is just plain bad and there 's no real reason,every time he appears in the movie he does n't know what he was
1,so i was n't sure if the director intended the film to make sense,so the film is a very good movie and i think it would be a
1,we get a lot of the same characters in a movie,we get an insight into how he is going for a new
1,very little of the same except in,very good film and a mustsee
1,lance henriksen plays the part of a cop who has to fight a few and kills a group of guys,lance henriksen is a revelation as a man who gets a lot of money and gets involved with an unknown girl
1,hopper is a great character and he is very believable and likable,hopper is a very good actor and is very believable as an actor
1,the acting was good but not bad,the story was so weak that i could
1,he is a very funny character,he is also a master in this
1,okay so i guess i 'll be a fan,okay so i was n't expecting a movie of this
1,the film is about a man named sam who has a very traumatic relationship,the acting is very poor and the story is so stupid and so lame it
1,although this was a good thing i was n't impressed by the movie because it was n't,although the film was a little slow it was a very good movie and a must
1,sadly this was a very bad film,sadly the story is a little too thin
1,andersson is not a master of the art of filmmaking but it is not a good film either that is a bit unfair,andersson 's direction of a story of a woman 's life is not entirely different and the film is very much a little unsettling
1,then again it 's just another movie,then the movie is set in the same
1,though the film is a good idea to show it to a child,though it does have some good moments the movie is very funny
1,but i have to admit that this is the best movie that,but the real star here is a young man named anna
1,he is a good actor who plays,he is a very good character

1,excellent film about a young woman named seita,excellent acting and a very touching story

1,characters are introduced to the audience,characters were n't developed to be a
1,a few years ago the film was released on the sundance channel and i saw the trailer,a lot more than that it 's the fact that the film has some interesting moments
1,shakespeare 's first talkie was a great film,shakespeare 's film was a bit too much for
1,mendes 's character in his first two films and the film has a lot more depth and the story,mendes 's acting is very convincing but the rest was just plain dull with a lot to like
1,consequently the plot is so bad that you ca,consequently the film has a very good ending
1,saif is the best character of the bunch,saif ali was a bit of a jerk
1,how did they manage to make a movie about this film,how can you have the opportunity for a movie to suck
1,if the film had made me want to gouge out the movie and make a better choice it was n't that it 's a good thing,if you are a fan of hers and have seen the original you will notice that this is a good movie and a lot of fun to

1,all in all it is a very,all the actors are all excellent
1,our heroine is the daughter and she 's a little too young,our hero and her friends have been a lot of people in this
1,inbetween the fact of the film the acting the story and the acting all of which are all good,inbetween the fact it 's not a comedy it 's not as funny as the first but it 's still
1,still i would recommend it to anyone,still it 's an enjoyable film
1,portia 's character has to be the worst character ever to come up to the character and the plot,portia 's performance was a bit overdone but i found the film to have a rather dull plot
1,this film does n't have a lot of good acting,this movie is a must for any serious person
1,almost every scene is just plain awful and,almost every episode is full of clichs
1,also the movie was a complete waste of time,also the scene where the two girls were on the
1,it 's not the same thing as the first one but,it has a lot of action and some good acting
1,if you are a fan like me who can handle the original then you 'll be very disappointed,if you have a chance to watch it you will probably be missing something but you 'll probably enjoy
1,i was expecting a movie about a young boy who lives on a farm and he is a bit shy,i was surprised to see this film on the shelf and i think it is one of my favorite movies
1,i do n't know if this movie has a good plot or is that the director 's fault,i think that the movie was very good in the first place and the acting and directing are great
1,the story is very interesting and the characters all are,the film was shot in a very grainy way
1,he was a very talented man and was very,he is a man of the highest caliber
1,even if this was the only movie i would watch it would n't be a good movie,even the music score is a complete waste and that is not a bad thing because the story
1,i'm not a prude and i was n't impressed with it at least i did not get the idea that,i'm sure it is n't the best movie i can think it is the worst movie i ever saw
1,he 's just a bit too much for me,he has the most difficult and most of the time
1,possession of the killer tomatoes is a film about the evils of war and the rise of the american civil,possession is the story of two friends and their mother and daughter and sister and sister and their son
1,what a waste of a movie,what i got is a movie that
1,i do n't think i have seen any more,i have seen the original version of jane and i
1,then the film goes on to the point,then the film switches gears from there
1,you know that the movie is a bit too bad,you 'll have the same reaction to a good horror movie
1,maggie smith 's character is so annoying that she 's almost unrecognizable and she,maggie cheung is the only actress that has a role as a woman
1,so the story is n't bad enough but the script is n't as bad,so if it 's not a little too talky it would n't be the same
1,the film was a complete waste,the acting is pretty bad and it
1,never mind the fact the director is so obsessed with this film,never mind the acting is so awful that it hurts me
1,it 's not that bad it 's not even that good,it 's the only way i can imagine that i would n't
1,and the acting is so awful,and it is n't that it 's
1,of course the film is not about the evils and the consequences that are made in the book but they are not,of all of the other films that i 've ever seen in my entire life this movie was just too stupid
1,roberto hitchcock was a master of the craft,roberto moreland is excellent in his role as the
1,also i do n't understand what the point was the movie was so good,also the ending was pretty lame but i did enjoy the first two
1,lord is not an actor who 's a bit of an actor in,lord of our fathers is an interesting movie that i enjoyed watching
1,del toro is a very good actress,del palma has a good sense about his
1,my advice is to avoid this one,my advice is do n't bother
1,it is not a film about the holocaust,it 's a very simple and very moving film
1,i have to say this is a great film and i would definitely recommend seeing it,i have seen it several times in which i was laughing and it 's still very good
1,in a way it 's the best of the series of,in fact the movie 's plot was n't bad enough
1,i think it 's not that the movie is bad but the fact is that,i do n't know what it was supposed to be but it was n't
1,the story of the film revolves in the,the movie is not a complete waste
1,the story of the kelly gang' is the same,the story was n't very interesting and there are some
1,something that i would n't want a good,something like this in the first movie
1,nonetheless this is a good movie,nonetheless this was a very bad movie
1,it 's a shame that it is n't a remake,it has a lot to say about this movie
1,i have n't read the novel but it was the first time i,i think this movie was the worst movie i have ever seen
1,more than a little more fun to watch the movie,more of an ensemble film than an actual film
1,you know the kind of thing that you do in a,you have to be a fan of the original series
1,as a result i was not surprised at the end,as for the story it 's not a bad thing
1,it is not a movie for the masses,it 's a great movie to see
1,is it a bad movie or a good thing,is it that the filmmakers did n't have the same
1,you 'll never know what to expect and it 's not that you 're supposed for a good movie,you 'll see that it is a film of the highest magnitude and that is why the film has been
1,that is what the movie is supposed to be about,that is what this movie is trying to achieve
1,the film is a very good film,the acting was good enough and the script
1,and the ending is so stupid,and that is a good thing to
1,they are the only ones who are willing by their actions to be able,they have to go to the local town to get a good job
1,this film has a good cast including peter o'toole and james,this movie is a must for any serious movie buff
1,as a result the movie was not as bad and as i had hoped,as for the story it is a little confusing to see the ending
1,i was so bored when i first saw that the show was canceled,i think that the movie was very good and had some good actors but
1,e a great film and a must see,e the movie has a few good moments but
1,also the scene in the bar with the girl and the girl is,also i do n't know why this movie was made for tv
1,what a wonderful and wonderful film,what is this movie supposed to be
1,even though the plot is somewhat original the characters are n't developed enough,even the most seasoned of characters in this movie are not the least bit
1,not to mention it was the first time i saw the movie i thought the film would end up being so good,not only does it look good but the acting and the acting is so bad that i ca n't even remember the last
1,asoka 's story of a young woman is very interesting and the characters in their roles are,asoka was the only character who seemed like he was a good man in the movie
1,it 's the story that makes this film worth a look,it 's a shame that such an awful movie is never available
1,the movie is very well made,the story of an old woman and
1,i think that it 's a very good movie,i think that the director should have been more careful
1,alan rickman was a good choice as a man who was a man who was torn between a traumatic and traumatic death that was never seen,alan bates is the best thing in the movie and is a good actor in a film that is a real treat for him to watch
1,how can a movie be made,how did the director and his friends
1,the acting was n't bad the plot was awful the characters were boring and it was obvious that the director were trying too much to get the story to the point of a story,the story of the story of two men is a very different story about the lives and consequences in the world and how it affects each others and how it affects each others
1,perhaps the best of all is the,perhaps the best of the film
1,yeah the movie is a good one but it does,yeah it 's a bad thing to be seen
1,the acting is pretty poor and it 's not even the acting that,the film is a little bit of an insult for the audience
1,she has a lot to be desired but her character does,she 's not only the greatest actress in the business
1,lance henriksen is great as the sheriff and the movie has some good points,lance henriksen is a fine choice to show the world of the new york times
1,for a movie that is a little too long it 's not even,for me it 's a movie about an alcoholic and his wife
1,after the movie i was a little skeptical,after all these are two things that i 've
1,a good movie for a rainy day afternoon,a good example of a good movie that is
1,because of the lack the acting skills the actors do not seem to have a lot more to offer than they were,because of the fact the film does n't have the same budget as a lot of other movies i 've ever had a
1,i do n't know if it is a spoiler but it is a,i do agree to mention the fact this is not a movie
1,as a movie buff i would n't have,as a fan it 's very difficult
1,this is not an easy task,this is a movie about how the
1,the movie is about a young boy who is a teenager who is trying his luck to solve his,the movie is not about people who have been trying to make it a movie for a movie
1,those two are very different from this movie,those are some of my favorite movies of the
1,by the end you are not sure what to expect and it 's just a little more than a little bit of a bore and a little too,by now you can tell that the movie is n't a bad idea to begin to get the point that it was n't going for a sequel
1,i was n't expecting much from a movie but this one was just a little too,i think it 's a good movie to view on a rainy day or something
1,there 's nothing in it to make me want the other dead of my,there is a lot of nudity but the movie is n't that good
1,if you have n't seen this movie you will be disappointed,if it was n't for a few good laughs i 'd give
1,the story is a complete waste of time,the acting and directing are very good
1,gosh this movie was n't bad,gosh this movie has a good premise
1,of course there was the fact of the matter of what it means to be an important,of course the only thing i liked about the show is the way the story unfolds
1,also a few people are n't as good as this one,also the scene where a man is stabbed by a bat and
1,if i was to rate a movie i should,if i were to make an improvement i would n't
1,once the film starts to drag the viewer can see the potential for this one,once the first time we get a glimpse on what we 're supposed the most important
1,at the end of the episode the viewer was treated with a little more care and more sympathy,at the time it was a long way from other movies i 've seen the movie and it 's
1,i'm not sure why it was made,i'm sure that the movie is a bit
1,it 's not a movie for everyone but the acting is,it is a movie about the life of a child
1,music is a very good song and the songs do n't make much sense,music is a very good thing but i do not know that it was a
1,i do n't know why this movie has so,i think this is a very good movie
1,a very interesting and interesting film,a very funny film that is a
1,in this movie the actors are n't very good either but it does not matter,in the movie the actors do n't have the same charisma as the characters
1,and i think this movie is the best thing i can think of in the world,and it 's a great movie to see if it is not for its beauty and its
1,certainly the film was n't as good as the original and it 's not,certainly the film is very funny in parts and the acting is excellent
1,i have never seen the film so i have to,i think that 's the point of the story
1,apart the fact of a couple of the most important characters i have seen in a movie that,apart with that it has a very nice twist ending that is n't just a bad idea
1,davis 's performance as a woman is very good as the character is so convincing and the,davis plays a young woman who is a woman and she is not a good actress
1,it 's not a movie about a,it is not a good movie
1,thought it would make a movie a good idea for a film,thought it 's a great show that is so funny it 's funny
1,not only does he make a few films but this one was a,not to say it 's bad but it 's a bad movie
1,dear god i have to say that the movie was very funny,dear readers of the show and the fact they were not just a
1,well i guess that was a good idea but that was,well this movie is not the best of the series
1,this is the best movie i have,this movie has no redeeming features
1,all in all this film has a good cast and a very,all the actors are good but they all do their best
1,but the film is not a good film and the acting and direction is horrible,but i have to admit it is one that is so good it has to be
1,do not waste my time watching this movie,do you have to have the same thing to
1,this movie has the best acting i have ever heard on tv,this film is not for people with a taste for films like this
1,telling him that he was a little too much and,telling the truth about how the film was made
1,secondly the film 's plot line and the characters make a,secondly the movie is a complete mess of a movie
1,i was surprised that it did n't get released theatrically and the only thing i did n't get is that it 's a very good movie,i was so excited that it was canceled and i was surprised to discover how it was going to end and the ending was so predictable that
1,that was the most ridiculous part in the movie that the viewer was left with,that said i do not think that it is the best film ever made
1,this is a film that will make you think,this is a very bad film with no plot
1,this is the first movie that is so stupid and so unfunny,this is a very bad film that should be avoided at all costs
1,this film is not for everyone,this is a film that will make
1,the acting is horrible and there was,the film is not a comedy
1,at least the original was a very,at least it 's worth watching
1,and the film is not as good,and it 's not that i have to
1,besides the film itself the film has a lot of action and the plot twists were so interesting,besides the fact the story is set in new york city of the living is an excellent film
1,overall the film does n't seem as if it 's a spoof or the first film,overall the acting was ok and the script is very clever and the acting is superb
1,it 's a shame that the movie,it 's a very funny show
1,meanwhile the two men are reunited and the two become friends,meanwhile the film is set up as a backdrop of the events
1,the story of the movie is very simple and the story line,the story is a little thin and it 's too long
1,i do not know if it 's the fact that the film was made by a director or not because it,i do n't know if it would be like a movie or a movie but it is a good movie
1,dorothy malone was a great actress and i liked her character,dorothy malone 's performance in this film was very good
1,when i saw this film in my local library i had to watch this,when you 're a kid it was a great movie to have your heart pounding
1,in the meantime of a great cast the film 's main weakness is,in the end he is a little too old for his own
1,i have n't read the books but the story of a girl who was,i think the movie is a good idea to watch the whole thing
1,the story line has been done by a man who,the acting in the film is very well made
1,this is a very good and very entertaining movie,this is the kind that i would love to see
1,she is not a bad guy but it 's a bad,she is a very talented woman and a great actress
1,so if the director had n't been able it might have made a better movie,so if i were to rate this movie a 1 out 10 it would have to
1,i was surprised at how many of the scenes were in this movie and i was laughing so hard,i think the movie is a little too long for me to understand the ending of the movie
1,yet i still remember it fondly,yet the movie is not so much
1,he is also the only one who is willing to go on a mission to save the,he is a very talented actor who can be very believable and believable as the lead
1,shoot em off the wall and you 'll get a good idea,shoot em down is an enjoyable movie and one that is worth watching
1,the movie was shot in the early seventies and the movie has been released in the past 50 years and is a film about an,the movie has a few moments that make me laugh and i think that it is a good example to watch a good film
1,this is not a movie about the dangers that the,this is a great movie for all the family
1,i was so excited to find out about this film and it was the only time it ever came out in my head and,i do think the whole thing has been made for television and i do have to give the movie credit to the actors
1,mutated is a film that will be seen as one that will be appreciated by everyone who has,mutated is the worst movie i 've seen in a long time but i have seen it
1,they were the only two people who were in the film and the movie was very good but not,they 're just so stupid and stupid that i do n't think i 've laughed so hard since
1,i'm a fan and i am a fan of hers so i'm not a fan of either of his films i do n't,i'm a huge fan and the movie was pretty good but it was n't a bad film it 's a little boring
1,overall i think this movie is a waste of time and a waste,overall i give it a 7 out of ten and it 's a good
1,tracy 's acting is very good and the acting is great but i do not recommend this movie,tracy 's character was a little bit of fun and he was n't the only character in the whole
1,this movie does n't make sense to the viewer to see it,this is a movie that is a real stinker of sorts
1,this movie was a complete disappointment to the eyes of a young man who has no,this is a great film for those who like to watch a good horror movie
1,how could this film be so bad that,how could you have to see it
1,while this is not the only film of this type of genre the film has a certain amount of potential to make the audience feel uncomfortable,while i do n't think the filmmakers were trying to be clever or funny this movie was a waste of money and time and it would have
1,farley lundgren and the rest of the cast,farley lundgren is a very talented actress
1,the film is a bit slow but the story is interesting,the story was very simple and it 's not the story
1,kids are not as stupid as this one,kids are the best thing to do
1,it 's a shame that this movie did not have a wider budget,it 's a shame that such an opportunity never made another movie ever made
1,in fact the movie is very much like it,in fact the movie has a very long list of
1,the story line was a joke the acting and direction,the film was made for a very young audience
1,john cusak is one that will never be remembered as the most famous actor in the,john wayne is a great actor and i do not think the film is perfect
1,the movie is a little over rated,the acting in this movie sucks so bad
1,and that 's the only way i will see it,and the film is n't a complete waste of film
1,it 's a very good movie and a good example of why it 's called,it 's not even that bad it was just plain boring in a hurry

1,lady chatterley is a great actress but her role is very poor,lady tremaine was an ambitious character and i was hoping for her to
1,he has the ability and the ability,he is the best actor ever
1,it is not even the worst film ever but i do think that it was a waste of,it 's not even the worst movie ever but its just a bad film with bad acting
1,some have said that this is the worst movie i saw,some people have commented on this film as a bad movie because
1,a very good movie and i recommend this movie,a good movie for a rainy sunday afternoon afternoon with
1,not a single scene is filmed with an open hand in it that is so bad,not that this movie does a good enough good job in the movie industry but the fact
1,life is n't a bad thing to do but,life in this movie is a real treat
1,blind and the dead is one that is a complete waste for a razzie,blind man is a film of the highest caliber and it 's the worst movie

1,the acting was horrible the script was horrible and the plot just plain stupid,the film is a complete mess of an action thriller that fails miserably
1,this movie was a waste on my time and i ca only recommend the movie for the acting,this film is one of the most beautiful i can remember and it 's a great movie
1,i'm a fan of the genre of this movie,i'm not a big fan and this is a good
1,for those who do not see this film as it should not get the recognition it deserves and it is a,for those who have not been exposed by the movie 's original title the film has a very good cast
1,the movie is a little bit slow but it 's just too slow and too predictable,the film was made by a group that was n't the first time around but the movie
1,the movie was shot on location in the late seventies and the film was released in a very cheap way and it was filmed in the same location,the story is simple and the acting performances of a bunch are not bad and the acting was horrible and the story was weak and the acting is terrible
1,the story is a little confusing,the story is very simple and very
1,and the movie is so bad that i ca all about the,and the acting is so poor it 's hard to believe
1,having read the books and seen them in a few years i have a fondness for,having read the book the film is based on the novel by the same author
1,it 's just a shame that this movie is n't available,it is a shame that the director did n't get it on
1,alison is not a good character but she is not the most interesting person,alison is the only one that can survive the death of the killer
1,if you want something different and you do n't want it to happen you might want a few more laughs,if you are not into a bad b movie this is a movie that should have had more appeal to them
1,if it were a little more than a drama i would say this is the worst film that has ever,if you 're a fan of the original you will like it as much as i like the original
1,look no farther than the usual hollywood fare that has made you think of the world of cinema as,look at the cast of this film and i do not think it 's a very good movie
1,first of all the acting is bad and the story line is so bad that i ca least even describe this,first of all i was very disappointed with it but i did not find it interesting and the acting was terrible as
1,well the movie is about a bunch,well the film is a little too slow
1,as for the rest of the cast the acting is terrible,as a result of the fact the story is set the pace
1,i have to wonder if the director was,i think it 's a good movie
1,i do agree with many comments on this movie,i do not think that the director intended the film
1,never before was i disappointed that it is n't,never before has the film been so consistently awful and
1,in the first film the main character is killed by an old man in the movie and is shot in,in this film the actors are n't bad and the story line is n't as good as the book
1,maybe it would n't be too much for him,maybe i should have had it been a little longer
1,the movie is a very good one and the acting is excellent but the story is not really about a man,the story is about the love triangle of a young man who has been a successful man for the past year and
1,this is the first film i have ever,this is a film for all ages
1,it 's a shame the movie never got released,it is not a movie that you will see in
1,wyman is a young woman whose only purpose is to get her to be a little,wyman 's character has the same personality that i have ever seen in a movie
1,his character is so believable that you,his character is a bit dim
1,this was a movie i would n't watch again,this was one movie i would like to see again
1,hint at this film is a good example,hint to the director of the film
1,from the very beginning of the episode the movie settles around the same building,from the beginning i found myself wishing that the filmmakers would have been more focused
1,wow i have to say that i have a lot of problems with this one,wow i 've seen it a million more time and i have to admit that this
1,trying hard and the first movie is the worst i ever seen and it is not,trying desperately for some reason i was n't sure how the movie could have been done
1,the film has some good performances and some nice touches on the part of a good guy but it 's not,the story of the story was interesting and it was n't the first thing you 'd likely say about it
1,only the acting was good and there was,only the title is a real letdown
1,not a good movie but a good movie,not that the movie is bad but the acting
1,his character is not believable and he does not even try,his performance is very convincing as the movie goes on
1,the film was made for tv but the acting was so poor that you could n't even care less about any character,the film is about a group called the filthiest of the world war two and the adventures that are in place
1,as a movie it was n't a total loss,as i said before i was not impressed
1,the movie has an interesting premise and is a bit of an action movie,the movie has a very nice cast and the actors are very good in the
1,i'm a fan of movies but this movie was just bad,i'm sure that the filmmakers and directors of this movie have made
1,some of the acting was pretty good and the story line was,some people may find this movie funny because of their problems
1,i think that the movie was a complete waste of my time and money,i do n't think that the director intended a movie for a movie
1,they are not in the film,they have to be one to avoid
1,while the film is a little slow at times it 's not a good movie to watch and is,while the movie was n't the best of its type i was n't expecting much from this movie
1,directed with the help that the original was a little more interesting than the original it is still very,directed by steven seagal and directed by robert deniro and a few other films that were n't bad
1,this is one movie that i would recommend to anyone interested into their,this film was made for tv but it 's still worth watching
1,i do n't think i 've watched this movie so bad as i can but it,i was so bored to have seen this film that i did not like that
1,for me the most enjoyable part of this film is the fact that,for me it was n't a bad movie it just was bad
1,blade li was the only one who could n't act in this movie but he is not,blade runner is the best film i have seen since it is a very good film
1,he is a very good character,he is not in his element but
1,by far this is the best film i have ever,by now i am a sucker for the film
1,imagine that the movie is a remake of an,imagine the movie and the movie 's plot
1,kiera knightley 's character was a little too young,kiera khanna is a good actress but her acting is
1,jones is a fine character actor who is very convincing in the,jones is a very nice person and is a real treat
1,backdrops are n't the main problem with the story and the characters are just plain boring the characters seem like they,backdrops are very good and it 's a shame that it is so much of a cult following for that
1,the movie is very slow and boring and the ending is predictable,the film is about a group of men and their relationship
1,he 's not a bad guy he does not even have the decency to pull off his lines in a movie that is so bad,he is a great actor but his character was so unlikable that it was hard not to root for the character he was playing with
1,timon and pumbaa are the only ones in this movie that will never get better with age,timon and bertie have the best lines and their lines and delivery delivery delivery and acting make it
1,strangely enough the film does have a few good points,strangely enough the film is a little slow but the film
1,the story of an american woman who is sent in prison by an american family is a bit of an easy thing to say,the movie starts with a bang and ends in a bar and then the camera switches gears and we see it coming from another angle
1,if i had to watch this film i would n't have to have a refund for it but,if i had n't seen the original version of the original film i would n't mind it
1,the story line has been done so many many times,the story is simple and the acting is good
1,the acting is good and it 's a great movie,the acting is very weak and there was nothing in this
1,very little is the scene with which the two,very few movies have a shred of originality
1,but the real reason why this movie is so bad is that it was so awful,but i do not think this movie should have ended with the first two hours
1,cary grant and irene hawn give a fine performances,cary elwes plays an excon who has no interest in
1,the story was so stupid it 's impossible,the film is a bit too long but the
1,i do agree with the previous reviewer about the movie but i did find the,i think it 's one that i would recommend watching it for all you
1,finally the film is a bit over a long time ago when it 's released theatrically,finally the movie 's main character is a little too much to ask for a good reason
1,so if you 're a diehard fan like myself i suggest it,so if the movie does n't work for me it would be worth
1,this movie has a great deal of humor in the movie but the movie has,this movie is a must watch for everyone interested with a very good movie
1,though it 's still a good movie to watch,though this is n't a bad movie i have to
1,gary is a man of honor and is a,gary busey is great as the evil man
1,this is a movie that is a,this movie is a must see
1,i think that the movie was shot in a very tight budget,i have to say that this movie had a lot to it
1,the story is simple enough to make you laugh at the jokes,the story is very simple but the acting and the directing are so
1,the film is not a comedy but it does n't have to be,the story of the story of an old retired family who is haunted with
1,victor is a very talented director and,victor mclaglen 's acting was excellent
1,i think this movie is one of the best movies ever,i have to admit that i was a little disappointed
1,its not a bad movie but a very entertaining movie,its a shame because it 's a great movie
1,i was n't expecting much from this film as it was a complete waste of time,i do n't know how it got a rating of 1 i gave it 3 out there
1,i have n't been able to find it in any way out of the stores or even,i have n't read the manga or read the books but the book is very good
1,then i realized i had a crush on the movie,then again i have seen this movie several times and it
1,i think it was a waste of time,i have never seen any other films in my
1,the film is very well done but it is a bit dated for the eyes and too much,the movie starts out with the two leads in an old house and they are all very different and
1,this is a film that i would advise anyone who likes to,this is a film that should have been released in theaters
1,the film 's main character is played as a buffoon,the film has a lot of action and some really great
1,altogether i was very impressed with the story,altogether i was n't impressed by it
1,it 's a shame to watch a good,it was a waste for the movie
1,he is a great character actor,he was a little too old for
1,this movie is not worth the time and money,this movie does a good job with it
1,the story of the movie is a bit of a joke but there was a lot,the film is a very interesting one and a lot of times in the movie
1,it 's a very funny show,it was a very funny film
1,i have seen it twice now and it is one of my,i do not know what it was like in my childhood
1,yes it 's the worst movie ever i have seen the movie,yes there are some great performances and the acting is excellent
1,well it 's just a little slow but that is the reason,well the movie was a bit over the top in my head
1,who is that knocking of the door in his grave to get his hands,who would have thought this would have been the worst of the bunch
1,i was surprised to see that the movie was made in the early 80,i have never heard about the movie and i do n't know why
1,sadly it was the only movie i had seen in,sadly i do n't know where it is going
1,i'm not sure why i was so impressed by it,i'm not sure if the director or writer were trying to
1,to be honest it 's not a bad thing,to say the film is n't a masterpiece of a
1,many of the characters are just too stupid and there 's not enough action to make it,many of us have commented that this movie is not as funny as i would be
1,it has a very nice story and some good performances,it 's not a bad movie it is just a bad
1,but it is n't that much of an,but it 's still a good movie
1,if you are a fan and have seen a lot of films that you,if you are not into the movie you will find this film entertaining
1,i do n't think i can see any of the movie in this movie and the,i have never been to a film theater so that i can appreciate the movie
1,as for this i would n't be allowed if i 'd seen this,as i mentioned earlier the film 's main character is not a hero
1,as a matter of fact there is no plot to the story but,as i said the film was very good in the first place
1,we get to know the main character 's motives and his character,we get a glimpse of what we see as we get the point
1,aside in a few words it is a very good and entertaining movie with great acting performances,aside from that there was a very funny scene where the two guys were in a bar with
1,the acting and script were very good,the acting is pretty good but it 's
1,one can only assume that the director and writer were,one of the most memorable movies i 've seen
1,he 's just as good as the guy who is always a good guy and,he was the only one to be able and he was so much fun
1,it 's just a little bit too long and it is n't that bad,it 's the same thing that makes the movie a lot more interesting
1,at least it 's not a bad movie,at one time the film is a complete mess
1,this is the first film i have had i laughed out loud at,this movie was a waste of money on my local video rental
1,he has a great sense of humor,he 's a very talented man but he
1,unfortunately the film has been a bit too long,unfortunately i have to say the film 's only saving
1,better luck next door is a very enjoyable movie and i hope it will be,better still a lot of people in the audience can relate to their characters
1,there 's a bit of nudity but it 's not a bad thing,there are a lot of things that make this movie so funny and the
1,and i have to mention the fact that,and it 's not even that funny
1,it is not a movie for everyone,it 's not the worst movie ever but
1,the film is not about a young man named paco who has been a,the movie starts as a series of flashbacks between the two main characters
1,i do n't know how to explain the plot but it does have a certain element,i think this is one of his better movies but the film is not very good either
1,but the film 's main flaw was that,but it 's not a bad movie
1,as the movie progresses you know what to do,as a result of the film 's title this movie
1,i'm not a big fan like the ones that are the ones that are the,i'm not saying this film is a masterpiece but a film of its own
1,this movie is a must watch for any fan of the classic genre,this was an interesting movie but it 's just not a movie
1,all of these actors are great and the story,all i can do is watch this movie
1,overall it was n't very good but i was n't impressed at the end,overall this is an interesting film and i hope that the next generation of the
1,the acting was horrible and the writing was bad and the story just,the story is very good but not as good as the other
1,the story line is about a young man trying his luck and the girl he loves,the story was so predictable that i could n't believe the outcome of the movie
1,in a way i was not disappointed,in the first film there was a scene
1,in this one the characters are not very believable,in the end i did n't care about it and
1,in the end i was hoping that the next big,in this case it 's a very good movie
1,in this movie it 's a little bit different,in the first half hour of this one the characters
1,why does the director choose to make this,why is the story such a mess
1,he is a man in a rubber suit and is a man who has a heart attack,he was a great actor in the first movie but i think it 's the funniest
1,critics have been warned that this movie was made in 1980 and the,critics have commented that the director 's commentary is a little misleading
1,i have seen a number of movies and the,i was expecting something better than this film
1,after seeing the first film i had to say that i was a little surprised,after a few minutes of watching the film i was n't bored at how much it
1,s direction was very good and the acting is excellent and the acting and direction are superb and the acting was good and the characters are very well done _EOS,is a great film that is not just a vehicle of a film but a documentary about a man who 's a teenager and a musician who has a severe
1,simply put this is a very entertaining movie,simply a movie that should be seen by all
1,i do agree but the movie was so,i think this is a good movie
1,most of it is the same,most of the time the film is
1,the story was a joke and the ending was,the acting was n't bad but not bad
1,at one point the camera is trying to get the viewer to look at the camera and look,at least i did not have any expectations of the movie and it was n't that bad
1,this film is a must see for any serious horror fan,this film is one big joke of the movie and it is
1,and the film has some very good actors,and the film is not a complete failure
1,this is one of the best movies that has made you feel the emotion of what,this movie does not make it to the end but i did like the film
1,let 's just say that this is not the worst movie i 've ever watched,let me just say that this is a very poor and very bad film and should
1,so the plot is n't bad but the acting was n't bad,so the story of a young girl named sosuke is a very interesting
1,congratulations to all who love the original story of the,congratulations the director 's commentary on the dvd cover
1,the acting and direction are very poor,the film is about a woman who is
1,i was so impressed by the movie i was so disgusted that i was able into,i think that the film is very funny but it 's not a bad film
1,also i think it was the best movie of the year and the best one was the one with,also i do not think this film is meant for the younger crowd who have seen this show
1,the film is about as exciting and interesting,the story is very simple and it 's not
1,the movie is about a man who is in love with the,the film is very well acted and the acting was great
1,still this is the first movie i have seen that has,still it is a great story about two young men
1,that said i did enjoy the film,that is the case with the rest of
1,apart the fact is that it was a little more interesting than the first,apart with the usual plot holes and the occasional plot line the film is a
1,robert duvall plays a young man who is torn between the life of a man and an old woman,robert duvall was a good idea and i liked the fact that it 's all very well done but the
1,and it is a very funny movie,and i think the director should be commended
1,some of the actors are not as great as their roles,some people may find the movie funny because it has no real
1,its not a movie for kids,its a shame that the filmmakers did
1,but the story line is n't bad and the acting by the two leads,but the film does n't have the same affect as the first film
1,they are both funny and funny and the movie makes you laugh,they 're the only ones that have a shred of respect
1,the story is about an aging man and his wife and,the movie starts out very well with the two leads
1,it is a shame the movie is not available on the imdb or vhs,it 's the kind of movie that you would watch over time and it is
1,each time he is in the film he is the most decorated,each character is the best and most believable of the bunch
1,definitely the worst film ever made,definitely not the best film ever but
1,is it possible that the filmmakers were making a film about the evils that the director did n't have,is it a coincidence that the director of the original novel was n't able for the film to be released
1,lord and his friends and the rest is the cutest of all the bad guys in the movie,lord of a trusted experiment has a very similar theme about his life in which he is a man
1,overall it was a very good movie,overall it is an interesting movie
1,moonwalker is a very good film that i would recommend it,moonwalker 's the most popular movie i 've seen in a while
1,hopefully the next day he will be in the future and that 's the only reason i can think of why this,hopefully the director will make a better film out of it but this is n't one that should n't be missed
1,i do think that this movie was very funny and i would like it if it was n't so bad i would not be watching it again,i think that the best part was when the movie is supposed to be the first of the three movies i 've watched but the story and acting
1,johnny is not a great character but he is not a good guy,johnny 's character and her mother are a bit of the puzzle
1,i have to agree with the reviewer who said that,i have n't read many books about this movie
1,do not waste your time on the movie,do n't get me wrong i love the original
1,the movie starts with a group of young people trying their best but the story is just so boring,the story of the film revolves around a young boy who lives in the city of new york
1,for the record i would have given it 0 out of 4,for the first hour and fifteen minutes i thought that this movie was
1,for the first half of this series the film is very slow,for a film that is n't really a thriller it is a very
1,i think it 's the best of the series,i do n't understand why people are so attracted to
1,too much of the action takes place,too bad it did not end
1,it 's a shame because this movie was so bad it was funny,it has been said that the director of this movie was the only actor
1,with the exception being a bit over it 's a good movie it 's not that bad,with all the shortcomings and the cast and crew of this movie it is not easy to see
1,the movie is about a young man named angus who works on a mental breakdown to,the film has an interesting premise but that is not what i thought it to
1,ariel 's father is a young man who has been sent into prison and has a crush on,ariel is a very beautiful woman who has to be the most beautiful actress in the world
1,like a movie that has the best of the three main protagonists,like i mentioned above the movie is a very interesting experience
1,there is no real explanation for this film to make it any easier and it 's,there are many things i do not like but this movie is a complete waste
1,you can get a sense of how the film was made but it 's just a,you know that the director and the director have done something with the camera work
1,in the meantime the movie is set up to,in the end it 's a good movie
1,i think that the movie should be seen as a warning and it is not a great movie,i do n't understand how it could possibly end with a whimper but it is a good story
1,happily he is the one who is the most,happily he was the one with the other
1,eddie 's father is a little more interesting,eddie is the best thing about the show
1,these are the two adjectives of the movie and the acting of all of the actors,these are the two things i did not like and i was n't expecting much
1,it is n't a film that 's not even worth watching,it is not the worst film i have seen but it has
1,it 's not even that bad but it is still a fun and watchable ride and,it 's a shame because the film is not as much fun to sit through
1,he has been a successful actor and,he is a very nice guy
1,the acting was horrible the directing is worse and there are some pretty obvious things to say about the movie and the acting is bad,the acting is horrible the plot is awful and i ca n't help but think that this is one bad film that has been released on
1,it 's not a bad movie but i have a few complaints that are so good,it 's not even the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune of viewing
1,to be honest this movie has a lot of action and some good action sequences but it 's not a,to make a long story is not a bad idea but the movie does have a lot of potential
1,of course there is n't a single thing in this world where it 's all that matters,of course the film is n't a complete waste and that 's not the point of the movie
1,and the movie is a little too long,and the movie is a complete waste
1,at least that is where i saw that the movie had to,at least it has some good acting and a decent plot
1,it is not a film that is a bit,it 's not the most interesting movie ever
1,i do n't know how this got the rave reviews but it does not deserve to go on the list for the movie and i would recommend that anyone interested with it,i do n't understand why people are so stupid and stupid about this movie but i have n't read a lot of other reviews and have read a lot of comments about this
1,it 's just a shame to see a movie with such great actors like this one,it is not a movie about a man who is a loner in a society
1,and the movie has a few twists,and it is a very funny movie
1,cheap production design and editing and editing is not the,cheap tacky slasher movie that 's not worth watching
1,i was expecting a movie to be a bit slow,i think the reason why i gave this movie a 1
1,i do agree that it was a bit of an accident but i was n't,i was expecting something like this but this was the worst i 've heard
1,now the movie was made in the early seventies,now i do n't know what to say
1,all in all this is one of the most entertaining and enjoyable films i 've ever seen and i 've seen many other bad ones and,all i have is the fact this is a film of a certain sort of film that makes it a must for the whole family
1,if you want to watch something good with a few mates and an adult,if you have n't read the book you will be disappointed by it
1,robinson and his wife are both a couple of times in a row that,robinson is the only one in the film that is a real treat
1,we have to see it to be over the face of one of,we have seen the same movie as in many of its contemporaries
1,the acting is horrible the script was awful and it made me laugh,the acting in all the bad lines is horrible and there are some really
1,in the end the movie is a complete waste of money and time,in the first half of it you get a glimpse of what the future
1,he is the only actor who has to be the most annoying actor in any film i know that 's all that is bad,he is a very talented character who is a very talented actor and a real pleasure to see and he is a fine foil for
1,you can tell that they are making a film with an actual budget and that the camera angles look very low,you can see the director 's intentions to tell the story of the film and it is not a very good idea
1,set in a small town town of the city where the story of a young boy who is a little bit sceptical of his life,set in a futuristic village in the middle of the night the story begins to go downhill and the characters get the same story
1,i do not know what to call a movie,i was surprised that it did have been released on
1,as a movie this is not the worst film in my life,as i 've said the movie is very well done and the story
1,the movie has the same plot as it was in it,the film is very good and the acting is good but the
1,view it is a movie that is not only a waste but a very funny movie,view it for the first half of the film the acting and cinematography are excellent
1,then i saw a few of the other comments about how this movie was a bit of an,then the movie switches to the main character of a girl who has a very deep secret
1,i was expecting a lot more than a lot of the other movies that were,i was n't expecting anything from this but it was a very entertaining experience
1,and that 's what i got,and the film 's climax is a
1,the acting was good and i was able to relate with what was going to be done in a movie like the first one and that 's,the story is a little too complicated for a children of the century to be able to get away and the film is very well done
1,eventually the story is set in motion and the movie is about two,eventually i was able into the film and i was n't disappointed
1,i do n't understand how it got made but the fact that it was filmed on location is very impressive and the actors were great in their roles as,i was surprised to see this movie in a theater and it would seem that i would have been more impressed if it was more of a movie
1,not only does the story not work in this case,not that i do n't know why this film was released
1,a few years ago i saw this movie and i have to agree that the movie was a little slow,a lot of the scenes are filmed and edited in slowmotion and they do n't really look like they 're going
1,the acting is good the story is good and i think this is,the acting is very poor but it 's not a good idea
1,also the ending is a bit too abrupt and it 's just a little bit too slow and the ending is just as stupid as you would have thought and,also the movie was shot in the same location and the actors in the movie are very good and it really is a shame that it was released theatrically
1,is it that the filmmakers are making a movie about how the,is it possible for a film with such a good premise
1,champlain has to go to a party and he does not have any of the same problems,champlain 's father and the son of both are the only people who have a chance of finding
1,it 's a shame that the movie,it was n't that bad either
1,i have seen it three years ago and have been impressed with,i think it 's the only way to get a copy
1,you know the story is a bit different,you can get to see the end of the
1,while the story is a little slow and drags at times it feels as though it was rushed out of a hurry and the,while i have to admit that it is not the worst movie i 've seen in my life it is a great movie
1,faced with the idea of having an american girl and her daughter 's daughter,faced by the film and the film 's success is its lack thereof
1,i have seen a couple episodes of this show and i 've always liked the shows and i,i was n't impressed by it and i was surprised by the lack of a coherent story
1,this movie is a must see,this film was a waste of time
1,in the first half hour we have a movie,in a way it does a good thing
1,we 're told that there is no way that the other passengers are the only ones that are,we have the usual suspects who are not the ones that are the most important of all
1,the movie is a complete mess,the acting is horrible and the script
1,evan is a very good movie,evan is an excellent actor but i
1,moments that are so funny are not that funny,moments of dialog were so bad it 's funny
1,but it is a great movie and a great one,but the film is a very entertaining and entertaining film that
1,he 's a very good actor and he has great chemistry with the rest and,he is the only one to get involved with the film 's production company
1,the acting and script are horrible,the acting is horrible the script is
1,it 's a shame that the producers decided to give us the opportunity of seeing this film,it 's a great film to watch for all of the stars involved and the acting
1,but the film is not a complete disaster,but the film is a very good and enjoyable
1,the film 's main character was killed by the devil and the girl who was in the film,the film has an interesting premise and it 's a very enjoyable film that is worth watching
1,if the movie was made in the early 90 years then it was a bit too long to get,if i were to give the filmmakers the opportunity to get a little of the credit they would
1,hey i know i know i 've seen the same thing,hey i 've seen a few movies like this but i 've
1,it 's a great movie that will be remembered for,it has to do the best of the lot
1,the story is simple and is a good one and a good one but that 's it,the story is a bit confusing and the acting and acting is very good for the most basic
1,here he 's an actor and a real person,here he is the only one who has a discernible
1,the movie is a complete failure and i do n't even want my to see a film with such a low budget,the movie is a little slow but i think it is a very interesting and interesting film to watch and i recommend it
1,anne parillaud is a delight as a young actress who,anne hathaway plays a very wealthy and protective wife
1,he 's not even a good man,he is the most talented and beautiful person
1,it is the worst thing in the entire movie,it 's just a bad film and a lot of
1,matthew mcconaughey is the only one to do the same thing he is so good,matthew mcconaughey is a great actor as the villain but he 's not as bad
1,it has a very funny and interesting plot,it 's not a bad idea but the script
1,well the first time we were watching it and we were all laughing,well i guess that 's the only reason to make a film
1,all i can say is that it has been so good to see a,all in all it 's an interesting film and a very good time
1,then the story begins to unfold with the arrival and the final,then again what do we have to do in this movie
1,if you 're going for a comedy this one will make your brain explode,if i were a little bit prejudiced it could 've been a good one
1,there are a few things i liked most but i was not expecting much,there 's nothing inherently funny in this movie it is not a good movie
1,i think it would have made a,i was n't impressed by it
1,i think this film has the best acting in it and that is what it is all all about but it 's still pretty funny,i do n't know how this is a film but it 's a very enjoyable and entertaining movie and one that you will enjoy as it
1,job in the case for the movie is the fact of the matter,job in this case was the fact it was a big budget
1,the movie is very slow moving,the acting is good the script well
1,after a while i had to watch the movie to see how many people were,after a few episodes of the show we have a series called the sopranos
1,the story is very simple and is told in the first five min,the film is about the man who was killed and murdered by the death
1,ever since then i have seen this movie and i am amazed that,ever the film is a very interesting film and i recommend it
1,what 's the point of the story of the characters who do not have to be,what is this about that is that the director 's cut is a real treat
1,now i do know what to say,now that 's not what it is about
1,for a film of such quality it 's hard to tell if they should be able to get a decent,for me i was a bit prejudiced about how much it is about the people involved in the making
1,risking a couple of hours of watching this show i felt that i could n't,risking the film 's plot the film is not as polished as a film
1,not a good thing for a movie,not only is he the only character that
1,one day he meets up a young girl who is a bit of a jerk,one of the best of the silent film noir films of the late 1940 's and
1,a few years back it is a movie with a great cast,a lot more than i thought was a really good film
1,philippe is a good actor and he,philippe is a very talented actor
1,that 's a shame because this movie has a good story,that was the most stupid part about the whole movie
1,most people who think that they have a different outlook,most of them are very good actors and actresses
1,the movie is not a good movie,the story is about the lives of the
1,when the film was released i was n't sure what was happening,when i watched this show the other was a little bit too young
1,of all the movies that have been released on the last few,of course he has n't seen this film in the past
1,i do agree with the reviewer that the only good parts are the ones in the club,i think the director and writer should have done a good job of making a good movie
1,a good example of how a movie should have,a few years later the movie was shot
1,also the film has a very interesting plot and some of its own,also the film is not as funny as in other movies like the ring
1,there is a lot to love about it,there are some great moments but they are n't
1,but i have to say that this was a good film,but the story of a man trying hard and failing to deliver
1,a very interesting story about two men who are married to a,a lot more than that it 's not a good thing
1,the movie is a complete waste of time,the story is very simple and the story itself
1,i think this was a pretty good film,i have never seen a worse movie
1,but the movie was just plain awful,but the film has no real plot no
1,it 's a very simple story,it was n't the best of all
1,but the movie is n't bad,but the film 's plot is not
1,with this movie it 's a great movie to see if it is a movie,with the help and the other 's name of this movie it would seem that he
1,later on the story develops a lot of questions,later on in a series that is supposed and is
1,the story line has a lot of twists and it is not the best movie that has been done,the film is a very moving experience of how a film can become so popular that it 's not a
1,as for the story the film is very entertaining but it is not a,as a matter i found the movie to be a very enjoyable film
1,and it does not take a genius to figure out,and i have to say i love the film
1,there is no reason for the to see any of the other films,there is a very good scene in which a woman is walking through her
1,the acting and script are horrible,the film is a little slow paced
1,amazingly the film is not as polished but it is a film worth a watch,amazingly it 's a movie about a young boy named sasha who lives with a young
1,the movie has some nice moments but the story does drag,the acting in this movie is horrible and there is a lot
1,kusturica 's direction is the most important part to this picture but i found it hard,kusturica and his crew are not afraid that the film is set against a background of the
1,they 're just so stupid and they are n't even funny,they are the only ones who seem to care about the characters
1,this movie is not worth a cent of your,this is the best movie i have seen
1,if you 're a fan like me who grew up watching a movie with a good story line then you should see a lot better,if it 's not for the fact of the title of the movie it 's not a good idea and the movie is a mess
1,i was n't expecting the same movie as the original but this one is just plain stupid,i do not think i can see the point of the film but the film is a complete
1,it 's not the best of its kind but it has the best of the two and a lot better,it 's a pity that they did this movie for the whole thing and i would have rated a 10 for
1,you 'll have no idea what to do with the,you have to see this movie to understand it
1,their relationship develops as a whole lot like the characters and,their relationship is the most important element in the film
1,it is the story that is so bad that the film has a lot to offer,it 's not that i do n't know what i was thinking of watching the movie but
1,but the film 's only redeeming feature,but the movie was n't bad
1,but the real reason why i give it a 10 out of 4,but the film has some of its most memorable scenes and a great ending
1,i have to agree with the other comments here about this film that i have n't heard so many,i think the film 's best part is to see the film as a comedy and a comedy
1,this movie was a total disappointment,this movie is a complete mess
1,herein was the fact that i was in a,herein was the fact it is a film
1,hidden from this one is the acting,hidden on this one i think that 's
1,so the film was n't so great as it was,so what i got was an excellent movie that is worth
1,pacino is the only one in the entire movie with such a great talent and he 's just,pacino is a great actor and i can forgive the actors for the role of the president
1,maybe the best thing about this film was the scenery which was the only thing i liked and that was the first thing you 'd want to know,maybe the best of the bunch is the one who 's in it and the scene with the girl in a bar is a classic and it 's a
1,members who have been living for a long weekend and have no clue of their own,members are not as good as the ones who have n't done the original version
1,an excellent cast that includes a very good cast and the end of the,an interesting film that is a mustsee to those who enjoy the book
1,i do agree with most of the other reviewers here,i have n't seen this movie in years and i still
1,aside from this it has been a good film,aside from that there was n't much of a good
1,do yourself an favor to the movie,do not waste my money on this one
1,spoiler alert the film is about as good as,spoiler alert it is n't even a movie
1,the movie starts out as a series of flashbacks to an old tv series,the acting is good with the exception that it 's not a great movie
1,to be honest i have n't seen this show since,to be honest i did not like the film
1,i have to agree with the other reviewer that this was a great film,i think this is a movie about the evils that are being made in a
1,finally there was a scene where the girl,finally the movie is n't a comedy
1,gone are the performances of this one as the characters are all very likable,gone is a movie about the real life of a woman who 's not a
1,hepburn 's acting skills and the script was,hepburn and lombard are a married pair
1,armstrong 's character is so unlikable and so unlikable that i,armstrong has a great talent and a sense of humor
1,she is a beautiful actress and she does n't need to do anything,she is also the best thing in life and she is a joy as
1,one can also identify to a character who is a very human and,one of the best films of all time is one of them
1,and i was n't sure what to expect,and it is not a good film
1,the film was shot with the handheld cameras of several cameras,the movie starts out with a couple going to see a train
1,as a matter of fact i have to say i have seen it many times and have never heard,as for me i do n't think it 's a good idea of what it 's all like
1,the story of a young man in the middle of a motorcycle crash in his home was very similar,the story is about the lives that are made to live and the people that are being killed
1,the film is about the power and the impact,the film 's main drawback is its plot
1,for a while this is the first movie that i have ever seen and that is the reason it was so popular,for the first two hours of the picture the characters are introduced as though they 're trying to get their hands on the
1,unfortunately the movie is just so bad that it 's almost impossible to make,unfortunately it 's not that good and it does n't make much difference
1,ok it was n't that great,ok so the plot is n't that
1,carol danes plays the role of an aspiring young girl,carol 's character is not only the mother of an old
1,the story is a little thin at the end but it,the story is about two people in a small town
1,like many of his films he has to be one dimensional character to the end,like the rest i found myself rooting to see what happens when the film finally gets
1,i do not think that the movie would have worked better with a lot,i do n't know why the critics were making such a bad movie
1,one of them is that the only one who has,one can only wonder why they were so bad
1,poste 's wife is a very good film and a very good one to watch,poste is the only one who is able for the most part of the movie and
1,it has the best of it 's own right,it 's a very good movie to watch
1,you know the kind you are in trouble,you can tell that the movie was made on
1,when the two men are killed by an alien gang of poachers who get killed by zombies the creatures are killed by a,when you watch a movie you will be thinking of yourself as a kid and it is a good movie to see
1,it 's a shame that it has been released theatrically on dvd so that it can,it 's a shame that the film has n't received any oscars for the original
1,in the end i was a bit confused about the movie but,in this case it 's not a movie for the kids
1,randolph scott is the only one who manages his role to the screen in his performance,randolph was in the first film and he was in a very funny way but the movie
1,its a shame that such a film is not made,its a great movie and i hope it does n't get
1,ian holm is excellent and i have to agree that he 's a great comedic actor and,ian mcshane plays his usual character in this movie as the villain who plays his part
1,and i do think that the director,and the ending was pretty bad
1,give me the creeps i 've never seen,give it a chance if you want to watch
1,sasori 's character was a bit too old for a film,sasori is a good guy but he 's still a bit more
1,the story is simple enough and there are some,the film is a bit of an insult
1,it 's not the same as a lot more,it was a waste of time and money
1,people who have seen the movie have a sense that it was not a movie,people have n't read the book and i do agree with the previous poster about it
1,this is a very good movie that is worth seeing and it 's a great family comedy,this is one of those movies i like to watch over and over again and again
1,the movie is about the power of the characters the characters and relationships,the acting was terrible and i thought that the movie was a little too
1,he is not the only one who can identify with him,he 's a very good director and a good writer but this
1,but it is n't a bad movie,but the film is a complete mess and
1,have n't seen any of this before,have i ever heard of the original
1,as a result it 's a very bad film and,as a matter i found the ending somewhat anticlimatic
1,kate beckinsale is perfect as a mother,kate capshaw is perfect and is always a
1,it is a very good movie,it is a very interesting story about
1,but it 's not that good,but the film is not as good
1,in the meantime of a film that 's a little bit of an oddity the film is very well made,in fact the movie 's story was a little rushed and boring but i think the story is a bit too
1,overall this was an enjoyable and enjoyable ride for,overall it 's not a bad horror movie
1,the film was shot in the same,the acting and directing are excellent
1,it has a good plot and a nice cast,it is not a movie about a group of men
1,and the movie is n't a total waste,and the film does n't make much sense to
1,no wonder he was in a movie that was not even,no it 's the same old thing as the first
1,we get to know that this movie was shot at the same time as in the original film and,we get a lot of people talking on the phone that it has no place in my mind
1,but the movie is not about the characters that are the ones that make,but i do n't think this movie should 've been called the classic
1,i was surprised to find that it was a little bit,i have n't been able to locate the original film
1,i think it is the worst of the series and i hope it gets canceled soon after,i do n't think that a film is a good idea but it is a very entertaining one
1,even the most ardent of actors in the movie are a bunch of bad actors,even the acting is awful and the acting is worse than the film itself
1,the film is a very moving one which is a lot of fun,the movie is about a man named benjamin a man named kenny who is
1,so if i was n't a little more eloquent than the original i 'd be able into the movie,so if you 're looking forward to seeing this kind of movies do n't bother to watch this movie
1,the acting is good and there are lots more of the actors that are the,the story is about two young adults who are searching for a new life
1,it 's a very funny show and the show is a delight to watch,it was a good idea and the movie did not make it to a movie
1,the acting was good enough but i was surprised to learn that it would not have been a good idea for an episode,the film 's main flaw of the film was that it had a lot of plot twists and some really good acting
1,it is a shame the film has n't,it has to be one to avoid
1,this is a very funny movie and a must see for any movie fan,this is a movie that i would recommend to anyone interested into the world of
1,preferably a little bit too far fetched to make,preferably in the middle ages of a movie
1,among all the films i watched this was the first of its many,among other films of this genre the film is a bit slow and the
1,the acting was horrible and i was bored by the whole,the acting was good and the story line is good
1,not to mention it has a good cast,not only is the film a little too much
1,i have seen the film twice and it 's not as bad as the others,i was n't expecting much of a movie and i was n't expecting anything
1,cause i 've seen a couple that is a little too much to say,cause it 's the only movie you have seen on tv you can see it
1,to be honest i do not think that the actors were the best actors in,to be sure the movie does n't have the feel that the original was
1,the story line was a little confusing,the movie has some of those qualities that
1,whilst the story was interesting and the characters and story are not as strong and believable,whilst it 's not a bad film at all it is still a good movie
1,finally the movie is n't as bad as it sounds,finally i saw this movie in an old theater
1,i think this is the worst movie of this type of movie,i think that it is one to watch and it is definitely not
1,but the film is n't that bad and it 's a lot of bad,but the movie was a lot better than this movie and i would recommend it
1,and the ending was so bad i was left wondering how much i missed a movie,and i was n't sure why i did n't watch a lot but the whole film was
1,there are some very funny moments but they are not funny either,there was a lot of action in the story and i liked it
1,the film is about as exciting as watching a movie,the movie has a lot of problems but i think that
1,we 're supposed to believe the story was a bit of an excuse for this movie but the story was pretty,we get a very enjoyable movie that has a great deal to offer but not as good as the original
1,i do n't know why this movie was so popular,i think that the film is a little bit too short
1,it 's the story that keeps you interested and will keep you guessing until you realize the ending,it 's just a shame that this movie has n't made it into theaters and has no idea why
1,you can see the film as a result in the film and it 's the only reason why i gave this a,you can see the director 's cut on the camera lens of the scene and the camera angles lighting and lighting
1,the story was so bad that it 's not really funny,the film has no redeeming feature whatsoever it 's not even worth
1,i think it 's a good thing that this movie is not for everyone who wants to watch it,i have seen this movie several times and it 's still a lot better than it is and i think
1,like many of his other films i think that the movie is a good one but the story line is not as strong,like many movies i have watched this movie is a complete failure to sit through and not to watch the whole time
1,one can also imagine the film 's appeal in this film,one of the best things i 've seen in the last 15
1,quaid 's character was a caricature and a very funny and funny one,quaid and his wife are both very likable and the film is very well
1,the film is a very good film,the story is very simple and the characters
1,so the plot and characters have to be the worst movie ever made and the ending,so what if the movie is n't about a man who is a serial killers
1,i do n't know what to call this movie,i think it 's one of the best comedies i
1,well it 's a movie that you can see in a theater or two,well the film was shot on a budget of about 30 million budget but the
1,a few years ago i saw it again on tv,a good film to watch for the first time
1,neither the movie is a masterpiece,neither of these characters ever had a
1,and it is a great shame that it 's,and the movie is n't that good either
1,but the movie was just plain stupid,but the film 's main weakness of this
1,filmed on location in the early 1800 'searly 90 minutes this film looks like it cost a lot more money,filmed on location and directed with flair by the late prolific cinematographer john mctiernan the film also features a young cast
1,since this was the first time i saw it i was n't sure why it would be a good movie,since it has been released abroad in germany the movie still has been done by a wider audience of the time
1,the film is very funny in its own right,the film is a very good movie and a good
1,i'm not sure whether this is a bad thing but it 's not a great movie and it is not for everybody,i'm sure that the filmmakers have been trying to make a film that is a little bit more than the sum but i
1,it 's a shame that the film did n't have a wider audience,it 's a very good movie to watch and it 's a shame it
1,however i do have to agree with the reviewer that this movie,however i think that the film is very much in depth
1,if you want something different and you want a good movie to see this one do n't,if it were a drama about a woman who was born to be a teenager and a child
1,however i have seen this film and i have never been,however it 's the best thing that can be say
1,the film is about as good a film of,the movie has a lot going from there
1,ed wood is one that makes you think about how to do,ed asner was the most annoying character in the whole movie
1,previous movies are made up in a series that is a bit more enjoyable than most of the other films,previous comment on the imdb user comment is the fact of the movie itself is a good one but the acting
1,peter falk is a fine actor but i think he was miscast as an actor,peter falk is a fine actress but the movie is not worth a mention
1,a lot of the film has the same kind as a,a few of these films were made during the height
1,has it been a movie about the holocaust,has a very strong and interesting story about a
1,it is a great movie that i recommend watching it,it 's a great movie to watch and enjoy
1,that was one of his best,that 's why i love movies like
1,nobody is allowed to make the mistake of being,nobody has a clue what 's going through
1,another reason why this movie was not released in,another thing that is good in the movie
1,i have seen this film twice and i,i have never been a fan ever
1,murders and the like is a great movie,murders are not always the case but it 's
1,they have no qualms about the situation,they have no qualms on how to get
1,but i think the movie was a,but it 's not that great
1,a lot of it is filmed with a,a very enjoyable movie and a mustsee
1,zombies are the only ones in the movie that are so stupid,zombies are not the same as we are supposed to be
1,i do not recommend this for everyone,i was expecting this kind of film but
1,okay so i was expecting to get a bit,okay i know it was a good thing
1,with the exception of a good director who is a little more interested than in the first movie it was n't that,with a cast in which the actors were cast in the roles of the two musketeers they were very well chosen
1,i think the film has a great soundtrack and the music,i was expecting a movie that would be better than the first
1,big budget is not a problem with the movie,big fat liar has been a favorite of mine for
1,it is a very funny movie,it 's a shame that it is
1,this is a great film and i highly recommended it,this is a film for all ages and it 's worth
1,red herrings are a bit too long and the,red buttons is one that you will enjoy
1,rocks and then a couple more,rocks are all a hoot and the
1,upside down is the best film that i have seen in a long,upside down is the most interesting film i can remember seeing it
1,patrick swayze is great as always as a man who is,patrick warburton is the most interesting character in this movie
1,the movie has some great actors and actresses,the story is very interesting and i do n't
1,in the end the movie ends with one scene and the other half is so,in fact the film has no real connection to any of these other movies
1,she has a good sense that she is not,she is the only character she can identify
1,others are not very good but the acting in the movie,others have commented that they 're not in this one
1,spoiler alert the ending was pretty lame and i was expecting a bit of the movie to,spoiler alert the movie is a bit too long for the most boring and boring ending
1,the acting was n't great but the actors did a decent performance and the movie really,the movie starts out with a bunch of people trying to escape from the planet
1,if the film was a bit more interesting and the actors were n't that,if you want to know what is a real film it is n't
1,some of the other reviews here are very positive about the movie but it is a good movie to watch,some people say it 's a good movie and it does have a great cast and it is very funny
1,my advice for the movie was a waste,my favorite character was a woman who was a
1,as i said the acting is very weak but i was surprised at how good a lot of,as for me i have seen a lot more of the same old and better known films
1,with the exception of the director 's chair and the camera angles it 's a very good job,with the help and the danger of being in the business business of the past and the future of
1,in fact this film is a complete failure,in fact the whole film was a complete mess
1,the film is a bit slow but that 's not the point,the movie is about a group that has to go through an old
1,and the acting is pretty bad,and it 's a shame because the
1,apparently this movie had the potential to be one,apparently the director has been able to make a movie
1,there was no real chemistry in the plot but the story was very interesting,there 's no real reason to watch this movie and the only thing i have
1,it is a very funny movie,it is a shame the movie is
1,you 'll never forget the film is not a complete failure but it is a good movie,you know it will end with you and i 'll never forget that i did n't get to
1,i have never heard anything about this movie before,i do think that the film was a waste and
1,it was n't the best but it was a great,it 's just a bunch that 's not funny
1,even the actors who were n't the main actors were not very good,even though the story is n't that bad the movie is n't a bad
1,how did this movie manage to get a distribution release on the,how could you not have a movie with the same title
1,by all means do not watch it,by far the funniest thing i have to
1,i was n't really expecting much from the movie at least not as bad but it 's,i was surprised to learn this was a movie for the first time in the series
1,some of them are just plain awful and they 're all bad,some scenes of this show seem to be a lot better
1,well this is not a movie you will watch in a theater and if it is n't so well acted it will,well i do n't know if i can find a copy of a movie or a movie that i would choose
1,besides this is a great movie,besides that this film is not worth
1,it 's not a movie for kids but it is very funny for adults,it 's just not a bad film but the acting performances are very good the
1,if i had the choice to see this movie again i could have a better movie,if the director of the book was a real man i 'd have to agree that he
1,tina turner is a woman with a soft spot for the ladies,tina is a very talented actress but she does n't have to act
1,the film has some very nice scenes in the beginning and,the story line is so bad that it becomes laughable
1,this is a great movie for everyone to laugh at but it 's,this is the first movie i 've ever seen in my life
1,unfortunately the film 's biggest flaw is the lack that,unfortunately it is not that easy for a person
1,john wayne is a great villain,john cusak was the only one in
1,i do n't know why i did not like this movie,i have seen it many years ago and i have to agree
1,i do n't want my time back but i do n't,i do n't know what to say about this movie
1,walter pidgeon is a revelation in the movie,walter brennan is a good actor and the acting
1,my favorite scene is a scene where she is walking through an elevator with a,my favorite scene was when the guy is talking about his dad 's life
1,seeing the first two movies i was impressed by the ending of the movie,seeing a film with a little more depth in your mind was the fact that
1,one of my favorites is the way that the film is,one of my alltime favorite films and i love it
1,i do not know if it 's just a movie or an example,i think the film is not a bad movie it 's not that bad
1,its a shame because the movie does n't have the usual plot,its the kind of film that you would want to watch
1,it is a movie with a lot of good ideas and a good cast that is not just a good idea,it 's a very good show that i can watch over and over but it is so much better and i do
1,i have never seen a film like this before but i do n't,i have n't read the book but i have n't read it
1,problematic to see a woman in a rubber coat,problematic and funny and a lot of laughs
1,there was a scene with the woman in the bar,there was no real plot to speak at the end
1,any one who can appreciate this kind should have been warned,any movie that has the same name as the original
1,if you are a fan of the genre and the tv series,if you want something a little more entertaining than i am
1,kelly 's character is not a good person but his,kelly was a bit more than he bargained for
1,when i watched this movie i had the impression that the movie was filmed on a tight camcorder,when the film finally ended and i was so disappointed that i could n't even get my head on
1,sadly the film is a little too much to ask,sadly the story of this film is not that bad and
1,her character 's life is the most interesting and most of the film,her character 's motivations were so obvious that you would think that she was
1,mike tyson 's portrayal of the man who,mike binder 's direction was very poor
1,groucho is an actor that makes you think he 's a real person,groucho is an excellent actor and he has a lot of screen presence but
1,okay the plot of the movie has some holes but the film is n't as good as the first two movies it is,okay i know that this is a movie for people but the filmmakers and producers should be warned to watch this film
1,plot is a bit of an insult but the story is so bad that the film is so boring,plot holes and the occasional plot twists are just not believable or interesting or interesting enough for the film
1,there are some funny scenes but the rest is just a mess,there are some good scenes and the movie is a bit slow at
1,this is one movie that should be,this film is a complete mess
1,if you are not into the subject matter of film making you 'll find yourself looking to get away with this one and you 'll be rewarded,if you 're looking for a film to be entertained by an adult audience this movie will be a waste of your money but do n't worry to
1,like i 've never been more disappointed with the movie i do think the movie is very entertaining,like the other reviewer i was n't impressed by the story and the acting and the script
1,you have to see the film to get it,you 'll have no idea what to do
1,why is it that the movie has such an awful script that i ca n't even begin to imagine how many times,why is it that the only time i can recall the name of the song is sung on the soundtrack album
1,this movie was not a great movie but it was n't as good as it was,this is not the case with this film it 's a film that has nothing to do
1,it 's the only thing i have ever liked,it 's a very good movie and it 's not
1,imagine the movie for the first time and it will be a great film,imagine a movie about how the director and director should have made this film to
1,there 's also a lot in the movie where the story is about a woman who is a woman and she is not,there was also an attempt by the director for trying to create a character study but the movie fails in every department
1,amid all of the other comments i have read here on imdb about it i have to say that i did n't like it,amid a very low point of view of the film it 's not a bad thing that this film has been made to be the
1,with this movie you will have the impression,with this movie you can feel that the story
1,when he is a teenager he 's a jerk,when i saw this movie i did n't even know
1,it 's the kind you can watch,it is a great film to watch
1,i think it is one of the most beautiful movies ever made,i do not know how many times i have watched this but the
1,they 're not the best of them,they have to be a bit of a
1,the film is a very good example of how the film is structured and the,the story is a little confusing and the story is very predictable and predictable
1,one can only imagine how this movie was released,one thing that really annoyed me is that the movie
1,she is the best character in this film,she has a very good performance in this one
1,despite the fact of it 's problems the movie has a very good cast and the supporting performances,despite being the most controversial film of this decade i was n't expecting much from the film
1,you know what 's happening in this picture,you can see the director mateo and his wife
1,anyway this movie has the same feel as if it was a sequel and a remake,anyway i think this film has a lot more to offer than the average movie that is
1,the film is a bit of a mess,the movie has a lot of problems
1,also the scene where he is talking is,also it 's a very good film
1,joseph cotten is the perfect choice as the villain,joseph fiennes is one of my alltime favourite actors
1,but i have no idea that the film was made in,but the movie is n't that good it is not
1,he is a great actress and is very good in her part,he is also a very good actor and he is a great director
1,this movie was a waste on an hour and 20 minutes and the whole time i,this was a movie i would watch if you have a chance to see it
1,well this movie is so bad it 's funny,well the film does have its charms in it 's
1,not only is it so boring it 's a,not to mention a lot of the movie
1,while i have to agree with other comments about the movie it 's not as good,while the film is not a complete waste of time it 's still worth seeing
1,it was a very good movie and i,it is n't even a good movie
1,reduces the two men to a place where the other is a,reduces a couple 's friends into a house of their own
1,definitely worth a look for anyone who likes the genre of the genre or the original,definitely not the greatest movie of the year but it is a very good film
1,as a movie it was a waste for me and a waste,as for the story it is a good one and a lot more
1,and the acting in this case was very poor,and the acting is horrible the directing is poor and
1,osborne is an excellent film maker who 's a great,osborne is the most famous character of the film
1,thank goodness the show was canceled in the us,thank you for allowing this show to go
1,well i do n't know what the point of the movie,well the movie is n't a complete waste of time
1,i do n't think that it 's too easy,i was n't expecting a lot of this
1,so the film is a complete waste,so the film has a lot of potential
1,i have seen it many years ago but still i ca only watch it for free,i was expecting a lot of the movie but this one just did n't have a lot
1,one of them is a woman who is a witch who is not afraid to go to the house,one of the best movies i ever seen in the last years and i have never seen a movie infuriated
1,maybe he 's just a bit too old to play the role,maybe i am just a little bit biased but i do n't think
1,not only does it have to be a little,not to mention a lot about the story
1,men are not the same as in this movie and the whole film is just,men in the cast are the same but the script is n't as strong
1,little of the same applies to his character,little did they have a good idea
1,when i first saw it i did not understand the movie at the time but i thought it might be a bit slow,when i saw the movie i had to watch the first movie and was shocked by how many times i saw it
1,otherwise it 's a good movie,otherwise it is a very good movie
1,the movie is a complete failure to watch and the only,the acting is good and it 's a great film
1,for the first half of a century i have seen a lot worse,for the record i think this movie should not be missed by any other
1,since it has been a long time since i 've seen this show i was n't impressed,since the movie has no real plot and is not a comedy it has to rely heavily on
1,this movie is a complete bore to me,this is a film that i can watch with
1,the film has a few funny scenes and it does n't really matter that the director was aiming to get it out of,the story is very simple the plot is simple the acting the writing the direction the acting the script and the story
1,i think this movie was the best,i think this movie is one of his
1,too much to ask for a little more,too many people have n't seen it
1,the film was shot in a very grainy manner,the film was very good and the story was interesting
1,this is one that i would love to know and,this movie does n't make a lick more difference
1,i think it 's a very good movie and it 's very entertaining and i do n't think that it 's a real shame because the plot was pretty good,i was n't sure what was going to happen but i could n't help but laugh at the lack in my stomach when watching a movie with the title of this
1,only to be honest i do not want to spoil the movie for my own sake,only the most ardent fans of the genre should be advised to see a few of the
1,it is not a movie that will make you think about it,it 's a very bad film that is n't worth a watch
1,as the movie progresses the audience is left wondering how much the story 's outcome is about,as for the rest the film is not very bad and the acting and the story is very
1,they 's character was a bit too old,they 's direction and editing were excellent
1,out of all things i have n't seen this film,out on dvd i watched it again on a saturday night
1,synopsis the movie was n't bad,synopsis a film about a woman and
1,soon after he 's killed he has the power to get his hands on a,soon the movie begins to drag and the viewer is treated by the film
1,lane 's character is a bit too long,lane is a very good actor and is the
1,ted danson 's acting is so bad that i do believe that the,ted is a good actor but his performance is not very good
1,he is also very convincing and he 's a good actor but he is not as good as his,he is the most beautiful and beautiful and beautiful woman in the movie and she is very beautiful
1,nikki is a great actor and she has a good voice and,nikki is the only reason to give it an extra chance
1,there are some good performances and i think the film was a good idea to make up some good movies but,there is no reason to watch this movie unless you 're looking for a fun movie with a good story
1,equally bad acting and a terrible plot is a very weak attempt to make the audience laugh,equally bad is the way the film is structured and the acting is so bad i ca all
1,if you have n't seen a movie that is not,if you have n't watched this show do n't
1,i do n't know what to say but,i have to agree on the ending
1,sometimes you can see a film with an open mind but that 's what i would like to say and i have,sometimes you get the feeling that the film makers are trying too hard to be too serious to be a comedy
1,it 's a shame because the plot is n't that interesting,it is a shame that such an opportunity to see such great
1,based upon the book this was written by the director of this film,based upon the novel by john huston the film 's title is a tribute
1,the film is a little slow and it 's too long for the audience to care,the movie has some nice moments and a few scenes that will keep you guessing
1,you 'll be surprised at how much it is,you have n't got a clue about what it is
1,however i think that the film 's biggest problem was that the movie was n't as bad,however i was impressed and the film did not have to do with the story and the acting
1,the movie was n't even bad enough,the story is a little confusing but it
1,she is also in a movie that is n't funny,she has to be a bit too young to play a
1,however the film does n't work,however this movie is a must for
1,vh1 was n't a good director,vh1 is the most famous character in
1,i think it was one of those movies that i had,i was so disappointed by the film and the story
1,when you see a glimpse of the movie it is a great movie,when i saw this movie on tv i was amazed by how good it
1,it 's not that the story is a complete waste of,it is a very simple story and a wonderful story
1,and it was n't that bad,and the film is not about the
1,has the director 's vision of the world,has a lot more of a story about the
1,by far i was so impressed by this film,by now i was n't really sure whether this is
1,american graffiti has the same effect as it is,american audiences will be disappointed with it 's a very
1,let the viewer know it 's a comedy about a man who 's a,let the audience decide to give the movie the goosebumps and the film
1,if you 're looking for something to watch then do not watch,if you want the film that 's a real tearjerker then this is
1,the movie was a little bit of a letdown and i did not know what,the film is a bit long and the story itself is a bit confusing
1,if you are a diehard fan you will find it a bit too dark but i,if i were n't for the movie 's end i would have been the same
1,alison 's character is so annoying that she is n't funny,alison is the one that makes this movie so funny to me
1,even the music is a bit too loud,even the music is n't very good
1,arriving in this world and all of the above mentioned the plot and character,arriving on the beach and the other two survivors go on the rampage
1,i do not want my money,i have to agree that this is
1,many things are n't even explained in that film the story line is very simple,many of the scenes that were supposed or did not seem like the film 's were
1,but it was not the worst film i have watched in a while,but it 's not as good as a tv show and it 's not
1,the movie is about a young boy named sasha whose father has died and he,the acting is horrible the story is awful and the characters just seem ridiculous
1,the story is very interesting and i,the film was a complete waste
1,there was also some nice scenery and a few nice touches to make it a,there is a very good scene where the two men meet in a restaurant
1,i was so excited when it was released,i was surprised at this film and i think
1,at first i thought it was the worst film ever,at one point the film is shot in black
1,in fact the film is a complete waste,in fact i have seen this movie several many
1,although the story was very original and the story line is very interesting it still works,although this is n't a movie it will be a lot more fun than this
1,those are some good points to the movie,those are the things i hate most people about
1,some of the other reviews seem to be on a bit of a bad idea,some have commented that the plot is a little confusing to say the least and the
1,action sequences and action scenes were done,action is n't all that great
1,i think the film is not a good film but i would have liked it,i do n't know how this is possible to make a film like this
1,she is not the least likable actress in the world,she is a beautiful woman and is very beautiful
1,oh yeah and it does n't have,oh my goodness and my friend
1,this movie has a lot of action and some good fight scenes,this is a movie for everyone who likes the first two films or
1,the movie has some of its most memorable moments and is a bit too long,the film is a very good one and it 's not a bad film but i
1,the film has a very interesting plot but i think the director and director should have been allowed,the movie is a very good one and i would recommend it for anyone interested in history
1,those of us who have seen a lot of the series will probably find,those who have n't seen any movie in the series should see this
1,to say the least i do n't want to,to me it was n't a great film
1,the movie is about as good an experience as it could,the story is simple but it 's not the story
1,i was surprised to find this film in a video store with my friends,i think this is the worst film i have had to sit with
1,and that is a shame because it was a very poor film that was n't worth the wait and it would be a waste,and the acting is so bad i have to wonder if the actors were reading the scripts of the script or the director
1,in a nutshell this is the worst thing i 've ever seen in any movie,in the first part we have a group of people that are not very well developed
1,over time i have to say that i 've seen this show a few,over the past few years i have a soft spot on the movie
1,the story is about a man who is a man and a woman who is in his late twenties,the acting and script are very good the actors are excellent especially colin cassel who 's always the best
1,the movie is about a young man named,the movie is a very good movie
1,you 'll have to see the movie to find a way out to see,you know that the story is about a bunch that are in trouble
1,he has been in the business of a serial and is a little over a top drawer,he 's a little too busy to have to make a movie that is n't a complete mess
1,if you have n't seen the movie then do so,if it was n't so bad that they 'd be making
1,i was n't expecting a good movie,i think it 's a great movie and
1,it 's the story of a young,it 's a very good film
1,this is the worst movie ever made and i do not recommend it,this movie does not have a good message and is just a bit too
1,spoilers i have a lot of fun watching this movie and i do not know what to do with the movie i do admire,spoilers ahead i do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you 're a big diehard fan of the original or just do get it
1,screenwriter robert benton is a genius,screenwriter michael curtiz has done the same
1,ricco was a good actor but he was n't convincing in this movie either,ricco is a good film but not as great as some of the more recent
1,this movie is a must see for everyone who,this film does n't even deserve a 1
1,hey the movie does have some of the most ridiculous and unnecessary sequences i ever saw,hey it 's not a good film but a great movie for anyone who wants to be
1,the movie is about a young man who is a teenager and a woman,the story of a young woman in the early age is very interesting
1,fight scenes are not very good but it was n't,fight sequences are very well staged and well photographed
1,but it 's just a fun movie,but the real problem here are they just
1,mexican director michael curtiz has done a good job of,mexican cinema was a very popular and successful film
1,my only complaint with the acting was the fact they are n't given much to say,my favorite parts are the one where the two are in the car with a pair of
1,story of the same thing and it was the first film to make a good movie,story is about two people who are married to each others who have been married to each
1,originally the movie is a complete mess,originally the movie is a bit too long
1,watching this movie i was surprised by how bad a movie is that,watching the movie i felt like it was made by a bunch
1,since the first movie is n't so bad it was good,since the movie is n't a good movie the acting is very
1,the film 's plot is a little confusing but it 's a good thing to see,the story is about a man who is a woman and has the same name
1,those are some things in this movie that are n't funny,those who do not have seen a movie should see
1,i think that it would be better to watch this movie again to understand,i have seen it three times already and it 's still very funny
1,you have the right to see it as the first of the three,you can see the movie in a way that is so bad that i
1,i do n't understand why the people here are so stupid,i was so excited to see this show and the first movie
1,this is one movie that will make people cry,this is a very good show that is a real
1,all the actors were very good and i,all in the background for the story
1,a good movie for the whole family is a great movie,a few scenes of a man walking through the woods
1,most of these films are not so much more but it 's not a bad,most people are saying it 's just a bad movie but it is n't
1,it 's the same kind of movie,it 's the kind i 've come to
1,the story line of this movie was so stupid that you would n't even know what the heck,the story is about a man named owl and his mother and his family and their problems
1,his character has a lot of potential but he does n't seem very convincing and,his performance in the film as the lead actor was also quite well done
1,i think that the film is a great example for,i think the film is a very funny movie
1,510 rated pg13 stars out 10,510 rated r for violence violence and
1,well this is not a movie that i would watch again,well the first time we were n't watching it we were so
1,snobby characters in the movie were not the same as the first movie,snobby and dumber is the story of a woman who is attracted to the
1,the story line is so simple that i have n't seen it since,the acting in this movie is terrible the acting is bad the story is
1,i do n't know if it 's the fact of the matter that it was,i have seen a few episodes of this show and it 's just so good that
1,that said the movie was a waste of,that is what this movie is about
1,it 's a shame the only negatives are not the same as this one,it 's a shame because it 's just a movie with no real plot
1,in the meantime he is given the chance to be the hero,in the end he was the only person who could have been a
1,presumably the film was shot in black and the studio and the studio were trying too to be hip and hip,presumably the film is a bit of a bore but the plot is a bit of the mess of a movie but
1,he 's a great director and he has a very funny cameo,he is the most talented character in the history of the movie
1,doctor sam and his friends are all very funny,doctor and the bandit is a movie that will appeal
1,and the film 's plot is n't as bad,and it does n't matter that this movie was made
1,there are a few things i do,there are some very funny jokes
1,obviously this is not an action flick,obviously the movie has been made by someone
1,the acting in this film is excellent and it is very good to watch,the movie starts off with a bunch in the woods where the two are going
1,john goodman was the perfect choice to be a hero,john huston 's performance as the lead character is also good
1,truth that the film never really does,truth that is so much better than the
1,the film 's premise of an ancient man and his wife is an interesting premise,the film is a complete mess and i think the director was trying too hard to
1,this film is a must see for,this is a very funny film
1,after seeing the film it is a pity because it is a very bad and very bad film with no redeeming qualities,after a couple of hours of watching the show i was n't impressed by the fact the director was in the film for
1,it was a waste for the film,it 's not a good movie
1,at least it was n't a bad thing but the movie was a waste,at least the film was made in the early 90 another 's company
1,che is a master of a nation that is not a human and the world is a very human human,che and his friends and his son and sister are in love with the same old guy but the film is
1,it 's a shame that this movie,it 's a very funny film
1,women are not the same age as the ones that have the,women are n't always a lot of fun to be able
1,the story was a bit confusing,the film is a little slow and
1,basically the movie is a complete mess,basically a lot of people have commented that
1,they 're all a bit like they 're,they 're all a bit too long
1,that 's a very bad thing since it,that was a good way to go
1,klaus kinski is a great actor and is very good,klaus kinski plays the role of a young man who has
1,it has a very funny scene with the main character,it 's not a bad movie but i have a problem
1,throughout the movie the film becomes a bit of an oddity,throughout his life i have been a fan since his father died
1,i have seen this one a number of many months ago,i was so bored that it was so funny and so i
1,that is what i was thinking and it 's the best thing about a film that i have seen in a long,that 's why i think the best part of this movie was the fact i was watching it for 5 hours
1,i think this is a very very bad movie,i have never seen such an act of a woman
1,i think this is a very funny movie that i would watch again for the first time,i was n't impressed by a film like the first one but i have seen a lot worse
1,it 's not a good movie but i think the,it was so much better than it actually was
1,it has the same kind of humor that,it is a great movie to see
1,it 's a very good movie,it 's not the worst thing i
1,as for the rest i was surprised to learn how,as a matter the film is a total mess
1,the acting in all the bad guys is good,the film is a bit of an attempt to recreate
1,i have to admit that it 's a great,i was n't really sure what to expect
1,they have the same idea of the,they 're just plain bad actors
1,the acting in all the movie is very,the acting in the movie was excellent
1,at least the film was a good movie but it is n't,at least the movie was a complete disaster but it did
1,once the story begins we get to see some of these characters and their motives,once the first movie ended you could n't see what the director was thinking
1,for the most part the film is not as good as the first but it has some good action sequences,for those who like to see a good movie that does n't have a lot of fun and action
1,frankie darro is a great actor and he 's very good in his supporting role but this is n't one,frankie 's character has a very good role and the film is quite good and it has some good performances by
1,this movie is a great film that is worth seeing,this was one that was n't really funny at all but
1,campy action sequences and a very good cast,campy and predictable the film is a little bit
1,superman returns is a great movie for everyone who likes a little bit,superman and his family are a bunch of friends who are n't even aware
1,this movie is a great example of why a good film is a good thing,this is a film that should have had more impact on a younger man
1,in fact the whole movie is a mess and i have to say that i have seen it dozens more many times before it 's release on dvd or vhs,in the end it 's a pretty good movie and the movie is a bit slow and boring but that was n't the problem i was getting into the movie with
1,we get a glimpse into the world of the film 's end,we are left with an excellent performance by the young justin mcdowall
1,so the movie was a little bit of a letdown,so if it is n't for the fact it 's a
1,take the movie for a long ride and it,take this one out if only the best
1,the acting in this one is superb,the movie was made up of three stars
1,i think this film has the best performance in the movie but the script and acting,i have n't read the book so much but the movie is not very good
1,all the actors in this movie were great,all i can say are you are not going
1,the acting in general is pretty bad,the acting and directing is flawless
1,as a result the film is a very poor attempt,as a movie i was n't expecting a lot of the
1,with the possible exception of this the film has no redeeming features,with all the hype on the box it 's a shame that they
1,the movie is a very interesting story,the acting is good and the story line
1,this movie has the same plot as the first movie,this movie has a lot going for them but it is
1,the movie is a very good example,the film is a very moving film
1,i have to wonder why i have n't read the novel,i do n't want it to be a good thing
1,as a result of his own life the film becomes a little more interesting than,as a matter of fact i was very surprised that it was n't available
1,starts off with a bunch that is n't going to be a big fan of,starts off with some weird scenes and then some bizarre and gruesome deaths ensue
1,oh and the ending is a little bit,oh and the ending was n't bad
1,so what if it 's a bad thing,so i have to admit that i have to
1,the movie is a complete mess of a,the acting in this film was horrible
1,this movie is one of the best of its genre,this is a movie that you will not regret unless you
1,the story of this is a good one,the movie has a very good story
1,then the film is set up as a comedy,then the movie is set up to make us feel
1,the film has a very interesting story and some of the characters were well developed,the film has some nice moments but it 's not as good as its predecessors
1,there is a very good performance in this movie as it is a film that is not only for people who are interested in the,there is a lot to be said but it was n't a movie that i could n't watch because it was just so bad
1,they are the best and funniest parts about this movie,they are all very different and they 're not really a
1,this was an excellent movie for all the good points,this movie was a complete mess of an insult
1,i think the movie was a waste of time,i think this film is very underrated and i would
1,the story was a bit thin and the ending was too predictable,the film is a bit of fun but it is also the story
1,whether or what the real world is that is the only thing you will ever see of this movie and,whether you can get it or not you 'll be a bit more forgiving of this kind of stuff
1,so the plot is n't too good,so the movie was made for tv
1,he is a very good actor and a good guy who is a good actor but he just did it,he is the best actor ever and he is a great director and he does a fantastic work of the movie
1,i think the director should be ashamed of herself for making,i think that 's why it 's a great film
1,remember the fact that this is the kind one is a very good,remember the fact the film was filmed in the early 80 's
1,first the film was a complete waste,first off the acting was horrible
1,rosanna arquette plays an aging young girl in the first movie,rosanna clarkson plays the part with the best performance and she 's
1,most of them are not funny,most importantly the movie is a complete
1,i was so disappointed that i had n't been able into,i think that the movie is a little too long
1,picard is an excellent actor but i think the,picard and a friend are both the same
1,the acting in all of these films,the movie has an interesting plot
1,documentary has been released in the us for the,documentary style is also used as a backdrop
1,richie is the only character that has any motivation for the whole thing,richie and the other characters are not the same and the same is not
1,but the film is a very good one,but this is a film that is a must
1,secondly this is not the only way of showing the film 's potential for it,secondly i was surprised by how many of the scenes were shot in black in a
1,like the first film this one is not,like i mentioned before the film is very entertaining
1,during the film the viewer was treated by a very young woman who had been in her own home,during his stay at the local hospital he meets his wife and falls for her and decides to go home
1,ultimately it is n't a movie that is not funny,ultimately it was a good movie but it was just not
1,i do n't know what to say about the film because,i was n't impressed when i first watched a movie
1,i have n't been able into this movie since it,i think this movie should be shown on dvd
1,the film 's story line and acting are pretty good,the movie is about a bunch of young people who have
1,that was a very good idea and the film was very good and it is a shame that it did have some good,that 's why the show is not a comedy and the jokes that were in this movie were n't funny or funny
1,technically the movie is a complete waste,technically the acting was excellent and i loved
1,johnny is a man of sorts but he has a small role and is a very likable man,johnny is a great character actor who has no personality and does n't really fit the role
1,this is a movie for all ages and it is worth,this movie is one of my all very favorite movies
1,i do not recommend this film unless you are a hardcore collector 's,i have seen it twice now and still it is a great movie
1,there 's no real plot and the movie is not about the characters or the situations they are,there is nothing to recommend about the film except that there was nothing else in the film
1,they are all so funny and so cute,they were the only ones who had the decency
1,and i do n't think that the director should be able to get into the movie industry,and it 's not that the acting is good the story is n't bad and the actors do
1,boot is not a good movie but the acting is excellent,boot is a movie that i will never forget about
1,i was surprised that the film was not released as a sequel for the first film i have n't heard the title,i have n't read a biography about a man 's book but this one is a perfect example for a movie
1,seidl 's character in the film is the same,seidl has made some good films in recent months as
1,really the film has a very nice cast,really the only thing i liked about this movie
1,in this one he is an actor and a very good man,in the end the movie has a lot of potential and the acting
1,charlie 's character is a bit too unlikable and he has a little too little too much screen time but he,charlie is a man of sorts and is a man who is n't afraid that his wife will be killed
1,in the first movie the characters have been killed by a giant robot that is a,in the meantime he is a little more than he is and his acting skills
1,i do not think that this was a movie made in a hurry,i was surprised to find out that the story is about a man and
1,they have to make the best movie of them all but it,they were n't all that funny but they were very funny
1,codirector james wong howe 's film about,codirector john hughes is a genius
1,all in the family and their friends and the people that made this film,all the actors and crew members have done their jobs well and the film is
1,actually i think the movie is very good,actually i was n't expecting the usual plot line
1,the film has a lot of action scenes and a lot of fun and the ending will make you laugh out,the film has a great deal and the characters seem real but it 's not the best of them all
1,imamura 's adaptation is not a complete loss,imamura 's adaptation of the book of the opera
1,you can see the film in a very different context,you 'll be surprised at how bad this film was and
1,the movie is a little slow but it 's just not that good,the story of the movie and its characters is a little weak
1,well this movie was n't that bad,well the movie is a good one but
1,i was so excited about the ending that i was so irritated that it could n't have been so bad,i have seen this movie twice and i am still wondering how many movies that have come out in the past
1,with the exception the movie is a very good example,with all the other comments about this film i have no
1,here 's another one of those movies that are so good that i have n't seen it since it,here we have the first two of the two movies that i saw and i 've seen it
1,i was n't really surprised by the film and the film did not seem like that,i think the director should have been more interested if he could have used the same director
1,it has been done by the writers of this movie that i 've seen the original,it 's the only movie i saw in the theater that i could have done a lot
1,but it is a good movie to watch and enjoy and it 's not a great movie,but the story is not so good it 's a mess and the acting is n't good at
1,but the film does n't really have much in,but i was n't sure what to say
1,but it 's not a bad movie it is just a bad movie,but the story line is so bad it makes it hard for me and
1,morgan and the gang of thieves and the other two are reunited,morgan is the only person who has ever played a character and is
1,especially the scene where the two men are walking through a crowded mirror,especially the ending is so bad that i could not stop laughing
1,the film is a little bit too slow and too slow,the movie is about a man who kills people in a small
1,i do not know how many times i saw it i was n't sure if it had a,i was n't really sure what was going on and i was bored by the end result
1,it is a very good film,it 's not a movie that is
1,there was a good cast and the actors and actresses,there 's a lot more of the same as the first
1,i do agree with the comments that say that the movie has no real redeeming,i was n't sure whether i should have had more of a better life
1,this movie is a must see if you like the genre of the genre but this is a good film and it is not,this is one of the best of the silent films and it has a lot going on it 's very well done and it 's
1,the story is about a group of people in search of a missing,the movie starts out well but is not really about the story
1,first of all the movie was a waste,first of all i was n't impressed at all
1,originally a movie about two people trying their own way to escape from the woods and,originally i was looking for something to like but i was wrong with the movie
1,john wayne was great in this movie,john wayne 's character in the film is
1,the film is a little slow but that 's it,the movie is a little slow at times and is not
1,i have seen it many times but it was n't,i do n't know how this got a pg rating from
1,and the film does a lot of justice to it,and the acting in this movie is horrible as well with
1,hopefully i 'll get a refund,hopefully the director and director have a
1,it 's just not a movie that,it is the best movie ever
1,i was n't expecting much of a plot and was very pleasantly surprised by the ending,i have never been a fan of the series since the first movie and i have never
1,this is a film that will not appeal to everyone,this is a film for all ages and a mustsee
1,in fact the film 's plot has the same basic ingredients as it does in the first film,in the end the movie has a great deal to it and it has some great scenes in it
1,because the movie has a very low rating and the actors are not really good either,because it is a great movie that 's not just a comedy and a comedy it 's
1,it 's not that i think the film would appeal for children and children but if you are a fan like me i think you might want it to be a bit of an improvement on me because it is a bit of fun,it 's a shame that the film is still unavailable as an adult classic and it 's certainly one of my favorite movies of the 90 's that is a great example to those who are interested into the culture of cinema and are not
1,and the movie is so boring,and it 's the worst movie ever
1,i have never been more disappointed in the film since i saw the movie,i think the director should have been proud to have been a little less interested
1,it 's a shame that it has n't received a score of 2 or higher but that 's a good idea to begin,it 's not that the story line is so stupid and the ending is so predictable that it 's not even funny
1,because of that it 's not a good thing,because the film is not a documentary it 's a
1,for a film about two people who are not very good,for me it was the most boring scene in which the two
1,after a while you have to watch the movie for yourself to watch the first half,after the film ended i was hooked and wondering how much i love this movie
1,i was so impressed when the movie started to be funny and,i have n't read the book but i have to agree
1,i think that the best of this is that it is n't the best movie ever made,i was surprised to find out what the movie was trying for a horror movie that i was
1,i do n't think that the movie is,i think the film was very funny
1,i was expecting something like this,i have to admit that i am
1,yeah it 's a bit slow and the story itself does not work,yeah it 's a good movie but it was a little too long and
1,and that 's what the film is,and the ending is a joke and the
1,innuendos to the viewer that the movie is n't going for,innuendos and not all movies are made for television viewing
1,if the movie does not have the feel of a movie that i have seen the first time and the,if you have n't seen this you 're probably the only people who are n't familiar in the genre
1,is that the best movie ever,is this a movie about a young
1,purgatory has a very good plot and is a great,purgatory is the first movie of a long time
1,michael dudikoff plays a young boy who gets a job in the form,michael moore is one that is a little over a long list of movies
1,she was a little too young and too young to be a good girl,she 's a good actor and a great singer but her role was n't the
1,although i do n't have a clue what to say and what,although it was n't a bad film it is n't bad
1,the acting was horrible the story was awful and there is n't a whole lot to it,the movie is not a comedy or an attempt to make it into something more serious
1,colum 's mother has a crush in her life and the two are in love and they do not seem to have any relationship to their relationship,colum is a good guy and his son and his friends are the only two people that are willing and that is the only reason to see this
1,the story of an aging woman who has a daughter and son in a small village in,the story was so stupid and so lame that i had to turn my eyes in
1,i was surprised to learn how the film,i was so bored to see it
1,he is not a very good actor and,he is also a very talented character
1,anderson 's film is not a great film but a very good one at that with the two,anderson 's character has been a bit too unlikable for his role as the film 's creator
1,the film has no plot no character development,the story line is so bad it 's unbelievable
1,dave is a great actor and a real good man who is a bit too,dave is a man who has been a successful artist for a few years
1,this is a film that will not be,this is not one of those movies
1,the story of the movie revolves on a group of young men who are living in a remote,the acting is good the script well written the story is good and the characters are great
1,the film is a little over rated and the acting by the entire cast,the film is a very funny film and a great movie to watch
1,other than that it is a good film and a very enjoyable movie,other reviewers here seem to think that the film 's main problem is that
1,horribly acted poorly acted and poorly written,horribly acted badly acted poorly directed badly directed
1,with the exception being a great movie it is still,with this movie it 's just a bad movie
1,the story is a little weak but it 's just a little slow and dull,the movie is about a group that is trying and failing in a small part in
1,mike binder has done better work in this movie,mike myers is the most annoying character ever
1,the story was so bad that you would have to be kidding,the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever but i have to say i
1,the film is very slow and boring,the movie was n't so bad it was
1,another thing that bothered us the first was the music and the camera shots,another thing i noticed is the way it was shot on the screen and it
1,it is a very interesting film that is,it 's not a bad film either
1,the movie is a complete waste but there are so few that i could n't stop watching and i was so bored that the movie was n't funny,the story is about a young boy who works in an orphanage and his father is a teenager in his own family who wants his son and his family
1,but the movie is a complete mess,but the film is so boring it hurts
1,an old friend is a man in the city,an example of the classic film is that it is
1,it 's not a bad movie,it 's just a bad movie and
1,with the help and the other side of the law the two are the only one who is willing to go to the police and get,with the title of the movie it is very clear to have seen a movie that was made in 2001 and it is a movie
1,after seeing it for the longest week it still is n't worth the time,after a few years of hearing the music of a song by a young girl
1,they have no clue what their relationship is and,they 're just plain awful as they seem
1,reviving it for a good movie it is very good and it 's a shame because this film is a very enjoyable one,reviving the film is an excellent piece and it has some very interesting moments and is a bit of an ode to a movie
1,by far the worst thing in the entire movie was when it was supposed as if the actors did,by all accounts of the film i have to say that i am so impressed by the story
1,later the film is shot in a beautiful location and it 's a shame that the director never had the courage to use the camera,later in the film he is asked to leave the theater to the police and his son to the hospital where they are forced
1,shot in new york city and the other actors are all good the actors are good,shot in a small town in the south east ireland in a remote desert area the film
1,vance 's character was the only character that was developed to make the character seem sympathetic to the story,vance 's character is a little too unlikable to have the chance of a good guy to do a good
1,it 's not a bad movie,it is a movie about the hardships
1,this is the worst movie i have ever had,this movie is so bad it 's funny
1,i have never been a huge fan of the comics but this one was a real stinker,i was n't really expecting anything else but i was n't expecting much more of a film to
1,played by john wayne is an actor that has to rely on a very difficult role to play the role,played with a great amount of skill by the cast it has the same amount as the other actors
1,i was so excited to find it in my collection,i think that the best of the movie is the acting
1,i think this is a great film,i was surprised that this film has been
1,this movie has a lot more to it than that,this is a film that i can watch for no other
1,she was a little over an average and she did not have a lot in her,she 's a little more believable than her character but her character was so annoying
1,just a few things that make you think of the movie,just as the movie is about as good a crime drama as
1,and it does not have to be,and i have no idea why it was
1,i have to wonder why this movie was made,i was n't expecting a lot of this movie
1,duke and jane have a great chemistry with each other,duke is a young woman who gets a job and is
1,but this film does not make it any less enjoyable or entertaining,but it 's not a bad movie and the acting is horrible and
1,even the most basic plot line is n't really a good one,even though the plot is not the same as it does it does
1,get a lot of money and go and see it,get it out of my head and watch it for the
1,ca all i know that this film will,ca to decipher it 's a movie
1,i do agree with the other reviewers that the film is very,i have to agree the first one was n't that bad
1,casting was good the acting the directing and the writing all in the right way,casting is good the acting is good and it is not just that they 're all
1,i think that the director should stick,i was expecting a lot more
1,never mind it 's the same old story,never really have the courage to do anything about
1,two men are a group in the middle east who are trying their luck,two of the characters have the most memorable moments of the whole movie
1,in a sense that the film has been released in the uk and is now available on video for sale,in the end it 's just an awful film that does n't even make sense and is a waste of time
1,apart from that i was n't sure what to watch,apart from the occasional lack of any redeeming quality this is
1,i do n't think that the film is a masterpiece but it is not,i do not know if the movie would 've been better had i had more
1,while the film is a bit long it is not a film that is n't a documentary,while the story is not as bad and as far as i can remember i was n't expecting
1,fans of the series will enjoy a few more episodes of the show,fans will see it as a very accurate and very funny film
1,by the end of his day the whole thing becomes boring,by the end of it you 'll have to be patient by
1,the story is a little too thin and too contrived to be believable,the movie is very funny and it has a great deal of humor
1,it was a waste of money,it 's a shame the film did
1,in fact this movie is one big tease and that 's not enough,in fact it is not even worth watching for the performances of a very
1,i have seen a lot more of the movies,i was so excited to see this film
1,a lot more than a few people have to have been in the film,a good example of a film that is a waste of time and time
1,from there i was n't surprised to find out that it was n't a comedy and the acting was terrible,from the first scene of the story the film is set in a mansion in the woods of the desert
1,mainly because of the fact the movie has a very low,mainly because of this film 's story and the acting
1,i have n't seen the original movie,i think the movie is a bit of
1,this film was not a complete disaster,this is a film that i would recommend
1,why did they make a sequel to,why do n't they make it
1,i was so disappointed that i was able to find the remote to be so engrossed and,i think that the director and writer were the director and it was a good film
1,watched it and was surprised at the,watched it on the scifi classic
1,how did they get to this,how many times do we see a
1,this film is a must see for everyone,this movie was so awful that i actually laughed
1,where was this movie made me want my time back in,where the hell did the director 's attempt and his accent come
1,the film has some good points to it,the movie is not as funny or as funny
1,now i am not the type person you have to watch but this movie is a complete waste,now the movie has some good points but the story is so weak and so boring that i do
1,it was a great show and i loved how it was made and,it 's a pity that the movie did n't get released theatrically
1,his acting was so good i could n't stand it,his character in a film that has been in a coma
1,if you want a good movie with some of a decent cast,if you have not seen this movie you 're in trouble
1,tom is a great actress who has been in love,tom and jerry is the best of the bunch
1,or maybe the fact that the film,or is he the same person
1,and the movie was n't so good it was a little slow,and it 's a shame that the film is not available on the
1,sure it is a good idea but the movie fails miserably,sure this is a good thing but it was n't
1,the story line was so predictable and contrived that i could not even begin watching it,the story line of the film is the same but it does have some of the worst
1,one day i watched this movie for the first few months of my life,one of the worst movies ever made in the history of cinema but this film
1,she is a good actress and she is perfect,she 's not a bad guy but she 's just
1,bulworth 's character in this film was so bad i almost choked up,bulworth is an excellent actor in the role as the young christy and the
1,although this was not an oscar winner for the film it is n't as much as a horror flick,although the film does n't have a lot of plot holes it is still very good to be a great
1,this is not a film for everyone but for those that do n't know anything about the subject matter of a story of two sisters who,this movie was made by a young girl who is n't even remotely good at her craft but it 's just not a good idea
1,the film has a very good plot line but the movie has no real plot,the acting and directing are all good and i think the actors were very well done
1,i have n't seen the original but still it has a good story and great characters,i have to say this was one of his worst films i had seen it
1,it is a movie about a group who is a bit of fun to watch in,it was n't a bad movie either but i think that is a good thing
1,it 's a pity to see a film that has so,it 's not the worst of the lot of films
1,hogan is a master and a very nice one and,hogan was a great character and i loved it
1,i do not want to spoil anything but that 's why i did n't care what happened next,i do not think that the movie was meant for the kids but i do think it is a
1,with the exception being a good one the acting is pretty bad,with the exception that he is a man he is a master in
1,it has the most interesting and interesting aspects of a classic novel,it 's a great movie that will keep you on a loop
1,are we supposed to believe in him,are we supposed to believe that the real
1,signe 's father is a little bit too old to be taken away from a very good movie but the fact that it is a comedy does n't,signe 's character is so much more than a little boy but the fact that it has been done in a way that makes it more believable
1,although i do n't think the movie could be a bit boring at least not in the least,although i do agree that this is the best movie that has made it out of all of those
1,in the first half hour the movie becomes boring and boring,in this movie we see the two men in a small village
1,greene 's direction is excellent and his direction was excellent and it was a nice touch to be able to,greene 's direction of the film is a bit jarring and the film 's ending was a little unsatisfying
1,the story line is very interesting and the characters are,the acting in this movie are all pretty good
1,this is not an action movie,this was the first of the three
1,we get a few glimpses into a group that is n't even a bit,we are supposed as to be expected to see more than one scene
1,well the first time we see it we have,well it 's a good thing to say
1,follow the plot and you have to see a movie that is not,follow the fleet of the old people and you have the movie
1,naturally the film has no sense of urgency,naturally it 's not a good movie but it
1,there 's also a good deal to make the movie interesting,there is no reason that it will have to be the one
1,it 's a shame that the film has n't got a,it is a very good show and a great one
1,none other then a few of those who have n't seen any of the others,none the better the story is a bit weak and predictable and there is nothing interesting
1,it is a very funny film that is so funny,it 's a shame because the plot is so weak and
1,the story was very interesting and i thought,the movie is not a good movie
1,from this moment i had a feeling of disgust for this movie as i did n't have,from the first scene the film is set and the characters do not seem to care
1,take a few steps to the mix of a good film,take it for the good of this one and the other one
1,i was expecting a lot of the movie but i did,i think the reason i did n't have to watch this movie
1,heck the movie has a lot of good points to it and i think the director,heck this is the worst movie ever made but it 's not that bad either
1,the story line has a lot of twists and turns but it 's not enough,the movie is not about as much fun and as a film of its genre but
1,they have a great cast and a good story,they are the ones that made this film
1,that 's why the show is a little,that was one of my favorite movies
1,despite this film 's plot the film was very good and had a very interesting plot and,despite its shortcomings this film has a lot of fun and the story is pretty decent
1,the film has a very interesting and interesting story that is well,the story of this movie is very similar to the original
1,the movie is a very good one,the movie starts out with a bunch and
1,what a wonderful film this is to the audience,what i liked about this was the acting
1,cut to the top of my list of favorite films,cut out a few minutes before the credits roll
1,it has to do is a good movie but it is not a good movie to watch,it 's a great film for the whole world and should have had a wider audience to the
1,the story is a little too simple for,the acting in the film is superb
1,all in all this is one of my favorite,all the actors are great in this movie
1,i was so disappointed that i had n't read any other reviews on imdb about this movie,i do not know how this movie got such a low ratings but that was it
1,it is not that the movie is bad,it 's just not a bad thing
1,the film is very good in its simplicity,the acting is good and the direction is great
1,but the film is so good it 's almost funny,but it 's a great movie and it is not the
1,people have commented in the movie and i think they should have had more money to pay the,people who are n't familiar and have n't read a book do n't know what to believe
1,at the same time a film that is not so good is the way it is,at one point i had the feeling of being a bit of a fan 's liking
1,to me it is the most beautiful film that i have seen since the last days i saw it and,to be honest it 's a very good movie and a good film for those who want good fun
1,yes i know that i do n't,yes it 's a little corny
1,the story is a bit of a joke but it does n't matter,the acting was n't too great and the acting was pretty weak
1,i think it 's a very nice movie to see,i think the film was shot entirely in the us and
1,the acting and script is a mess but the acting in this one is horrible,the story of a young man 's journey into the world where he is being held
1,there was also an interesting story line,there 's no reason for this to have
1,if you 're looking forward to a good action film with plenty of,if i were to give this film a 1 i would have
1,but i do not think it is that,but the film is a little slow
1,nothing is a little bit of an action movie,nothing really happens to be in this movie
1,the acting and the script are very good and i,the movie is a bit of a mess though
1,older than the other reviewers here i 've seen this movie and it 's a great film,older brother 's sister and the family are in their home and are forced to go to school
1,they 're all very good and are n't very good either,they have the same problem as the first one and the same
1,also the film 's plot has a few interesting twists,also i do n't think that the actors were able to
1,but the film is a complete waste,but it was n't the worst movie that
1,wow this is a movie for kids,wow i have seen this movie and i
1,i was so disappointed by the movie and it was n't,i think this is one of the worst shows ever
1,due the other comments i have read on here that the movie was a bit slow at times,due for the film 's success this film is a mustsee for anyone interested in history in the united
1,i'm a big fan and i have to agree with,i'm not sure why i did not like that
1,jeff goldblum is excellent as the lead,jeff goldblum plays the character with a very
1,ther 's the only reason to watch it,ther is a lot of fun and a few
1,arriving at his destination the other night is a very funny movie,arriving in this film i have a feeling of gratitude for it
1,talk of a movie that was a lot more fun to watch but i did not think it would be so good,talk of caution is one that i would love for anyone who has n't seen a movie about the evils and prejudice in
1,besides the acting is the worst,besides it is n't that funny
1,not only is it so bad it is n't good,not to mention the acting is bad and the plot is
1,at the beginning the film was made up a little over the years but the film is still,at first i thought the movie was going to end with the main theme of the story
1,sorry to see this movie was n't the worst movie,sorry to say this movie is a little slow
1,it was the first film to be made in the past decade,it 's not the best of all time it 's just not worth
1,a few minutes later i saw it again and i,a good film to be seen with your family
1,slasher movies like the ones with the exception that they,slasher fans may be able into the giallo subgenre
1,my favorite scene is when the girl is talking with him on a phone,my favorite scene was the one where he is talking and talks at the phone
1,see it for yourself if you 're looking for,see it if you can get a chance
1,spoiler spoilers i was a little confused about how,spoiler alert the movie was a little slow
1,the story of the movie is a lot better,the story is simple and the characters and the story
1,this is one of the few movies,this was a very funny film
1,well it has a few good moments but,well the movie is about a bunch
1,the acting and the script are very poor and it has no,the story is simple but there are many twists and turns
1,my friend and i rented the movie,my only complaint is that it is so
1,the story is a little thin and is n't a good thing,the acting is good and the story is very good for its own
1,however it 's not the best,however the story is a little weak
1,the film is about a woman who is attracted by her son to be a woman to,the movie is a very good example of how the film is set in an era
1,i'm not sure if it was meant for the younger,i'm a fan of this show and it shows
1,while i do n't know how it is in the movie it is n't a movie about it,while i do not like the movie it 's not as good or interesting as the original
1,as for the rest i would n't be allowed by the movie,as i mentioned earlier i was not expecting much from the film but
1,ulysses 's character was so stupid and stupid that he had no personality,ulysses is the best character in all of his films that he has ever
1,why is the director 's cut to a movie that has nothing,why does the movie have so few positive reviews on it
1,but i was not impressed by this,but the film is a complete mess with
1,having said all of it i have to admit that this is a good family movie,having a child who is a child and the mother is so much more interesting
1,the movie has a lot of problems with the plot and the acting,the acting is good and the story is very simple and believable
1,i think it was a waste of time and time,i think this was a very good film and i would
1,this movie is a great example,this movie is a must see
1,also i do n't think that it would have been a better film,also i do n't think the director could have made it a much better
1,maybe it would 've been better but the movie is so bad it makes you wonder if you 're,maybe the movie was a bit long but i do think it is a little bit too short
1,with a lot of good things happening on screen this is a movie that should be seen by anyone looking out,with a lot better to do and the story line would have been a lot more interesting if it was n't a
1,they are not even the slightest bit funny,they are all very good in their roles and
1,but the real problem is that the movie is n't even remotely entertaining,but the story is so simple and the acting is so bad that it
1,no one can be trusted and he is n't a good guy but his character does not seem to be,no matter what the characters and the plot line are all the same it 's a very interesting film
1,fans will be disappointed by this film,fans will see this movie as a comedy
1,but i think this is one film i would n't want my money to be as good as i would have liked it,but the film is a bit too slow at times and it really feels as if they are trying too hard to create a
1,i'm not going and the film is not as good,i'm not saying that this is a good film
1,through this movie i thought i was going to get to the end and i was surprised,through a series of coincidences and a few other things that are n't really explained or answered in
1,this film was a waste of time,this was the first time we saw a
1,a good cast of supporting actors including the talented cast,a lot happens in the movie that i 've seen and
1,but the story is not as bad as it should have been,but it is not the same thing with this movie and the whole
1,i do not know what to call it that is the worst movie,i was surprised to see that it is a very good film
1,i do n't understand why this is n't available on video,i was n't really expecting anything else but i was n't disappointed
1,it 's not a movie that you will enjoy,it 's just so bad that it makes it impossible
1,its a very funny film and the acting is great and the,its just the same thing with the same exact same story
1,however the film is n't so bad as to,however the film is not a bad one
1,he is a very talented director and a good writer,he is the most talented actor i have seen
1,oh and the ending was so stupid and stupid that the movie was,oh and the scene with the girl in the bar is priceless
1,this movie was a waste of time,this is a movie that you can watch
1,the movie is a little over the heads,the acting in this film was terrible
1,he is the only person to die,he is the most beautiful and talented actress
1,there was a lot more to it than the original and it 's still,there 's a lot going for it and it has some nice twists
1,the acting and direction are very bad and there are no special moments,the acting was good and the plot was pretty decent for an independent movie
1,i was n't impressed at all the fact that it had a few good actors,i think it 's a very bad film and should be avoided by everyone who has
1,the film has a lot going on in the way of a good story and the acting and acting,the film 's story is about an evil killer who kills a bunch of kids and kills them for their
1,then again what do i know it is,then the film is a bit of a bore
1,usually a bad movie is the worst thing i 've ever,usually the movie does n't work for a long period
1,the film has a few funny moments and a few,the acting and direction of the movie is excellent
1,when i saw a movie i could not understand the plot and the characters,when he 's in his place the movie starts to be about a man who
1,it is n't a bad movie it,it is not a bad movie
1,it is a movie that you can sit down and watch and enjoy it,it is n't a bad film but the acting is good the story was good
1,stan laurel and his wife are all excellent,stan is an excellent actor and he is great
1,i think that the director 's intention of obligated the story to be a little,i do n't know if it was a good idea to make a movie
1,many people have complained about this show,many of them were so funny and so
1,i was so disappointed when i first saw this movie,i was so bored by the movie that the movie was
1,i'm not sure what to say about the film,i'm not saying that this is one of those
1,quite frankly i think this is a very good movie,quite frankly i think the movie is just too much for
1,a lot more than the sum of their careers it was the most popular movie in my opinion,a good film for those who enjoy good films with lots and plenty of laughs but no thrills and
1,i think the reason why i give this movie 2 is that the acting,i was so disappointed that i was so bored to watch this film
1,in fact the film is a bit of an action film and a bit too long and too predictable,in a nutshell the story is about a young woman who lives with a young woman and a young girl
1,he is the only one who has a shred of talent,he 's a little stiff at the time but he is not
1,the story is simple and the characters,the film is very well directed
1,this film does n't have a good deal but its a great movie and the acting was good,this is the first film that has been made in recent years as a director and it was nominated
1,but it 's not that i have a problem with the movie 's plot and,but the film is so good that the movie is a little too slow
1,and i think the film 's best scene is the,and the film has the same kind to say
1,most movies are not funny and they are n't even funny or funny,most movies do n't have the same theme as the original but it does
1,character actor is very good and he,character studies are always the same
1,its a great show to show the kids that they,its not even that bad it was n't bad
1,outsiders and dolls alike are n't funny and the plot is a,outsiders have no qualms that they are not in the movie
1,if you are a diehard collector of the original series you might enjoy this film,if it had n't had been made in the first place i would n't want it
1,i was surprised by how the director managed the book,i was n't really sure whether to laugh at a bad
1,is this supposed for a reason,is the story of an innocent family
1,a good film to be seen,a lot of the humor in it
1,finally the movie is n't a comedy but it is a good movie,finally i saw the movie in an interview with the other reviewer on a
1,also the ending was pretty lame,also i do not know what to
1,well i do not think that this was a good movie,well it 's a movie that will be a cult film and
1,in the first movie he was the one that had a lot of potential,in fact the only thing good about the movie was that it did not have
1,there 's no reason for it to go to a movie with no real reason,there 's no real reason to watch this film unless you 're a fan or someone
1,yeah the movie is n't that good,yeah i 've been a fan for a
1,even when the movie was made i thought i was going through the motions of,even the acting is n't that horrible either as a result of the script
1,oh and it 's a shame that the director never got a job in it to make it,oh and i was n't expecting the usual suspects to be the same as the one in this movie
1,in the first part the movie was filmed and filmed,in this case the film is very good but it is
1,spoiler spoilers ahead i was a bit surprised by the fact,spoiler spoilers i was a little confused about this one
1,lucy 's mother is the daughter of the family who is also,lucy is the only person who has a crush on her
1,for a while it was a good idea and the film is a good example,for the rest i was a bit skeptical that the film had been made
1,power and prejudice are the only ones that are not as powerful as the first one,power of the universe is an excellent and very moving movie that is worth watching
1,rent it if it is in english and,rent this movie and watch the movie
1,i do n't think i have seen this movie in a week,i think the movie was a waste and the acting is worse and
1,i was n't expecting much from a movie that,i have never heard of this movie before
1,while the film is a little bit of fun it 's still a very good film and a very enjoyable experience for those who love to see it,while it 's not as funny and as funny and the whole movie as the original was it was n't really a bad thing but it did have a
1,he 's not the only one to blame him but the rest of us will be able to see the movie,he was the only one that had a good time to make it and he was a very nice person
1,it is not a film that i would n't have missed but it 's still very good and the story of the movie,it 's the same kind of movie that is so stupid and so stupid and stupid it 's almost like a parody of the
1,another problem i had with that was that it did get more and more boring,another problem i have with this movie is that i was n't able to see the
1,terrible acting terrible script and terrible acting and,terrible movie that i would n't recommend
1,on the plus the movie is a bit too slow for,on top of that the movie has an interesting premise
1,either a man or an idiot,either the writer and writer of the
1,the movie has some nice twists and turns,the acting is very poor and the story just
1,why is it so bad to watch this movie,why is it that this is a movie
1,soft and cold and the other is the fact the movie is set up in one scene,soft porn fans and critics who want to see the real movie of the 70s will probably enjoy
1,is it a comedy or is it a drama,is it a bad film that i have to be
1,ben stiller is a good actor as the villain,ben stiller and his team are a hoot and the
1,how can you have such an enjoyable movie that you have,how can anyone tell you that it was a movie
1,the acting in this movie is terrible,the movie is a bit of a mess
1,for those of all accusations the film 's message is the fact the director was,for the first half or two years the film is a little more enjoyable
1,this film was made for the sole purpose that it is not,this is a film that should have been avoided at any cost and
1,when he finally meets his father and the two men he is reunited with a man who is a bit more than he bargained for,when you 're not a fan of movies that are made you think you 're not going to get a chance to see this film in
1,it is not that bad or so but it does n't matter that,it 's a shame that this movie has been so much better
1,they are not in their midtwenties,they 're all very good in this
1,this is one of the worst i have,this is not a film for everyone
1,how many times can you get a good idea for the movie,how did the guy who wrote the screenplay for the film was so
1,we 're told by some of his friends to find the killer,we get to know what the movie is trying and it does n't
1,all i can say about it is how do you get,all the actors are great especially the two lead actors
1,this was a movie about a group of young adults,this is the best movie ever to have seen
1,the story is simple and the actors and actresses,the film is a complete waste of time
1,this is the first of three movies that have been released in the past 10 years as one of my favorites,this movie is a complete waste and i think it 's a shame that the producers did n't make a movie like
1,this movie is one of my favorites,this is the best movie i have ever
1,amazingly it has been a very good movie and i think it would have made it more enjoyable if it was n't,amazingly the film does a good job at showing the struggles of both sides of the war in which they live
1,his character is a bit of an,his character was not the same
1,powerless is one of his best films,powerless to get the job to be in
1,like many other films the movie does have a very interesting story,like the other reviewer mentioned this is not a movie about the holocaust
1,his performance is very good but the script and acting are poor,his character was a bit too much and he was too old for
1,imagine this movie and you have to watch a,imagine the film is not for the masses
1,i was n't impressed by the fact that i had seen the original film and,i do n't know if i can find a copy to buy the soundtrack
1,this was the first film i saw that made it look interesting,this is the kind that the movie is not so good
1,for those who are interested in the subject you will probably be confused by the fact that it is a film that has a few good moments,for a long time in a movie i was n't sure how this movie could be made but i think it was one that had been done in
1,the acting was terrible the script is awful,the film is a very good one
1,at least the movie had a lot more to offer,at first i thought it might be a good idea to
1,my friend who has seen the film is a little confused about the film,my favorite scene is when the girl is lying and says oh my mom and
1,i think the film is a little bit too slow and the story was too predictable to follow the plot line,i have to wonder if the movie was a little too long and i do n't know why the hell is so
1,the film is a complete mess,the acting in this movie are horrible
1,more than just an old man with a gun,more than just a bad guy who is a bad
1,he is a very good character actor and,he 's not even a good person
1,while i do agree the film is not the worst of its kind it was still pretty good,while the film has a lot of action and a few good scenes it 's still a very funny
1,i have seen this movie several times and it was great to,i think this is a great film for the entire family
1,the story is about a bunch of people who have been living in the middle of their own lives and,the story of a woman who is a woman and a woman who 's being raised by a man
1,but the film 's biggest flaw is that it does n't have to rely too much for its own plot,but the film 's only flaw in the film was the ending and the fact it was a sequel
1,there 's also a scene where she is trying and her friend 's death is so stupid and i have never seen,there is a lot more of a story to the story but this is the kind of movie you can watch
1,the film 's premise of this movie is that a,the movie was a waste and it was n't
1,when i first saw this movie i was in awe of the characters and the plot,when you watch a film that is a masterpiece and a movie you can see the influence
1,the movie was made in a hurry,the acting in this movie is terrible
1,for a movie that is a little bit of an exercise in this,for the rest it 's a little slow paced and very funny
1,if you are not a big fan of hers you will probably be bored with this,if you want the movie you will love this movie and will definitely recommend it
1,but this is not the case,but the story is not so much
1,i'm glad i did not get this movie on dvd,i'm not saying that it 's a bad film
1,this is the worst movie ever made,this is the kind that i would n't
1,while the plot is somewhat thin and the characters and situations remain unexplained there is no way it can be a good film,while the film was n't a good film it is still a good film to see if you 're a fan 's
1,a few years after the release i was a bit skeptical that this movie is not a good film and it 's,a lot of it is filmed in a very small town where people are talking and talking about the same thing
1,some have said it 's a bit of the,some scenes were just a lot of fun
1,featuring the usual hollywood fare of the late seventies and 70s the film is a bit dated,featuring the cast and a cast of actors this movie has the best acting ever assembled
1,but the film does not work as a drama,but i think it is the best of its kind
1,it has a great cast and it 's a good family comedy that is,it has a lot to offer but i do not recommend watching it
1,it has a great story about a young man who gets involved in the murder,it 's a shame that this movie is not available for sale as it is a
1,i think it is a shame because it is n't as good or better than most of it 's sequels but it 's,i do not recommend this movie to everyone unless you are a hardcore fan of hers and have seen the original movie
1,the movie is a complete bore that is n't even remotely,the film is a complete waste of time and money
1,at least the actors were not in it,at the end i felt compelled to write the
1,i have n't been in high school since,i do n't know what the appeal of the
1,one can see the film in its entirety,one of the few things i found funny is
1,i do not think that this film,i have seen it several times
1,the story of this story was a bit thin but that 's about it,the acting is pretty poor the script was horrible and the story was n't even
1,but the movie does n't work at the expense of its own,but it 's a great movie and i would love to see a
1,i do n't think that the movie has been a success,i have n't read the novel but this movie was not a
1,wow i was so excited when i saw,wow the movie was n't so great
1,that said it was the most expensive of all,that is the only thing that made it so good
1,the story is about a group of four friends,the film is a complete waste of money
1,they 're all in the movie,they 're just not the ones that
1,reign of darkness is a film with a lot of good ideas and a good cast,reign of terror is a film that will be remembered for many reasons and is probably the
1,as a result i found the movie to be a complete waste for my precious life and i do agree,as the movie opens the story becomes increasingly convoluted and the characters seem like the story of a young man trying
1,heaven and i do n't think i 'll watch it again,heaven was a great show for a rainy afternoon but not as
1,the movie was a little slow at first but the acting was so good that you could not see it,the movie is a very good movie with a lot going for them and it 's a good one to look
1,by now we have to be a bit of the smartest thing that has ever happened,by the end the story is very weak but the movie itself is n't bad either
1,by the end i was n't expecting to be scared but the movie,by far the worst movie ever made in the history of cinema
1,beware of a few of the other films in which the director and director,beware of this movie i have to say the movie was so good
1,the movie was n't a bad idea but the acting is pretty poor,the acting was horrible but the story is very good and there is some
1,nevertheless this was a good film for me,nevertheless i was surprised by this film and i
1,yeah this is a great story about a,yeah the movie was a little slow
1,madison is a great actor and i really hope he gets a chance on this one because he has done a good job,madison 's father is the son of a rich man and his son is killed by his father and son who is now a
1,by the way the story is a complete bore,by the end of the movie i felt like i
1,this is a movie for all ages and a great movie that deserves to die,this is not a film for everyone who is a fan of musicals and a few
1,it 's a pity that it was not made for tv as it is a very enjoyable movie and a good one,it 's the same kind of thing you have seen from the first film but this one is just plain bad with no
1,how many times do they have the,how can you make this movie
1,i think the director was trying to get to a,i do agree that the acting is very good
1,i have n't read a novel so much as the book is based on the novel by the author of a book,i have seen a lot more movies in my time and this movie has a good cast and a lot more
1,consolation the only thing you will notice is when you have the movie 's title,consolation that the film is n't as bad it is not a great film
1,oh my i was a little confused at the time and the,oh and it was a great film that was so funny
1,virtually every scene was a joke,virtually every character in this film is
1,this film was a waste of a few hours and i,this movie has a very good story and a lot
1,i was surprised to find that the movie was not as good as the first,i do n't know what to do with my money but it is n't
1,if you have n't read the book you 'll probably have a very difficult,if it was n't so stupid it would be a little more interesting
1,the film 's main character is an unlikable man who has been killed by an accident,the acting is good and the direction was very good and the acting was good enough
1,after all the movie was made in the 80 minutes i had the feeling of being in the,after all these years i have n't seen the film but this film was a total disappointment
1,her character 's performance is very good,her character has a lot in common
1,is it a coincidence to see the same movie in my life,is it a good thing for someone to make an attempt to make
1,a lot more of the same can not be said with the movie 's,a very interesting story about a young girl in the middle of nowhere
1,snoop dogg was great as a cop who was a little too old for the role,snoop 's character has no depth or reason whatsoever and is not given any chance by the
1,true this is not a bad movie it,true the film is not a comedy
1,halfway in his life is the story that he has to overcome and the way he,halfway through this film i was wondering if this is a good film or not
1,this is one film that i would watch over the past few,this is not the worst movie that you have to offer
1,you 'll be glad i did not have this,you know that the movie was n't a comedy or
1,dad is an old man with no redeeming features whatsoever he,dad 's wife and daughter are in their late twenties
1,while this is a true gem it was not the same movie with the same exact plot,while the story is n't a good one it does n't have much to say in the end
1,i was so disappointed that i could have been watching it for a while,i do agree with most other comments that this is a movie about a young
1,the movie is a little bit of an insult,the film was shot in a very cheap manner
1,columbo is one who has a knack for getting rid of his family 's problems,columbo is one of my favorite actors and he 's a good actor but i do
1,it 's not the worst of the lot but i think it would have had a lot to do with it,it 's a shame because it 's a little bit too long for the rest of the movie but it 's not
1,i have seen a lot of movies in them and,i was expecting a lot more than i was
1,can you say that the only good thing is the acting,can anyone please save this movie for a total total disaster
1,what i found interesting though is that it was not a comedy,what i got is the same feeling of a movie that is a
1,the film is a complete mess and the acting was terrible and the story was a complete waste,the acting was n't bad but the acting is n't that great the story is just a little weak
1,this is a movie that you should watch and you will see,this was a very poor film and i was n't impressed
1,solid acting and a good script and a,solid acting and a good story line

1,and the movie has no redeeming qualities,and the film has a great deal of
1,the acting was terrible the plot was ridiculous the acting was awful and it was n't a good idea at that,the story is simple but it 's not a good film and the characters are not developed in the slightest
1,i was surprised at all this,i think that this is one movie
1,but this movie was just awful and i,but the story is n't that bad
1,i do n't know how to describe a movie that,i was so excited when i heard about it
1,the movie has the feel to the movie but i did,the movie was shot at that point of the film
1,it is not a film that is n't even remotely funny and is,it 's a shame the rest of us did n't like it
1,william powell plays the part with the character of the young woman who 's been a bit of,william holden was the most convincing character of the movie but he is n't a good actor
1,other people who have been in the theater know,other than this the movie is a mess
1,nevertheless i would like this film for anyone,nevertheless it 's the worst movie ever
1,the story is simple and it 's,the film was shot on location
1,holmes is a man of honor and a man,holmes 's performance as the lead is a bit jarring
1,the story is about a group called a group of four who find themselves stranded,the acting and script is horrible but this movie is n't even worth watching
1,this movie has no real story line,this film is a great example of how
1,alice has a very difficult marriage to her,alice is a young woman and she 's a
1,if you want something different than this is the film for everyone who loves the first film or the original,if i had n't been a little less concerned with the plot the film would 've been a better movie
1,nonetheless this is a movie for those who,nonetheless the movie is a little slow
1,i think it 's a very good film,i have to admit i was a fan and
1,it was a good movie but i was wrong,it is the worst movie i have ever seen in
1,aside from the fact it is a film about a young woman,aside from a few moments the film is not worth watching
1,a lot happens in this film,a very interesting film and a great
1,our hero is an antihero and the person he met in a very brutal way,our hero is a young man who is sent to the united kingdom to get to
1,they are both a great movie and i recommend it,they are the ones who are not in the least bit
1,it has the feel of one of those movies that 's so funny,it is a shame that the movie is n't available on dvd
1,tim roth was the most annoying in the movie,tim robbins is the perfect choice of the character of
1,hey the film 's plot summary was n't that good but the,hey this is the worst film of the last few years
1,does it have to go to a very different,does he have a good time with him
1,the story is a little weak but,the story line is very interesting
1,however the movie is n't really a good one at all it is,however the film 's biggest flaw is that it is so boring
1,in this case the movie is about the man who has a,in this one he is not a very good character actor
1,a few of the actors in this film are a bit over here,a very funny scene in a nutshell that is the only thing i have
1,babenco 's film was a bit of an achievement but,babenco 's direction and the cinematography are very good
1,i think that the director was trying to create a film that was so bad,i have never been a big fan of the series and was not surprised that the
1,set in new zealand city and the film 's title sequence is set in a futuristic mansion with an intriguing backdrop of its,set on the small screen in the early seventies and 70s it 's a very nice film and i recommend this movie
1,what 's the deal in this film is it,what is the difference between these two movies
1,for me the only good thing i can think of is how the movie is n't going to be a classic of a film but the fact is that it is not,for those of you who have seen this movie you are in for the hell that you will have a lot of money for a movie that is not so bad that it
1,it 's just that the movie was so boring and,it is a movie that is so much fun
1,a few years later i saw this movie in the uk in the uk and was very impressed and,a very enjoyable film and i hope that the director will make more films than it is for
1,were we to believe the director had a vision of the story of the movie,were we supposed as to be objective to see how it was supposed or to be
1,directed by steven soderbergh the director is also the director 's first directorial achievement of this film,directed by the director of a film like the first film and the second is one of the
1,with a lot of great actors and great music this was a film for you to,with all of the above mentioned the movie is not a bad one at all
1,hap 's character is not the most interesting and the characters in this film seem to have been lost,hap is a very good actor and i really hope that his career was wasted on a lot
1,the movie is about a bunch,the story of the movie was so
1,over the course of a week i was n't a fan of the movie but i thought it was pretty,over the top and a little bit of nudity the film has some of the funniest scenes ever captured
1,the movie is very good in a good sense,the film has a very good cast and a good
1,and the film is so bad,and that does not mean it 's
1,does it have to be that the only person,does anyone know where the film is going
1,italian director sergio corbucci is the director of his work,italian director david lean is a very funny director and a
1,which is the only good thing about the film and the fact is it 's a,which is a pity as the plot was pretty weak and it was just boring
1,i have n't seen a lot in the past,i was n't expecting a lot from him
1,she is a very talented woman and her husband is a good one,she is the only person that can be blamed on the film
1,this was a movie that could be,this film was a complete waste
1,as for the film i think it is the worst movie ever,as for me the film is a complete bore that the viewer will
1,orlock 's character is so stupid it,orlock was a very good guy
1,the movie was n't a complete success it was a very good movie and i liked it,the story of a girl who has been kidnapped by her husband and is forced into prostitution is
1,who cares about the story in the first movie and then you have the makings of what is going,who cares about the fact of the matter that the film was shot on location at the time
1,when i watched the first episode it was a little bit of fun to watch,when the film was made i thought i would have been a little confused
1,it 's a very funny show that,it 's a very good film
1,with a few exceptions i was surprised to find it 's a little more enjoyable than,with all of this you 'll probably know that it is a very good show
1,edwige fenech was a good choice to watch her,edwige nachle is a good example of how to make
1,this is a movie i would recommend to anyone who enjoys the genre,this film has a very good cast and is very well done
1,bracco and dunne are the main stars of the,bracco is a very beautiful and sexy lady
1,i think it would be a good idea to make an observation to make an attempt to make a movie,i was surprised to learn this was not as good as i expected and it was a little disappointing to be
1,just as a movie about an evil murderer and his girlfriend 's daughter and,just as the film was made it 's not even worth a look
1,but the real star of this movie was that the movie is so bad,but the story is a little weak and it is n't a good film
1,with this show he is a great actor,with the help from the two leads the film
1,next the film was shot at the same time,next time i watch it i have a soft spot
1,i think the reason i was watching the,i have n't seen this movie yet
1,the acting is good and the story is very good,the story was so bad that it was almost laughable
1,joan cusack is a great actress and is very good,joan blondell was excellent and her acting was excellent
1,she 's a good actor who 's,she has a lot of fun
1,the movie is a little slow at the start and,the acting is good and the script is good
1,the movie starts with a group of friends in a small village who lives with each others and then stumble upon a,the story is simple the characters were believable the plot is a bit thin and the story is n't very original
1,be warned if you are a fan or,be prepared to watch a good movie
1,the film has a lot to say about the,the acting and the story are just awful
1,that is the most obvious aspect of this movie and it 's the worst movie i 've seen in my life,that is the only way i could get the soundtrack on this one and the dvd version of it is very good
1,i was expecting a lot more from this one but it,i do not know why i did n't get it
1,the movie was a complete waste of time and money,the acting was n't bad but it was just awful and
1,tony leung and james cagney were great,tony is a very good movie
1,it 's the kind you can watch,it 's a shame that this movie has
1,lots of action scenes and a lot,lots and lots of blood and a few
1,this was a movie i would n't recommend watching,this film was a waste of money on a rental
1,it is the best of the series,it is a great movie that i would
1,i think it is one of those movies that is n't even a,i do agree to give this movie an 8 out of 10
1,above all it is a great film and i recommend it,above that i think this is a very bad show
1,i have seen the film several many times,i think the director was a genius
1,nice to hear the song of the song,nice to know what i was looking forward to
1,it 's not a bad movie but it 's still a great,it is not a film for the faint of the viewer
1,i do n't know what to say but i do,i do think that the acting is pretty good
1,very little of the story is told,very good movie with good acting
1,unfortunately i did find it very entertaining,unfortunately the movie is a mess
1,the film is about a group of people trying their best and the world is not only in the hands,the movie is about the man and his wife being kidnapped by one of the killers in the movie the two
1,here 's a film i would have done without any redeeming features and the story was n't so,here 's a movie you can watch with the lights off your ears to get a laugh
1,if you 're looking to see a good movie with a good plot and a good script then this one 's not for,if you want to make a good film that is not so good it should n't even have the impact on it
1,not only does he have to make,not to mention the whole cast
1,this is one movie where the story of the first movie is about a,this is a very good film and it is a very good movie
1,find the right way to make it into a movie with a good cast,find the film and you will find yourself wishing that it was not
1,although the film is not as much as the original the film does n't have much in the way for it,although i do not agree with the other reviewer that i 've never seen the movie the original version is a very
1,this was a movie that was a huge success,this film was a complete waste of my time i
1,ok so it 's a pretty good movie but it is,ok the movie does contain lots of action and suspense
1,but it was n't a movie,but it 's not the worst film
1,the acting and directing is flawless but it is not as good and as it is,the film 's story follows a group who are stranded in a deserted apartment building
1,i do n't know how many times he has been in,i do n't know why i was watching the movie
1,this movie does n't have to rely on the fact it,this is one of the worst i 've ever seen
1,the movie is a very interesting one and the acting is superb but,the story is very simple and it is a very good movie
1,the movie is a little bit of an exercise in the way that the film takes its own life and it 's,the film was very good and it 's a shame that the film did not get a wider audience to see
1,and i do n't think i 've seen any of these,and it 's not even the worst movie ever made
1,i have never heard of this film before,i have n't read many of these books but
1,is it that a movie like that,is that supposed to mean something about a
1,in fact it is not even that bad,in a way this is a good film
1,she 's just a little too young to be the best actress in this picture and i,she was a great actor and i was surprised to learn that she had to act
1,there are a lot to admire this show,there 's no plot and there was no character
1,here he plays an obnoxious and egotistical character,here we have two very talented characters
1,everyone is entitled and it 's not even the case that this movie is about as far as the movie goes,everyone in their family was a little too much and i could n't help but laugh and laughed at the antics of
1,the film was shot with the intention of being a very,the acting was good enough with the script and acting
1,the story is about a young girl named caroline and her son,the story line was very interesting but not in a good way
1,he was a little more convincing in,he was a very talented character
1,the acting is horrible and i 've seen,the acting is horrible the script worse
1,one thing that i found most irritating about this film was the lack the depth of the character and the plot was so stupid,one of the most interesting things to come about the film was that it was a movie about a young woman named becky
1,i was so bored by that,i do agree with the other comment
1,there was n't a single scene in which the two men are killed by their,there is nothing to be said about this movie it has a good cast
1,this film is a must see for,this movie is a great movie
1,this is not one of them,this is a movie that i think
1,none of the characters are likable and the film lacks any,none of the actors in this movie are very good
1,guy ritchie was a very funny guy and i liked it a lot and i really enjoyed it but,guy is n't the only character who is a real person but he does have a great voice
1,fabian is a young man and he 's not the one to be,fabian and company do n't seem to be a threat to the story but
1,but i think the movie was very funny,but the movie is so boring that it 's
1,all in all i would like to thank you,all the characters in this film were very believable and
1,i'm a fan of this show,i'm a sucker for a good movie
1,getting it out on dvd and you 'll be hooked in the end,getting to the bottom line of this mess is the bad guy
1,the acting is horrible and there are some very bad performances,the story line has all sorts of elements of a story about
1,consider the fact the director wanted to make a sequel with,consider that this film will be remembered as a classic
1,sean astin is the best actor ever,sean connery plays his role as a man
1,anyway the film has a lot of potential but the acting is pretty good,anyway this film is a total mess with a lot of wasted opportunities to be
1,i think it is a shame that,i think that 's a shame
1,everybody in their lives and the other characters in,everybody in this film is just plain stupid
1,when i saw the movie i was a little sceptical about how the movie was made and the way the characters interact with the characters and their motivations,when the film is over and the actors are all trying their hardest to get their hands off the screen they are able at the camera work
1,it 's the story and story lines,it is not even worth watching
1,it 's a very good movie and i recommend this movie to anyone with great knowledge for life 's,it 's a very good show and it is a shame that the film has n't been released
1,now that i have seen it you,now i do n't know why
1,the film is not a bad film and it is not a movie that makes,the film is not a bad movie but a good film to look at
1,he 's just a bit too old,he 's a very good guy
1,some have commented that the film was made for the sake that it was a little too long,some of the scenes are just plain boring and i do n't think they could even make a film
1,both are a good movie to watch,both the film 's characters are very interesting
1,he 's just a bad guy,he is also the only character in
1,he 's not the only actor in the whole movie that 's a real loser to watch and a good guy,he 's a little more than just a bad guy who gets to the bottom of his lungs to a t
1,maybe it was because i was n't too young to be,maybe it would have made the whole thing more interesting
1,here 's a list of reasons to see a movie that 's a little too long,here 's the breakdown i was looking at this movie and it was n't that good
1,i do not want the audience to be able to sit down with my parents to see this show,i think that it was a waste of money on a film like the dp and writer who could n't
1,we 're talking to a group of people who are in the same place,we have to wait until we are treated to another of our own favorites
1,the movie is a little slow at times especially in its,the acting is horrible and there are no special moments
1,this is one of the best films ever made,this is the best part of the movie and i
1,one day a woman comes back to a town to find the,one can only hope that they will get a bigger release
1,and i do n't think that the actors were able to,and that 's why the film is a complete failure
1,he 's not the least bit likable,he is a very good actor
1,yet the film is a very enjoyable movie with a great cast,yet it 's a great film and i hope it gets more recognition
1,the movie was shot with a handheld handheld cam,the story is simple but it is not
1,at the end of his life he 's the one to blame the man,at least that 's what it is a great movie that 's just a bit
1,a few years after the release of this show it 's not a great idea for that,a few years ago i saw this film on tv and it was a very pleasant experience and
1,i was so bored by this flick i was surprised by it being a complete rip on,i was surprised to find that the movie is a bit slow and boring at times
1,i have n't read a book that has been made to read the,i do n't understand why the film would get so much publicity
1,francois mclaglen and his crew of the other thieves who,francois ozon 's film is a very good example
1,i was n't expecting much from it,i have to wonder if it 's a
1,limp and boring and a bit boring but still,limp is one of my favorite comedies ever
1,maury blacktop is one of the most beautiful films ever made in my life and i will definitely love it,maury povich 's character is not the most interesting person i can think of and i think that the actors are
1,the movie was shot in a small town in the early,the film is a very interesting and very entertaining one
1,yet it does not have the feel to the film,yet i still have the feeling that it was a good
1,there are some good performances but they are not good actors in this,there 's also the fact that the movie has some interesting elements
1,it 's the story of a young boy who has a dream of being a father and his father 's life,it has a great cast and it is the best thing to come up with a great movie that has the same
1,that said it was not a movie,that was a very good idea
1,it was the first time i have,it 's not a bad thing
1,i was so excited to find this movie on video and it,i think the director should stick with the original book instead
1,the acting is pretty bad and it 's not that great but the acting is pretty good and i really enjoyed this movie,the acting was terrible and there 's nothing to be gained from the actors that are supposed or they do n't even have any
1,i do n't want to spoil the ending but it 's not a good film,i have never seen such bad movies as the ones in which the bad guy is
1,also the scene where he is trying,also the ending is very predictable
1,however it 's not the same,however this is not a film
1,finally there is the fact that the director and the actors are not the only one who could n't act,finally there are some good points of the film that are not the most important of the two stories
1,but the real star of this film has a good supporting cast,but it 's a very good show and it shows how the world
1,the story of an aging woman in a family is very,the acting is good with a few of these actors
1,overall it 's a good movie to,overall it is an excellent movie
1,aside from that the movie is a complete waste for me,aside this is a good movie and a very good movie for
1,the film 's story is a simple one,the film 's premise of an aging man is
1,i have to say that i have n't seen the original version of jane 's version,i do not think that it 's a matter that a movie is about a man who
1,the film 's main weakness is that it is not only an attempt to be funny and it 's a very good,the film is not about a young man who is accused of his own life but is also a compulsive father
1,i do n't think it 's the best of the bunch,i have seen this show twice and will never tire of it
1,i was n't impressed by it but this film was a complete failure,i have seen the movie multiple many years before i have seen it in
1,the story of the movie is a little confusing but it does n't have to be,the film 's plot revolves on two couples in an isolated apartment in the middle and a
1,what 's the point in making a film about,what 's more the acting is so good
1,also it 's a very funny movie with the usual plot twists and twists and characters,also the scene where the two men were sitting through the movie was a laugh to the
1,there are some great performances from the cast but the story line has,there is a very good scene where he is in an elevator
1,the film has some good points to,the acting in general is good
1,inside is the first of a series that features a very interesting and very funny scene in which the two boys are in the car and decide to take,inside the world we have a young man who has been abused by a woman who has to be the most sexually unstable and caring in the process
1,he has been a great character in,he was a very good actor
1,so what if you can get the message of the movie the plot is not,so the film is a very good movie and i recommend it for all
1,he has the best of all his usual,he has a good sense of humor
1,i do n't know what the director is saying,i have to admit that it has a lot to
1,shame on you for a few scenes of how bad this was,shame on all the people who made a good horror movie
1,i think that the film is very good,i think that the movie is a little too
1,then the movie goes downhill and you see a,then the story goes to an old school
1,my favorite character has been the father 's mother who has a onenight life with her father,my friend who i saw was the only one who was interested to see the movie
1,maybe the director is trying too hard,maybe he is the only person that is
1,to be fair i was n't expecting a good movie,to make it more realistic it 's not a good thing
1,you have to be kidding me to see it in theaters and it is n't,you have the feeling of being a good person and you can relate with the story
1,as a movie it is very entertaining and a good one at that,as for the rest of the movie i was not surprised to learn how
1,but the film 's plot is n't really that good either,but i do n't think that 's the case in my opinion
1,i think that the best part of the film was when the two,i do think this movie has the potential for a good film
1,i do n't want to give anything more than a 1 but it 's just a waste,i do not want to spoil anything but the film is a complete waste and it is not
1,but the movie has the same effect of,but it 's just not the same
1,fast forward through the movie and then suddenly the film is set up,fast forward to the end of this film we see a bunch that 's
1,it has a lot of fun but it is a very good movie,it 's a very funny movie and a great one at that
1,although it 's a little slow at times it is not a comedy,although the story is n't as good the characters were very good the story
1,the story is very interesting the characters are likable the plot and acting are superb and,the acting was good and it was n't bad but it was n't as funny
1,sure this film was n't a complete mess,sure the story is about a man named benjamin
1,bujold is one of the most beautiful characters in cinema history but he,bujold is a good guy but his character is not very good
1,and that 's the reason why i give this film an 810 instead of 1 is the fact the director is so obviously a little confused,and that 's the reason why i give this film 1 is because it has been a 2 for a long while i do have to say
1,joan blondell was a very good actor and the movie is a perfect example for an independent movie,joan crawford was a good actress but she was n't in a movie that was n't a great movie
1,these were the days of the great depression and i think that is what the movie is,these guys are just as bad and the only ones i know are the bad ones
1,each character is played by one actor who is a little too,each character has their moments and the characters are all likable
1,but it is a great movie,but the movie is so bad that
1,the acting was n't too good either,the story is very simple and it 's
1,only to be honest and the film has a,only the most discerning actors could n't act
1,this is one film that is not only a vehicle for insomnia,this is one of those movies that you will never forget
1,well i was really impressed by this one,well the story is about two brothers in their
1,those who do n't know that they are in love,those are the things you do with this movie
1,maybe it was a little more interesting and more believable but the film,maybe it 's because of this but i think that 's why
1,it was so much of that,it 's just so boring that you
1,at least the original was a very good idea,at the same point it 's the fact that this
1,and that is the only reason why this movie was n't a complete,and the movie was so boring that i could n't stop it
1,you can watch it with a group of friends,you have n't seen the first two movies
1,the movie is a very interesting story of a young woman who is a struggling husband and is a very rich woman,the story of an old man and the girl who are shipwrecked on a boat in their home and the local police department
1,moonlighting is an important part of this film,moonlighting is a movie that should never get better
1,costumes were not the only bright lighting the,costumes and scenery are all very good
1,some of the scenes where a little girl is talking about her boyfriend 's life and her mother 's death is not the best part of the movie,some scenes in the movie have a lot of room and the movie is not very interesting but i think the director is the only person who could possibly
1,just as the film opens the story is a simple tale of a man 's struggle to find,just a little bit more and the acting was horrible and the plot was just too bad
1,well this film has the best of the worst,well this movie is n't bad but i do n't
1,also the film is very well done,also the ending is a joke as well
1,what i liked most about this movie are those that have n't,what a waste of a good cast and a good script
1,he is the most interesting character i can remember,he is a man who is not a man and
1,there are some great performances in the movie,there are some very good performances from the cast
1,there is also some nice gore in this film which is a shame,there are a few scenes that do show up in the end but the
1,this is a great film for everyone involved,this is a film for everyone who likes the
1,the movie is about the same thing about the same subject matter,the acting in the movie is so good that i could n't believe
1,that is the most obvious thing in this,that 's what makes it so good
1,i have n't laughed so much since watching this movie,i think the movie was made for the sake of showing
1,now i know that i can forgive this one,now this is a good example for an action flick
1,in the movie 's defense it is the same thing as,in the end it 's not even a bad movie
1,i do agree that this film was n't made for tv but for,i was surprised that the movie had a good rating for it
1,the film is about a young man who lives on his own in the middle ages of his,the film has a very good soundtrack and a great soundtrack but that was n't the problem
1,sedated little girl who is the only reason to see this movie,sedated is the most beautiful and most unsettling of the four

1,there are some great performances by everyone in the cast,there is a scene that will leave you with a feeling
1,feels sorry for the people involved and the fact they are trying so hard,feels as i was watching this film the first 30 minutes were the same and
1,of course the movie is about a guy who gets killed by,of course the movie is n't as good as it is
1,you 'll never forget that it is a movie about a man who has been living with the us and the world is a bit of,you can see it coming from an old man 's face as the movie is shot and the camera pans down and the camera moves
1,if it was not so much more then a little more accurate to me i could n't have cared,if you have n't read the novel you will probably have a lot of fun watching this movie
1,pros the movie has a few good moments and a great,pros is a very funny movie that is worth seeing
1,i have seen it several years now,i was surprised that this movie did n't
1,in the first part of the series we get to know the character 's motivation for,in the end it was just a waste of money and time to watch it
1,in a nutshell i was n't expecting much of a movie and was pleasantly surprised,in a movie that is not so bad you can tell you the story of the
1,the movie is not about the people who have the power to be so stupid and so bad they just have,the story of an aging man who gets to a hospital where he has no idea of what to expect

1,in the end he is a little too old for the role of the film 's own good,in the first part of the series there 's the usual cgi effects and the occasional flashes in the
1,due to the fact that it 's a very good movie it is not,due to a great cast and the cast the actors are very well done especially
1,lame and dumber to the eye,lame and pointless but not the best
1,and it 's all pretty funny,and the film 's ending was pretty
1,kathy bates is the only reason i can think this would be,kathy ireland is one that i have n't seen in years
1,but this film was a waste of my money time and i could,but the film is a complete failure and the acting is terrible
1,i think it 's a great idea,i was so disappointed with that
1,the story is very weak and the ending is very predictable as well and the movie does n't even try,the story is about the lives of a young boy who is in his late teens in the city
1,there is a reason to see it in theaters,there are a number that will have you laughing uncontrollably
1,i do n't want it to be that,i have n't seen the first one
1,james woods was a good choice to show the movie,james caan plays his role as well as the character of
1,go watch a movie with a bunch,go rent it or rent it
1,growing up and watching this show i had to watch it,growing up on this film the only thing that made it worth
1,while i do n't like it at all,while the story is a little slow it does
1,far from the truth and the fact of this movie is that the film does not work as well as the book itself,far from a masterpiece of mine this film has a very good cast and a great script and a very interesting story line
1,sadly the film does not seem like a movie to be a serious drama,sadly it was a little bit of a stretch to sit down to watch this
1,maybe the best thing about this is it 's,maybe the film is n't a good idea
1,heman 's father and son are the best of them,heman 's father has a secret agent who is now in

1,the acting is very good but i was,the movie is a very good movie
1,gladly the film was made in the early seventies and the,gladly the film is about a group called the toughest
1,but the film 's plot and characters are not enough to save this movie,but the film 's main weakness is its lack of a good script
1,polygamy has a very small budget but it has the potential to be an action movie and the action,polygamy is the story that is not about the human condition but it is also a great film
1,concept is the only thing i can remember about the first movie that i saw in the,concept is not a good idea but the film is very entertaining and is very funny
1,they were so stupid and so stupid that i had,they are both a very nice and talented director
1,its a shame that this is n't a movie that will appeal for everyone,its not that i do have to say it but i would like to see
1,after the first 15 minutes of this film you know that it was going on a little too,after all the movie is about the same people that were born in the early 1980 century
1,the story is very simple and very funny,the acting is pretty good and the story itself
1,sorry for the fact it has a good plot but it 's not,sorry to say that the plot is n't a good idea and the acting
1,in the first half of this movie we,in fact this movie was a waste
1,the film 's story line has been changed from a novel,the story is simple the story line is n't bad
1,few of the characters are believable,few of these movies are made to
1,no matter what they are you 'll be,no matter what you 're talking about
1,also the ending of the movie is the most interesting aspect of the,also the ending is very good as it is very well done
1,how could it be that a movie like the texas rangers and,how can you go to a movie with such great stars
1,on the way they encounter the girl who is,on the other hand the acting is terrible
1,woody allen is a master of the craft in this film and he does not disappoint,woody harrelson plays the young man who has a crush in his heart and his love of
1,we have a movie that will never be forgotten but it will,we get a lot more of the characters and the characters
1,and the movie is a little too long,and the acting was good the script had some
1,in fact i think it 's the best film ever created,in the end it 's not a bad film but the fact
1,the acting in this film is very poor,the story is very good and the acting is
1,this is one of those movies that you will not regret,this is the first of many films in the subgenre
1,unless you 're a fan and do not know anything you can enjoy it for the sake of the film and its ability,unless you 're a fan of bad movies you 'll be disappointed to find that this is the worst film i 've ever had
1,since it has a good cast of characters and a few moments of humor it 's a bit of an,since the first film was a complete success in my mind i 'd like to watch the original version
1,one of my favorites was that this was a very funny film and a lot more fun than this movie,one can see that the actors are n't trying too much but they do not work in this one and they
1,and i think that is why this movie has a,and i think this is a very important film
1,yes it 's an interesting idea and i can say that this movie is a complete mess,yes it has the best acting in the movie but the story itself was so good
1,added to the film is the fact that the director and writer have a very low iq,added a few words of a movie that you would n't have seen in a film
1,ben stiller plays a character named seth green,ben stiller was a good guy but his character
1,it has a very good cast,it has been the same year as
1,the movie is about two young men,the film is very well done
1,you know it will be a bad thing to begin with,you can see the actors and actresses in the film
1,about a half of this is the first half of it and it 's,about a half hour after the movie i started to watch it again
1,with the help of a few people in his life the film is not only,with the exception the director 's cut is a little slow and slow paced
1,tragically the movie does n't have any of it 's charm,tragically the story is a bit too thin to be taken from
1,he is a good actor but he 's very funny and is always funny in,he 's the only one in the movie who is a little bit annoying
1,add to that the fact the characters were so,add to the mix a very good cast
1,some of these scenes seem to be cut out,some of it is not a bit dated
1,petula is an actress of a woman in this film,petula moore is excellent as the woman who is not the
1,if i were to give the movie a try to make it a point i would have to be a big fan of hers and have seen,if it was n't for that i would have given it a higher rating but it is not the worst movie that has ever been made
1,cast members and actresses are not very interesting and they are very believable and very believable,cast members and actresses and actresses in the roles are all fine and i think that the
1,the acting is good the script is very good the acting is good and i have seen a lot of movies,the film is a little over the top and it 's too hard to find a way to get to the point
1,it has a lot to say about a young boy named kale a,it is not a bad film but i would recommend this one
1,park is an excellent character actor,park 's performance as a child is
1,and the acting was n't bad,and the ending of this movie is
1,it 's a shame that this film is not only for the diehard fans of the classic but also fans,it 's a shame that the movie is so much more than a comedy but the acting is superb
1,correct spoilers ahead the ending is a complete mess and i did n't know what to expect,correct to the point of sorrow and anger is a film that is n't a total waste of
1,jeanette lloyd plays the lead character who is also in a wheelchair,jeanette macdonald was great in the movie but the rest is pretty bad
1,cruise is the best thing in the film and is the only good thing,cruise is a great character and he is a real person who is n't afraid
1,this is a great movie and a great movie,this is a movie for the whole family
1,too bad it is n't a movie,too many people have to be killed
1,it 's not a movie that will make you want to leave your seat and you 'll be bored and you,it has been a long time since i 've read a comment on it that this movie is a joke
1,i think it was an excellent film and a very enjoyable experience for the whole movie but it is a bit of,i think this movie is a great example of how to make an action movie that is a lot like it
1,otherwise this movie is not a movie to watch,otherwise it 's a very bad and bad show
1,a very good movie with a great deal of action,a lot like the film the characters in this film were
1,all in one of his most enjoyable performances the best performance of the film is the performance that plays the role,all the while i do have to admit it was a very good movie and i liked it very very much
1,there was n't a lot of action in it,there is a reason why this movie has to have
1,it is not a good idea to be able into a movie but it 's still a good film and a,it has been a staple since the first time i saw a movie i have seen that was the best
1,i'm not sure why i have never seen such films as the last two but i,i'm not sure whether it was a good idea to show the film or not
1,i was surprised to find this one a very interesting one,i was n't expecting a lot from the first two but the
1,the movie has a lot of potential but it 's a very poor story that does not work,the story is a little thin and it does have some good moments but the rest of it is
1,there was a scene in which the hero 's daughter was,there is a very good performance by a young caan
1,but the film has a very good story line to it that is n't too bad and is n't even remotely funny,but the real reason for the movie 's success is to show us how to make a movie that 's as entertaining
1,all in all a great piece of entertainment,all the actors in their roles were good but
1,this movie was made for tv but not as,this movie is a complete waste of time
1,its the best movie i can think of to be honest,its not a bad movie but the acting and direction are all
1,it 's a very funny show and,it is a very funny movie
1,the film has a very good cast and,the film is a very good movie
1,my favorite part of the movie was when a girl 's character goes out and the other girls are n't,my favorite parts are when they are talking about a man who is a woman who is a woman
1,we get a glimpse of the real life of,we 're not supposed as to be objective
1,the acting is horrible the plot line was,the story line has been done before
1,the movie is a little over a few minutes of my head i will,the story was a lot better but the acting was horrible at best
1,the movie starts out as the story of,the movie is a bit too dark
1,but the film is not about a,but this movie was so good
1,this movie was a waste of time and money and,this movie has the potential of a good movie
1,said it has the potential to be one that is a classic but it 's just a good movie,said to say that the only way i can watch this show are the ones i have n't heard of
1,the movie is about a group of friends in a different country,the film was made by a very young director and his wife who
1,no one is ever a fan of the show but the show has been a favorite episode,no one could possibly have a better life than the one who is a real artist
1,i do think that the movie has a lot to do with it,i was so excited to hear that the first movie i had heard of
1,we are supposed to believe that the people of the town have been conditioned to get the money and the money they are in,we are supposed the interplay of the main players and the story is a little bit too predictable for its tastes as a film
1,this was a very good film and a good,this movie is not for the faint hearted
1,no one could possibly have pulled off a good film but this,no one has ever heard that a movie is so bad
1,and the acting in this movie are all good and i do n't care for anyone else who has seen the first two movies,and i was n't impressed with the ending and was surprised to see that the film was n't a sequel to this film but it
1,bava is a very clever director who 's a very talented director,bava has done a lot of films that are n't so bad it
1,the movie was shot at the time,the film is a bit slow at times
1,it 's a shame because i was surprised by the amount of,it is a shame to see a good director like this
1,this film was made by the same director who made a lot more of the genre and the result,this is the kind that i have to warn people that it is not a movie that is n't
1,i think that 's what this show has done,i have to say i have seen a lot worse
1,a good film for those who like the genre of horror movies,a few of them are n't that bad but the acting was so
1,finding a new love story that has been told to,finding it 's own a little easier to understand
1,my favorite scene is the scene where the guy gets shot and then he 's talking on the,my advice is to avoid a film like this for a good laugh and a good time
1,it 's not a bad movie,it 's a pity that the film
1,while i do not have a problem with the movie 's plot i found it hard to believe the director would be a writer,while i have seen the film and the other reviews it has to say about the film i was surprised at how bad this movie
1,master of the art is not the best of all the actors,master 's wife is a young woman who is a woman
1,not to mention a couple scenes in which the camera pans around and the narrator 's face is so bad that you ca n't,not only is the acting terrible but there 's no way the script is ever made and the script is n't really good
1,all in all i 'd say the movie is n't a bad one,all in all i think it 's a great film for anyone who wants
1,it 's the only thing you can get from,it 's a shame to see this movie
1,lots of blood splatter and nudity in a movie that is a,lots of blood and gore but the story is so bad
1,the story is simple enough but it 's not the worst of the bunch,the acting and directing is excellent but the script by eric bana is so bad
1,to make matters worse it was just a bunch,to be honest this is a film that i would
1,i do not want the film makers to get,i think the director was making an effort
1,it is a movie that is a joy for all,it has been a long time since this movie is made
1,but this is the best film i have seen in my entire lives,but the movie is so good that it 's not even funny
1,the movie is a very good one to watch and it 's a great movie to watch with a couple friends in their right mind and a good time in the life and heart of the movie that is n't,the story is very interesting and the acting was good but the script was so bad it was hard not just for it to be good but it was so bad that i was left speechless watching this film
1,s the only thing i could say,s the real life of the film
1,he is a very talented character and a,he was also a very good actor
1,imagine the film is not a comedy it 's a satire and a good one,imagine the movie as the most important thing to do to make it a classic
1,luckily it is not as bad as i,luckily this is a very good show
1,the film is not a comedy or even an action,the film is very slow paced and very slow
1,at least it 's the same old guy with a lot more to do than the usual hollywood exec who 's been trying to make it to his new home,at first it seems like the director has been working for a bunch of people but the movie is a little bit too slow for a long boring boring and boring
1,obviously the film is n't a comedy it 's,obviously this was a very low budget production
1,and it 's a very funny scene that makes,and the film 's main character 's character
1,watched it on tv recently and i was amazed to,watched this movie for the second time on dvd
1,she was so beautiful and so sweet,she is a very attractive woman who does
1,the film has a very interesting premise,the movie is a complete waste
1,wells is the best thing about it,wells has a very good cast
1,why did they have all of the actors,why do we need this elvis' to make a
1,i do n't know if i was in the theater for a few days and i would have to be ashamed,i think the reason i gave it 2 stars is because it was n't so great but i thought the movie was
1,nothing really happened to the characters,nothing really bad and not even that
1,derek is an excellent character actor who has,derek is the perfect choice for this
1,when i first read the book i thought i 'd read the book,when the movie ended i was surprised by it and it 's so bad
1,3 the movie was a total mess,3 a few scenes of dialogue and some
1,john huston is a genius as the lead character and is the perfect foil to his character in the,john wayne 's acting is a bit wooden but the movie is a bit too long for me
1,to be sure i do n't know what to say,to be honest it was n't a total loss
1,the movie has an excellent story line and,the movie is a very good film
1,this movie was a complete disappointment,this was one that was not only
1,i think this film is a must have,i think this is the best of the two
1,what i found was a really good movie,what is the point of this movie that is
1,the acting is horrible the script was awful and it is a waste on the whole,the acting is very good and i have to mention the acting and the direction
1,the movie is a complete bore and it has no plot at least not for the,the movie is about the struggle between two men and their relationships and their relationship
1,credits are a bit misleading but the fact is that the film has some great,credits for the movie to come out of this movie is not a movie
1,this was a very good movie,this was the only film i have
1,the story of a young girl and her son who are in love with each other is very interesting,the story line is a little weak as the movie goes along with the plot and its characters
1,talking about a film about a young boy who is born in a small village in london,talking about the plot of the movie is that it is a very good movie that is so
1,it is a movie of a movie that has a few,it 's a shame because the film is so boring
1,the movie is a complete failure and should have had the potential to be a sequel to it,the film was made for a generation who has never been able to find a way to go
1,just a few years ago the film has been a bit too long for me,just do n't waste your time with a movie that is not worth the time
1,dad is a good guy who is not a bad person,dad is a good actor but the rest of the cast are
1,if i had n't seen the first two films i would 've been able to suspend my disbelief,if you 're looking forward to a movie that 's a little slow paced and a waste then this
1,i think that the film would have been more entertaining,i was so disappointed by that i had to watch this
1,how can a woman be so bad that you can almost,how can you go to the movies of this film
1,actually it 's a shame the only,actually this was a good movie
1,by the end the only thing i did not get was watching the movie,by the end you will find yourself rooting to find out if this movie was
1,the movie is not about a man who is a,the movie is a complete mess of a film
1,it 's a very good movie,it 's just a bunch and it
1,it 's the kind of movie i would watch over all times,it 's a shame because it 's so bad that it 's almost
1,so if you want to know what 's going to happen then i recommend it,so the film goes on to be an interesting story but it is n't a good
1,everybody else in this movie is either a caricature and just an obnoxious stereotype,everybody is entitled and the whole thing has been shot in the head of a
1,all in the family is a very funny movie,all in this film is an enjoyable and entertaining thriller
1,of the three films i 've seen the same is one to watch with my kids in their late 30s i,of all of the films of the past ten years i have to admit it was one of my favorites
1,certainly the movie is not for everyone but it,certainly the movie is not worth the time
1,i do n't think that it was that bad,i think it 's a shame that this movie has
1,this is a film of a kind,this movie is a complete mess
1,for me the only thing that i could say about the film is that it was shot in the early,for me the film is a masterpiece and the director 's commentary was to be taken from the book
1,most movies are n't funny and i think the film is n't funny,most people will be disappointed to watch this film as the best movie in
1,hillarious to the extreme and very very very very,hillarious and funny this is a great movie
1,one can only imagine a few people who were in the theater,one thing is that this movie is not even worth watching
1,or the fact that it has been so popular in,or even the scene when the girl was killed
1,fortunately it is a little bit too slow for,fortunately the film has a lot of problems
1,how many times have we been in a movie,how could this be so bad that it was just
1,beasts and demons is a good film,beasts and demons is a very good movie
1,the story of a woman who has a secret to live in a brothel in new york city and is very well developed,the film is about a young woman named becky who is a woman who 's a child and a teenager who is obsessed by
1,get it out of your head,get a lot of people out here
1,like i said before i was a little surprised by the film and it 's,like the rest i thought it would have a better ending than the movie
1,now i do n't know how i can watch it,now the film was made in the late forties
1,anyway i think that it is a great show,anyway i do think the movie 's best part is
1,however i have a feeling of nostalgia for a,however the plot is not really that good
1,none of them have any real problems,none of these actors are convincing
1,the acting was n't too horrible either,the acting in this movie is horrible
1,sly 's acting in this film is a little wooden but it,sly is a great actor and he is very convincing here
1,he 's not a bad person he 's a good actor and a good man who can be very funny,he was a great character but he 's not the only actor in the movie who has n't been able to
1,but this movie is not for everyone who loves movies,but it was a little bit too much to make a
1,however i think this is one of his better films and i hope that he can get a chance,however the movie is a little slow at times but it 's not as good as the book or the
1,but the movie does not make much sense at all but i think that the movie is a bit long,but the film is a complete mess with a lot to think and a lot better in the end
1,why does he have a tendency for,why do we get the point
1,stewart is the best actor of all time but he is a good,stewart is a good actress but she is n't a great actress
1,question is that it 's not so bad as the movie is,question of course the movie 's main character 's character 's name is
1,the acting is very good but the plot and the characters is just plain awful and it 's not even worth mentioning that,the story is simple and the story is very interesting and the acting is great but the story is n't very interesting
1,which is what the film is about and that,which i think is a very good thing
1,greetings is the worst thing about this flick,greetings from the darkness is a film that will
1,the story was so weak and so unbelievable it was so predictable that i actually had a,the story is a little too complicated but the characters and the characters all are believable
1,the film is very well acted,the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
1,given the fact that the film is a little slow paced the characters seem very real,given a chance to get rid and a few of the actors and crew of their careers
1,a good film to be seen by anyone with an,a lot of it is a little too slow
1,i do not know how this movie was made and it is,i do n't think this movie was a waste of money
1,that said i would like to point out that the film is very good and it,that was n't the best part of the movie but it was n't that bad
1,4 out there is the best movie ever,4 the movie 's main character was a young
1,it 's a shame because the movie is n't really a,it is the worst film that i have ever watched
1,george c scott is the only one to be able,george c scott is the standout actor of this movie as
1,careers are n't even close enough,careers are the best thing in the
1,but the film 's only redeeming feature is the lack that it 's made,but the real reason why the show was canceled was the fact that i was
1,one of my favorite films of all time,one of the best movies i have watched in
1,the movie was shot in color in black and blue and the costumes were very good but the,the film has a very strong cast but they 're not as bad as the first film
1,in fact the only thing good is to watch a few of them and the movie is not a bad film,in a way the movie is not as good as the other films but it 's a very enjoyable film
1,beyond all the plot is not the best,beyond the usual clichs of the first film this
1,this movie is one that should be watched by,this is a movie that you will enjoy
1,i have to admit this was an interesting,i think this movie is very good
1,the acting is horrible and the story line,the film has a lot to do with the
1,instead the film has a lot of action sequences,instead of being a good guy he 's just not
1,the film is about a man who is a loner in a hospital and is a man who is trying hard to solve the mystery of life,the film is not as polished as the first film but it 's a good movie that is not only a very interesting and interesting film but also
1,rather than the first movie that is n't the same the second,rather than a movie about two people trying to escape the world and
1,from the opening shot to the last shot is a little slow,from this point of fact i found myself wondering if the writer or
1,the movie is a bit too long and it 's too,the story of a young girl who marries her family
1,this is the best movie of 1997 i have ever,this is the best of all the columbo series
1,in fact the only redeeming feature in this movie were the costumes and the acting was n't as bad at the time as i had expected from a movie,in the first part of this film the audience sees that the director is not going to get a clue of what he 's doing in the film and the
1,it 's a great show for adults to enjoy,it has a great story line and a great soundtrack
1,sally grable plays the role of the young woman who 's been a little over the years and she has a very good time with,sally grable was a very talented woman in the first season but she was n't really as strong as she did with her character
1,and the ending was so bad i could n't help thinking that it was just,and it 's a shame that this is n't even available in the states
1,like many other films of this genre it is not a very,like i said it was a good idea for a movie
1,if you have a chance to see it do n't,if i were n't a teenager i would have to watch
1,the story is simple and it 's a bit of a stretch,the story is a bit confusing but the movie itself was very well
1,however the film is a little too long,however the movie was not a good one
1,the movie starts out with an interesting premise but it does,the acting was horrible the plot is awful and the characters just
1,after a while i was n't expecting a lot more from the movie,after all the hype of the story is a bit too much
1,unfortunately i was so disappointed that i was watching a movie with a lot of people,unfortunately the film is n't really about anything and it 's not even worth mentioning the first
1,the acting and direction are excellent,the film is not a complete failure
1,go see it and then see it,go see it if you are into a
1,i think the movie is really bad and it 's not even worth watching it just for the fact of,i have to admit that the story is pretty good and i liked the way the movie is structured
1,i'm a huge horror movie lover so i'm glad i rented this movie,i'm a big big believer fan and i am not a big fan
1,they 're just so bad that they 're just so bad they,they are not the only characters that have the slightest personality
1,now this is a good movie but it 's a little boring,now this was one thing that i had never thought of
1,well the movie is a complete mess,well the story was pretty good
1,this is not the type film that makes you want a good movie to watch,this is the kind of story you should n't want but it 's worth watching for
1,for the most part this is a very good movie and i recommend this movie for anyone who likes a movie,for the rest of it you have a film about a young woman who is trying her best friend 's life
1,i have n't seen this movie since it was a little bit of the movie,i was expecting something more from this one but this was a great movie
1,this movie is a great movie that,this movie is not for everyone
1,and it is a good idea,and the movie is so bad that
1,it 's a shame that the movie was n't even,it was n't a movie for the whole family
1,the film is a little slow paced but it 's not too much of an impact for anyone,the film is very well done and the actors and the director are all excellent with the same actors
1,unfortunately it is not as good or bad as,unfortunately this is a good thing to say
1,a few years ago i had a fondness,a lot like it is a film
1,i was n't impressed at all,i have to wonder if the director
1,as a matter i was n't expecting a lot of it,as a matter of fact i did not care for the main
1,i have never heard a movie before that so i have to admit that i was,i think that the best part was the scene in the bar with the kids
1,never mind the film itself was n't even nominated for best picture,never mind it 's not a bad film but i have seen it
1,the film is a very good film,the acting was n't bad but not bad
1,in the movie 's end it is not clear that the movie is not a complete mess but it 's a,in fact the whole cast seems like they 're having fun in their roles and it 's all very funny
1,i do n't think that the actors are really bad,i do not want my children to go to a movie
1,for the first time in a long time i,for me the best thing about this movie
1,interesting to see how the story of a character,interesting characters in a movie about the holocaust
1,but the movie was n't really about the characters in the first,but the real problem with it was its lack of originality
1,to be sure i do n't understand why the movie is so bad i ca all of the acting and plot,to be fair the acting is pretty bad and there was a scene that could be cut out and the editing was
1,save your money rent it buy or rent it,save your cash and rent the dvd and you 'll
1,some of these movies have some of those moments that make,some of it 's problems are the acting is terrible
1,they 're not a great movie,they have a lot to do and
1,this was a very good movie with,this is a very good movie
1,one of my favorite films of all times,one of the worst movies i saw i 've
1,there was a lot to like about this movie,there is also the usual clich scene where the two
1,now i do n't know how to describe this movie,now i have seen a lot more of the series and
1,for me the film has some of its moments,for me it 's not a movie that is a
1,i was n't sure why i was watching this,i think the movie is just too much
1,then the film switches gears to the point of view of an american family,then the film is set and the characters get involved with the story
1,the acting was horrible the story is,the film is very well acted
1,so the movie is a bit of an excuse,so the movie was n't that good either
1,ok so i was a fan and this movie is a complete bore,ok so i do n't have to be a fan of this movie
1,but the film is not a complete disaster and is a must see film,but the story of the story of the film was so predictable and the ending
1,the acting is horrible the directing is awful and the script is a,the acting is good with all the actors and actresses and actresses
1,i do think that the movie 's best asset was the acting,i was so disappointed that i was watching the show i could have
1,at one time the movie is about a woman trying to escape from her,at least the movie is a little bit of an insult for me
1,instead of having a party and then get the girl to eat the crap he 's wearing,instead of being the same director it would appear that the director of the movie was a writer
1,joe don wilson 's portrayal is a good one,joe pesci was a great actor and i thought he
1,gavras 's direction was excellent but i did not expect much to this movie,gavras is the most famous director of his films that he has made
1,her performance was so bad that it was painful for her,her character was so annoying it was hard for me
1,normally a movie about people trying too much to be a good film but not as,normally i think the director should n't be allowed the film to get any better
1,his performance is a bit stiff but his performance here was excellent as the character who plays his mother was a very good one and the film was very well done,his character is a stereotype and his character is so believable that you wonder how he could get into the world 's most powerful and dangerous world in the end and his
1,it is a movie that is a must see for all fans and for fans of the genre of the genre and of a great time when it was released,it 's a shame that the movie is so bad and so stupid that it 's hard to believe that anyone would actually want the sequel to this one to be
1,russell crowe is a fine director,russell is a good actor but his
1,the film is a complete failure,the film was shot in a time
1,i was surprised to find this one,i do think that a movie that is
1,she is a very talented actress and she has a very strong voice,she 's not the only one who does n't know she has a chance
1,the story was so stupid and predictable that it could have been a great movie if,the movie starts out well and the acting is very solid with a few exceptions
1,do n't be fooled if the film was released theatrically,do n't get me wrong the story has many holes and
1,so i do n't know why,so the movie is a little too
1,i was n't expecting a lot more from this movie but it was a waste,i was surprised at how many of my favourite actors have made this movie
1,a few years later the movie 's main drawback was its title,a good example for a movie is the fact that it is a
1,but this film is a complete waste of time,but this one has a very good plot and a
1,it is not that i think it would be a,it is not a bad idea for a movie
1,some of them are very funny and i really do not think it is that good,some of them do have a few good lines but they are just plain boring
1,peter falk plays a character who does n't know what he is doing,peter boyle plays an interesting character but is the only person in his career
1,this is the worst film i 've ever seen,this is one movie i would love for anyone who
1,unfortunately the movie is not so much of a surprise that this is a movie about two,unfortunately it 's a shame that the film is not as much as i 'd expected
1,it is a movie that is n't afraid that the director and writer should be ashamed,it has a lot of action and the plot is so thin that it is n't even
1,it 's a great story and a good one,it is n't a bad film but i would recommend
1,i do not want to spoil the movie by revealing the story but i think it 's a good movie,i think that the best part of the movie was how the movie was shot and edited with a lot of
1,indeed the film has some good performances,indeed it does n't matter to the audience
1,the film is not a bad movie,the story is about a bunch that is
1,for those who have not been in the us know that they,for me it 's not that bad but it 's not
1,in the end he 's just not as bad as he should be and i 've been looking forward for,in the end he is n't really a bad guy and he 's the one with the bad guys
1,released in the uk and forties in the late 1960s and the early seventies in the seventies the film is a bit dated but it 's still a,released in the uk and 1940s in the uk and 1940s in the early seventies the film was a lot of fun in a lot more ways
1,we 're talking about the movie and the story and the characters and the plot line,we get an insight of a very complex relationship that is so difficult to accept
1,but it is a good movie and it does,but the film has a lot of potential
1,yes it is true but the acting and direction are very good,yes it is a little corny but that is not a big deal
1,quote of a film that 's not a bad thing,quote on a film is a good thing but not as
1,by the time the end of the film i was just wishing,by the end of the movie i had to watch it
1,and the film 's ending is very,and it 's a good movie
1,there is a scene where the two men meet up with their mother,there is a reason why the movie has been so bad that i have
1,the story is a little thin but,the film has a great cast
1,it has a lot of potential and it 's a shame,it is n't a bad idea for an action film
1,i have never seen such bad acting in a while and i,i have never read a book that i could not stand
1,the movie was a waste of time and money,the film is a bit slow and drags on for
1,as i 've said the film was a little too slow,as a result i have a soft tolerance for a movie that
1,but i do not recommend the movie to anyone,but it 's not as good or bad
1,you can watch it without the slightest hesitation and the characters and their motivations,you know the story and the movie is a bit of a mess but it
1,it 's not even that bad it is n't a bad movie,it 's a shame that the film did n't get released theatrically and
1,the movie has a great story line and,the story was a lot of fun
1,the story line has a lot going from there,the film has some good moments but it 's just
1,my advice is if you are a fan and have seen the original you 'll be,my favorite part was when the kids in this show were laughing at the tv
1,the film is a complete mess and it 's a waste of money and time to watch,the story was a little too thin but the movie was so bad that it was n't funny
1,he is a very talented man who can be found on a very dangerous level,he 's not a bad guy he does n't have a problem with him
1,after the first half hour i was hooked to it and the story is so good it,after the first 15 minutes i was n't sure how to get to the next scene
1,anyhoo there was a lot more to the story,anyhoo the story is about a group that are trying
1,it 's not a movie that will leave you wanting the audience,it 's the story about two young men who are married
1,like i mentioned earlier the movie does a good deal of the,like the rest of the movie the plot is pretty simple
1,i was expecting a great movie,i do n't know how it was
1,on a positive note it has some good performances,on a technical side the acting and direction are very
1,shot in black and white and directed in a way that makes,shot on a shoestring budget and the acting by all involved
1,it is a shame that it was released theatrically,it 's not a good movie but i think it
1,it 's a very bad movie and it is the only thing i can say,it 's not a good film to watch but the acting and direction is so strong
1,the story was very good but not a very interesting movie to watch and i,the story is simple enough but there is a lot more than it is
1,like the other reviewer said i was so impressed,like the other two movies this one has the best
1,the acting is good the script is very bad and the plot is just too ridiculous,the acting and directing was terrible the plot was awful and i thought the acting was pretty
1,i do not think this was the best movie in the world,i was surprised that this movie did not have any other redeeming feature
1,considering that the film has a few flaws it is not worth it,considering that it is a movie about a group of young men it is
1,there was a lot more to it than the movie but the story was so predictable and so boring,there are some great actors who are also good in the movie but they do n't really fit in
1,the story line was so bad and so lame it was unbelievable,the movie is not a comedy it just is n't funny
1,their relationship was not so good and it was n't until the end that,their performances are not very convincing but the script was a good one
1,there was no real reason to see it and it 's a very boring movie,there is no reason to see this movie and i do mean that i did like
1,the story of a young boy who gets a job in the middle of the road in the,the film has no real plot no plot no plot just a bunch that could n't act
1,the acting was horrible and the plot is just plain stupid,the movie has a few good points but the story is not
1,greg araki was the first of a lot to work with the director and the director,greg araki is the director and the movie does n't have a lot of action
1,to me the movie was so good that i could n't help but wonder if the,to make matters worse this is not a movie that will make your brain hurt
1,much better than i thought it would get,much of the acting in the cast is pretty
1,the film is a very good one,the story is simple enough to warrant the
1,korea is a very very beautiful film,korea is a film about a man 's
1,comedy is a bit of fun,comedy wise but this movie is so
1,wonderful movie and a good movie to watch for those interested,wonderful film with a great deal of suspense that is very well
1,and the ending where the killer 's,and the ending was so predictable
1,searching for a movie to be good and entertaining,searching to find out what happened to the man he
1,the acting is horrible the plot has no plot,the story of the movie is very interesting
1,a very funny and funny film,a lot like the other reviewers here
1,whereas this movie is a bit long it is a very good film,whereas the film is not the worst film i have ever seen this film
1,so if you 're not a fan you should see this one and i think it is,so i guess that was just me and that was a good idea to make it
1,the film is about a man who is a woman and,the acting is horrible the script and acting is horrible
1,i think that the director 's cut of the film is the best of all the movie 's shortcomings,i do n't know if the movie 's budget is n't so low but it is a good thing to
1,quite possibly the most interesting character to grace in the history,quite possibly one thing i have to say is the fact of
1,for a film that was a little too long for me,for the first time in a movie i had to be able
1,in fact this movie was a waste of time,in the end he 's the one who has to
1,i have seen the movie and i do n't think,i have seen the original version of this film
1,then the film goes on and on with the story line and characters,then the movie switches into an endless flashback scene with the guy in a
1,anyway i was n't expecting much from this movie but i thought i had to give it a shot because it had so many twists and it was n't even funny and,anyway i do not want to spoil the film for anyone who loves it or even a fan and i do n't think the movie was intended to be so bad
1,they are all the actors and the actors are n't bad but the story is so poor it makes me want to,they are both funny but it 's just too much to make it worth watching for the acting and the direction
1,giving it a 10 i would recommend this movie to,giving this one the same kudos as i have
1,they are not in the film for the most,they are all very good in a movie
1,perhaps the film is a little too long but,perhaps the film was shot entirely in black
1,so if you are a diehard fan of horror movies this is one for you,so i do n't have to be so much fun to watch a good horror movie
1,with the possible amount and lots to go with the film it 's a little too late,with this one it 's a shame that they did n't have the money and it 's not
1,all of the actors are very well known,all in the family and i think they should
1,enter a little town where the two men go to a party to get married,enter the house and a group in a remote cabin where they have to go on
1,not a bad movie but not a bad one,not only was he trying to make it look cool
1,to be sure it 's not that good,to be honest i was n't expecting much of
1,he was the first to die and it is the most disturbing and disturbing scene,he has a lot of fun and is very funny in his later work
1,an old fashioned movie that was made in the early 80 'searly 90 's was made,an interesting and very interesting story about the consequences and tribulations of the late 1800
1,they 're just not the same,they are the best actors ever to
1,barbara stanwyck is a very talented actress,barbara carrera is the best actress in this
1,i was expecting the same type of movie as it was in the first one,i do agree with those that you know that this was the only movie that was
1,this movie does a good enough to give it an r,this is the first film i saw with my parents
1,this film does a good job of,this is a film of sorts
1,watching this movie was a good idea,watching this film is a waste of time
1,moreover the movie is not so bad,moreover the plot is very good
1,everything is so stupid and the acting is so bad that you ca ca n't even,everything is just as bad as it gets but the movie is just plain awful
1,cravat is the only reason to get this movie and the only good performance of the entire movie is the performance,cravat and a friend of the gang are the two roommates who have the power to be the first victim
1,i was so bored that it was so hard on this show to,i was so excited that i did n't see the whole thing
1,this movie does n't even have the decency and the,this is the worst movie i 've ever read
1,the movie is not a comedy or a comedy but rather,the story of the movie was a bit too long
1,it is the most important thing about it,it 's the story of a man who is
1,darius 's character does n't seem to,darius is an excellent character actor
1,let 's just hope that you will be disappointed by what you 're seeing on screen as,let me tell you it 's a bad film and a waste on an excellent cast
1,la antena was a film that i had never,la confidential is the best of the four
1,also the film is a complete mess of a story,also i think that the director was trying hard to get
1,and the film does n't even have the benefit,and the acting was n't that bad and the acting
1,of course there is no real story and the acting is not good,of the many people who commented about the film 's flaws are that it
1,it 's a very good film,it 's a very simple film
1,stunning and very touching and a great movie for the family,stunning cinematography and a very good soundtrack by max steiner
1,it 's a very funny show,it was n't a bad thing that
1,and the ending is so predictable that you ca n't help thinking the movie is going to be,and the film does n't seem like a movie that is the most interesting to have seen
1,this is a film that is so,this movie is a complete mess
1,why did they do so much,why do they have to make a
1,but the film 's biggest problem was that it,but the film is a very good one
1,duchovny is the best actor i 've ever heard and he is very good in it as a character he has a great,duchovny is an actor and his character is so bad that i could not help thinking that this was a bad film
1,i'm sure the director had some ideas for this one and the film is n't that great but this was,i'm sure that the movie was made for a buck but i would n't want the movie for anyone
1,during a visit in the woods he finds a new partner and a young boy named duncan who 's been a big success since the first time,during the first few minutes the story of this film has a very good premise and is told in a very simple fashion and it does n't have
1,and that is the reason why this show sucks is the fact that the characters,and it 's not even the best of the bunch that it was n't
1,school is a very good film that is a,school is the best thing about the film
1,the story was n't bad enough and the characters were not developed in a believable way,the story is very simple and the characters and situations were believable the acting and directing were
1,the acting is good and i liked how the,the movie is a bit of a mess
1,so what i was looking forward for,so if i had the choice of the
1,it 's not even the kind it 's just a waste of,it 's a great movie to see in a movie theater
1,the acting was horrible the script is terrible and there are no plot holes and,the acting is pretty good and the script by eric is very well written
1,a few of the other comments here have criticized the overall rating of this movie 1 for,a few minutes later the movie goes on and we get an idea of what happened
1,although the plot was not original i was not impressed with the characters and the plot,although the story of the film is not a complete mess it 's a good movie to
1,now that i know i 'll get a few laughs and i 'll give it a try,now i do have a problem with the movie but i think it 's a bit too long
1,the acting in the movie was excellent and the acting is good,the movie is a bit slow but it 's still a good movie
1,the film has some of its most unintentionally humorous scenes in it,the movie has some good acting and the story lines are pretty good
1,many scenes were shot in the back yard,many people who say it 's bad but not
1,but this movie was n't even close as a horror movie it is just a,but the film is n't so great that it 's not even worth renting
1,i have seen it many many times before,i was surprised to learn that i was watching
1,perhaps this was the only movie to make it to the screen in a hurry,perhaps this is the only film that i 've had to sit back lap my finger
1,this is the best movie that i 've ever seen,this is not a movie that i would watch over and
1,now i am still wondering if the film is going to be made for tv,now i do not think that a film like this should have been made
1,in fact it 's a very good film that will be a cult classic,in the end he is a little confused and he 's not even that good
1,the film is a very funny film,the movie has some nice moments but the
1,it 's a shame that this is the,it is not a movie for everyone
1,why do they have to make this one of,why did n't the police stop the show
1,also the movie was very funny,also a good film is not to
1,it 's the kind that makes you think,it 's just a shame that the film is
1,i was surprised to find that the director had to do a bit of research to create a new movie,i have seen the movie multiple dozen times and i still feel that this is one of those movies that i
1,i have to say the acting is great,i think this is an interesting story
1,i'm not sure what to expect from the movie but this one is a great example to the genre and should,i'm not sure whether i should have had the movie 's soundtrack on the soundtrack cd or the dvd cover
1,raoul walsh 's film is a film with an interesting story and some good performances,raoul walsh is an amazing writer but he has no idea what he is going for
1,we have to be careful to see this film as a child 's movie,we have seen this movie several months ago and it is still a great family
1,blessed with the first two seasons and a very good episode i found this one to really show the real world of the,blessed with his own style of film making and the fact that he was a very popular director and writer and director
1,branagh is the only reason i gave this,branagh 's direction is a great deal
1,i was n't expecting much but i found this movie very disappointing in the beginning and the ending was so bad that it was a,i was n't really expecting anything from this movie and it was a bit disappointing to be honest but it was a great film
1,this is a very bad show,this movie is a complete waste of
1,the acting and the script is so bad that it is n't even funny,the film is a very good movie that should be seen by everyone who enjoys
1,it 's a shame because the movie was a little,it was so funny and it made me laugh
1,incidentally the director of a great deal of time spent the movie restoring the story,incidentally the story was not so good and the actors were all very good
1,we get an explanation that the characters are all the same,we 're talking about the same old thing and the same thing
1,accept the fact that the movie was made in a hurry,accept it as the most important thing about the film
1,the story line is about the only people who can survive in,the story is simple but the story is very well told
1,if you want to see the worst film ever produced this film is the best,if the director and his friends are going to make the mistake to be a good
1,if you are a fan of this kind of movie you 're going to be,if i had to give it the benefit it deserves a 10 out there
1,i think this movie has a good cast and,i do think this movie should be made
1,its just a waste of time and money,its not a good movie but it 's still
1,thomas is a very talented character actor,thomas 's character was a bit of an
1,the film is very well done and the,the movie is a very good one
1,to me it 's a great movie,to me it 's the only way to
1,i have to say that it was the worst film i had seen in a theater,i think that it is a very good movie and i think it should be the one
1,he 's just as good in the role of the,he 's not the best actor in this picture
1,also the scene where the two men get killed is just another one that i would have liked,also i think the movie is very good in the same sense as the original series and that 's
1,nicely photographed with great acting and a great score by max steiner it was nominated to be a classic film of,nicely photographed and directed by john carpenter this film is a must have for anyone with any interest at all
1,this was the worst movie ever made,this film does not have a lot of
1,i have seen a lot worse movies and i 've seen better,i was expecting a movie about a bunch of people who were in
1,too bad that it 's not a good film,too often i think it 's the best thing about
1,it has the same kind that i,it was a very funny movie
1,there was a lot of action in this movie,there are a few good moments in the movie but
1,the movie is about a bunch of friends who are sent into a world where each other has to fight for their lives in,the story is a little too thin for its time but the film is a little too slow and too dull for me
1,hoffman is also excellent as the conflicted and very,hoffman is a very funny and sexy man
1,just like in a few films you have to wonder why the movie was made in,just as the movie is about to be done and it is n't the same
1,there are some good moments and some very good moments,there is a scene in which the girl is walking around
1,however the plot is not really that bad and,however it is the best of it all
1,there was a lot to be learned about the movie,there is no way the characters in the film were any
1,although the plot was not as strong or original it was a bit more fun than most of his later work,although the movie does n't seem to have any real connection it does not have to do with any other
1,although i was n't a fan i still thought it was a pretty good show,although i do not think that this film was intended as a comedy it certainly was
1,the movie is a very funny film with a lot more laughs thrown in,the acting and direction of this film are absolutely horrible and i ca n't believe
1,she is the one who has no idea of what her mother is,she is also a great actor but she is n't the best in the
1,it has a good story line and,it 's not a bad movie
1,tracy has a good role as a young man who has to deal to get a little more money,tracy is a young man who is in the business for an unknown life and has no idea about the
1,the acting in all of these roles is very good especially from the leads,the film has a great cast and the supporting actors are all excellent
1,the story of the movie revolves around a young man named erik,the story of this is a bit of an excuse for the viewer
1,most movies of the time are made of this kind of film,most of the time it 's a little too long and i think
1,to be honest it was not a good film,to be sure i do have a soft core of
1,the film 's story follows a group of,the film is a very moving experience
1,it has a very funny plot and is very funny,it 's just a shame that they never made a sequel
1,there was n't a single moment to this one,there was a lot of action and some really good
1,seeing this film was like watching an early 80 's tv show,seeing the same thing over and present of the same old same old
1,it has a lot of fun but it 's not enough,it is a very good film with a very good story
1,as i watched the film the story of a young girl named lucy 's father 's mother and her mother 's family 's relationship,as a result i found the story and characters to be very engaging to watch but it was not a very good film
1,rob reiner is an excellent director,rob lowe is the only actor who
1,with a few minor exceptions the movie is not a total disaster,with the exception the acting the script and the special effects were all
1,it is a very simple story,it was a great idea for a
1,in a way it does n't work for a film that 's not a good one,in the meantime the movie is set in a very small country and is set in new
1,some have commented on this film and it is,some of the scenes are just plain boring
1,you know it is a comedy and it is so bad that you ca all about it,you have the usual hollywood formula and the usual clichs and you have a recipe to the movie
1,that is what this movie is about the way,that 's why i gave it an extra
1,the acting and script is so bad that i could,the acting was n't as great as i expected
1,i do n't know why but i was a,i was so bored to see the film
1,essentially the film 's plot is a little too convoluted and predictable to follow and it 's just not interesting,essentially this film was shot on video cameras in a very grainy manner and it looks like a cheap production
1,i have never seen any other film before but i was surprised that,i have never seen a movie that has such a great story
1,i was surprised at all the comments about this movie,i think that the film was shot at the height and
1,i was n't impressed with this one,i think that it 's a very funny
1,it 's a shame that the film is n't even worth a watch if you 're a,it has the same kind that i have seen before but the story is very good
1,ultimately it 's not as good as it 's been in the us and the film does not have any of it 's qualities it 's not even a,ultimately i have n't read the book and i have to say that the ending does have an interesting element but it does n't work for a sequel
1,however it is a good movie,however it is a film that is
1,it 's just that bad and i have to say i was n't expecting much,it 's a great film and it has to go to the top of the world
1,we 're talking a bit about the story of the two brothers who are married to each and everyone else,we are left with the same feeling that you have to see this one as it is not a movie
1,mainly because of the lack in this movie the,mainly the story line is a little confusing
1,although i have seen it several times i can still remember it fondly as the first movie was a masterpiece,although the movie does n't have a lot of action and some really nice twists and some good acting the movie
1,he is a very nice man,he is a very good character
1,add a little extra humor to the film but you have a very good movie with a good cast,add to that the great acting by a bunch of guys who are not a bad guy and you have
1,his character was a little more annoying and he seemed to be a rather unlikable person who would have,his acting is a bit wooden but it 's not a bad film and is not a movie
1,i was surprised at the amount of violence i have to endure this,i was expecting something like this to be the worst movie of the year
1,wayne is a great character actor who is a great character actor,wayne 's character is so unlikable and his character 's motivations are not
1,i was so bored to see this movie,i think the movie is really bad but it
1,left to be watched by a young man who has been living for years and has been a successful actor in many of his other movies,left to the viewer 's imagination to be a bit more experienced and more experienced than in a film like this one is the only way i
1,if i had a problem with the movie it would have made a better film and the film could have been much,if it was n't for the good of the film and the fact it did n't get the recognition it deserved
1,if i could give a copy i might have a good idea of what this is supposed to mean,if the movie is n't bad enough there is a scene in this movie that i could barely see
1,if it 's not a little bit of an improvement,if it was n't so bad it 's funny
1,2 the movie is so awful that,2 the plot is very simple
1,i have seen this movie many times and i still,i think the movie has a lot of potential
1,the movie has a very strong plot line,the film has a great cast and it 's
1,that was the best part of the movie,that is the most obvious aspect of it and
1,there is no real reason for this movie,there are a few things i do enjoy most
1,i have to agree the first one was,i think this is an important movie
1,it is a movie that you can watch and laugh at and enjoy and laugh,it is n't a film that will appeal to you for a few laughs
1,this is not a movie about a group that is trying to make their,this is a movie that you will watch over the past 15 minutes
1,this is the first of the three films that the director,this movie has the potential to become a cult classic
1,annie and her friends have been married and married with the other two,annie and emma are the two main reasons to watch this film and they
1,let me say that i do n't think this is the only film,let me just tell the story of the story in the end
1,as the film opens we are left wondering why we are left with the characters,as the movie goes on its success is a lot of the film 's atmosphere the
1,beverly hills was a great movie,beverly d'angelo plays the part of an
1,my favorite scene involves the scene where the guy is trying a gun to get his hands,my favorite scene in the movie where a woman is raped by the girl 's face
1,gee the film 's plot is a little convoluted,gee i have seen the movie and it has been
1,they are both a good movie but not a good movie to watch,they 're not the best of the bunch but they are all pretty good
1,the acting was horrible the plot is awful the acting is bad the directing awful it is n't funny,the film is very slow moving and the acting was horrible and there was nothing in the film which was
1,it 's just a bad film with no,it 's not a movie for everyone
1,he has been in a coma for a long time and he has been sent back from the war to save his wife and his family,he is a good guy and he 's not just the bad actor he is a good actor but he is not a bad actor
1,although this movie does n't seem to be much of an improvement on it,although the film is a bit dated it 's also a bit dated
1,what a waste of money and effort,what 's worse is this film is so
1,there 's also an excellent scene in a bar that,there was a lot of action in this movie
1,ellen barkin and her brother 's daughter and the two men are,ellen barkin and her husband are the only one to survive
1,seriously i think this was an excellent movie,seriously it 's a good movie to watch and
1,and the film is a complete mess,and the movie is a little too much
1,that 's what makes this film so enjoyable,that was a big mistake in a good film
1,there are some great actors who make you want to know the characters but you ca n't do anything,there 's no reason to see it unless you 're an insomniac or a fan or a masochist
1,doris wishman has a great talent and he does a good work,doris day and his wife are a young couple who are married to
1,the acting is very poor and the script,the story is about the same thing
1,it 's a shame to see such an ensemble cast in such movies,it has the same kind of humor as i 've ever seen
1,would n't it be a good movie to have to have it be made,would have to say the least bit more than i can think about
1,we 're told the story is a simple one,we 're not talking with the camera and it 's
1,also the ending is a bit abrupt but i do n't think that this movie has any of it,also i think that it 's the only movie i saw with a real budget that was made to entertain
1,ooh it was n't the best movie ever,ooh the acting was horrible the directing awful
1,if you are looking for a fun movie with a strong message,if you are into this movie you will probably like this
1,it has the feel that it was made in a week of filming but it is n't,it was a good idea for the movie to have a plot and it did make sense
1,why is it that the only reason,why do they make this movie
1,the film is not about the war but about how a man who has,the story line has all sorts and the movie has some good points
1,this is a film that is so good it 's funny,this movie is not a good movie it is just a waste
1,seeing it is a waste your time,seeing the movie is a good example for
1,a very funny and funny comedy,a very interesting film and a very
1,other characters have been introduced to a little girl who has been in the,other reviewers seem to think that this is one of my favorite films
1,if you want a movie that is not bad and bad this,if you have not seen the movie i would say it
1,but it 's just a bad movie and,but this is not a bad film
1,other than that the movie has a few moments of comedy and it is very well acted by the actors,other than that there is a lot of action in this movie and there was a lot more action
1,his character was a little more than the sum,his character is a caricature of an aging man who
1,although the story line was n't as good as the original and the acting was good,although the plot is n't as good and interesting as the first one it still manages to
1,this film is one that should never,this movie is not for everyone
1,allinall the movie does have a good deal of,allinall the movie has a very interesting story
1,the movie was n't even good enough for the viewer to laugh at it and laugh at,the film has a few moments of humor and it does n't seem to make a point
1,i do think the director should stick the movie to a new level of music in,i have never read the original novel and this was one i had n't read
1,these two films are not so much different than the ones they 've made but this one has a great cast,these are the things i liked about this movie but it was so stupid and i could n't help thinking that it
1,he 's a very funny and funny guy,he 's a good actor but the movie is
1,for the rest the film is a bit long,for the rest of it you have to have the
1,one of the best movies i have ever had the misfortune of watching and i was very disappointed,one day i watched this movie and i was very disappointed in this movie i was very disappointed in
1,yes the movie is not about the same subject matter,yes it has some funny parts and some really funny moments
1,despite this film it 's a pretty bad movie,despite its flaws this one is n't bad either as
1,i have n't seen the original movie and i do n't think that it was a good movie,i was so excited to find out what the director was trying and saying to his audience
1,any movie that can possibly compete is a disgrace for the director,any of the characters in a story of the real life or the
1,it 's the same story of a young girl named lena who is attracted and sent into a prison of,it was the most expensive and most expensive film in the world and it was very much a waste
1,although the movie was made for tv i would n't have had it in my collection,although the plot is somewhat predictable the acting and script is so bad that it 's hard
1,every time he gets a chance he does n't know what to make up until he realizes that he can get away with it because he does,every time i watch a movie i have to say it is the worst movie in the world but i 've seen it a million times
1,beckett is the only character that is believable and he is not only a likable man who is a very good,beckett has a lot of fun making the film and it does not take a lot to get to it
1,if you want a film about sex sex drugs or nudity you will love this film,if i were a little kid i would be surprised that i did n't see this movie
1,coupled with a great deal of humour and the usual gore scenes it was very funny and the acting was good,coupled with the fact the movie is set in the future the film is not about a man trying and the girl
1,the movie is a very bad movie,the movie was a little too short but
1,he has a very small role as the head of a car salesman and the rest of the cast is very well done but the script and the direction were very poor and it is a very,he 's the only one who can get a grip on his own personal demons that he is n't able to do so he is not the only one to be killed in his own ways
1,she 's not a good actress,she is not a great actress she
1,the acting in all of his other movies has been a bit over the edge but the script does not work,the acting was horrible the directing horrible and even the special effects are bad and it 's not even the worst movie
1,here 's where the movie starts,here is where i really really think
1,just as i watched the movie i had the opportunity to watch it again,just like a lot of people who are n't even in their position for the
1,after a while the film becomes more of what it is,after all these years i 've seen a number of films that
1,another thing i liked about this film was that the story,another problem is this one is n't a great movie
1,currie is the best in it but his acting is so bad,currie 's acting skills and other oddities are not as good as they
1,they are both a very funny movie,they 're all in the dark
1,the film 's premise has the same effect as it does,the story was a little weak but there was a good twist
1,larry and his gang of friends are invited to,larry is an old man with no experience
1,the story is a little thin but it does n't matter,the film is a little bit of fun but it is a
1,my favorite character is a fat fat kid who is constantly bullied and then killed off with a machete and a few other guys,my friend and i went to see a screener of the movie and i thought i 'd check it up for a while i did
1,and the ending is just so lame that i was left speechless,and that was not the case with this one but it was n't
1,so i do n't know if this movie really made me angry or not but,so the plot of course was a bit too predictable for my own good
1,it is a very good movie,it 's just that there 's a
1,philippe 's father and daughter have been married to a young man who 's been married to the other,philippe has a very good role as one character who is the only one in a family that has a
1,whatever it is the story is not as good as,whatever it was i was expecting to be entertained
1,i think that this was an excellent show and it 's,i think it 's the worst movie i ever seen
1,the movie is not about people who do things like that they have a good time and a bad man,the film has no redeeming quality and it is a pity to see such an amateurish movie in the future of
1,most importantly the film is not a documentary,most people are talking about the movie
1,jack frost is the first film of the,jack frost is one of his best
1,anyone with an iq of the imagination can relate with this,anyone who does not like it is the only one who is
1,a few of my friends have been exposed to the film and i do not know what to say about this movie but i do agree to say it was a little slow,a lot happens but i have to say that the acting is very bad and the story is very weak and the characters do not seem to care much at all because it is
1,devoted and the only thing that kept the film together is how the director managed,devoted and the film is very well made and is one of those movies
1,the story is simple and the acting is n't as great and it is not a good film but it,the story is about the same old man that he is told by an american woman and his wife
1,but the movie is n't as good as some have suggested,but the film is so bad that i just ca n't stand
1,the story is simple and it 's not a good thing but it 's not,the acting is good but the script is so bad that i ca n't believe how
1,the acting is very good but the script is so bad that you can see the director slipping away from his chair,the acting was terrible the directing was terrible and i was embarrassed by the fact that it was n't a comedy
1,well the movie does have some funny scenes but it is,well i guess i do n't know what to think
1,peter falk plays a man who is a struggling man and,peter falk is great in his portrayal as an american
1,i'm not sure why the movie is n't a complete mess,i'm not a big big football fan and i did n't have
1,the film is not a documentary of the life that it is,the film 's story is very simple and is a bit of fun
1,however i have seen the film and it was very disappointing,however the film is a bit slow and too boring to make
1,i have to say that the story was pretty good,i have to admit i was impressed by the movie and
1,great movie with great acting and a good script,great performances by the leads and great actors
1,just as a man with the help of his son and his friends and his friends who are,just do n't get your hands on this film you have a bad case of bad movies
1,the story line is about as good in a horror film as i 've been and,the acting is horrible but it 's not the fault that i would have liked
1,that 's why this is a film that has been done so well,that said the film was a bit too slow but the ending was a
1,after a couple minutes the story is told by the narrator,after seeing the film i was surprised at the fact
1,the film is a little slow but i do think it was very good,the movie starts off with an extended prologue that will make you think about how
1,as for the story it was n't a bad movie,as for the story line it has a lot to say
1,while i am still a fan of the original and the manga i can only say it was a little disappointing for me to see it again,while the movie was not a great movie it still is one big disappointment for the viewer who would be interested if it was n't so good and
1,in fact it 's not even the worst,in the end it was n't even worth the
1,that is the only reason why i gave it,that said the film was a little slow
1,it has been said by the writers of the story to be able of a good movie,it has a lot going on in this film and it 's all about the characters
1,he is a very talented actor but he does n't have to,he 's not a bad guy he 's a good guy
1,do you know that the film 's biggest success is the title,do n't get me wrong the movie has some good moments but it
1,homosexuals are n't always a lot more interesting and the movie is a lot better than this one but it was not,homosexuals who have been in the military have been in a military prison for years and years to find the truth of their
1,natural york has a very good sense of humor and is a great movie to see,natural york is an amazing film about the evils in a society that is so much different
1,a good cast including a good script and an interesting,a very good movie that is a good one
1,well it has been a while since i 've read a review of the film and i have read it,well the film has a lot to recommend and it is not the worst film i have ever seen
1,the story is simple and the characters and the story are all very well,the acting was terrible the script was awful but it was n't bad
1,but i was n't impressed by the fact that the movie is not as much a masterpiece as it is about a group in,but this movie does not have a lot of problems and it 's not really all about it 's a very good idea
1,then i got to know the movie,then the movie is over again
1,it 's not a movie for everyone,it has a very good cast and a
1,rugged little kids who do n't seem too much and have,rugged to the point that the film is almost unbearable
1,by the time i was watching the film it was a bit of an accident for my,by all means this is a very good movie and one that i would watch again
1,captain nemo 's daughter is a good guy but it was n't,captain sam and his wife lisa are in fact an attempt to get
1,before i saw it i was n't impressed,before the film 's release the dvd is a
1,the movie has the feel that a,the film is a complete bore
1,we get a glimpse at the characters that we do n't know and care about,we 're told the movie 's plot is not that good and the story does have
1,the film is a little bit of a disappointment but it 's still a great,the movie starts as the story unfolds in a series called a serial killer
1,the film is a complete bore to the point that you can almost,the film has a great story to it but it 's not
1,this is a movie i will not forget,this movie was a waste for me
1,its a great movie and i recommend it,its a great show for a family movie but
1,then there 's a few scenes of a couple of scenes of a man 's life,then there are the usual characters who do not seem to be in any way shape or

1,in fact the film is so boring and the ending of it is just too,in a nutshell i have to say i was very surprised by this movie
1,i think this is one of those shows which,i have never seen a movie like that
1,as the film continues the film descends deeper and more into an intriguing and suspenseful experience of the nature and nature,as for the story it is a little confusing to be a horror movie and a bit of a letdown
1,the movie is a little too long and it 's too hard on to the end,the story was so bad that it was actually quite funny and i thought the acting was
1,rico is not a bad movie,rico is an interesting character study of
1,the film is about the struggle between the characters and the story,the story is simple and it does a lot of justice to the
1,it was so bad that i had to stop watching the movie to the very worst end,it 's a shame that the movie was made in 1995 so that 's a shame
1,that is why the story of an innocent boy who has to cope,that 's why i think this movie is one of my favorites
1,the movie is not a bad film and the acting is terrible but the,the story of the movie and how it was written is one sided
1,it 's a shame because the movie is a complete mess of a sequel to the book which was,it is n't that it 's not a bad idea but a few people are killed and killed
1,i have to say the film was a waste of time and money and i do n't know if it was the same thing i,i think it was an accident to see a movie that could have been so bad that it would have made a good film
1,unfortunately i have to say that this is the worst horror i ever seen,unfortunately i was n't impressed by the fact that this film is a remake of
1,i do think that the acting in it was a joke,i do n't know what to do with this movie
1,shame that it 's so bad,shame that the film has a few
1,after seeing the first episode i was impressed,after the first half i was n't expecting much
1,after all these things are the only ones that can get the,after all the hype of the movie is a bit misleading
1,he 's a good actor but the rest is just bad,he was also the most annoying character in the entire show but
1,simple story about two young men who have a relationship with each of them in a very different way that is a little different from the,simple story about a young man who is diagnosed by a mysterious man who is a little of a coward and a very handsome man
1,a few minutes ago we get a glimpse of a man 's,a lot more of the film would make a great film
1,gulliver is the only reason to make this show to the screen,gulliver was a very good character actor and i was impressed by how
1,i do n't think that the movie was meant but it was just a good film,i do n't know why i have to say that i was so disappointed in the movie
1,the movie is a complete mess,the story is a simple one and
1,also it was a very good movie,also the scene where the hero was shot
1,the film has a few faults and it has the usual suspects to,the movie was a bit long for me but it was n't
1,if it was a drama i would be ashamed to have it in my collection,if i had the choice to see a movie that could n't get worse it would
1,for me it was just a bad movie,for those of you who are looking to see
1,hey i 've seen this movie several years and have n't seen it in years and i have to agree,hey i know that this is n't my first movie but i have seen it twice and never tire
1,if the movie does have a few laughs it 's the best movie ever made,if you have a choice to see this movie do it a couple of hours and
1,michael moore 's character in this movie is,michael caine is a fine character actor
1,if you 're going through it you will be able to suspend disbelief for the,if the movie was so boring i would n't have been able into this
1,the story of the film was a bit too long but it was a little too long,the film is about a young woman whose life is not a love affair but she is a
1,none the worse it 's the only thing that keeps me interested,none is a movie that is so bad you ca only laugh
1,why do we care what we are talking about,why did the filmmakers have such a good sense to
1,the film 's main character is the hero,the film is a bit slow and slow but
1,but it does n't matter that the,but this film was a waste
1,all the actors are all pretty bad but the actors who play their,all in all i think that the film is a good example
1,i was n't sure why this movie got made,i was n't expecting a lot of things but i
1,one can see why the actors are so bad they 're just,one of them gets to be the one in a movie
1,unbelievably this is the kind that i would n't have seen,unbelievably it 's the only one i can think about
1,if i were to make an overview of the film i 'd say that it is a film that i would watch over and of course but it 's still not a,if you are not familiar about this film and are looking forward into watching it i would advise you that you are not going for a long long time to waste
1,soon the two men are reunited in a strange relationship that leads to a tragic ending which makes the film,soon the movie begins to unravel the fact that this film is a remake of thunderball 's classic classic
1,the film is a very good example for a good movie but it 's not a good one,the film is a little slow but it 's a very interesting and interesting film that has a lot
1,8 out of 4 stars for the film,8 the story of two men is an interesting
1,as a matter of fact i did not like this film,as i said the film does have a few moments of suspense
1,he 's a great actor but his,he is not a bad actor
1,this is a film that will make a lot of money to watch,this was the first movie that was released on the imdb 's bottom 100
1,if i had n't watched this i might have been a fan of the original series but it was a little slow,if it was n't so obvious that the film was made in the 70s it 's still not a great movie
1,and the film 's climax is a,and the film does not work
1,foot has a very low budget but i do not think that,foot is the story that is a bit of an adventure
1,the acting in the movie is excellent,the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,and that 's what the director should,and the acting is pretty good and it
1,the acting was horrible the story is awful and the acting just was n't bad enough but the movie itself was just plain awful,the movie was made in the seventies with a lot of action and a lot to think of it 's just not funny
1,the movie is about two men in the city who decide their life to be a little more interesting,the story is about a bunch in a different way than the one that the other two are
1,it is not a film that is so boring,it 's the same thing that the movie is so
1,the acting in this film was horrible the acting was,the movie is a complete waste of your time
1,i was surprised at how bad a movie can really do with a good cast and good actors and a decent story line to make you laugh,i do think that this is the best movie of the decade but it 's not a bad movie it just does not have a good plot and
1,even the actors are n't as good as the actors,even the actors are n't as convincing and the script was
1,there was a lot of action to be made,there are a number of scenes that are very well
1,as a result of the film 's success it 's a shame,as a result the film was shot in a small budget
1,a lot of the humor is in the way the characters are portrayed and the characters are all very likable and believable and the story is a good thing,a lot of the film is about the family and the way they live in the dark city and the hardships and feelings they live in and the way they
1,sixth sense the first one is the,sixth grade is one of those
1,the film has an interesting premise but is very boring to watch,the film has no redeeming qualities at least not for it
1,i was surprised that the story was so predictable,i was n't expecting the usual suspects that were made
1,it is a movie about two people who are trying their lives and their lives and the consequences they get from each others who love to live and love,it is a shame because i do not think this was a good movie because i was n't impressed by it and i think it 's a very enjoyable movie
1,the film is not a bad movie but a lot of fun,the film is very well directed and the characters are believable and well
1,ghosthouse was an interesting and original story of a family of four sisters,ghosthouse is the most interesting film that i ever saw in my life
1,it 's a shame because the movie is not,it 's a very funny and funny movie
1,however the film does n't seem to have any real problems,however i was n't sure if i was supposed to be interested
1,we get an idea about the story of the characters and the way it was,we 're talking about the characters that are the main characters in their life
1,the movie is a bit too much for me but i really enjoyed it and i loved this one,the story is about a man who lives with his wife in a small town with the family
1,after seeing a film that is so bad that you wonder what the hell were going through it all,after all it 's a film about a group that is not a very good movie but it 's not
1,peoples 's performance is not bad,peoples 's a real estate agent who
1,waiters are the only reason why i give it a 2,waiters and gentlemen are the ones who are n't in this movie
1,it 's not a bad movie but it is n't,it was n't the worst movie ever it 's the only
1,devito is one that is n't even funny at the same level but it does n't really,devito is the best of the three actors and he plays the role of one man
1,lynda is a very good actress and she is very good as the mother who gets a job of,lynda is a good actress and i have to say that i was surprised to see the movie
1,what i got is a film that is so bad its actually funny,what is more important is that it was n't released at all
1,lucky enough the movie has some good points and the,lucky enough for me it 's a good movie
1,maria is a young woman and she is a little too infatuated,maria 's father is a very nice guy and the two young lovers
1,it 's a very simple film with a lot of action scenes and,it 's a great film and it 's a great family comedy
1,but i have seen this movie,but it is a very enjoyable film
1,he has a great deal about his role as well as his character,he was a little bit too old to get into the character and he
1,too many people have to be told that the story is a lot better and it,too bad the director did n't make a movie that was a bit too much
1,she is the one who has no trouble of finding out who her friend,she has to be the most irritating character to ever grace a screen
1,this is a film for everyone who likes to laugh at the art of,this movie is not a bad one either but it 's not bad
1,almost every character in this film is just plain annoying,almost as good as the book but it 's not
1,alan arkin plays a man who is trying hard,alan rickman plays a very likable man and a good
1,there was n't a whole bunch of characters in the story,there 's a very nice scene where she is in a hospital
1,equipped with some very nice moments the movie is just a collection,equipped with the fact is that the movie has a few laughs and
1,actually this was a very good movie but it,actually the film does n't seem very original
1,it is a great film and one,it 's not a bad movie
1,it 's not a bad movie,it is a great show for all
1,this was one of those movies you just,this film is not worth your time
1,see this if it 's on cable,see this movie if you want it to
1,so what if the movie is about the real thing about a movie that,so the movie was made for a few dollars but it was not
1,it is a shame because the movie is not as good as some of the other movies,it was a great movie for me but i think that the movie is not that funny and
1,but the movie is a bit too slow at times,but it is a great film and a great example for
1,i have to admit that it has a lot of action in the movie,i was surprised to see this in the theater when i first watched this film
1,to say the most of it 's shortcomings is the way the story unfolds,to say the least this is an awful movie and i do n't know what
1,i think that the film has been made to appeal for the viewer,i think it 's a very good movie and a great one for those
1,in the end it 's a good movie but i ca all about it it has been made to look good and the acting is,in the end the only thing that could have saved this film from the 1 out of 10 was that it had been made
1,but the film 's biggest flaw is the fact the director is not able to make a movie with such,but it 's just not that bad and it has nothing to do with the plot or plot holes
1,i think that 's why this movie is a complete waste of my,i do n't know if i was in for a good movie
1,i do not think that the movie was meant but,i do agree that the film is very good
1,how could it be a good movie,how could it be so easy to tell
1,editing is very choppy but the script is so good it is almost painful to listen to the,editing and cinematography are all excellent and it makes for a nice surprise for the whole family
1,which is a pity as the movie is a very bad movie,which is a good thing because the movie is n't a total disaster
1,the merry de la bestia is a great example of how not a great movie can do,the maltese man' is the story about two young brothers in a different place in a country in
1,i was so bored that i did so i was n't disappointed,i was expecting the worst movie i have ever read but the film
1,there 's nothing to be said about this movie except,there is a lot to like about this movie
1,but it is also a very funny movie,but it was a very funny movie and i
1,it 's a great movie that i can watch,it is not a film that is not in its
1,however the film is not about the same,however this is a great film and a good
1,the story is simple the acting is good the characters is believable and the,the movie is a little slow and it has a very good cast
1,i was so bored to see this film i had a blast of my,i was expecting a movie to get a bit more interesting than that
1,the acting is horrible the script is terrible the,the film has a lot of good moments
1,i was expecting this movie to be,i was expecting a lot better
1,director david lynch has a very funny cameo in the film,director michael winner has a good sense of humour and a good
1,exceptional and exciting story about a man who has been sent,exceptional acting from the cast and a very touching story
1,to be fair the acting and direction are horrible,to be honest this is one of the most beautiful
1,i do n't want it but it 's just,i think this is a very good movie
1,but it 's a good film,but this is one of the few
1,firsttime director robert altman has made this film as well as the original the film is a great film,firsttime actor john gielgud who has an outstanding role as the detective of the accused and the young son of
1,gosh i have n't seen this movie in my,gosh i do not know what to say
1,not only was the plot very interesting and it was a little bit farfetched,not only is he not a good actor but he 's a pretty good actor
1,alas this film does not have a shred of,alas the movie was made in the us
1,she 's a very nice guy but she has a good,she is a very good actress and a great singer
1,kurt russell plays an annoying and unsympathetic character who is not a good actor and is,kurt russel is a fine director and a great director but it does n't work
1,but the story was n't so good and the acting was horrible and the plot was so bad,but the real star of this movie has to be the one that makes the story and this movie
1,the story was so bad it made me angry,the film is a bit slow at times
1,try to find the right balance between the original and the film is not a good one,try and see this one in order for it 's to come out of the ordinary and the
1,while the film has its flaws it is not a movie that will be remembered as a comedy,while i do agree with the other reviewer who said that i was n't impressed with it i was
1,aided to an end by a friend of the family of the murdered mother of,aided with a great cast of actors that make the most memorable movie ever
1,a few scenes were filmed and were very good,a lot of things i did n't like in the
1,lubitsch is a master of the art and his films are,lubitsch is one that has a great deal of talent
1,or is it that the film is not so bad it 's good and it is,or maybe the fact that the film was made by someone with an open interest
1,all in one i have to give up,all in all it 's an enjoyable movie and
1,and i was surprised at this film,and the movie is a little too much
1,though it is a bit dated it 's not a good movie either but the acting is pretty good,though the film has a few moments of unintentional humor it is still funny in the way they provoke the
1,but the movie does a very good start,but the movie was so bad that it 's
1,when he gets to the bottom and he 's on the run from his job he is forced by a group that is a,when i watched the trailer i thought the movie had a very good cast that was n't the main reason to watch it
1,i was surprised to find that the movie was not as bad but it was not the first one,i do not think this is the only way that i can think that a movie can be made by
1,tom cruise plays the role of a man in a small,tom cruise plays a very good role in this film
1,it 's a very funny film,it has a lot to say but
1,it has a lot of good action,it 's a pity because the movie does
1,personally i think the movie was made for the sakes of the,personally i think this film has a lot to offer it
1,the acting and direction is superb,the movie is a little too much
1,but it is a very good film,but the story is so bad that i
1,it 's not a movie to watch,it was n't a bad film
1,it 's not even worth mentioning to the film 's audience that is not the case with the movie,it is the most beautiful and most intimate of the three and i love that one scene in which she
1,i have seen a lot of movies and i have,i do n't think that it was a waste
1,ron perlman was great and he was n't just,ron howard is also good as his wife
1,it 's the story and acting of a very good cast,it 's a very good movie with excellent acting and an excellent
1,it 's a very good movie,it was n't a great movie but
1,i have seen it twice and i still do n't think it is the worst i have ever seen,i was expecting a lot of this movie but i found it to be very boring and boring
1,to be sure the movie is a bit slow and the plot line does n't seem to have any meaning,to be honest i was surprised that i had never seen a film that was so bad i just could n't
1,interviews with other people are the same as this movie which i,interviews that are supposed to be funny are just plain stupid
1,i do n't think that the film is a masterpiece but a good,i was surprised to see this film on the imdb bottom 100
1,he was n't a great actor,he has a lot of fun to
1,a few years later she was a teenager in a hospital,a lot of things have been done in the past
1,at least it was a good idea to get to know some characters,at least that 's why this movie sucks but it 's not
1,starring john wayne and robert morley who also starred in this film and i think it was the best performance,starring a young man who is a young girl and is able for revenge against his father 's family
1,the film 's premise is a bit thin and is a bit too long,the film has some very nice touches and a good pace to it
1,but the real problem is that the,but the movie was so awful
1,this was an excellent show and it was a great movie,this is one movie that i would watch over and over but
1,first of alli the movie was n't very good either but it is not that great either that is not a good sign,first off the plot line was n't really that interesting and i thought it was pretty boring but the acting is n't bad either
1,each episode features a lot of action and suspense,each character is one of those who are in the
1,in a way the movie is n't as good as the original but still it does not,in the meantime the film was shot in color and it 's a very beautiful film to look
1,strip club and the late '60s television are a very nice combination of the same and,strip of a hat is one of the best and best movies of all times
1,oh yeah i guess that was the worst movie i have ever seen but this,oh yes i know it 's a good movie but it 's just bad
1,the movie is about the struggle between,the movie is a complete bore
1,not only is he a bad actor he is a very good guy,not only does it look so real that it is difficult to believe it
1,anything that happens in the first movie,anything about this film was bad and i
1,i have n't seen a movie that is so bad,i was surprised that the movie was n't released in the
1,the story is very good the characters are believable the situations and the settings the music and,the story is about two people living in a city who have no experience or love
1,every time she 's on a train with a woman she decides to give the police a little of,every scene has an impact of a plot that could have easily been done with a tighter script
1,he 's a great actor and is very believable in this role,he is a man who is not afraid of being gay
1,he is a great director but the rest was not a great movie and he 's just not the only character that has any depth and the,he is not a very good actor and it does have some good points in it but he was n't the least bit likable at least
1,although i think the film has a lot of potential it is not the best movie i have seen in years to come but it is still good for those of you who are looking for a good film and have some of the great scenes,although this was n't exactly a movie i would have to say that this is a movie that is not only a waste but it 's a good film and it is a good example of how to make one of the best movies of our generation
1,i have n't read the book so much,i have to admit i was impressed
1,the story line is so predictable the characters are so unbelievable and the characters just are so unbelievable,the story of a man searching for his son and a girl who is a man who lives in
1,i do n't think that the movie is so good because i,i was n't sure if the movie would have been better
1,i do n't know if the movie was,i was so excited when it came
1,i have to say that this is a very bad film,i have never heard a thing before i did n't even know
1,it is not a movie about the dangers it presents in its own right and how it is in a world of people who have been,it was a very good idea and it 's a shame that the film is not so much better as a movie than a film
1,the story is simple and it 's not a bad film but there is no excuse for the,the film is a little slow paced and the ending was very predictable but it was n't
1,i was n't sure whether this movie was intended to be an homage or to make it a little bit different to other films like that but it 's a,i was surprised at how many movies that have made the same mistake in a long period of the genre and that is what makes the first film great
1,its just a shame that it has,its just not a good movie
1,so if you are looking for a,so i was expecting something more
1,there is a scene in the film,there 's a lot of action
1,this is a very bad film,this is a movie for all ages
1,the movie was shot on the cheap and was n't,the film has an interesting premise but is not
1,so if you 're not a diehard hollywood fan this is,so what if you 're going to get a movie
1,there is a reason for that,there 's a very good performance in
1,it was the first time i saw,it 's not a bad thing
1,this is a film for all those who like it and have,this is a very bad show with a very bad script
1,michael moore is one of the most underrated and,michael ironside is also excellent as his wife
1,the movie is a little slow but i do n't think it would be a good movie to,the film is a bit slow and the story is not as good as the first one
1,that 's what the movie is about and the fact that this,that 's the only reason i gave it the 2 stars
1,everything else about this show makes it seem like the writers are,everything in between and the characters are very believable as well
1,for those who are looking for a film that is not a good movie it,for me the film was a total failure to sit through the entire thing
1,and it 's not that it is bad or the,and it 's the best of all the actors
1,while the story was not as good it is not as good as it is in this one it 's not that great but it is still good,while it 's a bit dated it 's also a little bit of a stretch of pace for the rest of the movie to get a bit too much
1,by the way the film was made in the early seventies,by far the funniest movie i ever saw in a theater
1,the story is very weak the characters are shallow and the characters are just a little bit of a dimensional,the movie was shot with the intention to be in a movie that is so bad that it is almost unbearable
1,now the film is a total waste of time and a waste of time,now i do n't want my money but the movie is n't bad
1,in the meantime he 's the only person who has to choose to save the day,in the first part of a movie he is a man who loves to hate the woman
1,maybe he 's a little too much to be afraid but he has the ability to make it more entertaining,maybe he was the only character that could have been a little more believable but the film does have some good
1,rusty is a great actress but she has a great talent and she,rusty has been a favorite of mine and i can see why
1,tommy stewart was the only one who had a knack of acting ability and he,tommy lee jones' character is so bad that i actually laughed at the antics
1,only a couple of scenes are worth the trouble,only to be rewarded by the fact that the film
1,the story of the kelly family is a little weak but it is n't,the acting is pretty awful and there 's no plot or plot development
1,one of the best movies i have seen in a long time,one of the best movies about a man in the world and his
1,granted it has a few good parts but it does n't make any good movie,granted it was a great idea but it was not a movie that had the feel
1,yang and his crew of two friends and two sons of the pioneers have to deal and survive,yang has done a fantastic job of capturing the spirit and innocence and beauty of the characters in this
1,there is no reason for that to be a comedy or anything but a bunch of bad acting and a ridiculous ending,there was also an attempt to make the story of a little bit of a horror film but the story is not as
1,an excellent example of a film about the evils of war and the life of the,an old friend who is a bit more concerned with the situation than the others
1,my favorite part of the movie however is the scene where she sings in the club of the song,my only criticism of this film is the fact that it is not a horror film and it does have
1,there are many many more movies like the ones that were released in 1995 the story is pretty good and the acting and direction is,there was a scene where a young woman was raped and killed in the shower and then the woman was killed in her bed
1,most of the movie 's plot involves,most people will not like it
1,i do not recommend this film unless you are a fan of,i have seen it several times in the past 25 years
1,sweetly it was the first time i watched this i was so impressed by the movie,sweetly photographed with a handheld handheld camera and the camera work it was very impressive
1,father is a very nice person and he is a very talented man,father is a very good character and the story is a little too weak
1,this is one of those movies that,this film was a complete failure
1,mgm is a great film for the ages,mgm has a lot more money for making movies
1,but the movie was so good,but it 's not the worst of
1,however the film does n't have much in common,however the film 's biggest problem lies with the story
1,the film has a very strong cast but it has a,the story is simple and the story is so predictable
1,d the film was made in the early seventies but i was n't impressed,d i do n't think the director is going to be a good director
1,anyways this film was not the worst movie i have watched but that 's saying something,anyways i was n't disappointed by the fact it did get released on a dvd
1,it was n't a great movie but it is a fun and very,it 's the story that makes the film a little more entertaining
1,for a while i was surprised to find that i could n't find the words that were,for the rest of the movie the acting was terrible but the rest is pretty good
1,from there onwards the plot was pretty good,from the beginning of this movie it was obvious
1,jean gabin 's acting was so bad that i felt embarrassed for her character,jean gabin 's character is so much a part of his family that you wonder
1,one thing that makes me laugh is that the,one thing the film has going for it
1,it is n't a good movie,it was n't a good movie
1,i have never seen such a terrible film,i think that it would be better to have
1,the acting is good and i liked the characters and their characters,the movie is not about a man who is a master but he
1,it 's not the best movie ever,it 's not even that funny
1,but it was n't that great,but this film is not for those
1,the story is simple and the characters all seem to die,the story is simple the characters in the movie were not developed
1,i have to wonder if the movie was intended for children,i was expecting a movie that i had seen and was so
1,tonight 's the first movie i saw i was a fan and i was n't expecting anything more,tonight i had the privilege of sitting down to watch a screener and i had to watch it to
1,the film 's plot is a simple little bit of trivia but i found myself wondering why this,the story of the kelly brothers are the most interesting thing to come out of my mind
1,ewoks were the most interesting things to be made,ewoks are not a threat to this movie and it
1,but i have to say that the movie is a bit too slow and too boring,but the real reason is to make you want a movie like this that you have never
1,seeing a film with the director is not necessarily bad,seeing a movie like it 's a long way to be
1,low budget and the film is n't that interesting,low budget and a lot better than this
1,a good example of the movie 's success is,a few minutes later i was watching it
1,this movie was so horrible it 's funny to me,this is one of those movies that you will never forget
1,my favorite scene involves the two in which the guy says the word of,my favorite scene is where the guy is trying to kill the president
1,this is the first film i ever,this movie is a must see
1,robert montgomery and james stewart are excellent in the leads,robert englund is a great actor and i hope his career
1,but the film is a bit of fun,but this movie is a total bore
1,whatever the reason i did n't like it,whatever i do do i have to say the
1,although the film is a bit slow at first it does drag the viewer into a world of confusion,although the film was a little too slow for a few seconds and the story was n't too much
1,for those of you who have seen this film you have to be in a good,for a movie about the evils of war it is very well made and acted
1,i was so bored by the movie i had no expectations,i think this movie should be shown as a comedy
1,made in a very good manner the movie is not only a very poor,made for television movie it is a very good movie to be seen
1,by the time i watch it the whole thing is a mess of a movie with,by the end of this film i had to watch the movie to end it
1,is it the story of the mother who loves to hate her mother and,is it a comedy or is it an attempt by a serious director
1,this was one that could n't have been made in a hurry,this is one of those movies where you have no clue why
1,but the film is a very interesting one,but i think the best part of the movie
1,a good movie for the viewer,a lot of the scenes in the
1,the film has a very good soundtrack by the late prolific composer alberto de vaca,the story was so stupid and predictable that you would n't care if the characters were
1,to say the least the movie was a complete waste,to me this was a very good and interesting movie with
1,if the film is a little bit more than a little slow at the beginning it 's a bit of fun,if the film does not make a point about the subject of the film the story of the movie is that it
1,friz de vaca is the most beautiful and beautiful woman i have come across,friz freleng was the first movie to win the oscar for best picture
1,the movie has a lot of problems but the plot is a little too thin and the story line just does n't seem like,the film has a few faults in it but the film is not so much a drama as a drama and a drama
1,three men are sent into a war against the evil and they 're trying to escape from prison,three stars for the film and for that it is a film that will be forgotten for all ages
1,that 's a good thing because it 's a,that 's what i thought was that good
1,it is n't the best film ever made and it does n't have the same plot line,it has a very interesting story and some very good actors and the story is very good but
1,it was a very funny movie that i could watch over a weekend and,it has to be said the film is very much an action flick
1,her performance is the only reason that i have seen her in this one,her character is not so good and her acting is so awful that i could
1,a lot more people have said that this was the first of the series,a lot of the scenes were just too much to be taken seriously and the
1,like the other reviewers said this is the best movie i have seen in my lifetime,like the rest it is a very interesting movie and a must see film for everyone who
1,which brings me back to the film 's end of it,which i thought it was a great show and i hope that
1,a lot of it is filmed in a very dark,a very enjoyable film and a very good one
1,this is a film that is not only a visual medium,this movie is a complete waste of time and money
1,this is a film that i will never forget about,this was a movie i 'd like to see
1,so the plot of course is a little confusing but the acting was n't bad and i found myself wondering why they did n't even try to get it,so if you are into movies that have nothing to do with this one you should n't be disappointed but i think it 's a very fun movie
1,he is the only actor who has the talent of his role and is a delight,he is the one to do and he has a very strong and unique relationship with the
1,sometimes the film has some very nice touches but it is not,sometimes the film 's biggest asset is its ability at the audience to
1,several of us have already watched the film,several scenes were cut out and were n't really
1,count dracula is an excellent character actor who is a good guy and the only good part in,count dracula 's character has the same name as a robot who is n't really a villain
1,the film was shot on location in the early seventies and was shot on location,the movie was shot in color but the story was not a little original
1,the movie is a little bit of a mess but the ending was very well done and well done,the story line was good enough and i thought it was going to be interesting to watch but the story
1,it is not a movie for everyone but if you,it is not a movie for the faint hearted
1,it 's a very good story about a woman that is a teenager and a woman,it was n't even the first time round was made to look at the camera
1,as i said the only good thing in this movie is that the film has an,as a movie this is one of those films where it is not so bad
1,it 's a shame that such movies are never seen and released,it is a shame that such movies are n't available in theaters and
1,joel schumacher is the most talented director of all times,joel mccrea plays a man who has a heart transplant and
1,he 's not a good actor and a lot more,he 's a little too much of a wimp
1,the acting is very poor and the acting is just horrible,the film has some nice twists but is not as good as
1,half of the film consists and the characters were n't developed well and the plot,half of the movie was shot in the woods with the same camera angles
1,donald sutherland plays the role of a,donald pleasance was a good actor
1,it 's not even that much,it 's a shame that the film
1,just do a few examples of the movie,just as the movie was made i thought it
1,she is a good actress and she 's very good in the role of an actress,she is also a great singer but her role in a movie is not very good at
1,lol it is a good movie but the story is so weak that it is impossible,lol i have to give it a 1 out 10 because the movie was a little bit
1,now that i am a sucker of the show and it is a great movie i think,now i have a lot of respect for a movie that is not a good one
1,as a movie it fails to make the film unwatchable,as a result of his life the film is not as
1,being an old fan of the first one the movie had no redeeming qualities to the movie and the,being an avid supporter i have to say that the movie does n't make any money at all
1,in the meantime he is a young woman,in a way i think the movie would have
1,i think it 's the worst film i ever seen,i was expecting a good movie and i did n't get
1,they are all very good actors who are n't in the same,they 're just not funny and are n't even worth mentioning
1,if i was a little bit prejudiced it would be a good movie but it 's not,if i had n't been a fan for this film i might as much as i have seen
1,we have the same kind as this one and that it is the best,we have a very interesting and interesting story of a young girl in love with
1,matthau is one of my favourite directors and,matthau 's acting is excellent as well
1,victor 's character is a real hoot as well,victor mclaglen as a cop and a cop who is
1,i'm not saying this is a bad movie,i'm not going for the first time
1,then the film starts to drag down and down until a few minutes into,then the movie switches to another scene where the main character says something
1,the film 's premise of an assassination attempt to be interesting and the story is about a group called the war,the film 's story is not that interesting and the acting is not as bad although the story itself is n't too
1,the acting is horrible the plot is stupid and the acting is bad but i ca n't help thinking that a bunch of,the story line is about a bunch of people who have a very small party together with their parents and their parents
1,how did he get it in a movie with,how many times have we seen the movie
1,it 's the same story of two men who have been married,it has the most annoying character development i could ever want
1,it has the same plot and it 's a lot of,it 's not even the best film of its kind
1,when he 's in the car he 's a suspect,when i saw the movie on my local cable i was
1,though the film does contain a lot of nudity and nudity the film also has some very funny moments but the film fails miserably,though the movie is a bit dated the story line was very well written the acting superb and the story line was very good and
1,whoopi goldberg was great and it was nice to hear the,whoopi reynolds is a good director and a good director
1,not a good idea of a movie that was not a complete,not to be confused but it 's not a bad thing
1,the story is a complete mess,the story is very simple and the
1,i do not want to spoil the movie,i do agree with the previous poster
1,how did this film ever get released theatrically,how many of us can be subjected to the
1,i was surprised to see how many times the movie was made,i think it 's a shame to see a movie that is so
1,a few of them were so bad that you,a few scenes are very funny to watch
1,however this is a very good film and it has the same plot and the characters were all very good,however i have to admit this was not the worst movie in the world but it was good enough
1,she is the one who is in love and the other,she 's just a little too much for the part
1,got to see a film with a lot of potential to go to the movie industry in the world,got to the end of a film where the director of the book was a little more than a little
1,she has to go to the house to get her,she was the best thing about the whole movie
1,another example of this is the scene with a woman in the woods,another problem is this one has a lot of potential and the story is
1,that 's a shame because the story is so stupid and,that was the only thing that was funny in it
1,we 're told that we 're not going to be a hero and the hero,we are shown a few scenes where the camera cuts out of a window
1,i have to say i did n't like the movie,i have never seen a movie that has a good plot
1,overall i think the movie is a great success,overall i think the movie was very funny and had
1,according that it was made in the early 80 's it was a very,according one day the film is a long long and long run down
1,i have n't read any of the other posts here but it 's hard to believe,i think it is one of the worst movie i 've ever had to watch
1,there are some very interesting moments and some really funny moments but it 's not that good to watch it 's just,there 's a very funny and funny scene when the killer is in a coma and is n't in the car
1,they are not funny or funny,they are all so good that you
1,the movie was a little too short for a long time but that 's about it for me,the film is about a young boy who is a teenager and has a son who has a son
1,so if i could have a copy i 'd have to be,so what i got is a film that is a waste
1,the movie is a little bit too long,the acting and directing are all good and the
1,once the film begins it becomes clear that the director is not a very good person but he has a lot more time,once the movie begins to drag the story becomes increasingly convoluted and confusing and the ending leaves you wondering what is the outcome in
1,there are some funny moments but they 're not funny at least,there was a lot of good things about this movie but it did
1,despite the fact that the movie is a complete waste of money and time on the subject of this story it,despite being a bit of a fan of the original i found myself wanting to see a more mature film
1,was he really trying to save the day he did not,was this a good thing to do and the rest of the
1,there was no real story to the movie,there are some great actors in this one but
1,soon the movie starts with a bang and a little girl,soon after the film starts out with a bunch of young people
1,it was the first movie that i saw on the starz show that i saw,it 's the story of two young people in a different world who live together and
1,ben stiller was the most convincing in this film but his,ben stiller was a great actor and was really funny
1,the acting and direction are so poor that it 's almost impossible for him and the viewer to care about him in a scene,the acting is very good the script is good but the acting was terrible and the plot was just plain stupid and not funny at
1,some scenes are very well done,some scenes were just plain stupid
1,and the movie is a total bore,and the ending of this is very abrupt
1,if you want to watch something like this you will be very impressed by it,if you 're looking forward at all to see a movie with no redeeming quality
1,i was expecting something like that,i do n't know if this is
1,as for the film it is very well done and the,as for the story line it is a little confusing
1,if i were n't so impressed i 'd have to be a little less forgiving to the,if the film is not a comedy i would suggest you do n't watch this film
1,however i think that the director was trying too hard to get a few chuckles from the,however the film is very much like an action film and is a very enjoyable film
1,still it 's a very enjoyable film,still it is a great movie and a
1,i do n't want it ever to happen,i think that 's what this movie was
1,instead it is a very bad film,instead it has to be a little tedious
1,i was n't expecting much from it,i think the director should stick to the
1,essentially it 's just another mindless slasher movie that 's so stupid that i ca n't even begin to imagine how many times it is possible,essentially this movie was a waste of my favorites i have to say that i am not a movie buff but i have a lot more fun
1,second the movie is a little bit boring,second there is a lot to like about this
1,it has been done by other commentators and the film has a great soundtrack,it was a great movie and it 's not just a movie that is a
1,these are not some people who do not have to go and watch the movie,these are the only things that are n't bad and i do not care for them
1,at the beginning of the movie the only person that could possibly be the killer is not so good in the film,at first glance i thought this was an excellent film but it 's not a great film and i would recommend this movie
1,oh and the ending was n't even worth mentioning the ending,oh and the scene where the girl was walking around in the
1,there was no reason for the audience 's actions of this film,there 's no real explanation for the movie and the story is n't
1,it 's a very funny and entertaining,it has a very good cast
1,also the film is a little bit too long to be taken seriously,also the ending is very good and is a very satisfying experience to me
1,it 's just a shame that they did so many things that could have been made better,it was the best movie ever and that was one of them in the past and it was
1,i'm not saying it 's a great film and it is a good film,i'm not a prude and the only character in my entire family who can relate
1,he has been on the edge of his,he is a very good character actor
1,the acting in this movie is so bad i have to,the acting was good enough with a few good lines
1,motion picture of a man who is not in the right,motion picture of the same kind is a great deal
1,in fact it 's a very bad and very bad movie and i have no problem finding the film to,in fact it 's a very poor film that is not even worth renting for a couple of minutes
1,in this case the main characters are a bunch,in the end it was just another film
1,i was so bored when the movie started i was so excited that i could n't have a movie like that,i was so disappointed by this show and that it was so bad i just wanted the show to come out and
1,not only does it look like it was made by a junior high school class student but it,not only does the movie drag in the right direction it 's just not worth the time
1,a lot more than i expected,a few of them were so bad
1,i'm not a fan of the book or even a fan of any of,i'm glad that i did n't pay a penny to see the movie
1,however the film 's biggest flaw is the fact it has,however this movie is n't a good one at that
1,the story line is about a bunch of people who go,the movie is about a man who kills his wife
1,the story line is a mess of a movie and it has a,the film was a little slow but it was n't too bad
1,and the movie is n't a total disaster,and the film is a very poor attempt
1,the film was a little slow,the film is not about as much
1,his character has been a stereotype of many other characters in the series including a couple and,his wife and daughter are not in love with the other one but they are not
1,because of the film 's success i have a feeling of gratitude,because the movie was shot in a very grainy and very grainy fashion
1,this film is a complete disgrace,this is a very funny film with
1,malcolm macdowell is excellent as the woman and the supporting,malcolm mcdowell and robert montgomery were in this movie
1,the story is a little thin and the characters seem like they just did not know what they are supposed,the film 's story is very simple but the story and the performances are all solid with the characters
1,but i have no doubt that the director has been trying to be a bit of a success,but the movie does not have to be a complete mess and it 's a total mess
1,the movie is a bit of fun but it 's not as bad as the original it has some good,the movie is not about as much of a thriller as the original it 's just a bit slow
1,i have never been a fan of the series and i,i do not want a good story to be good
1,it 's a pity to see a movie that is n't even close to being the worst,it 's the only way to get a movie that is so bad and so utterly bad that
1,now i have to say that i have n't,now the movie was a bit too long
1,ever since i first heard of the movie i saw,ever i was n't expecting the worst of it
1,in the end the story is not as bad,in a movie with a cast of young actors and
1,ok the plot is pretty basic but the characters and,ok so i do n't know what to do
1,what i did n't like was the fact that it is not a horror flick,what i found a little disappointing was that they were trying to make a film out
1,the film is about a young man who lives in a small apartment in a country and his mother is killed,the movie is a little too long for the plot but there is n't much else in the film that makes it
1,i have to say this is one of those,i think it 's a very good movie
1,i think the film has a lot more to offer but it has a,i think the film 's biggest flaw is the fact of the matter
1,stanwyck 's acting is very convincing and the movie is,stanwyck is the only reason to watch her performance
1,but this is a movie that should have been,but i was n't disappointed with the movie
1,it is n't even the best of the three,it 's the kind that makes the show a classic
1,three men are sent to prison for the first time in time and they are left in the,three years after this one came out of the box i was still looking for a film
1,the acting is pretty awful the effects are poor the script sucks and the special effects were terrible and the story,the movie starts out with some great action scenes and then turns them off into some sort of bizarre thriller
1,but it 's not a bad movie either,but this is not a movie that is not
1,al is a good man and he is a very good fighter actor who is a very good guy,al pacino 's character is a caricature of a man in this film and it was a very good film
1,it was n't that bad but it was just bad and it was just plain boring in the end it was just plain bad and i do n't know how,it 's a very simple film with an unusual message to the film that it is not a very good one but it 's a bit of the same
1,director john woo has done some great job in films like this one but this one is a mess,director michael j curtis has created a movie which has a very good story line but that 's about it
1,not to mention the acting is awful and the plot is just plain stupid,not to mention that the movie is a total mess with a very weak plot
1,a few minutes later we get an endless glimpse into what the characters,a very funny movie and a must for anyone who loves comedy
1,a few minutes later the movie turns on a boring slow pace,a few years later the young man is still living on the screen
1,show the world is a great movie,show the two of us who are n't
1,bare breasts is a very good movie,bare breasts are the only thing i can
1,with the help that he has the most difficult time in the business his wife is a little more than a little suspicious,with this movie you will see the same thing as the one in which this movie was made and i think i will be
1,the story of the movie is based on a novel called the,the story is simple but the story is a bit weak
1,because i have never seen it in my life and it 's still very hard,because i do believe the story is not that good or even the actors
1,the film is a bit slow at best but it,the acting is good but the acting is horrible
1,do n't waste any money on this movie,do not watch unless your looking for the real
1,unlike many other films the plot has a few twists and surprises,unlike the other movies i have watched this is the best of the
1,although i think it is a bit of a bore it 's not a movie that will appeal,although i do n't have the patience of the actors i would not have to give it another one
1,it is n't a film for the faint,it was a waste on this film
1,likewise this film was a waste,likewise the story is not a complete
1,scorcese 's film has a lot more going for him but he does a fine,scorcese 's direction was a little too slow but it was a great film
1,the acting was n't bad but it is not a good,the acting was horrible and the script just plain stupid
1,so what i was expecting was a good movie that is a must have,so if you are a fan of this kind of thing and are interested in
1,theres a lot more to the movie,theres spoilers i have n't read it in
1,the acting was horrible the script was awful and the plot just plain stupid to watch and the ending was so stupid i could n't care,the acting was horrible the directing was worse the story line was boring the characters were annoying the acting sucked the plot sucked so bad that i
1,what is more the story and dialogue is so bad that i could barely believe that the entire cast is n't going,what 's the deal with the story of a young woman named benjamin who has a sexual obsession with her son
1,ian mcshane plays a man named krishna who has a very good idea of what is,ian mcshane is a great actor and he is great in the role he portrays
1,during this time the film was made,during the movie i had a headache at
1,this is a very good show and it has a good story line,this is the worst movie i 've ever had to endure and i was
1,casting a young man who was a young woman and the son is a bit of an actor,casting is the best part in the movie but the acting was so awful i could n't believe the
1,laurence baldwin is a great actor but the rest is just bad and the movie does have a good story to it,laurence fishburne is one that makes him an actor in the movie and he is not only a bad actor but he 's
1,it 's a shame the movie has so many opportunities that are,it has a lot to offer and i have to agree
1,for a movie that was n't even worth seeing,for the first time a movie was filmed on a
1,that 's what it was like to make a good movie,that 's a shame because the whole cast was very well made
1,the acting is horrible the script is awful the direction is worse than any student movie,the movie starts off as the first film and it 's not even as bad
1,the acting is good but it was n't,the movie was a waste of time
1,elfen lied does not have a chance,elfen lied is an interesting film
1,he is a great actress and i hope she does n't get a chance,he is the one who gets the girl and the other is the girl that
1,it 's not that i have to,it was a very good show
1,here is a movie where the characters are all very interesting and the characters are very likable,here 's a movie where i could n't get a grip of what was happening and what was
1,gotta be the worst film of all,gotta be a bit too much
1,an excellent cast of characters who have a great chemistry with the leads,an old friend of mine who has seen the movie is a young boy
1,on this note the actors were very good,on the plus of it all is the fact
1,but the film 's main flaw of the,but it 's not a good idea
1,the acting in the movie was good and i loved it,the film is a little over the heads of the characters
1,and i have seen a lot of films,and the movie is a bit slow
1,suddenly the movie begins to get weirder when the hero is revealed that he is a,suddenly he 's given a chance to find out who is responsible for the death
1,valjean 's father has been sent back to the states by an old lady named dr,valjean is the only one who is able for the most part in the whole film but
1,against this movie it was a waste on a good cast,against the backdrop of the story of an old man who is
1,it is n't even worth the wait for it and,it 's the same thing as in the original
1,it was a very good idea for the film,it 's a shame that the film has been released
1,by the end the story was a bit contrived,by far one of the best movies ever made i
1,100000 of the time it is a very good movie,100000 to be a movie about a man who is trying
1,john wayne 's performance in the film was a bit too wooden and,john goodman is the perfect villain for his role as the villain
1,how many movies are you supposed to be in the right frame,how many of the scenes are the ones with a lot of people
1,taken in by the other characters and the plot it becomes apparent that the story is about a man trying,taken from a book by john carpenter the film is a complete mess with a capital of its own
1,if i were to rate the film a zero i would have given it 0 out,if i were n't so impressed i would not want the story as i do
1,i think this movie is a must,i do agree to say it
1,in fact the movie is not as funny or interesting as it is a film,in the movie 's defense the film is set up as one big joke
1,it 's a shame that this movie was not nominated for an academy award for,it 's a very good movie and a lot of the laughs are funny
1,the film has a lot to do,the movie is a complete waste
1,he is the most beautiful person in the world and is a joy as well,he is not a very good director or a good guy who can be trusted by
1,gerald is a very nice guy,gerald is an excellent film and it
1,it was so stupid that i could,it is not a good movie
1,most of the film 's characters seem to be the main focus on each other,most of the actors are n't really that good either but the actors were n't really
1,one of the best films ever made,one of the most interesting aspects of the
1,and that is why this movie is so bad,and the ending is so bad that it 's not
1,they are both funny and the movie is a bit,they are both a very nice and talented man
1,and the ending was a bit of a letdown,and the movie is a complete mess with no real
1,first of alli i am aware of how,first of all the acting is terrible
1,and it 's all so bad and it is so stupid that it 's hard for a film like this,and the movie was a little too long for me but that does n't mean that the movie is n't a
1,here 's a few examples i 've,here 's where the story ends
1,there 's a lot to be said but i do think that the movie was a good idea to watch,there was also the fact of the story of the movie that was made in the early 80 years
1,for a film about an evil and reprehensible woman who is attracted by the man she loves,for those who have n't seen it yet i would recommend this film to any one who is
1,each of the characters in this story is the,each episode is a real treat to watch
1,at one time a young girl gets killed and she is forced to choose to get a,at one stage the movie was released in 1980 and was shot in the united states
1,at least that would be a good idea to show the real life of this man and his,at the same time a group called their own family members are killed by the local mafia
1,just a couple that are so stupid and stupid i ca n't even begin with this movie,just as the movie is about a guy who has to fight a few minutes of the movie
1,i have to say that i have never seen the original version of it,i think it was the first time that the director had made a movie about
1,okay so i was n't disappointed but,okay the plot is n't bad
1,very good movie but not a good one,very little is a movie about the evils of
1,produced by john ford a film critic of the silent era and a few years back in this movie he is an actor who is a master of the craft in the genre,produced to be a movie about a group of young kids who have been married and have to live together in their own country in the late 1960s in their mid 30s
1,yeah it has to be a little dated,yeah it 's all about all of you
1,i was n't expecting much of this movie but i thought it would have made,i was surprised that this movie did n't get the rave rating it has
1,the acting is horrible the script is awful and the direction is terrible,the movie is a little bit too long but it 's a great film
1,although this is a good movie it is a good example of what a good movie should,although the movie was made in the early 80 years i still remember the title song
1,henry fonda 's character is the only person he is able in his way and he has to do it,henry fonda plays the character who is the only character in the movie who has a very good reason to see
1,there are a few moments in which a character has to do so much to make,there are some very funny moments and the ending is so bad it 's funny
1,it has a good cast of characters and a very interesting story and a good cast that includes some good special effects,it was a good movie but the ending was so stupid i was surprised to find myself in a situation of the movie
1,there was no plot no plot no plot no story and no real plot,there 's a lot going on here but it 's a good thing
1,the story line of the story revolves around two men in the city,the story is a bit slow but there is a twist ending
1,however the film does a lot worse,however the movie was so boring
1,by the time it was over it seemed to be a complete waste,by now i have seen the movie twice as i am not going to
1,in a way this film was made in the us,in fact it 's not the worst of the series it
1,there 's a scene with an old man walking around,there was a lot of potential for this movie
1,british film makers have been trying to create something different and different in the,british horror fans will find this movie a little better than the first
1,i was so excited when i saw this,i do n't know why i watched this film
1,this was a movie i was hoping for a good time and i did,this is a film that should never be forgotten by everyone involved in the making
1,but it 's not the best film ever made,but i think the best way to describe it is
1,all in all this is not a great movie,all i know is the acting is so bad it
1,watched this film at the toronto international festival,watched in the first 15 minutes i had the
1,associated with this movie it is not the same,associated with a lot of the other movies this movie
1,it is a shame that the movie is so bad that it is not even close,it 's a shame the film did not have a wider release than it would 've made
1,i do not want a lot,i think this movie is a waste
1,this movie is a complete waste,this film was not for me
1,go see it if you want it to go to a cinema store,go rent it if only to see how bad it really is
1,if you have n't seen this movie you 're going to be missing a point,if you 're looking to get into this film you 'll probably enjoy it
1,nonhorror 's work was a bit over his prime,nonhorror and the film industry is a very entertaining film
1,if it was a little bit of fun,if it were not so much better
1,dillon is one of my favorite actors in a small role as a man,dillon is the perfect villain for this role and he is a good actor
1,what i did n't like was the fact of it 's a good idea and it would n't,what 's more the story is not so much of a drama as it is a comedy
1,keanu is a great actor but i think the movie is n't really about him,keanu goldberg is the only one who is able to get a few good performances
1,a very interesting story about a man trying his luck and his,a few minutes later the film goes on and over again
1,paige 's character is a bit of an idiot,paige 's character has a very complex and believable personality
1,this is not one film that you can watch over and see,this movie does n't have to be a sequel to a classic movie
1,besides the fact the movie is a complete mess of an action thriller it,besides it 's a very good movie that is not for the squeamish
1,but it is a movie about a,but it 's not that bad
1,so i do n't know if this is supposed to appeal to anyone,so the movie is n't a bad film and it is not
1,it is n't a good thing to say that the actors in particular,it was a good movie but the acting and writing was terrible
1,the story of the movie is based solely on the novel by the same author and writer of the book and that 's what,the acting is very good and the story line is good and the actors are great and the script makes you laugh out
1,incest is n't the only thing to make this movie worth watching for a good laugh,incest is a bit more interesting than the movie but it 's not a good one
1,kale is a very funny and funny film that is so,kale and woodstock have no idea of the real life
1,the film has a very good cast and,the acting in the movie was excellent
1,and it 's all about how the,and it 's a good movie
1,the story is a bit of a stretch but the film,the film was very well done with a nice cast
1,giles is an excellent film and one that is not afraid to be a,giles 's character is so annoying that i do n't care for him
1,but the film is a complete mess of a film with a very boring,but this is a movie you can watch with your friends and friends
1,mathieu has been in the past for a while but the rest are all too busy and are n't,mathieu and his friends are the two starcrossed lovers who are not afraid to go to a party
1,recommended for fans of classic cinema,recommended to those of you who like
1,we 're supposed to be a bit prejudiced of these types,we are not talking about a character 's life but his feelings
1,henriksen is a fine actor but i ca n't believe that,henriksen 's character is not as bad as the villain
1,foxes is the first of three movies i 've,foxes is the best movie that is made
1,here he meets a young girl named angela who has been living,here we see a very good film with a good cast
1,he 's the only person who has the decency to be in his position,he was a great director who was so proud to be a hero
1,aykroyd is the only one to be seen by his father and he is a,aykroyd is the only reason why i give this movie 1 out there is
1,so if it is the same way that you are not in for a good movie,so i have a feeling that this movie will be a success to me as it is
1,however the movie is n't really about the killer,however it 's not as good and the whole story
1,well this is the best of the series and it 's not even that bad,well it is a great show and the best thing about the show was that it
1,my friend who i thought was very cool and was very good at,my advice is that it has the potential to be a classic
1,there are some great scenes in which the movie takes a while and the film is very,there is a scene where he has to fight a little boy with the same man
1,and it 's not that it was n't,and it is a very interesting movie
1,anyway i think that it is the most entertaining film i have ever read,anyway the film is a very good one and the story is a bit slow
1,it is a great film for all,it is not a good movie
1,the story is about a group of young adults who are living in the city and have been searching for,the acting in this movie is so bad i have n't even seen the movie in my entire life

1,i was so bored by the movie that it,i have never seen such a bad movie
1,millions of years later it is the most difficult and the best of the four,millions of people have been killed and the whole town is in dire straits with the
1,the movie is a bit slow but it 's still a great,the story is simple but the story line is so predictable
1,funny and funny this is not a bad film and a,funny how the film is set in a small village
1,and the ending of a movie is,and the acting was n't bad
1,only the most discerning of the movie is the fact that the film does n't have a lot,only a handful and a few minutes later they 're not even worth mentioning in the movie
1,and it 's not a bad movie,and the film 's plot twist at least
1,she 's a little bit of an actress but her performance in this movie was so good that she could be the worst,she was a good actor in the film but she was so annoying and so annoying that she did n't even try
1,pick it on dvd is a great film that will make you laugh,pick this movie out and you 'll be disappointed and you have to watch
1,some have said the same about the movie and the fact i did not have any expectations,some people are so bad i ca n't believe that they are making a good film like this
1,warren hymer plays the character he plays in the,warren beatty is the best in the film
1,i was surprised at this film,i think it 's the best of

1,this is a film of the kind of,this film is a very bad movie
1,3 the story is about the same thing,3 the story line of the film was a
1,the story of an innocent woman who has been abused by a child who is now grown into a house,the film is a bit of the same as a typical hollywood film with a lot of plot and some of
1,this movie does n't really have much of a plot and it is just boring,this was one that was n't even funny enough to be a good film but i
1,the film was shot with a digital video and a few shots that are not used for,the movie has a very good cast and the story line has a lot of twists
1,i do think this is a great film,i have n't seen the original movie
1,contrary with the film 's release the film was made in the late seventies in the 1980s,contrary to the imdb comments on this movie i was expecting the same thing over time and again
1,without the words and the music of this movie it would seem that it was the best,without spoiling any of the film it 's a very long film with a few laughs
1,hurley 's acting was n't that great,hurley is also good as a woman who
1,i do n't understand how this movie got released theatrically,i have n't been able for a long long time and
1,finally the movie has a very good plot and it,finally it has to have the best of all
1,the acting was horrible the story was awful and it had the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie i 've watched,the film has a lot of good things going it makes it a very good movie but not as bad a bad movie
1,i do think the movie is very funny,i think that 's the only thing that i
1,the movie was a little over the place but the acting and direction were so horrible,the film is not as polished as it is in this case but the film is not
1,el charro is a movie about two women in the world who are,el mariachi was a wonderful movie that is a must for all
1,throw a few pounds of blood and gore into the movie and you have to see that the actors,throw in the towel of an old man and a woman who 's not even a good guy
1,we 're told that the movie has been done by a very young and talented cast,we are not told that the film is a good idea to make a film about the

1,they have to be the most annoying person ever,they have a good sense of the supernatural
1,the movie starts out with an old lady,the acting and directing are all good
1,i was expecting the movie to be a bit of a spoof,i think the movie has the same kind as it is
1,in the first half of the story the characters get to the point of the story and it becomes clear that there 's a lot more than just a,in fact this is one that should be seen by all of the students of the age who are not afraid of the world of our generation 's
1,the acting was terrible and the writing was terrible,the movie starts off as an excuse to show the
1,the story is simple and very funny and the characters are likable,the movie was a waste of my life and i would n't have
1,you 'll have a good time,you know the kind that is n't
1,but i think that the movie is n't that,but the film is not a complete mess
1,i was so disappointed that the film ended abruptly after that,i do think that it is not as much as the original
1,oh and the ending is just plain stupid,oh and the scene in which he is talking
1,this movie has a good plot but it 's so bad it 's laughable,this is not a movie that is a complete waste of a movie
1,definitely worth watching for all of the above average actors,definitely worth a look for the acting and the direction of
1,how did the producers and directors manage,how can a movie like this that has
1,watching this show i had no clue what it is like,watching this movie i had to stop watching and i thought it
1,i have seen this one twice and i have seen a lot,i think that 's what the story of the movie is
1,but it 's not a great film but a,but it 's a good movie to see
1,perhaps the film was made for the money but the film was a little over the heads in the first 30 minutes,perhaps it was a mistake for a good actor to be a good actress but i do not think that he should be
1,the story is about a young girl who is sent,the acting is pretty good and there is plenty
1,i'm a fan of the first movie so this one,i'm not a big big big budget horror fan
1,sorry to think that it would be good to,sorry i do n't have any idea why
1,reading the other comments here i have seen the trailer and have read a few comments on this site and have read the other comment on,reading the novel is the story about the life of a man who is a man who has lived a past in a small city
1,i think that the movie is very funny,i think it was a good idea for an
1,finally there is a scene in which a group of men are abducted by the evil spirit,finally the movie has the same kind to be made in the same way as it did
1,the film is a little bit too slow for the whole family,the film 's main weakness is to get the audience to sympathize with
1,but the real reason why i gave this,but it 's not a bad film
1,you can watch the entire movie and i 'll say it 's not a total,you know what 's really going wrong and you 're not supposed to care
1,the story is a little too complicated to make it a little bit of the same,the film is a complete mess of a film with the usual plot devices and clichs
1,and i have n't seen the original,and the film is n't as bad as
1,the story of a young girl who is in love is a bit of the same for her character but the story itself does,the film is very good but it has a very good script by robert de niro who is a master of his own
1,this is the best movie i ever saw,this movie was not a good movie and it
1,this movie is a great example,this is the best film i have
1,made me feel sorry for myself and the fact i had to go to the movie theater,made in the seventies the film has an allstar cast and a story about a man who has
1,you have to be one of the best actors to come up and say that this was a good movie and i hope,you can get into it the plot of the film was so much more believable and it was so easy to follow
1,will smith and his friends make the,will the audience see the movie
1,other than that it is a very bad movie and i would recommend it to anybody,other reviewers here seem to have a lot more of the movie and the movie does not
1,still it 's a fun movie to see,still it is a movie worth owning
1,some of these are the most important things i have,some of these movies are so much more entertaining
1,jamie foxx is a fine actor who has been very underrated in his work,jamie foxx is a genius and i have to agree with the reviewer who wrote
1,it has the same kind of atmosphere as the first film,it 's the story of a young woman in love with a
1,the story is simple and very predictable but it is still an enjoyable movie,the movie was shot in a small town and was a little too long
1,it was n't the first movie that made a good impression but,it has a good plot good characters and some good acting
1,i do n't want to be too unkind to this movie,i think the film is a little bit too long
1,j carrol naish plays the hero who is trying to solve the case,j is a very good actor who has been given his own personality
1,i think that 's why this movie is so awful i ca n't,i think it 's one that i would n't want to watch
1,i'm not a big football star fan but the story is pretty good and the story line,i'm a fan of the original and this movie was so bad it was actually good
1,standout scene in this movie is the scene where a woman is lying in a room,standout is the scene when the father of a man in an old mansion is killed and
1,and the ending is very predictable,and the film 's ending is a
1,just a few examples that i 've seen in the past,just like in the other movie the actors were not the least
1,interestingly the film is about a group that 's not a good one and the plot is n't,interestingly enough the film is not only boring but it 's a very good one to see
1,the movie is a little bit of a mess but i do n't think it 's a good thing that it is,the story is about two young women trying their luck in a small city in the middle of a small town
1,you 'll have to see it if,you have a lot of fun
1,all the characters are believable but the story itself is,all i can say are we are all that
1,most people are saying that the movie is not as great and it 's a,most people have said this is the worst movie that has ever been made
1,i do n't think that the actors were really bad,i have never been so disappointed in my viewing
1,i was expecting something like this,i do n't think that a movie
1,could n't they have had it,could have been a good movie if
1,the story is simple and the actors do a fine job,the story of an aging man who is sent by a woman
1,believe me this is a film that is not worth your money or time,believe me you 'll never forget the film is so much more than the sum
1,the movie was a waste of my time,the movie is about a bunch that has no
1,a lot like that you would n't want,a very good movie with great music
1,yeah this movie is n't bad,yeah the movie was a total mess
1,one of the worst movies of the past few weeks the movie was released on video,one of my favorite films of all times is a great example for this film
1,the film was shot with the same camera work in the last two films,the movie is about a man named sam who is sent in a mental hospital
1,after a long time i had a headache,after a couple years i have a fondness for
1,one of my favourite movies of the 90s,one of his most famous films and the film
1,and the ending is a bit abrupt,and it is the worst film that i
1,subtract the button and watch a film that 's a real,subtract a copy of this film is a good idea
1,they 're the best thing about it,they 're just so bad that they do
1,i think the director should have been able to,i think that the movie is very good
1,instead of a good movie i have,instead the movie just becomes annoying
1,no matter how many years later i have to say that i was n't,no wonder that the movie does not have a lot more to offer
1,it was a great movie and it had the same feel to it,it 's a shame because the movie is n't a good movie but it
1,i think the movie is just too good to be a,i have never seen the original so it is not
1,i think this is the worst film i have watched,i have never seen a worse actor in his movies
1,the movie is a little bit of an exercise,the film is a little slow and slow
1,the film was a bit too long for me and my wife and i went into the theatre with the intention to,the film was made in the us in 1980 it is a film that is not only a very good movie
1,eric clapton is the only actor i,eric bana is a great director
1,is it a coincidence to make a movie,is this a bad thing that is so good
1,obviously he is n't in the movie for a few days,obviously he 's not even the best actor but he does a
1,the movie is a very good example for a movie,the acting is horrible the plot is awful and the script
1,she was the only one to get her hands off,she 's a great actor but she is n't
1,at least the actors were n't so well done and they could n't have chosen the script,at one point in the movie the narrator is a man of the woman 's body
1,well the film is about a group called la who 's been a little too much,well this is a good example to the world of film noir and the movie is n't
1,this film was made in the us,this film has been done by a young
1,your only problem in the first place was the lack of a coherent,your first time was the film 's production value to the film
1,we get a very good movie about a man and the woman that are trying to make a living in a,we are shown to see a film where a young man is being killed by a man who was born
1,now i am still a fan and i do not like the way it was filmed,now that the film is about a guy who gets to the point of his life his
1,watching this movie i was a huge disappointment,watching this movie i thought i 'd give a
1,i think this movie is a masterpiece of mine but not,i have never seen a worse actor in the movie
1,even the actors are n't very good either as they 're in a,even if you 're a fan you have to be very careful
1,it is a shame that the movie did n't work,it has a very good story and great characters
1,since the movie was so much better the movie was n't even good it 's not a good story and i did not,since the story of the original story was a bit of an adventure it was very interesting and i liked the characters
1,try and find the movie 's worth it 's worth a look and a little more,try it out of your head and you 'll have to see it for yourself
1,my advice do n't watch this movie,my only complaint is that the movie has
1,i have n't read a biography that was a bit of the book that was based on this book but,i think this was an attempt to make the movie a little more realistic and more of the same
1,the movie is a complete mess,the movie was a waste and the
1,do n't get me out of the movie i did and it was n't,do n't waste time on this one unless the movie was really bad or bad
1,with a supposed budget the only thing that kept my attention was the fact that the actors were not actors,with the help from a group that has a little more money it seems like they have to pay a ransom
1,it 's a pity that it is not available on video as soon as possible,it has the same plot as the book but i did enjoy it more
1,brave and simple but i would n't have to say that this was one i 'd seen for a long while,brave to see a movie that is not so bad it 's good it 's just bad it has no real plot
1,i was surprised at all the reviews here,i do n't think that the director should be
1,in this movie we have an excellent cast of characters and a story that is a bit too much to be true,in the end the only thing that makes this film is that there is no way that the movie is going as a
1,she is a very talented actress and i think that she 's the,she 's the only one who has the ability of her own
1,yet another movie about an american woman who is trying,yet it is still very enjoyable and very funny
1,i think this is a very very bad attempt at a horror film,i do n't think that this movie is really a good movie
1,that is the best part of the movie,that said this movie is not a good movie
1,if you want to watch the original movie i would advise anyone to check this out,if you are a fan of the genre and the original series you 'll probably like the
1,she was a very talented actress but she was very convincing in the role,she has to go to the police station and she is forced into her car
1,here we see an old man who is a little too old to be a,here 's a film you can do without the usual clichs of your own
1,bridge of death was a good thing but i think it 's a very good movie and the acting,bridge is the story of two young people who live in new york in the late 60 century
1,with the exception the director and his wife have a very strong and intriguing,with all the shortcomings of this film it 's just an excellent film
1,and it 's a shame that they never made a good film,and it 's the worst thing in this movie that i can recall
1,it 's a pity that the film is so much more than a film,it 's not the worst film of all time but i 've seen worse
1,i think that it was one to watch and,i do agree to give credit to him
1,golan 's first film was released in the united kingdom,golan was not afraid that he was a great director and
1,the movie was shot with no budget and the script was n't very good either but that,the film is very well made and the actors and director have made the movie worthwhile
1,however i was not surprised that the movie did n't get released theatrically,however the plot was so weak and so predictable it could have been a
1,the movie was shot in black,the acting in general was pretty good
1,however the movie is very well done and has an interesting message that i would,however the movie is not so bad it makes the movie even more boring
1,life was a little too late for the film,life was n't a bad thing but the acting was
1,he 's a great director and he 's always trying to make it funny and entertaining but,he is a very talented actor and he has done well in this film as well
1,however the film does not work for the rest of the film and the film is a little dull,however the movie does not have a lot of good action scenes and it 's a bit confusing
1,i have never been a fan of any of the actors,i was n't sure why it 's so bad i do n't
1,the acting is good with the exception of an old man who 's,the acting in the first half hour of the picture was excellent
1,and it is a good movie for,and the acting is n't bad
1,in the end it is just an excuse for,in the end it does not make sense
1,while the movie is about an old man who is in the army and the us army and the president and his wife who he does n't have the same problem,while i was expecting a lot more from this film i did n't really care for any one redeeming quality of it and that was the only reason i did n't like
1,this was an awesome and funny movie,this movie is not even worth the time
1,inevitably i was surprised that this movie was n't made,inevitably this movie was a waste of my life
1,sure there is no real plot to speak and it 's not even,sure there are some good parts but they 're just not good
1,dolph is the only character who seems to be the,dolph is a great director and a good guy
1,harry and arthur have been a lot of fun,harry 's character was the most annoying one in this
1,the story was n't too good but the characters were so stupid and the plot is ridiculous,the acting and the plot is just plain awful the script is terrible and there was no real
1,those two have a great deal of,those are just the two things
1,i'm a fan and the film is very good but i ca all be a bit harsh,i'm not sure why i have n't read any of these comments on imdb but i have seen
1,it is n't even a film,it is not a film for anyone
1,since this is the first film i have seen in the last 15 minutes or so i have n't even seen,since i was n't a big child i was not surprised at all but i was very surprised by this
1,its a great movie to have to sit back and laugh at,its a very good show but i think it 's the best movie
1,did i forget that this film is a remake,did they get the chance to make a sequel with
1,this is the first movie i ever saw that i saw on the big screens,this movie is one of many movies i can watch again and never tire
1,the movie is a very bad one but it does not have any of that,the movie is not a bad movie but it 's still pretty bad and i would
1,the movie is about a group that 's in the middle east,the acting is horrible and the plot line is just bad
1,whatever the reason i did n't give it a 10 out of 10 i do recommend the,whatever the reason i was so disappointed with this one it was a very bad movie
1,also the scene where he 's walking in,also the movie is a complete mess
1,although the plot is n't too original and is n't really that interesting it has some very funny moments,although the movie was not as bad it was still pretty good fun to watch it is a very entertaining
1,he is the only one who knows the story of a young,he is a good actor and he 's very good here
1,it has a very funny plot but the acting and the plot are just plain awful,it 's not a bad film but it 's good enough to be good enough to warrant
1,oh my gosh i 've seen a lot of movies and this is the one that,oh and the ending is a little bit too abrupt but that 's not enough
1,sam raimi is one of the most underrated actors of all time,sam waterston is the only actor who can act and he is very
1,i have seen this movie several dozen years ago but i do have a few things going,i have n't seen the original series since the original series but it 's still pretty good
1,and the movie is a little too long,and i have to say that the movie was
1,what 's more the film has the same,what is the point of the film
1,the story was very simple and very very funny,the film is a little over the top
1,i think this movie should 've won a razzie awards award nominations and it was great,i have to say that i am a fan and have n't seen this film
1,when i saw this on tv i was very excited to see it on,when i saw a preview i thought that it was a good idea
1,considering the budget of this movie i would have to say it 's one of the best movies i have,considering that it was made in the late 80 's i was very impressed by the acting and directing
1,i think this was a great movie,i think this is an interesting movie and
1,it 's not that i do not want to be a part to a movie,it 's just that there are a few good moments to be found here
1,he is the only one that can save his family and the fact he does a,he is a very good character actor and i hope he makes a better effort
1,strong story line and a good script,strong and very funny in the end
1,his character was so believable that i had never heard of the movie,his wife is the son and he 's a very handsome woman
1,it 's a great film for the,it was n't even a movie
1,i have n't seen this film in the long long run,i was surprised at how many of you have been able to
1,to make a movie that 's a little too much of a stretch to me and i think i would have had the same problem to watch it,to be honest the story is a little weak and it 's not a good movie but there is n't one in the movie where it 's supposed and
1,and the movie is so boring,and the ending is very good
1,of all the movies i have watched it 's a waste of my,of all things i would say is the worst of the worst
1,but it was not that good either,but the film is a very interesting one
1,the acting is pretty poor but the story line really is a bit weak,the acting is good and it 's hard to believe the actors were all cast
1,according to imdb users this was a movie that i had seen in my life,according to the imdb comments on the imdb page this is an excellent piece
1,the movie is about a man who is,the movie has a lot of potential
1,obviously the movie is a spoof of the book and the acting,obviously the film is set on a soundstage with the usual cgi equipment
1,overall the movie is not a great movie but it has a good plot and a good cast and it is not a,overall it 's a pretty bad film and i would recommend this to anyone interested into a movie or a horror movie
1,he is also a very good character and he 's not only a bad actor but he 's a good storyteller and a,he 's a great actor and he does not have the chops of an old man to play a role like this
1,martin sheen is excellent here as his wife and he is a joy as the lead actor and the,martin landau is a good actor but he is not as good as his best in this one
1,another thing i noticed was that it was a bit more interesting and the ending is more of a surprise,another example that the filmmakers were making a film that was n't even remotely good at first and the director and
1,a very good movie that is worth watching and for anyone who likes the first film or a good movie it 's a great choice,a few minutes into the movie i was thinking that the writer was going to make an artsy film but this one is just plain awful
1,adrian pasdar and the rest are pretty much the,adrian de vaca has done a great performance
1,they were the most annoying characters i ever saw on the screen and it was n't even the story,they are both a very good film and the actors who played the main roles of each other
1,this was an excellent movie and i hope they make a movie that is so bad that i ca,this film is not worth a rental but if it were on dvd i would n't be surprised
1,if you 're looking for a good movie that is a bit of,if you are a big horror fan you 'll probably like it
1,meryl welles is a great actress and is the only one who does n't disappoint in,meryl streep plays a young woman whose husband is a woman in the middle age
1,it 's a very good film,it was a very interesting film and
1,and it 's not that bad either,and the acting is n't that bad and
1,he 's a very talented actor and is the only actor who,he is also the one with the heart of the film
1,to me it 's just that the film was shot on a soundstage in the middle east and the locations are used to create a very realistic look and the music is so bad,to be fair i do not know how to describe this movie as it has been in the theatres since the 1980s and i think it is the funniest movie in my opinion
1,other than that i found the ending,other people are not so sure
1,people who do not like this movie will be disappointed by it but i do n't,people like the characters are not very likable and they do a lot of things
1,but i do n't want to spoil it for myself what i like to say,but the film 's plot is n't too interesting to make a movie about a man
1,i do not think that the film is a good thing,i have to admit it i did like the movie
1,pod man is a very good show,pod girl is a great movie
1,do n't worry that this film is a masterpiece,do yourself a favor watch a movie that 's not
1,there 's also the obligatory and gratuitous nudity which is so bad,there are a few moments that i found myself laughing hysterically
1,he is a great actress but the movie has a few moments that are n't worth watching,he has the ability to make a film that has a very interesting look to them and that
1,i think this was a very bad movie because of the fact the movie was made,i do n't think this was one intention to see a good movie and it would be
1,the acting is very poor and it 's not that great,the film is a little over the edge but it 's a
1,horribly acted poorly acted and directed,horribly acted and acted in the worst
1,oscar wilde was nominated for best supporting actor,oscar wilde is a fine actor who has always
1,the film is a little slow but the story itself was so,the movie has a great story and some very good actors
1,while this is the most beautiful film i 've ever had to sit through it 's the kind of story where a movie,while this is not a good idea for a movie to be good i would have to agree with the other reviewer
1,when i first heard of this movie on a local cable station it,when i saw the movie i had to give it 1 stars
1,and that 's the reason why this is the only film that i have ever,and that is what it 's all just a bunch that is n't funny
1,not to mention it 's not the best movie,not a bad idea to begin to unravel
1,there 's a lot going on in it and it 's a good thing,there was a good cast and it had some very good moments but it was
1,okay it 's a movie with some nice actors but,okay so this movie is n't a bad one
1,the acting is horrible the script is,the acting was n't bad either
1,i do n't know if the movie is just about the,i think that this film was a waste of time
1,try it to make a movie about the life of god but the movie itself was n't,try not to be a big fan of the genre or the original film and it 's a
1,he 's not even the most likable character in the film and it 's hard not only like him,he is also the most talented character actor in the world who has to be one to remember his lines
1,yes the acting is pretty bad but the script is n't very good either,yes the movie has a lot to do with a plot that was a little
1,i have to admit that i have n't been in a coma for a,i think this is a great movie and it 's a good thing
1,william shatner is great as the evil sheriff who has a heart of gold,william powell is a good actress and he plays a character who is not a
1,it is a great film to see,it 's a very good show and i
1,generally the movie is a bit slow but it does have its moments and it is not a movie that will appeal to,generally it was the best of all of his novels but it did not help that the movie did not work out
1,and i do not know how to describe it,and it 's the only thing to do with a
1,the acting is good and there are some good supporting actors,the movie is not for everyone but it 's a very enjoyable
1,the film is about a young man who is,the acting is good the story is good
1,the story line is so simple that it 's almost painful watching,the acting and direction are very poor the story is weak
1,the story of a girl who is a little girl and,the movie has an odd premise to tell the audience
1,it 's not even worth a look,it 's not a good movie and it
1,in a movie that is supposed for kids,in the movie the only thing i can say
1,a lot of people are killed in this,a very funny scene in the movie
1,i have never been a fan of the series,i think the film is very well written and well
1,what is more a good example,what 's the difference with the movie
1,and it is the most beautiful movie i 've ever seen in a movie with a great cast,and it 's the same thing as in the original series and it 's a shame because the movie
1,the movie is about a man and a woman in a mental institution,the acting was horrible the plot is bad but the story is n't too
1,i do n't think this movie was a good movie,i do n't know why i did n't like this movie
1,it 's a very funny film that is n't just for the,it 's a pity the movie has a lot to do
1,fantastic performances from the actors and the cast,fantastic acting and a great story that 's not
1,it has a good story line but a very good story and good acting,it 's a shame because this is a film that i would n't watch again
1,of all of the movies that i have seen this is one i have,of all the movies i watched the last days i saw this one
1,and that was the most important thing about this show,and the film is a bit of a stretch for the
1,yes there were many things that made this film a bit long but there was no,yes the movie is about an evil killer that is supposed to be a vampire
1,the acting is very good and it 's a pity to see such,the movie was a complete failure to watch the first two minutes
1,connie 's character is so unlikable that i could n't help thinking of her character and,connie and his wife lisa have a relationship with each others and the story begins
1,the movie is about a young woman who has her own problems and is a woman in a society,the film has a great soundtrack score but i ca n't think it would 've been a good movie
1,leslie nielson is great as always,leslie caron is a delight as she
1,realism is n't all that good for the film,realism and the need to be a movie
1,in fact the film is so bad and so poorly constructed that it 's almost laughable in a bad way,in the end he does not have the same sense to do in a film that has the potential and the
1,i have to say that i was n't impressed by the movie,i was n't expecting much of this but the film did n't have
1,a lot of people are killed off the way they are in the movie and they do,a very interesting story about a man 's life and the consequences he endured in life
1,the movie starts out with a bang of some sort of weird,the film is very funny but it 's just not funny
1,i was n't really expecting a much better adaptation of this,i was n't impressed with it but this is the most entertaining
1,it is a very interesting film and a very good example of what it is,it is a movie about a group that are n't in the same room
1,well i was n't expecting much from this movie,well it has a good story line and good acting
1,there was a scene where he was supposed to be,there 's a lot to love about the film
1,feel free to warn people to do the same thing,feel free for the film and for those who are interested
1,i think that 's what this is,i was surprised to see that he did
1,i think that it was a good idea to show the film to be so realistic that i could,i do n't know why the director did n't have any idea that he was in the mood
1,the story is simple and the characters are,the acting in this film was terrible
1,of course the story has a lot more plot and character than the original,of this is a movie that is not only a comedy it is an excellent
1,okay so the movie is not as great as the original but not as good,okay so i do commend you to watch this movie and you 'll see why
1,you can see the actors in the film who are the ones that are,you have a good idea of a good idea and a great cast
1,cause that the film was shot in the same location and shot it was shot on location in the desert,cause the film was a success and the film was shot in the same location in the first place
1,salma 's performance is so bad it makes it difficult to sit in the theatre,salma hayek is excellent in her part and she does n't really seem to have much
1,he was a little too old for the role,he is a very funny and talented man
1,the story of an old friend who is trying to,the movie was a little too long for me
1,it 's not the best movie ever and i 've seen it,it 's the story that is so stupid and so predictable
1,camp 's character is so stupid it 's untrue to anyone who is in,camp is the best movie of the series but its a good film
1,the acting was good but the story was weak and the characters were so boring that it seemed like the writers had to be in the movie for the most,the story is about two young adults who are married in the late 1960s and early 1800 another and the two of whom are now married to each other
1,what a waste for a razzie award nomination nominee,what 's worse was this movie is so awful
1,ultimately it 's not the worst movie i,ultimately the film is a bit long
1,the movie is a complete mess,the movie is a complete mess and
1,haters are not the only one who can see this movie,haters of this film are the ones that do n't have any
1,joseph cotten is the only reason to watch his movies and his acting in,joseph gordonlevitt is the only one that makes a movie worth a look
1,but i do n't think this movie should be made to appeal for younger audiences,but the movie was so awful that i could n't help thinking it was a joke
1,what i found interesting was when he got his hands on his face,what i did like about the film was how it was filmed
1,seriously the movie is n't a bad,seriously this is a great film
1,this was a very bad movie but it 's just plain bad that,this is not a good movie but it has some funny moments
1,passengers of the desert is the most beautiful and beautiful movie i 've,passengers of the desert was one that i would n't have known
1,this movie does n't even deserve to be called the first movie i,this was one that i could have done without a lot more
1,but it 's not as good as it is to the director,but this is one movie that i will never forget to watch
1,the story was a lot better but the movie was n't that bad either i thought it was pretty bad but i,the movie is not about the people that are the only ones who are not the most important people in history
1,i have n't seen the original movie but i have to,i do not think that the film is worth watching
1,that 's what makes a movie watchable,that 's a shame since the film does
1,i think it 's the worst movie that i have watched since the first movie,i have never been a fan but i was surprised to learn this film was going
1,this was the first time i saw it i thought it had a good,this is a film that i recommend to everyone interested in the subject
1,to me this is a great film and one that is not only a very interesting and interesting film but it is a great,to be honest i do n't know why i have to watch a movie that is supposed as if it is a remake
1,it 's a shame that this film,it is a very good film
1,my favorite scene involves the guy walking around in a chair and talking about it and the camera pans off camera and,my favorite scene is the one in the bar when the two girls are sitting in a bed talking about it
1,the movie has a lot of good acting,the film has a great deal of humor in
1,now i have to say that this film has a very good cast,now that the film 's title was a little misleading it is the fact
1,the movie was n't even bad,the acting is good and it is
1,it has the same kind of humor as the original,it 's not a bad movie but i have to disagree
1,as a result the film does have its charms,as for me i would have given it an 8
1,watch this show and then watch the show for,watch it if only for the sheer silliness
1,in fact i would have been surprised if it were a bit,in the end the only thing that makes this movie watchable
1,i do think this is the best film ever made,i think the movie is a bit too long
1,i think it 's the only way to get it out,i was expecting a movie with a little bit more of a
1,as a result the movie is a mess,as the movie continues it becomes clear to the
1,he is the only actor who could,he 's not a bad person
1,le samourai is a very good film,le cercle dick is one that you 'll
1,she has a lot more screen time but she does n't do much,she is also a woman in her own life and is not a woman
1,in the movie we get a bunch of characters in a,in a movie that is not even a good one
1,and i have to admit that the movie was a bit slow but i found the story very interesting,and the movie was shot in a time warp where the actors were n't speaking english and it 's just
1,it 's a very good movie,it was a good idea to show
1,no matter what you say and that is what the movie does,no matter what you do you 'll be a fan of the original
1,he 's the only person that could have done without,he 's a good actor and is very convincing
1,i think that 's what this movie was,i was so disappointed by this movie
1,i have to wonder if i was watching a movie with a little of my own,i think the film 's main flaw in this film was the casting of the two leads
1,there was a lot of nudity but the movie is not,there was also a very nice cameo from james coburn who was
1,if you want a good scare watch this film and you 'll find yourself asking yourself what i will be thinking about it in this movie,if you 're going to make an artsy movie like the one that has a few funny moments and some good actors you will find it very
1,the movie is about as much fun as watching it,the acting and script are so bad it 's laughable to
1,reminds me a bit on the old tradition of,reminds us that it 's a real life
1,even though the film was a bit of a bore it 's still very enjoyable in its approach to its subject matter and its message,even the most ardent fans have to be advised to appreciate this film and it 's a shame because it 's a great movie for the
1,but it 's still very funny and i liked the idea,but the film 's only saving grace is the music
1,this is a very good film that is a,this is not a film for everyone involved
1,there are a few things to criticize about this movie and that 's why the film,there was n't a single scene that seemed to be filmed in the first half
1,let the audience decide to watch it,let it go by the end of this
1,having seen this movie i was impressed to see how many of the reviews on here are on this site and the positive reviews,having seen a number i had a very good time watching this movie i felt that it would make me feel like a real person
1,lately this is a very good and entertaining film,lately i was expecting something better than the first one
1,perhaps this movie has some redeeming value,perhaps the director 's intention is to show
1,those are not the ones i 've,those two are not very different
1,i have to say i did like the first one but the second time around i found the story to the,i have seen this movie several many times and i have to be honest to the people in the theater
1,do yourself a favour and do n't watch this movie you will be sorry for yourself,do yourself a favor and skip this movie and do not waste your time on this crap
1,i think it 's one to watch,i was so excited when i heard about
1,i do not think the filmmakers would want us,i was expecting the movie for a while
1,it 's a very simple and very funny film,it 's not a movie that you can watch with
1,i do think that the acting and writing is,i was expecting a lot more from it
1,all in all i was very pleased to see that the first one was a,all in one of the best movies i have ever read the first one
1,be prepared to watch the movie and the film 's,be sure to give it an 8 out 10
1,i think the film was a bit too much of a disappointment,i do n't know how to make a film about this kind and
1,my favorite parts of all were the ones where she was supposed and the scene where her father says she is in,my favorite part is the scene where a man is talking to a girl and says he 's not a kid
1,for the first time in the film i thought the movie was a bit more interesting,for a movie that is a little too much of a stretch it does n't really matter
1,i was expecting a lot better,i was expecting something like the godfather
1,she is a great actor and she,she is a very talented actress
1,it is not a movie that you should watch,it was the first of a series of films and
1,it 's not a bad movie but it 's not bad,it has the feel that it 's just the same
1,she 's not even a good actress,she 's not a good person
1,clearly the film is a bit too long but that 's what it was,clearly it 's a good thing to say this movie is n't bad
1,then there 's the ending which is,then the movie goes down hill
1,also the movie is a complete mess of a movie that has no real plot no suspense and no real action,also a few of the scenes are filmed in a few seconds and the film has a very good pace
1,most of the movie 's characters have been killed in,most of the movie is spent in the movie
1,basically it has a few good points to it but i think that the film is just plain stupid in a way,basically a bunch is a little more interesting than the original but the movie does have a good story to work on but
1,but the real problem is it is not a comedy,but it 's a very nice film and it 's a
1,this film does n't have the usual,this movie was a complete waste
1,maybe i was expecting more of it,maybe it 's the fault of a few
1,as a matter the film 's climax of a film in which the characters are left undeveloped is a testament to how the story was made,as a result of a few of the scenes in which a man has his own head bashed by a man 's body is torn to shreds
1,and that was the most interesting part,and it 's a good film
1,my favorite scene is when a woman says she is a virgin she is a whore and,my favorite part in the entire series is that of the two sisters who are married
1,core and other films are the only ones that are good,core and other films of that period are made of the period
1,for me the film 's biggest strength is its lack of originality or the slightest of it,for the first time i thought it might be a good idea to get rid of a film
1,you 'll see the ending of the film,you can tell they 're going on a lot
1,jordan 's character is so unlikable and the plot that it 's hard not to laugh a lot of the,jordan is a very good actress and a great actress and i think the film is a great success
1,were they going for a good time,were we to believe the film would be
1,the film was shot in a very cheap and grainy digital video camera,the acting was good the story line well the acting was great and i
1,the acting is good but it is,the movie has some nice moments
1,offside was one such great movie that i could not watch,offside 's character is a little bit of a jerk
1,anyway i have seen a lot of movies and i 've been a big fan of the genre,anyway i think this is one of those films where i have to say that it 's one thing
1,i was so excited to see it in theaters but the,i have never read any of the other reviews here
1,thankfully it 's just too much,thankfully it is n't a bad movie
1,feel the need for the actors and crew,feel free to warn the audience that the film
1,whoever thought this was a good movie,whoever thought that it was a great film
1,gabriel is a very talented actor but his performance is n't very convincing either in this film and he is very convincing and is quite convincing,gabriel is a young woman in love who has a onenight life and a very rich young daughter and is played in an entirely new yorker
1,the story is very simple and the story line was very good,the acting is good and there are lots of great actors
1,this is a movie that should be watched for the entire time,this is the kind that makes you want to see more of these
1,it 's not the worst movie i 've seen in a long time it is not a good movie,it 's a shame because the movie is n't even worth watching and it 's not even that good to
1,there 's a lot of action and the movie is a bit slow,there 's a scene that is n't really worth the wait but the whole
1,because the film is a little slow and boring,because i was so disappointed in the end
1,special effects are the only ones i 've,special mention for the director 's performance
1,still the story is very good but the,still it is a very entertaining show
1,knowing that he is n't a great actor and his acting is a bit of a stretch for him,knowing the story was about a man who has to go on to find a new life he can live
1,flynn is a good actress but he has the charisma,flynn is one of the greatest stars of all time but
1,i have to admit that the movie is a little over rated but that is not enough reason,i do think that the acting was great and the acting was superb and the story line
1,this is a film of the highest order of,this is the worst movie of all time
1,but this is not an easy thing to do,but i do n't think this is a good idea
1,i was n't expecting much but this was the first of three films that i 've seen in a row,i think that the film was made by the same people as the blair witch project but the story is so
1,it is a very good movie with a lot more heart and soul to work,it 's not that the movie 's plot line is so predictable that it becomes tiresome
1,and the film 's climax is the best,and that was the only reason i watched a
1,luckily i do n't think that this movie would make it a good watch if it were n't,luckily this is n't the only way to get a good story and the good bits of the original
1,however the film is a bit too slow,however the movie is a complete bore
1,samuel l jackson is a good actor as he 's in this,samuel l jackson is one of our favorite characters in this one
1,troma 's movies were not so popular,troma 's movies like this are not only
1,alan rickman as the villain is the best in the film,alan rickman as the villain is very likable as the villain
1,the maltese king' was a good film,the omega man has a very funny scene
1,everything in between this movie is so bad that,everything in the movie was just plain awful
1,the film was a little too long for,the movie is a very good movie
1,but it 's a great movie and,but it 's not a movie
1,the story is simple enough to warrant a viewing of this film,the movie is a bit long but it has the same plot as
1,this is a very bad attempt,this movie does n't have a lot
1,well it 's a movie that you 'll enjoy watching and it is worth a viewing,well the film is not about a man who gets his revenge on his son but the
1,i do think the director should have been able to make a movie about a young boy,i do think that a lot of people have said that it was not that bad
1,however the film does n't seem like a real film either,however i think that it is the most overrated and most expensive
1,this movie does n't really have much in the plot to speak of it,this is the first time i 've heard of this movie and i am not
1,you 'll never forget that the film is so bad,you know that this film was made in the early 80
1,an interesting story about a group that,an interesting premise for a movie
1,however the film is very good,however this movie was a waste on
1,the acting is good with some good performances,the movie starts out as an afterthought
1,nonetheless the movie is a bit slow at times but the plot is very good,nonetheless this is a very good show and i think that it should n't be canceled
1,if i had n't seen the movie i 'd probably be surprised,if you 're looking for something more than just an hour and a
1,how could it have been a great movie,how did the guy in this mess ever say
1,thus i have a lot better to do,thus the film is a complete bore and the
1,when you 're not going to see the movie you will see what,when the movie is over the movie is a very good movie
1,spoiler spoilers spoilers ahead i have a theory about the plot,spoiler ahead i have n't read it but this is the best
1,akshay khanna is the only one that has a role in this movie,akshay kapoor is a very good choice for the character of jack frost but
1,they were the only ones who could,they are not in a hurry
1,dassin 's films were a great deal of fun to follow,dassin has a very strong sense of humour as a filmmaker and
1,um the movie is n't that great,um this was a very poor film
1,detectives are not always the same,detectives of the united kingdom are the
1,despite the obvious lack in his life the movie does n't have to have a good story or even if you do n't care about any character or the actors,despite being a bit too many years later the film has a very interesting story and the performances of all the actors and the music are great and i liked how
1,there 's also an odd scene when the girl is,there 's nothing to be ashamed of this film
1,the film has an interesting message that is not a good thing,the story was a joke but the acting is n't bad either as
1,i think this film is a masterpiece of the genre and it 's a great movie,i do not think i have ever been in the army for the entire film
1,i was expecting something like this to be a waste,i do n't think this film was made for the sake
1,sadly it is n't the worst movie i ever had to watch,sadly the film is so poorly made and badly directed that i could
1,i was n't really impressed with the acting,i do think that this movie should have been
1,the film has a very good cast and the,the film was very good in the beginning
1,of all of these things the film was a bit too long,of all the films i have mentioned that it is one hell of
1,the movie has some of those moments that i liked,the film was made for the sake to have a good
1,i do n't know if this is a good thing,i do not know what the hell is going for it
1,drama was a bit of the spoof of the original,drama is a little more interesting than the first but it
1,the acting is good and the story line is a bit,the story is a complete bore and it is not
1,this is not the type movie that i,this movie has a lot of potential
1,but the film 's main character is the one who,but this is not a good thing to do
1,ming ming was the first of the series,ming ming is a good actor but he 's
1,i have to say i was impressed to find that it is a good story,i do n't know if it was the director 's intent but the story line was
1,there is a reason why i think the movie is a bit too good but that does n't matter because it is not a bad idea,there is a lot to say the first one and the second is a very good film but i do not want my time back and i
1,i was n't expecting anything else to happen,i was n't expecting a great film but it
1,i was so disappointed that the movie had a,i think this is a very bad movie
1,worse yet the movie is n't bad,worse yet the movie is so awful that
1,no one could have pulled it off,no one can replace the film for a
1,his performance is so wooden that it 's laughable,his wife is a man who has a daughter and
1,though the plot is a little weak and there is a lot of action it 's not a good idea to begin with,though it is a bit dated and the story itself does not have any plot points it 's just not worth watching
1,the story is very simple and it is very well done,the movie is about as bad in a film as it is
1,and the acting is n't bad,and the acting is horrible the plot
1,the movie is a very good example to be a good movie,the film is very funny and the story is very good
1,i think it was a great idea,i do not think this was a good
1,the movie was shot in the same way,the movie is a very bad film
1,as a result the film is not very funny and i did find that the story is not really about the characters themselves,as a fan i have seen the movie and i have to say that i am not sure if it was a comedy
1,it is a great movie that will be appreciated and rewarded for all its shortcomings and the best of it 's genre is the fact,it 's a shame that the movie was made in 1934 so that 's a shame because i did find the movie very interesting
1,why does n't he try and convince the kids,why is this so much of a film
1,i do think that it was a very enjoyable movie,i do n't think that the film would have had a
1,but it is also a very funny,but it was a great film
1,the story is very simple and the acting is superb and it makes the movie more enjoyable than the first,the movie was shot on the cheap but i guess the producers decided that it was a low point of the
1,this is a very bad movie,this is a great movie to see
1,for a long while we get a glimpse of a group that,for me it 's a good film and a good one
1,the film 's premise is a little confusing,the acting is pretty good and i think this
1,nothing is ever explained in the movie that the film has to offer the plot is a bit of a joke,nothing is really funny about the movie and the plot does nothing to make it a good movie to watch
1,and the film is n't even a comedy,and the acting is horrible the story is weak
1,this is a movie i 'd like,this film was a complete failure
1,but the movie does not make a lot of sense,but the movie is a little bit too long and the
1,start off with the first two movies,start the film and the movie begins and
1,in this case the movie was very good and i was impressed,in the end he is the only person that can be redeemed by
1,the movie has some great moments and some really funny moments,the acting was terrible and the script was horrible and the acting
1,this movie is a waste on a film,this is one movie that is not only a
1,did i get the feeling it was a good idea to make,did anyone know that it was n't going to be good
1,at least the movie has a few good moments and it,at one time i was n't impressed by the film
1,to me the best of all the movies,to me this movie is just plain boring
1,i have seen this one a few more years ago and i have to admit i am still a bit jaded about the movie,i do n't want to give away the fact i do n't want my money back and the movie is n't a complete failure but
1,i do not want my kids for their children but the fact that they are all that makes this film so good i ca n't help feeling compelled,i think it is the best of all the movies and it 's the first one i have seen in a long while i 've seen it
1,she is the only person that is able to get a hold of,she has to go to her home to get married with her
1,somerset is a great character and he has the right amount of humor,somerset morgan plays the role of the mother who has to deal with the
1,betrayal and love are the most important elements to the film and the story of a boy,betrayal and redemption is one that will leave you thinking about what the director is thinking
1,the acting is very weak and the story is very weak the acting is poor the characters,the acting in the movie is so bad you can hardly see the difference between them
1,it is the story of an aging man who has,it 's a shame because i was n't disappointed
1,a few scenes of a man walking around a table and talking to the camera,a few scenes are shot in an old fashion and they 're shot on location
1,tom hanks is the only reason i watched,tom hanks was great as the villain
1,i was expecting a great story with great characters and great actors,i was n't expecting much from this movie but was pleasantly surprised by
1,i was expecting a lot more than this one,i have n't laughed once during the film and it
1,sorry for the bad guys but i do,sorry but this is a good movie
1,also the movie is very slow paced and very poorly done with the requisite exception of some,also a good film for the whole movie is that it 's not just a comedy
1,this is the kind i 'll watch for a few years,this is a film for all ages but it does contain a
1,all the characters in this movie were all likable and the story,all i can say is that i do n't like it
1,the movie was a bit long for me because i had n't seen the original,the film has a lot more going for it than the first two thirds of the
1,as a result it was a bit slow but that 's all,as a result of a movie that has no redeeming quality whatsoever i
1,the movie was shot in the seventies in the middle ages,the story was very interesting the actors are good and the story
1,my only complaint is that the film is not as good,my only problem i was that the first two films were not
1,but it 's not a bad film and it has,but this film is just a waste of time
1,exactly what i expected from this film,exactly what i expected from a movie that
1,but the film 's biggest weakness is its lack,but i have to say i was very disappointed with
1,she is a beautiful actress and she does n't need to do anything else in the world,she is a very talented actress and i have never been so impressed by her performance in a
1,does he get the money to make this film,does it make a movie about a man with a
1,lastly i think this film is the best in my opinion,lastly i was surprised to find that this movie was n't even
1,this is a great show that i would recommend watching,this is the best movie i have ever seen
1,then there is a lot more of the same,then the story of this film and the two of
1,another reason i gave up the dvd is that it is not available on video or dvd or vhs,another example of a great film is the way the characters interact in each scene of the characters
1,the film was shot in a small town in new york city,the story is a little too simple for a young boy
1,just do a few research and you will,just a few examples in my opinion
1,3 a group that has been killed and tortured,3 a group of friends and a group of kids
1,this is the best of his career and he 's the,this movie is a must have for the whole world
1,he is a good director and it 's a shame that he has n't made a film like that,he has the ability to make a film about a man and a girl who have to deal and live
1,with the exception of this movie i think it was the most important thing to be said,with a lot of good things going them it 's a good idea to get the film to
1,john goodman 's performance as the lead,john cusak is the perfect choice
1,it 's a shame to see a sequel to this movie but i have to say that it 's a very bad and boring sequel,it 's just so bad and so boring that you wonder why they did n't have it on a movie or dvd or dvd copy
1,final verdict it 's a very bad film,final thoughts on a film like that
1,the film is a very good movie,the film is a very interesting film
1,even the music was not the best,even though the plot is n't the worst
1,there 's a scene where a man is talking,there was a good deal of the movie
1,possibly the worst movie of the year and a half dozen,possibly one of those films that i would watch for a few
1,in a nutshell the movie has been made,in fact the whole movie is a waste
1,it is not even a comedy,it is a great film and one
1,the movie has a few good points but the plot,the acting and the story is just plain horrible
1,i'm a sucker of the director 's work and i have to admit that i am still not sure whether it should end,i'm not a big football fan and it 's not a good idea for a horror anthology but it is a great movie to
1,the film was shot on location in the early seventies and was filmed at the,the acting in this one sucks but i think this was a good idea
1,i'm not saying that it 's the worst film i 've ever,i'm not sure if this was a bad idea or not
1,okay the film has some very nice touches but it is n't,okay i have to admit that i have n't seen it since but
1,he is a very talented actor and he is a good actor,he is a very nice guy and he 's a good actor
1,if you are a fan of horror movies or are a fan you 'll enjoy the movie and you will enjoy the ride in,if the story was a bit more original it would have been a bit more interesting to have been in the middle ages
1,not that this was a good movie it was just plain awful,not that i do not want to be too harsh for the movie
1,i was surprised by this movie but the fact remains that,i think this movie should 've won an academy awards
1,well it 's the best thing i 've ever seen,well i guess it 's a bit too late but it
1,the movie starts out very promising,the movie was shot with a budget
1,his character in his first movie is the only one in a very interesting situation,his character has a very small role that he 's in the first movie
1,the story of the movie is very simple,the movie has a lot to do
1,there are a number in the cast that is n't,there is no real reason to see the movie
1,it 's not a good film,it is not a movie for kids
1,tarnished a few minutes of the movie,tarnished the first half hour and so to
1,scoffs at a few people who do a lot about,scoffs at the screen in a way or another
1,charm was the norm for a film,charm is a bit of fun
1,the acting is good with the actors and the script but it does work,the acting was horrible but that does n't matter because it 's just a bad
1,they are not in a bad mood,they are all in the movie for a
1,the story was a bit weak but it did have a few good moments,the film is about a group of people who go through the woods
1,overall it is an enjoyable movie,overall i think it is worth watching
1,as a fan i can only assume this is a film that is not a total loss,as for it i do n't think it would have made a better sequel if it had been
1,save your money watch it and find,save your money rent a copy
1,all i can say about this show that has n't been said is how many movies have,all i could see was a little of the movie that is supposed as a comedy
1,am i glad i saw a copy of this film on dvd,am i a moron or something but i think the movie is n't
1,only a few people can identify with the same,only the title would be a good idea
1,frank morgan is the perfect choice to play a man who does n't,frank sinatra is the perfect choice for this role as the villain
1,the movie was shot in a very tight and edited digital camera,the story is about a group that has a very different outlook on
1,if you 're looking to see a good film with an excellent plot this one should be a must buy for,if the film is a bit of an action film it 's a little too long and it is n't
1,he has a good job with his daughter,he is the best character in this series
1,if the movie had been made by a bunch of,if it were a drama it would n't work
1,this movie was a total waste,this is a very very good show
1,what is the deal with the story,what is this supposed to mean when a
1,got a little of it and it is a very nice one to be made,got the best out of it and the other is the fact it is n't even
1,wow the story of this film revolves around a bunch that are in the same,wow this movie was n't bad it is n't bad either it 's bad
1,this was an excellent movie that is worth a view on dvd,this is one of those movies where i could not believe i had
1,it 's the story that makes this movie,it 's not that bad it 's just not
1,of the many movies this one is n't the best of the lot,of all of the other comments here i have seen the first two installments
1,but the movie is n't bad,but i do n't want to ruin
1,alex is a very funny and funny movie,alex 's mother is the son of her father
1,again the plot was n't too interesting to,again this is not a bad movie
1,the movie is about two people trying to find the right,the acting is pretty bad the plot line was ridiculous
1,tierney is the most beautiful and most talented actress in this film,tierney plays a young woman whose life has her own problems but the
1,this movie is not a comedy,this is not a film that will
1,in a way the story was n't very good and the ending was just too predictable for the viewer to actually care,in the end i was surprised to find a film which was a complete waste and far worse than the film
1,i have seen this movie twice,i think the reason i was watching
1,the story of the story of a young man named,the acting was n't as bad as it was
1,from a technical standpoint this is an interesting story of a young woman and the woman who live with a beautiful woman,from the very beginning of the movie you get an idea of why the director should be commended for the fact he was
1,the film is a little too talky and too boring for its own little too much,the movie is very well done and is definitely worth seeing but it 's still not a
1,he is the most beautiful woman in a world,he is also a very talented actor but he does
1,nevermind that this film has a very good premise and a good cast and it,nevermind it 's not a bad thing but that 's what it does n't
1,it was n't even that great,it 's not the worst of all
1,this film has a lot to offer,this is the kind that makes it a
1,it has the same plot and it does n't have much,it has the same kind of humor as the original but it
1,the story is about two women who go on a killing spree in a foreign village to,the acting is good and the direction is great but the story line has some holes
1,i do think that the film is a very,i think it 's not worth the money
1,but it 's a good movie and it 's a shame,but this is not a movie that is n't even a movie
1,it was a waste of a good hour and a,it is a movie that you can sit through
1,the acting is horrible but the script is so bad that it makes you wonder if they were trying to get the best parts of it,the movie was a little over the top but i did n't think the film could have done better if the movie had ended up being a
1,also the film is very good in the beginning and the ending is a bit of fun to watch,also it was not a very good movie and it did n't really matter that much of a plot
1,it was n't even that good to begin with,it 's a shame to have a sequel to the
1,in this film the director has a knack for creating a movie that,in this case i would say the film is a complete mess
1,all i have to credit is the fact it 's the only thing i can think of in a movie that has a good cast but that 's it a good film,all i have to add is that it 's the best of the series and it shows the whole world in the same breath and the way the story is told
1,she was so beautiful and the movie had a great story,she is the only reason why i love this film because she
1,this is a film of all ages and i would recommend this movie to everyone,this is a very funny movie that is so funny it makes you laugh
1,here 's another example of how a movie can make you think about what it is,here 's a list that will not disappoint you but you wo to find the right thing
1,however the movie does have a lot going on,however the film is a very entertaining movie with a
1,heck i was so impressed with that film,heck it has to be one of my all
1,i think that the best of this movie,i was so disappointed by the movie
1,the story is about a bunch of people who are trying desperately to get rid of each other but,the film has a lot of action in it and the film is very entertaining in its approach
1,despite the obvious plot holes the film is very good in the sense that it is n't the best,despite being the most successful film ever filmed in my opinion i would like it to be seen in a
1,unfortunately it 's a bit too much of a mess for the viewer,unfortunately it 's a shame because the movie is a bit too short to
1,one can say the same thing,one thing i noticed was a little
1,the movie has an allstar cast that does not have the talent to be in it,the film has a few good points but it 's still pretty fun to sit through
1,worse than a lot of other movies that are made in this era and that 's not a good thing because this is,worse yet the worst film i have ever seen and it 's not even worth mentioning that it 's not even funny
1,miss bates was a great actor,miss bates 's character was not as
1,i think that the movie is just a bad excuse for an ending,i do think the movie is just too good for the most younger people
1,in the meantime he is a young man who wants to be a father of an old man,in fact i would have been more interested in watching the movie instead of watching it again
1,as a result it 's not the worst movie of the,as for it 's the best performance of all times
1,it 's a very good movie to have to sit through it,it has been said in many other movies that the movie was shot
1,overall the film was pretty entertaining though,overall i 'd say this was a pretty
1,ca n't say that it 's a good show because the show is,ca all of that is the point of view of the movie
1,perhaps it was a bit too long,perhaps it was just a movie but the
1,that was the most ridiculous thing about this movie it was the worst i have ever seen,that is the only way to see it in the theater when it was on cable and i
1,unfortunately it 's all too obvious that the film is so bad it 's good to watch,unfortunately the film 's main character was a very unlikable character and he is a total idiot in
1,if you have a chance to view it then you will probably like the film,if you have not read it do n't watch it if you are a diehard lover
1,given the fact of that i have a feeling that this movie was n't even worth the,given that the film was made for a low budget the film would be much better
1,over the course of the film he becomes the first and is the second of his,over all i 'd say it is one that i can watch over all times
1,my favorite scene involves when the girl is talking about her husband,my advice is do n't waste your money on this movie
1,a lot more people would say this movie is a waste of your,a lot more of the movie is a complete failure to watch
1,the film is a bit of a mess,the movie is a very interesting story of a
1,nurse snowblood is the worst of all the movies,nurse betty was a bit of a jerk
1,by the end of this movie you 'll get a sense,by the end you 'll be asking yourself to believe that the
1,this is the kind of thing you 'd want,this movie has a lot going for it
1,in the end i was n't impressed by the movie and it did n't work at all but,in a way this film is a must see for anyone interested with the genre of filmmaking
1,it was n't a bad movie it was just a waste of my,it 's the story and story that makes this movie so good
1,conner 's son and his wife are the best,conner is the only reason for the existence
1,he was the best in the movie,he is not a good actor
1,however this is a movie about the evils in the world,however i do not know where the real story is going
1,this is a very good and very funny movie,this movie does a lot for the characters
1,that is the only reason i can think for it,that is what the film was about the film was a
1,such a film as the first one was the,such a great cast and a great cast
1,this is a film that should not be,this is not a movie for everyone
1,but the film is a very entertaining one with a lot more laughs,but it 's not the worst film that i 've ever seen
1,also the scene when the girl and her boyfriend 's mother is a bit of a laugh at the camera work is a joke to me and the film 's only saving grace is the acting by all,also the film is a bit long for the first hour and a half of it but i still feel that i was in for a good time and i could n't wait to finally watch this
1,why do they have such a low score,why does he have the talent to create such
1,this is not a film for anyone interested in,this is not an example for a movie
1,val is a good actor and he 's good in this movie,val kilmer is a great actress in this movie as well
1,i think it 's a good movie,i think this movie was a huge disappointment
1,in this movie he plays the part he 's playing in a film that is not,in the end the movie was a little slow but it was n't that bad
1,mel gibson is a master of the craft and his talent and skill is the perfect asset for him to work with his craft,mel gibson is a very talented actor and i can see how he was in the film and his performance as the main villain
1,it is not even worth watching,it 's not a bad movie but
1,the film has a very strong plot and a very good cast,the movie is very slow and boring at best but it 's still
1,this is the worst film of the 90 's and i 've seen a few movies,this was one movie i saw on tv and i was very pleased with it
1,it 's a shame the movie is n't so much of a cult classic that is n't,it 's a pity that the film is n't as much of anything as a classic
1,this was the first of a trilogy that i,this movie is a waste of your time
1,oh yeah the movie is a bit cheesy,oh and a couple times you have the same
1,i do n't think that the director should be given a camera to,i have n't read the book but this is not the case
1,look no further and the movie was just plain bad,look for some of the best acting i have ever witnessed
1,the film was shot in a small town,the film has a very nice soundtrack
1,practically all of the actors were great,practically all of these films made a good
1,for the first time i thought the show is a bit too slow,for those who are interested at least the most ardent of the film is
1,some scenes were just plain stupid,some have said that i do n't
1,to say that this movie is bad would n't be a great understatement,to me it 's the best thing that has ever been said
1,he is not a very good actor,he 's not the best character he has
1,in the meantime of the film the film 's main protagonist is a young man whose wife and,in the end the film is a very entertaining movie that will be forgotten in many ways
1,robin and his friends have the power to go to their house and the two of those people are the,robin williams is a wonderful choice for this film and he is very good in it as the embodiment
1,in the meantime the movie is made to have a good cast and a very interesting plot line,in the end i was n't expecting the same to be the first time but it 's still a
1,i was surprised to learn that this was a good movie but i did,i have to wonder if the film has a lot of good points
1,i think this was a very low budget film but i think it,i have n't laughed so much since i 've seen the film
1,with the exception of this film the film has no real plot to speak,with a supposed beard on the wall it is a little too long for me
1,i do agree but the fact that it 's a film about a group and,i do agree that the film 's title character is a bit too unkind
1,laura linney was great as her character,laura is the only one who is able
1,this film is one big disappointment,this is a movie for those that
1,the film is a bit too slow and slow paced,the story is a complete disaster of a movie that does
1,the film has a few faults,the movie is a little slow paced
1,the acting and the direction was excellent,the story is about an ordinary young man
1,all the while the movie is set on a,all in all this is a great film
1,there was also a very funny scene where a guy who was,there was a good deal of nudity and nudity and nudity
1,i think that the film would be better off as a sequel of this film,i was so impressed by the story and i could have had a good time watching
1,as a matter i have a problem with the film as a whole,as for me i would have been a fan of this film
1,gunfights were not very good and the story seemed rather rushed,gunfights and a lot were a bit of a joke
1,displays a sense of humor that is n't really funny and it 's a little too long to make it worthwhile,displays a sense in which a movie has to be the easiest one to watch in a theater and is very entertaining
1,and the movie is so funny that the film has a certain amount more than a few moments,and it 's not that it 's supposed for a movie like this to be made and the fact
1,well this is a movie about a young man named kenny a man named tristan who is sent to the hospital to,well this is a good example of the kind that is not in any movie collection or even an action movie
1,i think it 's the funniest movie i have had the fortune of seeing,i do agree that this is not a movie for people who are not a
1,the film is not a bad movie but the acting is superb and the script by eric greene is a bit,the story of the movie revolves in two young girls who are searching for the missing love of the life
1,sean bean plays the character with a great sense to the story but he is very good and he is very good in,sean connery is a fine actor as well and he is excellent in this movie he plays the part with the character
1,to me that 's what i thought,to say that this is the worst movie
1,yes there 's a lot going for,yes the movie does n't work
1,i do n't know if the film is a good one,i think this movie has the same amount as a typical b
1,i have to say that i was impressed by this,i have n't seen the film in the past
1,enemies of the universe and the other characters are all,enemies of course are the best part about it
1,the acting is horrible and the script,the acting and directing are excellent
1,lame movie about a guy trying desperately hard to get the girl to,lame movie that is n't even remotely entertaining or funny at all
1,like i was watching the film i was n't impressed,like a lot more than a few of those movies you
1,the film has an interesting premise but that 's about,the film is a complete mess of an hour
1,to say that this is one of my favorite actors makes me think,to say the best of all things i can say is the fact that
1,dennis hopper is the best in the movie,dennis quaid and his crew are the best actors
1,a lot like the film the story line is not as,a lot more then i can say about the acting
1,it 's just that there was no real explanation for the movie,it was a good idea and it 's a very good movie
1,none other than the fact that he was a very good actor,none is a movie with no plot and the acting is terrible
1,there was also the fact that the film was shot in the,there was no need that to make it into the movie
1,there is a lot to like in it but it was n't,there was also an attempt to recreate the movie 's own problems and
1,it 's a shame to hear more of the,it was a waste of time and time
1,from the beginning the movie is about the struggle between an old man,from a few of the reviews this is one of the best movies ever
1,i have seen it several dozen more many years before,i do n't think it would have had any redeeming quality
1,after a few minutes of the first movie we see a group that is not only the last surviving but then we are left with a bunch of questions,after a while you realize the movie is going for a lot of the movie and the ending is so predictable and predictable that the viewer is supposed to believe
1,not a single solitary moment in this movie that is n't a good idea for a,not only was he trying too hard but i was pleasantly surprised to find out
1,eleanor parker 's performance is a bit too old to be the,eleanor parker is a very good actor and is very good
1,errol flynn is the perfect choice for this role,errol flynn is a great actor in this film but
1,mandy moore plays the mother of the rich husband and the mother of a young boy who has a crush in the world,mandy 's performance is the only thing that makes it worth watching and is not only one film that is worth seeing
1,however the film 's biggest flaw is,however it 's not that bad
1,we are shown a very different view,we get a few laughs from the opening
1,at the end the movie ends up in,at least it has a good plot
1,eric roberts plays an annoying and annoying man who is a,eric stoltz is the only reason to see this movie
1,the film is a little over an attempt to be funny and is just plain stupid,the story was so bad that it could not have been a good idea to make a
1,three men are sent to a mental institution where their husbands live in a small apartment,three stars from the film that are the most memorable of the film and the most impressive
1,it has a lot more going for it,it was so funny and it was a shame
1,the story is about a young man,the film is a complete mess
1,so the story of the film and the story of a woman who gets involved in,so what i do remember is that the film has no redeeming qualities at all
1,and the film has some good points to it that are so much better than the original,and it 's not the best of them either as the film is about the man who is
1,i was surprised to see that the movie had a lot to do to get,i think that the film was made for the sole purpose in the story
1,i was so disappointed with it i was surprised that it would n't be made in my country and i do n't think that the,i have to say that this is one that i would recommend seeing it if it 's available on vhs and dvd or dvd
1,it 's a shame because the film is a little slow but that does n't mean that it 's not a good,it 's a shame to see such a talented performer and the actors who play the main roles of this movie
1,eventually i was a bit skeptical about this film because it was so bad,eventually he finds a way to help her and she 's a very nice person
1,not a great film but a great film for,not a bad movie for a rainy day
1,this movie has a lot to do with the fact that it is a film,this film was made by the esteemed producer 's first feature director and it 's one
1,the movie is a bit long and the acting is not very convincing,the story is about a group of four young adults who live with their
1,why do they make movies like the plague,why is it that i do not understand why
1,a few years later she 's a little more than a year old,a lot more then the usual hollywood blockbusters it 's a very nice film
1,the story is a little confusing but the characters are likable enough to keep the story together,the film is not as bad but it is a little slow paced and the acting is terrible
1,my advice is if you are looking for something more than watch this,my favorite scene is when the two men meet the two lovers
1,amber 's character was a very good and likable woman and i liked her in,amber is an excellent actress who can act as an actress in the film
1,in this case i have seen this movie in a theater and i 've seen it over and,in this one he 's the hero of the film who plays his role as the hero
1,ok so i do n't know how it 's going for a horror film but it is a great movie that i can recommend,ok so i do n't think that the acting is bad but it is not that much better than most of these films but it
1,oh and the scene where the guy is sitting in the,oh yeah and the film has a lot of fun
1,this is a great example to the genre,this is not a film to be taken from
1,i have seen a couple of episodes and it shows that it is,i have to agree that the film is not a total disaster
1,several scenes are so funny you ca n't even laugh,several of the scenes in this film involve some very graphic
1,not only is this the best movie i ever saw but it was also a great,not only does it have a lot of fun it 's a bit too long
1,most of them have a very bad script and the script was n't bad enough to make it,most of the actors were good and the story is very good and the acting is good
1,vic jaffe is a very talented actor and the,vic morrow is great here as a man
1,one of the best of the silent era films of all time and the one that made me laugh,one day the girl gets involved with a woman named missy who is the daughter of her husband
1,the film 's main character 's daughter who was the only character in this movie was a little girl in the book but the fact she was a bit too young,the movie is a bit slow and drags on for about 10 hours but i still think it 's worth watching if you are looking forward at the video store for the
1,this movie was a waste of time and time to sit through,this film was made for the sole reasons that it failed to make
1,it 's not even that bad,it 's not a good thing
1,the story is about the lives of a group of people,the film is a little bit of fun to watch because of
1,if it was n't a little too much like a comedy it would have worked better,if you want the real seung of a movie like i do n't know what i did
1,rated pg for violence violence strong female language and drug situations to the movie,rated r for violence violence violence sexual content sexual references sexual content sexual references
1,more than a few of the scenes in the movie were a lot like the ones that are supposed for the sake,more importantly the film 's story is a little too much for me but i have to say the acting and the story
1,in fact it 's just so bad it was good,in this case the movie has a very good cast that
1,like a lot more of the same,like the other reviewers said the movie does
1,add a few of his best and a good story and you have the,add to that the usual action sequences and some of it 's own
1,it 's the only movie that can be made available on dvd and vhs,it 's a shame the movie is n't even a comedy and it is n't
1,there are some good moments in this movie and i think that the director was a little too unkind to this,there is a lot of violence in here and a few scenes that are n't funny but it is n't
1,she 's a very talented actor and i,she is not a very attractive person
1,the acting is horrible the directing is awful and it makes you wonder if,the story was a bit too thin but the characters were very interesting
1,the movie has a very good story line,the movie was shot on location and it was
1,madge is a good actress but the script is so bad that it 's hard to believe she is actually trying,madge and her friends have a relationship with the two sisters and their parents and their families are all very different from
1,this is a movie for all ages,this film is not for everyone
1,a few minutes of my life have been spent on,a good example was how the movie was made
1,no wonder it 's the same old,no one can replace the movie
1,i think it 's a very bad idea to make a movie about,i was expecting a lot of fun and i liked that movie
1,cheap and boring but the story is n't that bad either,cheap and dull but this is a film that is worth watching
1,this is the kind of movie you should n't,this movie was so bad it was funny
1,its a shame because the movie was so bad that you could n't care about it and i was bored,its a great film for the entire movie and it 's a joy for anyone who likes to laugh out for
1,maybe he is the best actor ever,maybe it would have been more interesting if
1,if you are not a diehard fan like myself you 'll probably like this,if it were n't so much better than it was then it 's still very
1,the movie is a bit long and the,the acting is good with the cast
1,for a while this is a very good movie,for those who have not seen the movie i think
1,both of these movies made it seem like they are being filmed,both of the two actors are good and it is a shame that
1,is it the best film ever made,is it a good movie or a bad
1,i was n't expecting a lot,i was expecting a lot more from
1,all of them were a little over a dozen years ago,all of this in a very bad movie is not even a
1,so i have a feeling that i 've been watching a movie in the years for something that is a little different but this is a movie that i would gladly warn people,so if you have n't read this review please do not watch this movie if you want something more than you 're looking for an asian film that will be a waste
1,unfortunately the movie does n't have the usual plot devices,unfortunately the script was so weak and so contrived
1,anne parillaud was excellent but she was very weak and she was very good,anne reid was a very nice actress and i thought the acting was great
1,otherwise this was n't even a good film but i would n't recommend it,otherwise i 'd like to point out the obvious message of this film
1,he is a good actor but his performance in this is so awful that it 's hard to believe that,he has been a great actor but his character is so bland that you do feel sorry for him
1,in a nutshell the film has a great cast and is one of the most underrated and underrated movies of,in the end i was n't expecting a movie about the dangers and the struggle to overcome the odds
1,can i say that this was an excellent movie,can anyone tell me what i was going on
1,let 's face the whole idea of how the writers were able to get a decent movie to the big trail in the end and then the end result is a good,let 's face it the story of this film revolves around an aging man who has been living on the island for the first night and has a son and wife
1,this was one movie that was n't bad enough for a sequel to the original but still the movie has,this was the first of a long series to come from tv and the show is so much different
1,i have seen a lot more movies in which i have seen this one and i think it is a very good movie,i think that it was the best movie i 've ever seen in my life and i hope they get it right next time
1,the story of a woman 's life in which her father is killed by the devil is a bit too,the acting is horrible the directing is worse and it is so obvious that it 's impossible for me
1,i have seen this movie several times and it still remains very funny to me,i think this movie was a waste for me and the acting and writing
1,he 's a very talented character,he 's a good actor but the
1,well i guess i 'll have to see it again to see how the movie can be done,well this film is a complete waste for a razzie award nominated for the best picture oscar nominee
1,as i said earlier it is very hard to believe this is a film,as a matter of view i was not surprised to see the movie in the
1,the movie starts off ok and the ending,the film is a very moving film
1,you can see that the movie was shot in the,you can tell they were going through this film
1,disappointed by all the actors in their roles they are,disappointed that the film is a little too long
1,naming it is a movie about a bunch,naming the story of a serial killer in the
1,in fact it is n't the worst movie i 've ever,in fact the whole movie is a bit of fun
1,yet it 's a very good movie,yet the film does not work at the
1,harriet 's character is so annoying it 's impossible to care for her,harriet is the best character in the movie as she does n't have any
1,playing the game of a serial killer on campus is a good thing,playing a straight part is not that bad it is not a bad movie
1,the acting and directing are very good and the characters are likable,the acting was good the story is pretty good and the characters were
1,it is a great show for kids and children,it was a good idea to show the real world
1,eager by all means the director and director of the movie is the director,eager for the first part of the story is a bit of the same
1,it was a waste of time and time and,it is the most important film ever made
1,and the film has some of its moments in the end,and the film 's climax is a bit jarring as a whole
1,as for this i do n't think that it would be a good film but it is not,as a matter there is a very good reason why this show is so funny and funny
1,while the story is about a young boy named angus a man who is searching for her father he decides to go to the house and find his,while the film has a bit of an ending it is a bit long and i would recommend it to any fan of horror or horror movies
1,but i do have to say that i have to say that this,but the film 's main problem with the film is its ability
1,in fact it 's just a little bit boring,in this movie he has a good sense of the
1,the story of the film is about a group that are trapped on,the film has an interesting message about a young man named seita
1,is this the same kind of film,is this supposed for a comedy
1,this is a great film to watch for a few reasons,this is a film that is not a good one
1,less than a few minutes of this film i felt that the acting was n't bad,less of a drama than a movie about an american woman and a young woman
1,after seeing the movie i can see the similarities with this film and the,after seeing the movie i was n't expecting anything more than it would
1,i was surprised to find out that the film is about a group that has a very good idea,i was so impressed with this movie that i was surprised to learn that it was a film about two
1,angelina jolie plays a woman who is a woman and has been a,angelina dunne was great in the movie and she 's great here
1,immediately i saw the film and it was the best of the three,immediately it becomes clear that the director has no clue what he wants and
1,one day he meets a woman who has an obsession to her own daughter who is now a little too young to be the mother of the son of the family and the mother and son of the mother,one can see the similarities with the film and the way that the characters in the movie were written by the director and the director of a film called deathtrap and the movie is about an individual who lives in
1,they 're the only one that makes a good film,they are not even funny and the film is n't even
1,the movie was shot at that,the film is about a woman named
1,for those who do n't know it 's the most accurate film ever made but,for the most diehard of the movie i have seen a lot of movies
1,the movie was a waste of my money i,the movie starts off with an interesting premise
1,but it is a movie that you can watch with a lot less laughs than,but the movie is not about as funny and it has a few laughs
1,no one can deny it but i do n't think,no matter the mystery is not a good thing
1,this is a movie about a woman who,this movie is not a good example
1,christine 's character is a bit naive but it 's a good movie and the,christine is a good character actress who is n't afraid to make the film
1,whether you 're a huge fan of the series or,whether you like or hate the movie or not
1,while i have n't seen this movie i have to say i was impressed by the acting,while it is a little dated it is still pretty good and very well acted and the actors
1,the movie is about the power that people are trying to make and how to be,the movie is not a complete waste of my money but it 's worth seeing
1,the film 's premise has been done,the movie has a few faults
1,i do agree with the other comment that this was the most beautiful movie ever,i think that the best way of making this film is to be appreciated
1,timon and clyde were very funny and they were funny at first,timon of notre street is a very good film that will not disappoint
1,what is the deal in the first place,what a waste for a talented actress
1,that 's the only reason i can watch it again because it has the,that is a very bad film and the movie is just plain awful
1,while i do n't know what to say about this film the acting is very bad the plot is weak and so on,while i have seen the original version i have to say i have n't seen the original series and i do not agree
1,and the ending is just a little too long,and the ending was just too bad and too contrived
1,calvin is the perfect guy to play the role of,calvin has the most difficult role of all time
1,just a couple of scenes where i could n't have been so much more interested in seeing the film and i,just as the movie is set in the future of a small budget and the actors are n't even good
1,falon is the best character of the bunch of thieves,falon was a good guy who was the hero
1,lee van cleef is in it for the first ten minutes or two,lee is an actor that is a bit too long to play
1,michael caine plays a young man with his heart of gold,michael moore 's performance in this film was so good that i
1,in the end he was a bit too much to ask and he,in the end he is the most likable character in this film
1,after the first 15 years of this film i thought that this was,after a couple of minutes you get to see the whole thing
1,if i was the only child i 'd ever met i 'd have been in love with her,if the movie does have a few laughs and a couple of scenes you 'll find yourself laughing hysterically
1,i think that this is one of those films that,i was so excited that i had seen it
1,if the film had been a little bit of the first two hours the film is still a,if i could find it in the first place i would n't even have to pay attention
1,this was an awesome film for all those that have seen the original,this film is so awful that i actually laughed out laughing and laughed my
1,robin williams is the only actor who has ever made his appearance in the movie,robin williams plays the part he is a bit more than the character he played in
1,fun to see a movie like this,fun to watch the film and i think
1,my advice is to watch the original movie,my friend who i saw this movie at the
1,regardless of what the film was supposed at all i was expecting,regardless the film 's only saving is its lack of originality
1,is this a movie for the whole family,is this a good movie for the first 10
1,out there i was a little surprised by this movie,out there the movie is a complete waste of money
1,she is the one to do,she has to have a lot better
1,maybe he is the only one who is,maybe the best part of this film
1,the acting is very weak the plot and the direction,the movie starts out very well and then the movie is
1,be prepared to give this movie a shot of,be prepared for the worst movie ever produced
1,the movie has a very nice atmosphere but it is,the film has a lot more going for it
1,it 's a very good film,it 's a very good film
1,the acting is pretty bad but the script is so bad that it is n't even funny,the film is about a man searching a young woman for his mother to marry his mother but
1,it 's a very good story and a great movie,it is a movie about the life and love between a
1,i think this movie was the best of it,i was so bored that i had to watch it
1,the story is very weak and the story is just,the acting is horrible the plot has nothing new
1,in the movie the main villain and the girl are the two women who live together,in fact this is one film you can do better than you have ever been
1,the acting was n't bad either,the movie is about a young boy
1,this is the best of the four films and i think the best one,this was the first time i ever saw a remake of this show
1,being a fan i can appreciate this movie and i do not recommend it to everyone,being a fan and a fan of his work i can still feel the urge of his
1,on a scale of fact there was a lot of action scenes in it,on this note the film was very entertaining and it 's a very good story
1,many of the scenes in which the movie was filmed were just a bit,many of the scenes are so bad that i could have been happier
1,sometimes i have n't read the book,sometimes i think that the movie was a
1,fortunately the film has a lot of potential for the,fortunately the film is n't even a horror film
1,supposedly this is the kind to make an excellent movie and i think that the director was,supposedly the story is not that bad but the acting is terrible the plot was weak
1,i do n't understand why they made this,i was so impressed with the movie and i
1,if it was on cable tv channel i 'd have a copy,if you 're not familiar with this movie i suggest that the producers
1,truly this is an excellent film and i recommend that everyone involved with the,truly a film that i would recommend for everyone who loves good movies
1,i think that the best thing in this movie was that,i was so excited to find the movie on dvd
1,but this is the worst movie i have,but the movie is so much better
1,at least the original was a bit of an achievement for me,at one point the film was shot on a soundstage camera
1,i have seen it many years and i can honestly tell you that,i have never been so compelled to see it in a theater
1,because of the fact it has the same plot and the actors it 's just a bit of the comedy that is,because of the fact that the film is not a good movie it does not have any real impact or purpose
1,sounds the same way as the other films,sounds the same but the movie is so boring
1,it is a shame to see a movie that has a great cast and,it 's the only thing you can get out from watching this movie
1,personally i think this is a good movie for kids who want to watch the,personally i would not recommend this to any one who has seen this movie
1,more than anything else i 've never heard,more like the director of the original
1,sadly the film is a complete failure,sadly the film 's biggest flaw is the
1,chow yunfat plays a character with a lot more depth than a character,chow yun grant is the master of the film 's story and the acting
1,it is not that the story line is n't that good the acting is pretty poor,it was a good idea to put a movie on the cover of the box and make
1,the film has a very good story and a very believable story,the film has some of the most memorable scenes i ever saw
1,in the end the movie has a great story,in this case it 's a very good movie
1,he is a man who is n't alone,he has a great voice and a good actor
1,here 's the plot of this movie,here is a movie that is a little
1,the film is a complete mess,the movie was a complete failure
1,during this time of course i had to turn off the tv and the whole movie is just so stupid,during his first viewing the film was made to entertain the audiences and audiences alike in the process of making this
1,his character is so believable and believable that he,his character was so believable and so funny
1,never really explained why they were all that the,never mind a film that is n't bad
1,both the film 's detractors have to be faulted for its shortcomings,both films are not so great and are so good that they can
1,their relationship with the family is also quite poignant,their performances are so bad that they 're almost laughable
1,i do n't think that this is a great film but i,i have to say this movie sucked me into the movie
1,i do not want to spoil the film by,i think this movie has the same amount
1,detective and wife of the murdered man who 's in a mental institution is the only thing he has to offer,detective and wife have to deal to save the city from their parents' life in order for them to find their place
1,at least the actors in this film seem,at least it has some interesting moments
1,enjoyed this film and i have n't seen it since it 's been released,enjoyed the film and its a very good film but the movie was just plain
1,plus this movie is a great piece to show the true love between two people who are,plus the film 's ending is a bit ambiguous but the end is so much better
1,this movie is one of the funniest i ever watched in any film i have watched,this movie was so good that it was a joy and a joy that i had never
1,it is not a good movie and it 's not a good film,it 's a shame because it 's not a movie to see if you
1,in the first movie the hero and the snowman are the same,in fact the film was so boring it was almost laughable
1,it 's the story of a woman who is attracted by her mother to the daughter of the daughter,it 's just a shame that the director and writer decided to make the film as the film progressed because
1,to me this was one of his better,to me it was a great movie
1,really it 's a movie you should watch,really this is a very good show
1,the acting is good and it makes you wonder why,the story of the film is a little weak
1,for a long time i did find this a bit of an exercise into the horror of a,for a long period of time i was able to sit down to see this movie again
1,when i watched the movie i had the impression that it was a movie that was a complete waste and good one which i think is a good idea,when the two of them are killed they 're all together and it is revealed that they have to deal with the fact they were in a different place to
1,it has a good story line and good actors,it 's not a good thing to say that this
1,there 's a lot of action and a bit more than the first half,there are some great performances in the film but they are very poor as the
1,director robert altman and writer john landis have created,director michael curtiz has created an excellent movie
1,i'm not sure if i was supposed or was n't the director intended a good movie or a combination of action and drama but,i'm sure that the director had to be a bit prejudiced for this film but i doubt it was intended for the film
1,promising movie about a man trying to get her husband out of her life,promising to see the actors and their talents and the acting was excellent
1,and the film 's main flaw is the fact that the director and writer have no idea what it is all,and the film 's climax of this film was so predictable that you wonder what the hell were all about
1,the story was so bad i could n't even care about,the film was shot in color and in the background
1,when i first saw it in new york it had been a long time,when i saw this movie i thought that the film is really good
1,things get worse when the movie starts,things get complicated at times but the plot
1,he is a great actress and i hope that he,he 's not the best actor in the movie
1,then there 's a lot to like about this film and the acting and the plot was very,then again i do n't know why i have n't seen this movie in the first place
1,truly it is a film that has,truly the best of the three
1,and it 's not that the story is n't that good,and i think this is a great film to watch and enjoy
1,upon arriving at the end we see that the man is not a man and he is the person that he loves and,upon arrival he meets a woman named melissa who 's been kidnapped and murdered by the police and is killed and murdered
1,actually it 's not that bad it was good,actually it 's not as bad as the others
1,sarah michelle geller and her brother are a great match,sarah silverman is the perfect choice to be the main actress
1,that 's the only reason i can think of,that 's the way it 's supposed to
1,you 'll never know that the movie will be so much more entertaining,you 'll see that there is n't much to say about this movie except
1,yes the movie does n't have any plot or character development but i,yes it 's an action film but it 's still pretty good
1,i think this film has been a favorite,i was n't impressed at all the movie was
1,one thing that really bugged my nerves is the acting,one of my favorite movies of all time and a must
1,the movie has the same plot and some good performances but that 's all there are,the story is very simple the acting is superb the script has a great cast
1,the film 's premise is that of a man named sosuke who has been murdered,the movie has a lot of good moments but it does n't have a whole lot
1,it 's the only way this could have made the story,it has the most interesting characters i 've ever heard
1,most people have commented on this show,most of the film is a flashback of
1,best line of dialogue in this movie is a scene,best line is when the movie is a joke
1,it is a movie that you will never want your,it is a movie with the best of all
1,they have a very good script but they do have a few funny,they are the only one that makes the film even remotely watchable
1,angels in a small village of the living,angels are n't always the same people
1,not a good film for the whole film but it does contain a lot more than just the usual hollywood clichs that have a certain amount to them,not only is he a very good actor but it 's a great performance by his character and his acting is very good as the movie progresses
1,this is one of the worst movies i 've had a long long past,this is a movie that is n't even worth watching for a laugh
1,trex is one of my favorite films ever so i have n't seen,trex is an excellent film with great acting and an interesting premise
1,if it was n't for the fact it 's not a good movie it would have been,if it was n't a total failure of an action movie i could n't help it
1,highly recommended to fans of the genre,highly recommended to all fans of a good
1,but the story was so weak and so predictable and so boring that i was left wondering why the director,but it 's just not that funny and i ca only think of the worse movie in the works
1,similar for this film it has the feel to it,similar to the first movie the characters were n't very interesting
1,there is a lot of action and a bit more of the action,there is a very good reason that the film is so good that the
1,with the exception the director and the writer and producer and producer have given the film a unique look,with the help from his wife the two leads are the only two people who have ever been able to
1,if you want to make something that is n't funny this movie will,if you 're a diehard horror fan you will enjoy this movie
1,xxx is one of them and it,xxx has been a great film
1,but it was a very good film,but this is the first time that i
1,this movie was so bad it 's funny,this is the best movie of the 90 years
1,often the movie is a bit slow but it 's not,often the plot is not a bad one but the acting is
1,the movie is a complete mess,the acting and the plot are just
1,now i do not know where to start but i do n't care for the characters,now i do n't know what i was thinking but i was a little disappointed
1,particularly the scenes that were supposed at times were just too hard and too little to the end to make me laugh and i was really bored with the,particularly the scene when the girl and her son were sitting through the entire movie and the movie is just plain stupid and i was laughing at it
1,the film is a little slow but it has the best of,the movie was shot on a shoestring in new york city
1,in the end it does n't seem to be as good as it 's predecessor and i do n't think that the movie,in fact the whole movie is about an hour long and i do think that the director is trying to be clever
1,example that i do agree that it is a little too slow for me to be a little too harsh,example a few of his other films are the same but he has to deal with the fact that he is
1,this was a movie that could be seen by the same,this is a movie for the ages of all ages
1,action is not a problem but it has to do with the story,action packed action sequences are a lot better than the usual suspects
1,i think this is one movie that i would,i have never been a fan of hers
1,to be fair the acting is pretty good but it is not a,to me it is an excellent film and one of the best
1,when i saw a preview screening of this movie on the shelf i decided it might suck,when i saw the film on the cover i was looking for it in the theater and i
1,the movie has a very good story line and a good plot,the acting was horrible but the story line was good the actors are
1,naturally i do not want to be too unkind to a,naturally the movie is a complete waste of my favorites
1,the movie starts out as a series of flashbacks,the movie was a bit of a mess
1,in this movie we see the same old man and his wife,in fact the film was shot in a very tight manner
1,he was a little more than a year later,he is not the best of the lot
1,our hero has to get a lot more attention to his character than he does and he does n't really do that,our hero and his wife are a married couple and they have to deal with their own problems in the past
1,there was a lot to like in this film,there was a bit of humor and a couple moments
1,and the movie does n't make any sense whatsoever,and i do n't care for anyone who is in
1,being a fan and the other films i have to watch this one,being that the film was made for the sole purpose of the first one
1,in fact the movie is very much a parody in a movie,in the first film we see a young girl being tortured and raped
1,i was expecting this film to be a bit slow but the ending is pretty,i have n't seen this since i first saw this in the first place
1,the story is about the lives of a young woman,the film is not about the war or war
1,and i was n't impressed by that,and it was n't a good idea to
1,the story is simple and the characters are all believable and the story is so real and the characters that are believable to watch and so much,the film 's story is about a group that is invited into the world of war and the two of them have been in a relationship
1,the story was so bad it was funny to watch,the movie is about as good and funny and as it
1,there is a reason why this movie,there are some very funny moments
1,on a scale of 1 to 10 it 's a great movie to see,on the other side the movie is a complete mess and i would n't even
1,when the first film was made in a year of its time and,when i first watched this movie on the tv i was hooked
1,alice and her friend 's daughter is in the hospital and they are forced,alice is not a great actress but she 's not just an actress
1,for the most of the time i was surprised to learn how to make a movie,for those who like the original series the original series is the best of course
1,i do n't understand why they did not show the real footage of the film,i have n't been a fan since i saw the movie but it was n't the
1,the story is about two people who are trying desperately to survive in the woods,the story of a woman and a boy trying to survive and get married and the
1,while i am a huge big admirer and i have never seen a movie that was,while it 's a bit of an action film it has a few funny moments
1,to me it was the most boring movie i have seen,to be honest i have n't read a book so much as
1,richard chamberlain is the perfect actor for his portrayal and his portrayal,richard pryor is the only actor who can save this one
1,steiger and the rest are just as good,steiger is one that makes you want him
1,this is one that you 'll never see anywhere,this movie is a waste of your money
1,there was a good cast of characters and the,there 's no real plot and no plot
1,could n't they have been a bit,could have done a better job
1,the acting is horrible the story is ridiculous the acting worse,the acting was good enough with the script and acting
1,dr the oldest son who has been kidnapped in a mental institution and is forced,dr jacques mankiewicz is a great director and this is a very good film
1,by now we are left with the same impression as the rest of this film,by the end of his career the only thing that makes it stand out is the
1,i do n't know why this was n't the first movie,i think it would 've made it a better film
1,my favorite parts are when a guy is trying his hand at the door of the car,my friend who was a little more than i was watching this movie would have been surprised by
1,the acting is horrible the story line has little,the story line has a lot of twists
1,before the devil has a heart attack and a man he 's been kidnapped by a man who is supposed and is not only a coward,before you know what to do you 'll be able to get the movie right after you 've seen it but you 'll have to be a
1,c aubrey howell is the perfect actress to be a great actress,c aubrey brooks 's character was so unlikable that it was hard
1,either way it is a very good film,either way it 's a great film
1,he is not a bad actor but he,he is also a very nice guy
1,90 years later a young man named jake decides to take his,90 minutes in the film is about as bad and boring
1,when i first read the book i was very impressed by how it was written but i was surprised at it,when he finally catches a woman who is in love with the girl he is a very good person who is a
1,even when i found the movie 's story i was really disappointed,even though i 've never seen a movie that is so much better
1,keep it in your head and do not watch the movie because the plot was so bad that it was actually,keep your eye on the actors who were the only ones who had the ability and the skill to shine
1,and the movie is not a total disaster but a great one,and the acting is pretty awful and i 've seen thousands of movies
1,it 's a shame the movie is not a good one to begin with and it has to have been the worst movie,it 's a shame because i do n't know what the point of the film was but i do n't know why
1,but the movie is a good example of the type of movies that make,but the film 's biggest flaw was the lack of a coherent story
1,my favorite scene in a movie when she is in the hospital is a bit too long,my only regret is that i have seen the same film and have a lot of fun
1,anyway i was a fan of this series but i do n't think that any,anyway it 's a movie about an aging man named hector and his wife
1,in this case i was a little confused about this movie as it seemed a lot of the film is just about the same,in fact it has to have been made in a very low budget and that 's what i would like to see in a film
1,finally i have seen this movie and have seen the first one in my life,finally the plot of this movie was very bad the acting was bad but the story
1,to be a little more interesting i was n't impressed at how much i liked it,to say that i do n't know i have n't seen any other film in a row
1,there is no plot no action and nothing interesting to say or even a good film,there is a lot to say about the movie but the acting in this is very poor
1,flavia is an interesting movie about an american couple trying to get their,flavia has been a very popular person for years to find her
1,of the two movies that were made in the 80 's and 90 other than this movie they are n't even,of course it was n't that bad but the acting in this film is horrible as well as the rest
1,the acting is good the script was ok and the characters were believable and i was surprised,the acting is very good and it 's a shame that this movie is so underrated
1,laura dern plays a woman whose wife has a mental health and a love for the woman and the woman,laura dern 's portrayal is a little too much for a movie but she does n't have the usual charm to
1,buttermaker is a very talented actor and is also very funny,buttermaker is one of the funniest characters in a movie
1,so the film was n't so bad it is funny but it 's just,so i guess i 'll give this movie 1 stars out of 10
1,because the movie has a lot of problems,because the film is so bad its good
1,this is a great movie to see,this movie is a great movie
1,the film 's main flaw was that it 's not the most original,the acting is very bad and the story is just plain awful
1,however i think that the film 's best asset is,however the movie was n't really that bad either
1,jimmy stewart is a very talented actor,jimmy durante is the perfect choice
1,the acting in this is excellent the acting was good but the story was so weak,the movie was made by a group of friends with an iq for the dvd
1,john huston 's performance is a bit subdued but the,john huston is one that i do n't know
1,it has a very good story but it has a good story to tell and is told,it 's a shame that the director of the film did n't have a chance to see a
1,he is a man of sorts but his wife is a very,he is the only one who can identify with the other
1,five years ago a young woman who is a woman is a,five years later he 's a man with a heart attack
1,this is the kind of movie that you would n't have seen,this is a very bad attempt to be an action film
1,i'm glad that the producers decided to,i'm not a fan like that
1,this was a movie about a young girl who is trying too much,this is the kind of movie where you have to see the film to
1,most of the time it 's not even the same thing,most people have seen that the movie is not as good as
1,this is a film for all ages and for fans who enjoy it and are willing to watch it for the first time it 's a great movie,this is the kind to be done in such a way of being a film that it is hard for anyone with an iq of a film to be
1,the story of the movie is very interesting,the acting is horrible and the plot is just
1,instead we got a very good movie with some great acting and a very good performance and the end is a,instead it 's a movie about an ordinary woman named seita played by her younger brother played by robert englund
1,there 's a lot going on here and the film is n't really,there are so many things that i can say for a movie
1,and that is what makes it so great and the film is very entertaining,and the film is a complete mess and it does n't even have a single
1,if i had to pick up my own review i could n't have been more than this film for,if the film is not bad enough to make you laugh it will probably appeal to all ages
1,now that is n't the case here with,now i know what i did last
1,special kudos should be paid to go see a movie,special effects that are used to make the film more like
1,the acting was terrible the story line had,the acting in this movie is terrible
1,it is a shame that the film is so,it is not the best film ever made
1,even the most ardent of actors in the movie were the ones i hated,even though it 's a little bit of a parody it still does not work
1,shelly is the best thing about this movie but,shelly 's performance is the best of all
1,the acting in this movie was so awful,the film is not a complete mess
1,idiocy is the only reason why i would like this film,idiocy is n't the only way you can enjoy it as it
1,aside the movie is a complete failure,aside from the aforementioned plot twists the characters
1,i have never seen the original version but i have to agree it is,i do think that the film has a lot of fun to it
1,lipsync is the best movie i have had,lipsync and candle is a great film
1,the film has a very nice atmosphere but the story itself has,the story is simple but the story is n't as good
1,oh yeah it has a very funny scene and it was fun to watch,oh yes the film was a bit too much for my taste but that was
1,i have never seen a movie where the actors,i think this movie was a great deal
1,it 's not a great film,it is not a movie that you
1,the acting is good and the story line,the acting was terrible but i did like this
1,but it does not make a lick more sense than that,but i have to say i was so impressed that i had
1,i have n't seen the original version but it is still very enjoyable,i have never heard a movie before i could n't get into the world
1,on the plus side the film was pretty much made for tv viewing but,on the other side of my mouth it is not a good film
1,the acting is horrible but the script is n't,the film was a waste on an evening
1,i do not want to spoil the plot but i 'll say that i do n't think it is that the movie was n't that great,i was n't sure if the film was going for an oscar nomination for best screenplay or acting and the other is that it 's not a
1,his character in the movie does n't really have a chance to be a good guy,his character is a little annoying and he is a bit of a jerk to me as
1,whiz and a little edie is an excellent film,whiz is a film that should have been titled the
1,i have to agree on this one,i think it would be great
1,when i saw the trailer of the movie i had to see the whole story,when you watch it you will probably be bored by the end but it 's just
1,when you have to be one of my favorite actors in this movie i have to say,when the movie is released it 's just a bad film and the acting was awful
1,i have seen it several times in my lifetime and it is a very good,i have n't read any of the books but this one was so bad
1,deadly grannies are a bunch of kids and they are all pretty stupid,deadly grannies and the mole end of your seat is a very good film
1,it 's a shame to see this movie on video,it is a very good film and the director is not
1,the movie is a little slow at first to think of what 's coming to the characters and what they are,the movie is a little slow and slow paced but the acting is so bad it is n't even funny enough to
1,unfortunately the film does n't seem like a real good,unfortunately i do not recommend this movie to anyone
1,good luck for a good movie but the film is a bit too,good luck but not as funny and as good one as this
1,this movie has been released on dvd for years and it has been released on dvd,this movie was so good that you actually had a good time with the story and it
1,for the first two thirds i thought that the movie had some good parts,for a long while i was able to sit down and enjoy a few scenes
1,yet the film has a very strong cast and a good story,yet the story is very good and the acting is good enough for
1,the acting was good but not enough to save it from being too dull,the acting was terrible the directing awful the script was bad and it had a
1,the film is a bit slow moving but a lot better and more exciting and more interesting,the movie was shot in the same location as the first time i have seen the first movie
1,his wife is a little too young to,his character has a lot of charisma
1,yes it is n't a bad film it 's just not as good as the other movies but it 's not bad,yes it 's a bit of the spoof but it does n't matter that the film is a bit too long
1,i have to admit i am not a huge austen aficionado but this movie is a perfect example of how,i have never been a huge austen purist but i was very disappointed with the movie and the acting
1,after all these things happen on the screen,after all this time i was a bit skeptical
1,where was his character and what a waste it was,where did he come up with the idea that he is
1,it is n't a bad movie but i,it 's not even a bad movie
1,naturally i was surprised at the lack in the first movie,naturally it 's not a bad thing but it is not the
1,one of the most memorable scenes is that when he tells his boss that they are,one thing i noticed was how the movie had to do with a good story
1,one of the best movies ever made,one thing that i found interesting was that
1,and that is why i love the movie so much i,and i think that is the best part of all
1,anyone who thinks this is a bad film should n't be disappointed by a lot of the scenes,anyone with a shred of knowledge of the genre will probably be pleased to see that there is no
1,spoilers ahead this film does not make a lot,spoilers the story of the movie is based in a
1,this was one of those movies where the,this was the worst film ever made
1,just do not expect a lot from this movie and,just do n't expect to see the whole thing
1,two of the most beautiful actors are in the,two of the main actors were very good
1,the film 's premise is a very interesting one,the story line was good but the characters were not
1,again this movie is a complete waste,again i think that this film was a
1,after the first hour or two the characters were introduced as if,after a while i had a feeling of watching a movie
1,if i had a copy of the movie and i could see it in the theater i 'd probably have been a little,if it had been a good movie and the actors would have had a lot better things to do it could n't
1,there was no reason to watch a film that i,there is a lot to like in this one
1,yada rhames plays the role of a man in his late forties in a similar vein of his time in this film the story is a very,yada rhames is the only good actor of this movie and i do think that he is very underrated in the role as the bad cop
1,hattie mcdaniel is excellent as the mother and the rest,hattie mcdaniel was a very good actress and i think she
1,this film has been made in the uk,this movie was so good that i could not
1,i do n't want to ruin the plot for you but i do n't care for anyone who is n't so happy,i think the reason i did n't have to be the movie was because i had to be a fan of a movie
1,the acting is horrible the script is bad and there 's not much to it but it,the film has a lot of good moments but it 's not a bad thing either
1,410 i mean the film is not a good film it 's just a waste,410 the first two of the three films were very funny in their own way and
1,the story is about a young boy named sasha who works for an irish family and decides,the film is not a documentary about a man who is a man and his son
1,heston is also a fine actress,heston is one that could be seen
1,at the end when the movie was made in,at least that was one of his best
1,i do not recommend the original series,i do not think i have any qualms
1,when the first episode was canceled the first time was a big mistake,when the first one is about the first two thirds of the film it
1,his acting was good the plot was pretty decent and it had some great twists,his character is so believable that it 's impossible to believe he is the only actor
1,boogie is a great movie for everyone who wants to see a good film,boogie nights was a very low budget film that was n't very well done
1,a good movie with a very interesting plot line but,a very good movie with great acting by everyone
1,it 's the kind of movie you should watch,it 's not the worst of any film
1,look at the cast and crew of the show,look at it objectively and you 'll be pleasantly surprised
1,we 're supposed as a bit to be,we have a lot better to do
1,caught this in an afternoon with a group and we were laughing at it,caught up in the middle of nowhere and the film 's final destination is a
1,it 's not a great film but it is definitely worth watching,it is n't a bad movie but i have a lot of fun
1,the story is about the adventures of a woman in her family who is,the acting is good the script and the script all the way through
1,so if it 's not for the fact i think it 's a great movie to watch,so the plot of course has been done by a man who has n't been a big fan
1,i was so disappointed that the story was n't so bad it would,i think it would be better if i were n't so bored
1,it 's a very good movie,it 's not a movie that you
1,today the movie does n't have the same plot and does not have,today the movie does not work as the first of the series
1,but the film is a very entertaining movie with some very funny moments but it 's a lot of fun,but i have n't seen it since i 've been a fan since it 's made and the story is very
1,soderbergh 's film also features a very attractive and attractive cast,soderbergh is also a master director and a very good film maker
1,donald pleasance is great as always and the supporting characters,donald pleasance was a bit too long for me
1,rage and death is a film about an unhappy woman who has to deal and cope with her,rage of the killer is not only a film for the kids but for all those interested in seeing
1,it 's not a great movie but,it is n't a good film
1,they have a lot better to do than that,they 're the best in their respective worlds of the
1,as for this film it was a little slow but it was n't too bad it was just so boring,as i watched the whole movie the acting is terrible the script is awful and the acting is bad
1,i have to say that i have seen this movie many times in,i do n't understand why the movie has so few positive ratings
1,watching the movie is like a good idea for the most important reason,watching the movie is a waste of time to waste your money
1,she is the most annoying woman of the bunch and she 's just not the same,she is the only reason why the movie does n't have a single redeeming quality
1,i have to say i have n't read the novel,i was n't expecting much from this movie and was n't
1,a good movie for those interested in the genre of horror,a good film for those interested with action and action
1,not to mention the lack of imagination or intelligence,not only did i have to watch a film that
1,i think it is an interesting movie,i think that the director was the one
1,two years later i have seen this film,two of us have a lot to learn from
1,currently i am not going to go see it again because it is so bad,currently i was looking forward for it to get a bit of a recommendation
1,this is the first film to be released by a very high budget,this movie does not have the best of its kind to the genre but
1,neither the movie is a masterpiece of the original but the fact that it is a very good film and it is not,neither the characters in the story the acting the actors the actors the script the actors the script or even it all
1,the acting is good the script is great and it 's not even the story,the film has no real story line it 's just boring and the characters seem like
1,is it that a film like this can be made,is it a bad thing or is the director 's intent
1,having seen the movie i thought it was going to be,having seen the movie i was impressed by this one
1,i do n't think i 've been a big fan of the genre since this was made in,i do think that the movie is not a total disaster but it is a good one
1,watching a movie like this is a good idea,watching the show i felt that the show was a
1,i was expecting a great movie but it is not,i do n't know if it was the script and acting
1,otherwise the film is very good and the story line was very interesting,otherwise it is a great show that will keep your interest for the rest
1,but it was n't that bad,but the story of the film is
1,this was a great story and a good movie,this movie was a great idea to put it in
1,i have n't seen the original but i have to say that i have seen,i have never seen a movie so padded with a great deal of time
1,the acting and directing were horrible and it is hard to tell if the,the acting is good and i think this was a very good film
1,i was expecting a lot more,i think that it is not a
1,this was the only film in the series where,this movie was a waste for a razzie
1,i was so disappointed that the film was so poorly written,i think this is one of the better movies in the world
1,i have to admit that the film is very good,i do think that the movie is very good and very
1,mike myers is a very good director but i,mike 's father is a real estate guy
1,overall it 's not very funny but it 's a fun film to sit through and it 's a fun time,overall the movie was pretty good though the acting is pretty weak the story and acting is poor and the script was
1,and the ending is a little abrupt,and it was n't that bad but it
1,the movie is not a complete waste of film,the film has no real connection between the two leads
1,count is the most beautiful film of the decade the,count is a great movie for the whole time
1,you have a great cast and a very nice movie,you know that the film was made for the sole purpose
1,you can get a good idea,you have a lot of fun watching
1,entertaining and interesting and the best one in this,entertaining film that has a lot going on
1,yeti is a very interesting character study of human nature and is also a very interesting character study of a very human human being who is also a human human,yeti 's story was so bad that i was left wondering why the writers decided not to make this movie in their own way and then let it go
1,the film 's premise was a little farfetched and the characters seemed like a bunch from some of the characters in a series but,the story is about a young man trying and his family in the same neighborhood as the father who lives on the farm
1,they have a very small role in the movie that is n't a big part for the whole thing,they are all very good in this film but they just ca all be counted by the actors
1,however the film is not about the characters or,however i think the movie is very good
1,that 's why i gave it an 8 out 10 because i,that was one thing that i did n't get to see
1,for a long time he 's a very talented actor who is a real,for those who are n't interested on this film i recommend the film
1,the movie is not a comedy but a satire on the,the film was a bit too long and too slow
1,three stars for this film is that the actors are not very well known,three men are sent to prison and the two meet up on the streets of
1,throughout his career he 's a bit more than the sum,throughout the movie the story becomes a bit too predictable to be
1,like i was n't expecting the usual hollywood style of this type,like the other reviewers who commented on this movie that is not a
1,and the movie has a lot of fun,and the film has no real connection between them
1,the film has a lot of action and the plot was,the film has some of my favorite characters of them
1,i was n't expecting much from this one but i did n't,i think the director was making the movie a bit better
1,it is a shame because it 's not a good idea to show,it 's a pity that it 's not even worth the money
1,i have n't been in a coma for a long night,i think it 's one of those movies where i could n't
1,i think this was a great film to see,i think it is a very good movie
1,and i think it 's a very good idea to make it,and the film has a lot of good points to it
1,its not a good movie but the acting and the direction,its a shame that the movie did n't get better
1,the acting is horrible the story line is awful and there was,the story of the movie is based on a true life
1,it 's a shame that this film is n't even available on dvd and has a lot of fun,it 's the only thing you can do with your life and you 'll be glad i did
1,at the same time it 's not even funny it 's not funny,at least the original version of the original was a good idea to begin
1,as a matter i would not have to give this film an eight,as a result the film does have a few moments of suspense and the
1,there was a lot of nudity in the film which was the reason i gave the show the,there is no plot to speak and the movie is just a little bit of the same
1,as for this movie it is a little slow,as for this film it 's a bit of a
1,i do n't think that this movie is a waste,i think the director should be commended for this
1,this was a very good movie,this is a very good movie and
1,but i have no problem with the story and i did like,but this is a great film for those of the ages
1,in fact it is not a good film but it does not,in a way this is the best movie of the year and it
1,i was surprised by this one as i was,i have never seen such an awful performance
1,this is a film about a group of people that have been,this was one movie that i would have liked to know
1,cant deny how the movie is going for a sequel,cant deny how the movie 's title is so misleading that
1,the acting is pretty bad and i do not recommend,the movie is very well written directed and acted
1,miss marple 's performance as the young woman was,miss dove is the most annoying character ever
1,did they have any luck or to do the right thing,did n't they know what to make of the movie
1,one of the most interesting aspects in the movie was,one of his best and most of the best
1,the film has no redeeming qualities,the movie has the best of all
1,there are so much of these things in the film and the acting is so bad,there was no need that the movie would be released on the cheap and it 's not
1,i have seen a lot of movies but this is a,i was surprised at how much i loved the movie
1,i think the movie 's best performance is the scene,i think that 's what this movie was about
1,so if you are a diehard fan you will enjoy this film and you wo like,so the plot of the story revolves around the characters and the relationships that occur
1,possibly a bit more of the comedy that,possibly a good idea of the film
1,come on people who are n't so bad,come on the other day you 'll have to
1,unfortunately it 's a little slow,unfortunately it does n't make any sense
1,very few movies have made sense to,very good movie with great actors
1,they are not funny and the movie is not funny,they are not the only ones who seem to have a
1,the movie is not a complete failure and is just not worth watching,the film is a bit too long and it 's not even a movie
1,the film is not a complete waste of film,the story is very interesting and i think this is
1,the movie is a complete bore and the acting is terrible,the acting was terrible the story is bad the special fx were
1,any movie that has been done is made up of one of those rare times,any other movie that has been made with such an incredible premise is that of a
1,every time he 's on the phone the next day he 's going through it and he 's just a jerk trying to figure out who,every character is either a clich or a stereotype of any kind and a real jerk who is n't even remotely interested in the story
1,an excellent movie that should be watched by all people,an interesting story of a young boy named krishna
1,you know what you 're getting from your life,you can tell that the actors are all trying to
1,dan aykroyd is the only one in the,dan aykroyd was great in this role
1,would n't you think that the movie is a bit of an insult,would n't it work if they were making a film about them
1,what is with this one and that,what i found interesting was that it had
1,the story was so predictable that you would n't even care if the,the movie has some great actors and the actors are all good
1,but the film does not have the same impact on,but this one was a waste on a movie
1,it 's a shame because the movie was so bad that it,it was a waste of my time but it was n't
1,the movie starts off ok but the story is n't that good,the acting and directing were terrible the plot is stupid but i was
1,this film is a must for fans of the original and the original,this was the first film to have a lot more money than the usual
1,and the movie does not make any sense,and the ending is so bad that it 's
1,the film has a great cast,the acting was n't great but it
1,che is an expert who is a master and his wife has to have the courage of a man who 's been married to him,che is a master of the craft and the movie is not only the best of the three films but the film is a masterpiece of
1,his performance as the lead character was,his character is a bit underdeveloped
1,the acting is good and the script by,the film 's plot is very simple
1,the movie was shot in the seventies,the acting is good and i liked the
1,do not waste your time with it,do n't get it 's just a good
1,there are some very good scenes,there 's a lot to like here
1,captain america is a very funny movie about,captain sam is a very good character
1,i was surprised that i had wasted a,i have never been a movie aficionado
1,after a couple hours of the film 's initial minutes i could 've done without the experience that was the main character 's fault of this film and,after all it 's a movie that is so bad it 's funny it is n't funny and not that great at all it just is bad
1,the acting and directing are horrible,the acting and directing are all very
1,gyllenhaal is the only reason i have seen him since he was in it,gyllenhaal is a fine actor and he is a great choice for the role and
1,then the movie goes down hill and it is the same thing over,then the movie starts to get weirder and weirder with the introduction
1,i have never seen a worse movie than the one,i was expecting a lot of the movie to get a
1,as for it i do have to say the acting is bad the script was terrible the direction is horrible,as for this film it is n't a bad movie but it has some good acting and a decent plot line
1,richard widmark plays a young man who is sent into the world of crime in a very difficult,richard pryor is one that is very good as always as a person who is a loner
1,in the meantime it is the best of its genre and the best of which i can say it is very good,in the movie he was a good guy but i do n't think it was the fault he was trying and it was
1,vlad was an excellent actor and i,vlad is a very good film
1,the movie is a bit long and the ending is very anticlimatic but it is a great movie,the film 's premise of a man trying to find the woman in the world of the dead is
1,during the first half of this series i was hooked and i was hooked,during a brief interview of the young woman he 's forced by a group and
1,i have seen it three and three years ago on tv and it 's,i think this is a very good movie and it was very good
1,i have to say that i have n't read the books and the book has changed the movie as a good one but i do not know how to explain the movie 's shortcomings,i have n't seen this movie in years and i have to admit it is one of the worst i ever saw and i do not think the actors who played this movie are very
1,that said this movie is a total bore,that 's why it 's so good and the
1,but i do n't think the movie was meant as much,but it is not as good as some of the best movies
1,moog 's character is not a good one as he is in the book,moog is a very talented director but he has n't done a good job
1,this is a very good show and i think it,this movie was a waste of time to make
1,this movie is a great example,this is not the best movie i
1,hitchcock is a master in the film industry,hitchcock is a genius and a master of the
1,from the first few scenes of a movie i was expecting a bit more than that but it was,from a very beginning to a very end i was n't really expecting anything much from the movie
1,henry winkler is a great actor and i have to say this is one that i can easily recommend to anybody who enjoys the movies,henry is a very good movie and is one of my all times favorites and i have to admit that i have seen it twice
1,i was n't really expecting a lot,i have never seen a film so padded
1,ellen barkin plays the role she 's played by the beautiful woman who is a woman and a very sexy woman,ellen barkin plays a woman who is a bit of fun and she 's a great actress and she is a great
1,he is the only one in the film where he 's given an opportunity,he was a good guy but not a good movie and i was disappointed that
1,the film is a complete bore to watch,the acting and script are so poor it hurts
1,the movie was made in the early 80,the film has a very good cast
1,anthony quinn is a good actor and i think the director should,anthony hopkins was a great actor and the acting was good
1,hitchcock is the director who also wrote the story and he is a master of filmmaking,hitchcock was also a master director and the director and cinematographer of the film is a genius
1,carmen and her husband have been married and have a relationship,carmen has a very difficult time getting a job in the movie
1,i think this film is the worst i 've ever heard,i was expecting something better from this film because it was so
1,by far the most memorable thing in the movie was,by far one that i 've seen in years
1,i have seen the first three episodes,i have n't seen it yet
1,each character was a complete wuss,each time the film is over the
1,hey i do n't think that this film,hey the film is a little slow
1,they are all in the movie,they 're all a bit more interesting
1,movies like 'the adventures of dr and the sundance strangler are a lot more,movies like this are n't even funny and not funny in the slightest
1,first of all this is a very bad movie,first of all it 's the story of a woman
1,i think the director was making the mistake that he was making an attempt to make something different,i think this movie has been done so much in the us that it is a very poor film
1,the movie was a little slow but it did n't work,the story of the film revolves around the characters in the first
1,the story of the movie is a bit too long but it 's not the same,the film is a little slow but i found the film to be rather dull and the
1,it 's a shame because i do think the movie,it is not that the film is so good
1,i do not recommend the book as i would suggest this movie,i think the director should 've been proud of the film
1,even the actors who played this were a total waste of time and i would n't have been better served as such an obvious movie as i did,even when they were in a movie i thought it was a great movie and the movie is a great example of what is a great film
1,like a lot more people in my family i have seen a lot of the other movies and the movie is a lot like,like the other reviewers here i have seen it and i'm still wondering why they did n't get the name to this movie
1,that is the only thing i can say that,that is the best thing i can say
1,also i do n't think it 's that bad but it does n't really,also the movie does n't make any sense and is a complete mess
1,this movie was a waste of money,this movie was a waste on a movie
1,it 's a very funny movie,it was n't the best of it
1,sophie is the best character in the film as she 's the main character and the movie does n't make much of a difference,sophie 's character was so annoying it could be considered a total waste of my time but i was surprised that the movie was not
1,this film is a must for fans who can handle their films,this is one that you can watch with a group and a half
1,sometimes you have the right idea and the movie is a bit over the top in parts,sometimes you can get a little bit more attention into a movie that is more realistic than you
1,as for the story well i think it 's not a good idea to have,as i mentioned above this movie is a waste on a lot of time
1,the acting was horrible the directing is awful the,the film was a bit long and boring
1,actually the movie is n't bad,actually it was a little too long
1,the film was shot in a small city,the acting is horrible and the story itself is
1,i was so excited to have wasted my money and my time to watch this movie,i think it 's the best of all of the inuyasha films and it 's one that
1,although the film is a bit slow it has some very good moments,although the story of a young man in a wheelchair and a young girl
1,furthermore it was the worst film i had seen in a very,furthermore the movie is not so bad that it is funny
1,the movie is a very interesting one,the story is about a group who have
1,throughout it all is very good and very funny,throughout his life the two of the characters are killed
1,i was so excited when i saw that this film was made for television,i have n't seen this since i saw a movie called this film
1,so what do you expect when you have the chance to see,so if the movie is n't so good it is n't
1,however this was a good idea for a horror flick,however the film 's main weakness of the film was the
1,again i have a feeling of being a little bit too harsh for the movie to,again i think that 's the only part of that film i could n't bear
1,there 's a scene where he is in the car crash in a small warehouse in his apartment where,there 's no real reason that the director would have given it a chance to redeem his life
1,i have seen the original movie and the film is very faithful to what the movie was about but it,i do think that it is one of those rare movies that you have to watch with the lights
1,the movie was a waste for the movie,the acting was good and there were some nice
1,not only is he the first of the three films of the trilogy but he is a very talented actor,not to forget that the actors are all so stupid and so unfunny and so bad that they 're funny and
1,or the fact it has a very long running gag of the same name,or maybe it would n't have been a great movie but it is n't a
1,it 's the same kind as the first movie,it is not a movie that is n't even worth
1,what 's worse is this was n't really that good,what is the point in that the characters are so real
1,i was so impressed with this movie,i was so impressed that i had to
1,for the rest of the film kronk and boone try too,for me i would like to see the movie again
1,i think the movie was very good and i would recommend this film to all,i do n't know if this was the case but i was n't expecting anything else
1,one thing is that i was expecting to see a lot more,one can only hope that they 'll find the film on dvd soon
1,this movie is not for everyone but it 's worth your,this movie is a great example for a good movie
1,does anyone else notice that this was made for tv,does n't it make sense to make a sequel
1,malkovich is a good actor but he is very good as the villain and his character is a bit too stiff,malkovich is the perfect choice to play the part he is given the thankless task of playing a role in this film
1,maybe he was a little too young for the part,maybe it 's a bit too harsh but it 's a
1,despite the fact it has been done in a very low budget the movie still works,despite being a bit of a fan 's film it was n't a good movie
1,the story line has been done by,the film is very well made
1,he 's just a bad guy and a bad guy who is n't a good guy,he is a great actor and a good one at that but he is a bit of
1,the movie is not a comedy,the story was so predictable i had
1,his character was the same person he had,his performance is a joy to behold
1,why is the movie called so unavailable to anyone,why do n't i have to watch this movie
1,first off i was a huge fan,first of all this film is not a
1,in the end the story is not a good one,in the end it 's not a movie that will leave
1,if you want to watch the movie with a few friends and,if you have n't seen this movie you should definitely watch
1,okay the plot is pretty thin the acting is terrible the script awful but the acting and direction is so good,okay so i was n't impressed with the film as a kid but i found it very entertaining to watch
1,fulci is one to avoid this mess,fulci was a very good director
1,it is a very good story and a good movie for fans of a great adventure,it 's a shame that this movie did n't come back to it 's roots
1,if you 're a huge fan of horror and horror films i 'd recommend this,if you have n't seen the original then i think it 's a great movie
1,in fact this is not a movie for everyone,in this movie the acting is terrible but the script
1,i do agree to describe that the movie is not the most accurate movie i,i have seen it several times and it has always had a good time
1,i do think the movie has a,i was n't expecting anything much
1,how can a movie be made,how could this movie be made in
1,but the film is a complete waste and,but this is a very poor movie
1,however this movie is a complete waste,however the film is a very good one
1,at least the original is n't as bad as,at least the original was a bit better
1,he is the only one who has a,he 's not even funny at times
1,one thing that makes the movie is the fact the movie was made,one day the woman who is in a mental health accident and a man
1,what i got was a film about,what is this film trying at
1,but it is n't the worst movie that,but the movie has no redeeming qualities
1,this is the best part of the movie,this is a film for the entire family
1,the story is about a young girl trying to save the life and her father,the movie has some good actors in their supporting cast including the likes that the director
1,hallmark was a great actor and i hope that he,hallmark has a good sense to do the same
1,the story is very interesting the characters are believable and the characters all are very likable and the characters are very likable,the movie was shot with a handheld camcorder that looked like a home video camera that would make it look cheap
1,yeah i 've seen this film and i'm still a fan of hers and it is one,yeah i do concede the fact is the fact is that you 're not a fan
1,the film is a little slow but the acting is superb,the story is about an ordinary young girl who has a crush
1,i do n't know what this movie is about,i think this is a very good movie
1,the story is about a young man trying to find a way to get his family and help him,the story is a little weak but it 's a great film and a good film to look at
1,this is the kind of movie you 'd watch in an old,this is a great movie and i recommend this for anyone
1,before the devil 's identity comes on his face he becomes a,before the movie is over you can see the whole movie
1,i was n't sure whether i was watching the movie or just a bunch and it was a bit too long,i do n't understand why this is so bad it has to be the funniest movie i have seen in years
1,the film was very well shot in the beginning of it all,the movie starts as an excuse that the director of this film would
1,worthless acting and bad acting make this a very enjoyable viewing experience,worthless acting horrible script and terrible acting all the while i was watching
1,barbra streisand 's portrayal as a woman is not a bad thing,barbra streisand 's character in her early years is the best thing about
1,as a result it 's not even a movie,as the movie progresses we see him as a hero
1,despite the fact that it has been released in video stores and has been shown on the big screen i have to agree with the critics,despite this the movie is a very entertaining movie and one of the most enjoyable and entertaining movies i 've seen in a long time
1,sadly this movie is n't worth the price i paid for,sadly it is n't a bad thing as a movie
1,i'm a big fan and the movie is so bad,i'm not a prude who likes movies but i was n't
1,not that i did see this one,not only is this movie not funny but
1,it has to be seen to believe,it was a waste of time
1,i do not want my kids,i was so disappointed by the story
1,you have to wonder if they had to do something that they did n't like and the movie,you know that it is a good idea to have a film about the hardships of life
1,the film is a very interesting one,the film is not about the war or
1,when the movie starts it 's just too bad,when i watched this film on the shelf it seemed
1,my advice do yourself a favour skip this movie,my only complaint is that the story is a little
1,performances of all the stars are very convincing and it is clear how the director and writer of this film got,performances by the actors who are so bad that they are so terrible they 're so bad it hurts me
1,from the opening scene to a few of his most famous actors the movie is a masterpiece and it 's not a good,from the opening shot shot to shot the film was made for the screen and the camera angles were n't as good
1,john wayne was great in his first,john huston is a great filmmaker
1,he 's the only person to ever be the leader who,he is the only character that is n't even likable
1,of this film is the first movie i had seen,of this type of film is the lack in which the
1,the film has a very interesting and very,the movie is a very good film
1,producer michael curtiz is the only one who has ever been able to get a job,producer robert benton is a very talented director and writer who is a talented actor
1,its not that i do not like this film but it is a must for anyone interested in the history of cinema,its a great film for all the people that like the book and it 's a great film for anyone that wants something
1,it was a waste of time to make a movie,it 's a very simple story and a very interesting one
1,the film is a bit of the same as in other movies but that is a good thing because the movie is,the movie is very well done but the acting is so poor and the plot is just so ridiculous and pointless
1,you 'll see the same thing as the one,you know what 's really going to be the worst
1,at least it has the potential of being a decent film and a,at least it was a bit more than a bit more fun
1,warning the film is about a woman named lena and his daughter,warning the movie is n't bad it is n't bad either
1,upon the arrival of the two men who were,upon arriving at the end the story unfolds
1,so if i were n't a teenager then,so the movie is a complete bore
1,this is a movie that i would recommend watching,this movie was a waste of my time
1,if i were to watch it i would have done better,if you want a good movie to see this one
1,the acting is horrible the directing was poor the direction was awful and so was a lot more,the film is a little slow and it is n't as good or bad as the original
1,the movie was made by a group called a movie called motorama and the other,the film is a complete mess with an allstar director and a very bad script but
1,peter boyle 's character has a different personality than he did in the first film so the movie is just a little too long,peter falk is a good actor but he 's just a bit too bad for the part he is in the first movie he is
1,and it 's all about the acting and,and the ending was a bit abrupt
1,there is no plot in the film and,there was no reason to watch it
1,also i think that it is not a,also the movie is a complete mess
1,the movie starts out with some interesting dialogue that is n't really funny,the story of a young man who has lost his wife and son in
1,everyone in it is just plain awful,everyone in the theater is just plain dumb
1,secondly it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen but it 's still worth watching,secondly this movie does n't have a single moment of suspense or suspense to be found in
1,yes it is not a movie about an ordinary man but a woman who,yes it has been said that the movie is a bit too slow
1,this film is a great piece,this movie is a complete failure
1,he has a very good role as an aging man,he 's a little bit of a jerk and is a
1,the movie is a complete waste of my money and time to waste your money on something that has been made in,the story of this story was very interesting to me and i loved it and it is the best of all
1,if you want the movie to get the viewer to watch this one,if the director was n't so stupid i would n't have seen this movie
1,i have n't seen a movie like this,i was expecting a great movie to get out
1,there 's a lot of good action and action sequences and the,there is a scene with a young woman and her mother
1,if i had to choose between the two i would have had a better choice,if you 're a fan 's the first one you 'll like it too much
1,they are both a very nice and interesting person,they are the most beautiful people around but it just
1,overall this is an enjoyable film to see and a good one to,overall it 's a very bad film and the acting is terrible
1,in fact the movie has been a staple in my book collection and i think the director should have been proud of himself,in the meantime it was a little too much for me and my friend and his friend were laughing and crying at the screen
1,as a fan of the original i was impressed to find that the film,as a result of the movie 's title the movie was pretty good
1,perhaps the best of the film was the fact that the story was a lot more interesting than this movie but the story is a bit too predictable,perhaps this is why i did not like it and it was a good film to watch but the first thing i did was that was a good idea
1,the film has some very nice moments but is n't,the movie has a very interesting plot line that keeps me
1,part of this is why the director and writer chose to make,part 1 of the film was a bit of the end
1,the film 's premise is that it 's a good thing,the movie has a few good moments in this but it has
1,it was a good movie to see,it has a lot to say
1,we have seen the first movie and i can see why the film is so bad that it 's not even,we get to know the main character 's character and he 's the only person who is n't the hero
1,the story is about a young man who is a struggling man,the acting was good and i was impressed with the acting
1,does it have a lot of potential,does he have a good time
1,on the plus side the acting in general is very good,on the other hand i think this movie was a waste of
1,kathy bates plays the role in a small part as the,kathy bates is the only one that has a role
1,so the movie starts with a bunch and then the main plot of a,so the movie is a little too long to keep a few minutes
1,also the ending in the end was so bad that it,also the movie is a bit too much for me
1,never before has i ever seen such crap,never mind that this movie is about a man
1,star wars is a film that will not be forgotten,star wars is the most overrated movie that i ever saw
1,cut is a movie about a man who wants a good life but does n't want him to go to a school and the family is forced,cut to a few minutes later when a man who 's been in the car is asked by a doctor to investigate the mystery of the crime he
1,now that i have a chance to get my hands on this movie i will be glad i did,now this is not a good thing but it 's not a good movie it 's good to have a
1,when i saw the film i thought it would be interesting,when i first heard the movie was going to be on the
1,johnny knoxville was a great character,johnny depp is the best of this
1,to be a little too much for a good film to get the audience out,to be honest the story of a young man is a good one and it 's
1,courtney and the other two were also great in this movie as well as a lot of people,courtney 's father who was also in love with her husband and his wife and son and his mother
1,and that 's the only reason why,and the ending is very abrupt
1,get a few laughs and you 'll get a,get a little too close to the original
1,a good film with great acting by all involved,a very funny movie with some great actors but they
1,in the end i felt that it would have been better to make a sequel to,in the end the movie has no meaning whatsoever but it 's not as good
1,also the scene where he has a car accident in which the driver is shot and shot in the head and his car,also it was a very interesting film and a nice addition for the genre and a great film for those of you
1,hopefully they could be able to make it more entertaining,hopefully i was a bit harsh but i do applaud the
1,a good example of what happens in the movie,a few of the scenes were shot with some very
1,originally a movie of this kind,originally the film is about as good
1,les amants du da de la la la bestia is a movie for,les palma 's the first featurelength movie is the first of three
1,this is a film for the whole world of film history it 's not a bad,this movie does a lot better than the others and it is n't that bad
1,i have n't been able to watch this movie since the first time and was,i have never read the original novel but this movie had a great story
1,as a result the film is a complete waste for me,as a result of this film i was surprised to find that
1,anyway it 's a movie about the life,anyway it was n't a great film
1,julie delpy is excellent and the film has the potential to make you want to,julie walters is excellent as the woman who gets to be the best actress
1,in fact the movie is so boring that it,in the meantime he is a little stiff
1,the story line is very good and,the film has an interesting premise
1,the acting was horrible the directing was awful,the film 's main drawback was that it did
1,how many times can you make a film that is so awful and boring that you ca only have a few good scenes and some good ones,how can you have to have the courage to watch this movie and do n't even think that i am going to get to a conclusion
1,even if it were n't a comedy it was a very enjoyable show,even though the film is set up in a small town where it does
1,before i start i 'd like to say this is a great show,before i saw a movie that i saw was a complete disappointment
1,and that is why i gave this one a 10 out 10 because i am still trying to get to see it again,and the ending of it is a little anticlimatic and it 's not even a movie to watch the whole thing and i will
1,dumbed down by this movie is the fact that it is a film about two men who are married and have a relationship and,dumbed to the surface of the ocean and a couple hundred thousand miles away from the same old building and the same one
1,i was surprised by that the film is so much better than it,i think this is one of the most beautiful movies ever made
1,it is not a film for the faint of heart,it has a very nice atmosphere and a good plot and
1,after all this is a good show,after a couple of hours of torture and
1,i'm not a big big football fan but this movie,i'm glad i did n't pay to watch it
1,the film is very well made and it 's a shame that this was n't the first,the movie starts as a group of friends who have a party in a remote cabin
1,it 's just a shame that the film is n't available to video,it 's a very funny movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes
1,as a fan of the genre of films i have to say it 's one thing to be a bit of a,as a movie this one is a total waste of time and money i ca n't even begin watching it again
1,at least that was the best of the series,at least it was made in a small budget
1,and the movie does not make a good film and,and that 's what it was all the rage
1,the film has no atmosphere and is very very slow paced,the story is very simple but not the same as it 's
1,very good movie but not for everyone who wants something different,very little to say about the film except that it has a
1,kathleen barkin plays the role of her character,kathleen turner is a woman who is a bit
1,the acting and directing were horrible,the film is a very funny film
1,when you 're not a teenager and you 're not a bad guy you 're going for the best,when he 's not a little bit of a wimp it is a bit of the same with the rest
1,how could it have been done,how many times have you seen the
1,the film was a waste of time and a waste of time money,the film 's main drawback is that the story is n't a very original
1,not only was this movie a complete failure but it was a fun,not that it is n't a bad film but a good one
1,granted it 's not a movie that you can watch,granted it 's an interesting idea but it 's not
1,just like the rest you 'll be,just do not watch this movie
1,harpo was the only one who had a chance for his role,harpo is a very good actor who is not only a bad actor
1,essentially the movie is a mess,essentially this movie has a lot going
1,i'm not saying that i am a fan,i'm not saying the acting was bad
1,there was a scene where he is talking about how a man he is in his own right,there was a bit of the usual nudity in the film but it did n't make sense
1,disney 's movies were not as good as the ones but it was n't,disney 's movies were so popular that i could have done without them
1,usually i think this is the worst movie ever to date the first time i have seen this,usually i have to say that i have to say this is my favorite of all time
1,probably the best thing about the movie was the acting and it was a very nice movie,probably one thing to be a part about this movie is that it is not a movie that
1,to be fair the film is n't a complete failure it 's a very boring and boring movie,to me it 's the worst film i can think i 've ever come across and i do not
1,cgi was the only redeeming feature in,cgi is a very bad thing
1,and i have n't read the book so,and the film is n't that great
1,i was so disappointed that i had to see,i was surprised to find myself being assaulted
1,it 's a shame to see such a talented performer as a director who 's a good actor,it 's a great story about a man who is a man with an extraordinary heart and an ability
1,a lot more than a few people have commented that the story is so bad that the acting is terrible but the story is,a very interesting story with some interesting elements and the ending is a bit abrupt and is n't really a surprise to me
1,the film is about the same people as they were in,the movie is about two men who have sex together
1,katherine tautou is excellent as a woman and she is a very talented actress and is very believable here,katherine heigl plays an ambitious and uninhibited woman in a small town who is married with the other two women
1,when i saw a trailer for it in my local video store and,when i saw the film i was very disappointed with the acting
1,if you want a film that 's so bad that it 's actually funny to,if i was n't a little bit worried it was a little more enjoyable
1,my favorite part in the film is when the woman 's boyfriend is talking about her father,my friend and my friends saw this movie at a sneak preview and i was so bored that
1,and it was n't the best movie i 've seen,and that was the best way to watch this
1,a good movie for those with an open mind,a lot of the humor and the jokes
1,but this is a great movie for the time,but it 's not a good movie and i would
1,an old man is killed by the evil dead and is stabbed by a bat in the back seat,an old man is sent to prison and the two meet up in a very small part and end the
1,tom and jerry are not in this one and they,tom cruise plays an excellent role in this one
1,stockwell is one that i think was his best,stockwell is the best of all the best
1,with a cast in the film i could not help to give,with the exception of this film the acting was very bad
1,i think the film is a bit too long and it is a little too long,i do n't know what the point in which the story was based on a real person
1,granted there is a lot of violence but there was nothing else that,granted there is a good deal of humor but it is not
1,no wonder the movie was made in a,no one could possibly be a fan
1,sure the film does n't make any sense but the story and acting is very strong and the acting is good,sure the movie is a little slow and it has a few moments but it has a few moments of suspense and
1,i do not want a movie to,i have seen it many times
1,additional to a point where the film was filmed in a time warp was not a very good film at least in my book it was n't even a b,additional to the point where the movie ends and the characters are so bad they do not even seem to care about the characters or the characters or care
1,if you want to know the story of the movie you should see this movie,if it had been made in the early 80 's this would be the first film
1,i do not think that the film is a complete,i do n't think that it is that bad
1,the story is a simple one but the story of,the acting is good and i liked this film
1,i have seen it many times but i have to agree that it 's not a bad film,i think the director was making an artsy documentary about the evils of the holocaust but this film does
1,dennis is a good actor but i,dennis hopper is a great actor
1,and the ending of it was so predictable that,and the movie has some very interesting characters
1,when you see a film that 's so good it makes it a little easier to sit through,when i saw it on tv i was surprised at how much it was a great movie
1,if i could give it the chance to get a 0 it deserves a 1 out there,if you want to make a film about a bunch in a movie that is so bad you
1,if you are a diehard horror buff and want to see a good movie about the dangers that the director has to go through,if i could find the dvd version and i could have had a good time i would have been able into the movie
1,it 's just so stupid it 's not funny,it was so stupid that i was n't even aware
1,durante is a very good actor and he does not play,durante is one of the most underrated actors in hollywood
1,after the movie 's over the top i could not stop laughing,after a few years i 've been watching the show for the past
1,the film is not a complete failure and it 's not as good or bad as the original it 's,the story is a bit confusing and the ending was so stupid that i could barely get it out
1,anyone else who has seen this movie will know what to expect,anyone who has read the books will notice this film as a very
1,how could this movie get made,how many times have we seen such
1,i have never read so many other reviews here but the story was so awful and so predictable that i was,i do agree with the comments on here that it is a good story and a good one at that
1,karin and her friends go out to get a new life together in an old neighborhood,karin is a great actress and she is great as the mother who has to deal
1,robert montgomery is also excellent as his wife,robert montgomery is a great actor and i have
1,not only does he have to be in the movie but,not to say that the film is n't that good
1,then again what do i know it 's not,then the film goes to a big climax where a
1,now i am not a fan,now this is a film of a
1,justin 's acting skills are very convincing and he is a,justin and behold do n't worry that they 're trying
1,and it 's not even the same,and it is a great movie
1,sadly it does n't work for me,sadly it 's not that good either the
1,the acting in this movie was very good,the movie was made for the romanians and the
1,it 's just so bad it 's funny to me,it is a shame because it is not a movie about
1,even when i was n't laughing i was laughing out loud when i first heard about,even the music is a bit of the same as the ones in this movie
1,basically the movie has a lot of action,basically the movie was a complete waste and i
1,him and the rest are pretty bad and i do not,him the best thing about this film is the acting
1,gene kelly 's character is so stupid that it makes me feel that he 's a,gene tierney is the best actress in the movie and i do n't know why
1,rhoda has been the only one who knows how,rhoda and his crew is a good movie
1,utilizing the original story and a story of a young boy in a small midwestern town in new jersey is the story 's greatest asset,utilizing this movie is an insult to anyone who has n't seen the movie yet it is the most enjoyable film of all times
1,just as the movie is set the pace and atmosphere of,just do yourself a big disservice and watch the trailer
1,the acting is good and there are some good supporting,the movie was a bit too long for me
1,this movie was made for a rainy day of time,this was one of my favorite shows and it was so
1,this movie was made for a generation that was n't even a good movie,this film was not for the masses but the fact that it is not a
1,that said it was a great film and a must for fans,that 's why i think the film was made by a bunch of
1,this film was a waste for the whole movie and i,this is one film that i will never forget about
1,it 's not the worst film i 've ever watched it,it 's a pity the rest is so much better
1,maybe the best of all was it was made in,maybe i was expecting a lot from the movie
1,there are some funny moments in this movie but the movie is not really,there are some funny bits of humor but the movie is just boring
1,then i saw it on cable tv when i was a teenager and it was n't even that good,then there 's a few good points in the movie that make it worth the price of a rental for
1,my only problem i have that it 's the worst of,my only complaint with this film however is its script
1,it is a movie with a very good story and some very funny,it 's a shame because it has been done so much better
1,in fact it 's a bit of an exercise in a movie that 's just too much to be enjoyable,in the end he is not as good as he is but it 's a good idea to make an appearance
1,hope that they will make a better movie than this movie is because it 's a,hope lange 's character was a bit too young and too much for a role
1,there are some great performances from all the supporting players,there was no need for the director 's vision to convey
1,i was surprised that it would get so much more positive reviews from imdb,i was surprised to find that the film is a bit too much
1,the movie has some nice twists and turns and some good actors and a good,the acting is horrible the script was awful and it is not even funny
1,this is the kind of story you,this is a very good film
1,she 's a great actress but her character is n't a very good character in this movie she does not have any personality,she has been a favorite actress in my entire life as an actress but she does n't have the charisma of an actor
1,with all the hype surrounding the movie it 's a pretty good movie,with a lot of good things going on here it is a little too
1,this film was so awful it was painful,this movie was a great idea and the film
1,i think this movie should be seen for all the good reasons and the most important of the story to the film,i think the film is not a total disaster but the story and acting are very solid and the actors in it are
1,it was so bad i was laughing at the screen and i was n't even,it 's the same story as it is in all of the other movies
1,if you want a movie with lots more action than you 'd expect from an action movie this is the one to watch,if i were a fan of the book i would n't be surprised to see that the film has a lot of problems with
1,but this one is just a bad one,but i think the film is a great deal
1,so the movie is n't really worth your time or anything,so the movie is a very good one and it 's not
1,in a way it is the best of it 's kind,in the first part of a movie the story takes on the
1,he 's a very funny actor and,he is a very talented character
1,diana rigg is a very good actress but she is n't as good as the first,diana scarwid plays the part in the movie and she is n't in the movie
1,the film 's plot is so predictable that it becomes impossible for the viewer,the acting is horrible the directing is bad and the plot just sucks
1,besides the acting is n't bad either,besides the fact of the matter i have
1,i have n't been able to find the soundtrack to enjoy this film,i do not recommend this to anybody who likes the original and the movie
1,the story line has a lot more twists than any other film in the series but it 's just not as good as some of its other columbo films such as a few,the story is simple and the characters in a story that should be told in a very interesting fashion and it is a very good movie to watch and enjoy the film and the
1,i think it was a waste on a movie but this one is not,i was so impressed that the movie was made for a few bucks to be
1,the film was a complete mess,the acting is very good and there
1,mr bean is the best of the lot,mr beetle is the perfect man for the whole
1,ill and i 'll give it 1 stars for it 's unintentional score,ill are n't the best of the bunch of movies that are n't bad
1,if you are a fan of horror movies you 'll love a lot of movies,if the film is supposed or not to be funny and funny i have to admit
1,you know that you 're watching this movie for a long time and then you realize the movie will be so good it makes,you 'll be surprised to see that this movie was released on the cheap and in the case of it 's own merits
1,hotel is a very funny movie and a very good movie to watch,hotel rwanda is a movie about the life in the west and it is
1,treasured but i was n't sure what to expect from the,treasured in a world that is n't a complete failure
1,of all things this film is not a total waste,of all the movies i 've seen i 've watched that
1,however the movie has a lot of action,however the story was not that bad
1,key characters are introduced to a very interesting ending which makes this film more of a psychological thriller than the movie,key points are not that the film does n't have the same plot and the actors were n't even good enough to
1,i was n't really sure what to expect,i was surprised by that it was so bad
1,then i was able into a movie with my friends who were n't,then again i do not want you to get to see this
1,if you are into this sort more than the sum of the parts of this film you 'll be left with a very good movie,if you are looking for a good movie to watch and enjoy this one i highly suggest you see this film it is not a bad
1,i have seen a number of movies that are made to be a little more entertaining,i was expecting a lot from this movie but it is still a good movie
1,i was so bored by that,i do not recommend this film to
1,i think that the film is a very interesting film,i was so bored that the film was so bad that
1,but it does n't matter if it 's a movie,but i do n't think that the film is worth watching
1,basically the plot of this story of a,basically the plot was a lot better
1,if you want to know the story and you want to see it you will love it but it does n't,if i was a little bit of fun to see then this movie was not for you i would n't recommend the
1,i was n't really expecting much of a movie but it was a good movie and i would like for a good laugh out loud funny,i was so excited to see a good film with this movie and i did n't like that it is a very bad remake but i really
1,well i guess the filmmakers do n't,well the film is n't bad
1,even though the film is a bit slow the plot,even the music score was a bit over used
1,jerry is a great actor and he does a good job in the movie,jerry is the one that is always alive and he is the only one in
1,at first the film is a bit of a,at least the film is a good example
1,this film does n't make any money,this was one of the best films that
1,and the ending is very abrupt,and it 's not a good movie
1,teams are not all bad guys but they are good,teams up with the two men and the woman and the
1,we have a very good movie that has a lot of great actors and a great story but the actors and,we are left with the feeling that the film is a real masterpiece but it 's a very good one
1,this is the first film i have had the misfortune,this is not a movie to make you laugh
1,intensely enough the film is n't as bad but its a,intensely entertaining is its cast of actors in this movie
1,the story of the movie and its characters are just as bad a movie as it is in the first place and it 's not the,the film has some good performances and the story is a bit too long for its own good but there are a few good moments
1,this movie does not have to rely solely on the,this is a film that should not be forgotten
1,if you are looking at your watch and have an open mind or you 're a fan of this film i suggest you do n't,if you have n't read the books or are looking for a movie that will make your heart hurt you will not be surprised to see
1,they 're all so good and so bad that,they 're all so good in this movie
1,maybe the film is a little too long,maybe it 's because i do n't think i
1,good acting by all the cast and actresses,good acting and a very interesting storyline
1,but the film is a bit too dark for words and the film 's only redeeming value to it is,but it does n't work out as a film of its own for a few minutes of a lifetime
1,some scenes were just plain stupid but the story is,some scenes of a man walking in a bar
1,next time i have seen a movie that is n't even bad i just want to say that i was n't,next the story of the young girl who is a very rich woman who is a woman and a woman
1,mostly a movie about a young woman who has to be a lesbian to be taken,mostly this is one that i 'd love to see if you have a chance
1,around a few minutes i had a headache and laughing,around this time the film has no real life or reason
1,the story is very weak and the story is just plain stupid to watch,the film is about the same people as the ones who are in fact a
1,flesh is a good example of the,flesh feast is a great movie
1,in fact the only reason why i gave this film 2 stars is because the actors are all good and that 's why i liked it so much and i was,in a movie that is not only a very good film it is a very moving film with an excellent soundtrack and a great soundtrack that is a perfect example
1,i think the reason for the film 's message is the fact of the story,i have to admit that i have never seen this film and it has been done
1,it is not a bad thing,it 's a shame that such an
1,i was so disappointed that i had to see this,i do not think that the movie is a masterpiece in
1,why is it so bad that they do n't even bother,why do we have to see a movie that is n't even
1,yet i do have a lot of fun in this movie but it is a bit of,yet i have seen this film and it is not as bad it is a movie
1,it has a lot of good acting and the story is pretty interesting too,it 's the same story with all the clichs that are being made to the
1,this was a very good film,this was a movie that i would
1,feet of an unknown director is a film that,feet off the screen for the first hour
1,it 's not even a movie,it 's a great movie that you
1,if you have not seen the film you should see it,if it was a drama and it was a little more interesting
1,i do not know why i have to say this film is a waste,i have n't seen this movie since but i have to admit the movie was
1,by the way the film is a very funny one that is a bit of fun and a lot better,by far the most memorable scene of the movie is when he is a man who 's a man with a
1,it has to be one that i would love to watch again,it has a good cast but the story is so weak that it
1,so i guess the director is not a good director but he 's not a good director,so i was surprised to find out this film is a remake of the original movie
1,however the movie is a little slow,however the plot is n't too bad
1,i have never seen a film like it,i do n't know if this is a comedy
1,the story was a lot better,the film has a very interesting and
1,kristin scott moore is a good actress and,kristin scott thomas is a great actor
1,the movie is not a bad film but is a good film,the film is very well done and is a must see for any
1,again it 's a great film and i think it 's worth watching the whole,again this is a great example of what a film could have been like
1,but the film has a good story to tell the tale of a young woman who has lost her son and,but it 's a very good movie and a good example of how to get the maximum of the genre
1,it 's the kind you have a good time watching it and you have a good movie,it 's not a bad movie but the acting was n't bad and there were some very bad
1,as for me i do n't know what to do,as for me i was impressed with the acting and the
1,but it is not that bad it,but it 's a great movie
1,however the movie is n't that great,however the movie is a bit slow at
1,i do agree that the film has a lot more going,i have never seen the movie but it is n't
1,you know it 's going down as you,you 'll see it as a whole
1,i think it 's one of the most beautiful movies in the last decade and it is a shame that it has been so,i think it would 've made a good movie if they made it a good movie but the actors were just too bad
1,christophe lloyd plays his part as well,christophe mcdonald is the only one who has
1,since it is a very bad film i have to admit that the story is not as strong,since the film is set up as one of the most important films of the past twenty months it
1,as a fan it is a must see for everyone,as for this movie there is no real reason to be
1,so what do you think of the movie,so i was n't disappointed by the fact it
1,i think the director should have done a better research of,i do n't know why this movie is so bad
1,not to mention that the plot is n't really a,not to say that this was a terrible film
1,there was a scene that was cut to the point and i felt like i was in the theater,there is no reason why it 's so good and it 's not a good thing to watch it is
1,this is a movie that you can watch and enjoy,this is the kind of movie i would watch again and
1,not only does it have the feel of an indie film and the actors have been a little over the top,not only is it not the best movie i have ever watched but i think the worst movie ever created
1,they 're just plain stupid people,they are not in a good mood
1,a lot more of a film,a few years back i was a
1,i think the film was shot on a very low budgets,i have to say that this is not a movie that is
1,my favorite part is when the girl gets pregnant,my favorite part of this movie is the way it
1,nothing is really explained about the story,nothing really happens in this film
1,each time i watched it it seemed that it was a very good film and i think it was the first movie that could have done a better,each time i see a movie that has a great deal i ca least recommend it to anybody and i hope they make it to the end
1,whomever was responsible to have a good time,whomever is responsible for a good film
1,film makers have a great opportunity of capturing the essence and the ability of a good director,film makers should be commended for the fact that the film is a very good film
1,directed and acted by the great john cassavetes,directed with great enthusiasm and great acting by all
1,part 2 is one thing that should have been left to the imagination of the,part of this is the fact that it is not just an action flick
1,the acting and the direction was very poor but the acting was horrible,the story of the kelly gang' is based upon one true love triangle between
1,it 's not even the worst movie ever made but it does n't make sense,it is not a movie for everyone who wants a film to watch but it is
1,heavens is one of them and it is n't,heavens is the best movie of all times it was
1,there was a scene in which she,there is nothing wrong with that
1,yet it was a little too late,yet another movie that i would like it
1,but i think it 's the best movie ever to date and,but the movie does n't have to be the same thing
1,in the end he is a very human character who is a bit over a top,in the end it does have some nice twists to it that make me laugh
1,in a nutshell this film is not a comedy it is n't,in a sense that this was the first of the series
1,i do n't want my time back,i was n't expecting anything else
1,roddy piper is a fine actor,roddy piper was a good choice to
1,talbert is the only one who can identify with,talbert is the best actor in the film
1,the movie was n't bad but i did not see the movie,the movie starts with a very good opening and then the film ends
1,it was a waste for a film,it is a very good movie and the
1,set during the first world war and a few years of the war it was a great movie,set in new york city and the two towers and the city and the inhabitants of new york city
1,it is the best movie i have ever read,it 's not even a bad thing that i can
1,barry levinson is the best actor ever in,barry shear 's direction was very impressive
1,that was the best thing about the film though,that 's what the movie was all over the place
1,i think that the director should have had his hands on the camera as he would have been a bit more interesting,i do n't want to spoil the plot for you but i do not want to ruin the plot for you
1,he 's a good director who has,he is a very good actor
1,the story line was good the characters were well done,the movie was a waste of time and i did like
1,a good example for a horror film and a very good,a very good movie that is not for all tastes
1,the acting in this one is excellent and it is very difficult to understand how the film is supposed to get a little preachy at times,the film is a very good film with a lot going it is a film that will make you think of a movie and a good one
1,ultimately i do n't care for the fact this movie is supposed for kids,ultimately it 's a very poor attempt by the filmmakers and the audience to think
1,the story is a little too complicated for its own little too much to,the acting is horrible and the story is just plain boring and boring
1,how did the guy know that,how can you go wrong when you
1,this is a great example for a film,this movie is a waste of time
1,the story is simple but the characters are,the film has some very interesting scenes
1,the film has some nice moments,the movie starts out with the main
1,it was a very good movie,it 's not a bad movie but
1,i do n't know if this was meant to be funny but it is n't,i do think that the movie 's plot line was very interesting and interesting
1,as for me i do n't think the director was aiming on making a movie about the evils that the,as for me i do n't think it was a good movie to watch and the acting in general
1,the movie has the best performance i 've seen since the days of the jackal,the movie starts out very slowly and ends with a bang in the middle
1,for the first time in the series the viewer,for me it was a very enjoyable movie
1,unlike many of those movies that i have seen in my entire life,unlike most other reviewers this movie is not the best movie of the year
1,before you know it i am a big movie fan and i have n't seen this movie yet but it is a great movie,before the movie is done i have to admit it i did n't have to pay for it but it was a waste of my
1,his character is the most interesting character i,his character is not the only one
1,immortals have a very small part,immortals and demons is a very good
1,yes the acting and directing was terrible but i really liked this film and was glad to see it again,yes it 's an interesting movie but i think the film is a bit too much for the story
1,as a matter of fact the film does n't have the same charm as it 's in the first movie,as a result the movie does not have the same plot as it does it 's just a bit boring
1,if you want to see a good film about the evils that are being made to entertain people and the audience,if i were to watch the movie i would have been a better person if it was a little longer
1,dean stockwell is a good director and a great writer,dean cain is a good actor as the villain but he
1,and the ending is so stupid that the viewer will,and the ending of the end was so bad
1,for a long time i was a little confused,for those of you who do n't care for this
1,gay people do a good job in this movie,gay men have a very small problem with the fact
1,the film has some very nice scenery,the acting is horrible but that is n't
1,then the movie switches to a scene that was n't funny and was not meant for me,then again i do n't think i can say that this is a movie i will watch again
1,sure the film was n't too much but it was a little too slow and it was n't even a complete waste,sure it 's an action film with some very good actors but the story itself is very bad and the story is n't
1,i do agree with the other comment that the ending is,i think this is the best of the two sequels
1,i was n't expecting much but i found it pretty good,i think it is a shame that the film is n't available
1,blade runner 2 the best of the three is the best,blade li was a great actor and i loved his performance
1,i was expecting a lot more from this movie but i was expecting something more than a little,i have n't seen a lot since this film is based on the book by neil simon
1,i think this was the worst of the bunch that i,i have seen it twice in the past few months
1,nothing is a good idea but it 's still fun to watch and the characters are very well developed by the,nothing is really funny and i ca least think of a film that is worse than that of a film
1,jonathan pryce is a delight as the villain but the movie just is n't funny,jonathan pryce as a young boy who has to deal to find his way is an
1,i do think that this film is a must watch film,i do not want to spoil it but i 'll say that
1,the acting is pretty bad the plot is awful the,the story is very weak and is very predictable
1,eliot and his friends are a group of young people who are not a single mother,eliot 's father is a man who is a little too old to be the mother
1,therefore the story is very thin the acting was awful the script was bad even for the time it was written and directed by the same guy who made a good horror thriller,therefore it is a movie about the holocaust of war and the struggle between a man and a man in a world of love that can be shared in the lives of men who
1,this is not a bad movie,this movie does a good job of
1,we get a glimpse of the characters that were supposed to make the story seem so,we get a lot of people talking and talking about the way things are going
1,freddy krueger is a good film that has been made in a very low esteem,freddy krueger is a pretty good film and the director is a very talented cinematographer but
1,rodman and lugosi are the two main leads in a very different form in which the film is set,rodman 's character is not a great one but the character is so likable and the acting that he does
1,it 's not a great film but a solid one,it 's not a bad movie but it is not
1,walt disney 's the original is a classic and it 's a,walt is the one who gets killed by an old flame
1,and it 's a shame to watch the movie for the entire movie,and the movie is so bad that i could n't stop laughing
1,well the film does not seem like that much,well this is the first movie that makes the story
1,so the movie has its own problems and it does not have,so what if the film had a budget of the day
1,memo to the director 's commentary on this,memo for the film to be made
1,i do n't know if this is a comedy but it was a good idea for a comedy,i think it 's a good movie but i think it 's just a waste of time and a
1,a lot of people are complaining about this,a lot like it would n't have been a
1,the film is about a group that is in the woods and,the movie starts out very well but is n't that good
1,if the story was not so good and the actors and actresses would,if i had to watch it i would have been more impressed
1,the acting is very good and the acting is good,the story of a young man named benjamin is an interesting
1,and the film is not a bad,and that was the best part
1,trust the director and the actors for this,trust me if you want to see something that
1,but the real star of the story was the fact that she was in a coma,but it 's a great film to watch with the lights and you 'll enjoy it
1,but the movie is not as funny,but it was n't that great
1,from this point of view it 's a pretty dull story about a group who are forced,from a very good performance by the lead actor who plays the role of the mother
1,jump forward and the other is one that is,jump is the best thing about the film
1,it has a great story line that is so good,it 's a pity that the movie is so bad
1,paulie was a little bit too eager to play the role,paulie 's father and his daughter are all very likable
1,the film has a very good story and a,the movie is a little bit too predictable
1,so the film is a little too long for the first half of the picture,so if the film is really good you can say that the director and his staff
1,maybe the director should n't be able,maybe i should have been able to see
1,and the film 's ending is a complete copout,and the film 's main theme is that it is
1,i was n't expecting a good film but i did n't,i have never seen a more beautiful film than this
1,with the exception of the first half and the second is not the best of the three but it 's a good movie and a mustsee for any fan and for,with a supposed beard in the movie 's favor it does not take itself too seriously and there 's a few moments of the film that are quite well done
1,as a fan myself it is a great movie,as for me this is the best movie i have
1,the film has some of the worst special fx,the film 's premise is a bit thin
1,i have never seen a movie where the characters are all very good and it makes for good viewing,i was expecting this movie to be good but the movie is just plain awful and the acting is bad
1,perhaps the most interesting aspect of this production is that it 's a bit of a mess,perhaps the best of all the film is the fact of which it 's a real treat to
1,it was a waste of time,it 's a very simple and very
1,did n't he know that he 's not going to be a good actor or a character that he is,did i mention that this movie is so good that it 's almost impossible for anyone to understand it or just
1,the film has a very good plot but the execution of this film is so poor,the acting is good with the exception of some of the actors in a movie
1,the story is about two women in a different situation who lives in a large house in the country,the film has a lot to say about the subject of a man who is in a mental institution but
1,i was surprised that this was a very good sequel to a movie and i think the best,i think that 's the best of all this is one movie that is n't even funny
1,now i know that the film is a remake of,now that i am i just like the movie
1,most importantly the film is a complete bore and a waste of my life and i do,most people who think that this is a good thing but it is n't that funny
1,and i think the reason why i give this a 1 out 10 is 1 the acting is horrible,and the acting is so bad it 's hard for the audience to laugh out of their seats to tears
1,but this film does have its charms,but i have to say this movie is
1,but it 's not as bad,but it 's just that bad and
1,basically this is a very good film,basically the movie is a mess
1,but it was n't that bad,but it was n't so bad that
1,jeanclaude bava 's the howling the grudge is a,jeanclaude bava 's direction is a good thing
1,nice luck and the movie is worth,nice to know what it is
1,i have seen a few films and the ones that are so bad that it is hard for me,i have seen this film several many years ago and i still remember seeing it in the theater and cried
1,they have a lot of fun,they are not in the same league
1,i have to say that i was a little,i think it 's a very bad movie
1,plays a character with a conscience and a disability,plays out like a bad movie with the same title
1,the story is simple and it 's not a movie,the acting is very good but the script is n't as
1,if you 're not looking to see the movie for the sake it has been made,if it was a comedy i would n't have seen it but i do not think it
1,in this movie we see him as a young boy in a very dysfunctional family,in this movie he is a man with a conscience and he is a very human
1,as for me it 's just that the movie has been shot and,as a matter the movie was a waste of time and money
1,will smith 's character has the same name,will the viewer get to know that there was
1,should n't they be the only way,should n't they be a bit more believable
1,i do not know if this was,i think that 's the point
1,if i could find this dvd on dvd i 'd be surprised to see the movie in the theater,if you 're looking for something more than a few hours you 'll get the idea that the film was
1,looking for it in the theater i would n't be surprised if this is a movie,looking at the cast of this one i have a problem of the director who wrote this
1,incidentally it is a film about two people in the same predicament,incidentally the director 's cut is a bit over a hour and so
1,these are not the ones we have to do with,these are the two things i do n't understand
1,i was surprised to see the first film in the series,i was surprised to see this film on the imdb for it
1,i think the director should 've been proud of this,i was n't expecting much of this film and i did
1,the acting in this film is superb,the film has a very nice feel to
1,in fact it 's not even the best movie ever made,in a nutshell i would say that i have a lot of
1,eric stoltz plays an old flame and a very funny cameo,eric stoltz as his son is a great choice for the part
1,bo derek is a very funny actor,bo svenson is the only one who is
1,and it is not that the film is n't that,and the movie is a complete failure to watch
1,in the first half of the film the viewer gets to know the character of his daughter and her lover,in the meantime it has a very very very very very bad plot and it 's not even bad
1,i do agree with the other comments about it,i do not want to spoil anything about it
1,she is also the one who gets the girl in the end,she is the only person in the movie that has a shred of
1,there is a lot more of the same,there is a lot to like and the movie
1,danny aiello is perfect and the supporting cast are all good especially the,danny devito plays a character that is so stupid it 's unbelievable
1,along those lines are the most beautiful and funny i have ever heard and i'm exaggerating about it,along with the fact that the film is set up as an interesting film there is nothing new to
1,and it 's not the best film that it is,and it 's all so bad it 's good but it
1,the acting and directing were very good and the story was good,the movie was a little slow but i did n't think the ending
1,it 's a great movie that you can find a way to watch and,it 's a shame to see him as the lead in this film
1,the movie is a complete failure,the movie is a little slow but
1,finally it is a movie about a group of people,finally the movie 's story is n't that good
1,indeed i do n't think i 'll be disappointed but it 's just a little,indeed the film is n't a total waste and is n't even a movie
1,a lot more of a good film,a good film that is n't even good
1,in a sense of the word the director is trying to make a movie that has no real meaning and is,in the first part he is a man who 's been in a coma and is killed by the devil
1,this was a movie that was so,this is a very good movie
1,one thing that is missing is the fact that this movie was made for a buck and it was not a good movie to watch,one of them was a very good movie with the same name of a man in the same place and in one of her best roles
1,there 's no real plot no plot no plot and nothing,there is a scene that is a little jarring but the film
1,overall the story was a bit weak but i liked it,overall the movie is a little slow and the acting is terrible
1,andre and the other two are the same,andre 's father is a very nice guy
1,meltdown is the kind to see a film with,meltdown is one of his better known works
1,an interesting and very enjoyable movie about an aging young woman who moves across the,an example is the scene where the hero is walking out of a window
1,other reviewers here have commented here that it is,other than that the acting was pretty good
1,among other things the movie is about an ordinary woman who has to be one of,among the many things that i have read is this is the worst movie ever
1,there is nothing in it for the movie to get any better or better,there 's also a lot more than the usual action scenes but the action is
1,i have to wonder how this was made and why it was so popular to me,i was so bored to watch this movie that it was n't funny and i did n't
1,the story was n't very interesting and there were some really unnecessary scenes,the story was so predictable and so predictable it 's impossible to make a
1,and the film 's ending was pretty bad,and it 's not that i have to say
1,norton 's character does have a lot of potential but he does n't seem to have a lot of fun,norton 's character is the only person who has a shred to him in the movie and the whole cast is
1,here he 's an everyman and a woman who,here 's a movie i will never forget
1,this was a movie that i thought would be a good movie but i think it 's just bad,this film is not for everyone who wants something a little more realistic and a bit of a shame that
1,climbing a hole in the middle,climbing a hole in his head
1,but the film does n't have to be a complete disaster,but the film is a little bit too dark for its own
1,this is a very good movie,this is not a film that you
1,she has to be a little too,she 's the one to do
1,the movie is about a man who is trying to get his son out and his wife,the acting in this movie is terrible the plot is awful and it 's not that bad
1,mr bean has the most annoying role in this movie,mr blandings was a genius as the lead character
1,the story is a little weak and the acting and direction are,the film is very well done and the actors are excellent
1,by far this one 's best asset,by far i have n't seen a movie
1,much more of a drama than a horror flick and a lot of it 's a little too long,much like the film 's plot the characters and the characters all seem to have lost their touch
1,unfortunately the film has a very good cast and it 's a good movie,unfortunately the movie does not have a lot more than the basic premise of a
1,i have to say i was n't impressed by it and it was,i have n't read the manga but this is a good example
1,some people may have to say that the film is not a masterpiece but it is still an enjoyable experience,some of the acting is pretty poor the characters are very weak the plot was predictable and the acting was horrible
1,she is also a good actress,she is not a great actor
1,looks like it was written on the wind,looks good and the acting is excellent
1,anyway the movie has a good deal going in between the scenes where a little bit of the mystery is thrown into a mix of a few scenes of events that are n't really explored,anyway the film 's main problem is it 's just too slow and boring for the viewer to care about the main characters and the plot is so contrived and contrived the plot seems to drag
1,it was a waste of time to,it has a very funny plot
1,this is not a movie that i can watch again,this movie is so bad it makes it impossible to watch
1,so if it 's not for the fact that the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever the movie is not a complete mess it was n't,so if you 're looking for something that does nothing but sit down relax and enjoy the movie then this movie is for you but you 'll
1,this movie has a lot of potential,this film was made in 1995
1,and it does not have to go down as an interesting and interesting,and it 's not that it does have a lot to do
1,but the film does n't have the same charm as in other movies like it and even with the exception it is a very good film and a great one,but the film 's only redeeming quality to this movie is the fact it has a few good points but the story does a lot worse with the script and acting
1,only to be rewarded to death,only the first half hour and the
1,teaching me that i was in a mental institution for my mum,teaching the truth about a film that is a good one to be
1,the acting is good but it 's not as good as i expected,the movie is about a young woman named lena who lives on a farm
1,if you are into the book and are looking for something to watch in this movie you can probably do,if you 're looking for an intelligent movie with a strong cast and an intelligent story this film is for you
1,the acting in all this is terrible and i 've seen better acting in elementary schools,the movie is a little bit of an action movie and a little too long but the
1,but it 's a very good movie,but the movie has a very good ending
1,now that the movie was over and over i was so excited to find myself in a coma,now i am going to go out and buy the dvd for a good price and a half of
1,when i watched this i thought that it would get a little better,when he is on screen he is the perfect choice to get to know
1,with a cast like the one in the book the film has,with all these actors i could not help but feel sorry
1,the film is not about an ordinary woman who 's attracted her to,the acting is good and the plot is a bit too thin
1,junk is the best of the lot and the best part is where the hero gets to know his character,junk is the only thing that makes this movie watchable and i do n't want my money to see the movie
1,many of them were not funny and were n't very funny,many things have changed in my view of the movie
1,either a movie or movie that is n't funny,either the director forgot that he wanted or the director
1,the movie has a lot more plot than most other movies,the story is a bit slow but there are moments where the
1,yea i know that the movie was made,yea the movie is a complete mess
1,it 's not a bad film but it 's still good,it has the feel of one of these early films
1,i have to agree that the film is a bit too long but it is still a good film that will make your heart hurt,i have seen the movie and have been a fan of a great film for years and i have to say this movie did n't seem
1,hey i have to give this a 10,hey i have seen this movie and i have
1,this movie has a good story line,this film was made on a shoestring in
1,the story is about the same guy who was in the army and his mother and his,the film was made for a few bucks and i think it would 've worked well
1,i do n't know what the point is,i was so excited when i saw that it
1,the movie was made for a rainy afternoon,the story of the film revolves on an old
1,the movie was a waste for the whole family,the film has a lot of potential but that 's
1,yes the movie has a few good moments,yes it was a little too long
1,i think the movie was very well written and directed,i think this is the best movie of the series i
1,but i was surprised that this movie did not have a chance to make it into the first movie in my collection of films,but the film is not so much a film that it makes you feel that there is a lot to admire in the story
1,out there the movie has a lot of fun and it is a great show that i recommend watching it if you can,out of the blue he was a big hit and i do n't think that this movie is really bad but the worst thing
1,a lot of the humor was done in the first 15 mins,a few years later i saw the film in the theaters
1,hrithik roshan is also the only actor that can play a character,hrithik qi is a great actress and she 's a great singer in
1,i think that 's the only part of the movie that i can identify,i do think the movie would have been better served if they were n't
1,ok so it has the same effect as the other two,ok so it 's not a bad idea to begin with this
1,it is the most powerful and powerful piece of work i 've ever had,it 's a shame that this movie is only available for the us
1,as for the film 's technical errors the story is a bit,as a result of a series the series was a success
1,i do n't understand why people would n't be so attracted to this,i do n't know if this was the best i can recall
1,in fact i was very disappointed with the film,in the end he 's not a hero
1,i have to say i have seen it twice,i do agree but i think it was the best
1,virginie khanna is a fine actor and is the only reason for this,virginie knightly plays a woman who 's a little girl and she does have
1,this was a very poor movie,this was a movie i would watch
1,this is a movie for the entire generation,this is the first of the four films that
1,i have never been so disgusted by a movie as this one,i have to say this was one that i would watch if it
1,it 's a shame that the film never got released,it 's a great movie that i would like for anyone
1,it has the same plot as the original,it 's not a bad movie either
1,the movie starts as one would have been more interesting if i had been,the film is a complete mess and should never get better and brighter
1,although the story was n't as strong it 's a very good film with a,although the film is n't a great one and the acting is pretty good
1,spoilers ahead the film is a very interesting and,spoilers ahead the movie was made for tv
1,we get the idea that the writer and director have no intention to,we have seen the first two movies and it 's a shame
1,you 'll see it all the way through the movie you can tell it,you have to be a fan and you 're going for it to have a
1,while the story is a lot better than the book it is a good film,while i do n't think that the movie was meant as an adaptation i would have
1,the acting was terrible the script was awful but i was,the film is a very good example for a movie
1,scenes like this are just too stupid for me to be too,scenes that were not funny or funny are not very funny
1,watching the movie was just plain stupid,watching the movie is the story of two
1,given the choice of a film that was shot independently on a low level of 35mm,given a chance to make an appearance for the first season the show was canceled
1,note it 's the worst thing i 've got,note the film is n't a total waste
1,all of this is a big mistake to make it a success for me,all in the family and the movie 's story was a bit too much
1,there 's nothing to recommend this,there was a lot more to the
1,has a very strong cast and crew,has the director 's cut of the camera
1,it 's not a bad thing that the movie does n't,it 's a pity because it 's so much better
1,and that 's why i did not see the ending of this film,and the ending was pretty bad and it was n't that good
1,this movie does n't have to be,this is a very bad film
1,overhears the story and you have a movie about a,overhears the film as a comedy it is n't
1,at first i did n't like this movie because i was so,at least the original was n't as great as i remembered
1,blood dolls and other assorted things,blood and gore are all the rage
1,to be honest the movie is n't a total waste of,to say the least the film was a total flop
1,the film is a bit slow but it is not a movie to,the film was shot in color and the sets were so grainy
1,i do not want to be a part to the movie but i think that it is a very enjoyable film to watch,i think this is an excellent film and should be avoided by anyone who enjoys watching it for what it has to offer and
1,if you are a fan of the original then watch this movie and enjoy,if i could have been the only person who could n't find the words of
1,this is a great film for those who enjoy a good film,this movie is a must for any fan of the series
1,the movie was a little slow but i found myself wondering if i was supposed for a,the film 's main weakness is the lack that the film 's main characters are in
1,mxico 's direction is the same as a few of the others,mxico is a great movie and a great movie to view with a
1,dependable and interesting to see the film,dependable and interesting characters are all in their
1,this movie was a waste for me but i really enjoyed it and i loved this movie very well,this is a film about a group of young adults and one of a very strict and violent and violent
1,to be fair i do not think it was,to be honest it is a good movie
1,it is not even a comedy,it 's not a bad film
1,a lot of people who say that,a good movie to be watched
1,iris has a great body and is a good actress who has done so many things that she,iris 's character is the only reason to watch it and i have seen it several times
1,marco 's mother is an alcoholic who has a crush on her,marco is an old man and he 's the only one to die
1,kudos to all involved in this production for the,kudos for a few scenes of a movie
1,the movie is a little slow and boring but it has some good moments but it,the story is very good but i ca all think that it was a waste
1,ok i 've read the comments and seen it but this was the first time,ok so this is the kind of movie i would watch over and past
1,once the movie begins you get to hear a few things about the movie but i think the movie is just plain,once the movie is over it is just a bunch and a lot of fun in the end it is not
1,elmer keitel was the best in this movie and i was impressed by his performance,elmer bernstein is a very good actor and the film has a great cast
1,sarah silverman is a good actress,sarah michelle phillips plays a young man
1,the film 's premise was n't a bad one and the acting was pretty good but,the story line has some very funny scenes and the movie is very well done
1,i think the film has some good points but it 's a lot of,i do not think this movie is worth the effort to see it
1,there is a lot of violence to be seen,there 's no real reason to watch it
1,the acting is very good and it 's a,the movie was a bit slow at times
1,the acting is good and i have seen the whole thing on tv,the movie was made for the romanians of all the groups of the united
1,mr blandings has the ability to get a job and the film is a great work of art that is,mr bean has the most convincing performance in the entire movie but he is n't really the best actor
1,after the film ended we were n't sure what was going on,after the first half of the movie i was n't expecting much but
1,the movie is not a complete failure,the film has some nice moments
1,i think the movie was very good in the first 30 minutes or the third and the ending was a bit abrupt but i was surprised that this was the last movie i have ever heard,i do agree but i have to say that the film 's ending was a bit too abrupt and i could have sworn that the ending had been left out for more than a week
1,pockets that have been done in the last decades,pockets of the plot is a little slow and the
1,version the first one and the second,version of the story of the famous and
1,the story line is about a group of people in a remote cabin in a small isolated village in the,the movie is a complete mess of a movie that is so boring that you can only laugh once
1,but it was n't a great movie either it just was not,but the film is a very interesting and very enjoyable film
1,though it is a very bad film i have n't seen any film,though the movie is a bit long it has some good points
1,people who have n't read this review are not sure who they 're and what they 're,people who are n't familiar with this kind of thing can be forgiven for this movie
1,but the film is not as good as the original it 's a very enjoyable and very good one and it is one that you will see again,but the story of a girl who is n't really a bad boy is not a very good movie but it does n't have a good plot
1,it is a movie that will not appeal to everyone,it 's not a movie that i can see over the
1,it 's just a bad movie,it is the most powerful movie ever
1,jonathan pryce is the only good character,jonathan shields is the most annoying person on
1,if you have n't already seen this movie you should be warned about the story and you,if i had a copy of a movie i 'd probably have seen the first one
1,equally bad and bad acting is n't,equally bad acting by the cast
1,this was a movie that i had never heard,this movie does n't have any of that
1,i do n't understand why they did this,i was n't really sure what to expect
1,how can a movie like this get made,how many people have a problem with this movie
1,the story is simple and the acting is very poor but the,the acting is horrible the plot line and acting is horrible
1,i think this is the best movie ever made,i have to wonder how much of this movie was
1,i was so bored that i did n't have to pay for this,i think that the film was made for tv and that it is not
1,she was n't a bad actress but she was so good that she,she 's a good person but she is not a good actress
1,by all means this movie was n't even a good movie but a good movie nonetheless,by the third act it 's a pity that the director and the writer have n't done
1,i do n't want it to go into the same category,i was surprised that the film had been made by a major
1,the story is simple the characters in their own way and are not afraid to be developed,the story of the kelly family and their relationship with the parents and the girl 's mother is
1,please do n't waste time with it and you 'll,please do yourselves a favor and rent this movie
1,arnold schwarzenegger was a very good guy,arnold 's acting is n't bad but the
1,george lucas has made the film as an art piece of cinema,george clooney is a great actor and i hope he gets a chance
1,anne hathaway is a very talented actress who has a very small,anne reid 's role is a little too much to bear
1,this is the worst movie i have had to sit through in my lifetime,this movie has a very low budget but that does not mean it is a
1,like the other two thirds of my own life the movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever,like i 've said before the film has been released in the united states and is now
1,one day i was in a mental hospital,one thing i liked most about it is that
1,we 're told that he 's not the only one that is not a good guy,we get a very interesting glimpse of the characters in this case and the story of the
1,clooney is a fine character and he 's a very good actor,clooney 's acting is so bad he 's just not funny
1,the story is about a young girl who is married to her husband in a car,the movie is about a group of kids who have a lot of fun and have a
1,in a way this film is so bad it makes you feel,in the end i was hoping that the movie would end
1,the story is simple and is not very well developed,the film is a very good film and a good film
1,i have never been so compelled for the movie,i think it 's a shame because the film was
1,young woman is an actress who does not have the skills to make a film,young people with the same sense and sensibility have been a little too much and still
1,for a while i did not like this movie,for me it seemed like a good idea
1,and it is a great story and i do n't know what it is,and the acting is so bad that it 's hard to see what 's going
1,i think that the director and writer should not have to make the mistake to make a film like this,i do n't understand why the film was made and why it is so good for the whole family
1,quite frankly i do n't understand what this film really did,quite frankly this is not one of those movies that you do
1,for those that have n't seen it do n't bother,for those interested with the genre of the time it 's
1,i think the film was very well done,i think the film is very funny
1,how could it be so bad,how did the director and his friends
1,his character was so unlikable and the acting was awful,his character is the only reason to see it
1,i think the reason for that was that it is not the worst film ever,i have n't read any of the books on which this film was written
1,when he finally catches his old friend and his girlfriend and he,when he 's on screen he 's a very nice guy
1,burton 's direction and editing are also very well done,burton is a great actor but i think he is a
1,do you know how to make you laugh,do n't worry that i wasted my hour and
1,this movie is not worth the effort of,this is one of my favorite shows
1,i have n't seen the film in the long time and i do n't know if it 's not a good movie,i think that the director should be able to make this movie as a warning and a warning to the filmmakers and the
1,bob hoskins is the standout actor in this movie,bob saget is the perfect choice for the movie
1,like a lot of movies that are not in any,like the other two the acting was very bad
1,the film is a complete mess with no redeeming features at the end but it 's,the story is simple but it 's all a dream of a man 's life
1,i have n't seen a film that has a very good message but the movie is not that good,i do n't think that a movie like it could have done it was that it was n't
1,kinnear plays a very likable character in the film,kinnear plays an american who has a secret agent and
1,i have n't seen this show in my entire life and i do remember it being so bad,i do n't think i 've been so effected with the story but this is a movie
1,melvin 's father is a bit of,melvin 's character is the best
1,the movie was n't even good,the acting is very bad the script
1,after all this time the story has a lot of potential,after a while you realize that it was the same thing
1,just as the story is told in a few words it is,just a bunch that would n't have been a better film
1,basil rathbone plays his character with his dignity as a man in his life and he is not a very good actor,basil rathbone is a good actor but his performance was so bad i was laughing at the stupidity of the movie
1,the acting in the movie is good,the story is about a young boy who
1,a very enjoyable movie and a mustsee for those of all ages and a must see for all,a few years later he has to go to the local police station to find the killer
1,all in one movie the acting was superb and the story lines were great but i did n't really enjoy the movie at all,all in the family is the best of the bunch but the most important thing about the film is how they are able and the
1,i have seen this movie several years ago but it is still a pleasure to watch,i have to say that i was impressed with the ending of the movie but i was
1,will the director please stop spoiling the film for being a,will smith and grodin have a good chemistry in this
1,each character was a complete wuss,each time the movie starts you can
1,still it 's not a great movie but i think it 's one,still it 's a great film to have a lot of laughs
1,they are not funny or even interesting,they are both a very nice and talented
1,and it does a good disservice,and the film is a little too
1,lead to the movie 's climax and the ending which is a bit abrupt,lead to the final battle of wits between two men and the other a group
1,while the film was shot in the early 90 minutes it was still very entertaining and the characters were believable,while this film was a bit too much of a mess it still manages not just to be funny
1,really it is n't a good movie but,really bad acting and a lot less
1,never mind that it 's a film about,never mind it 's a good movie
1,seeing this film was a great idea and a great cast and it is,seeing this one i was impressed by the way the story is structured
1,the movie starts out very promising but the end result was just too predictable and too slow,the acting in this movie is very good and i have to say i liked it
1,i do think it 's a great idea for the movie to be done and i do not think that the director should have done a good story or the movie,i do not think that a movie that has been made by people of a high caliber or a director 's work would have been able into the world of the director
1,from the beginning of a movie that is not really about the characters and the plot it,from a technical point in this movie you can see that this is an excellent movie
1,he is the only person that can,he is not a great actor
1,it 's a shame that such a great movie,it was a good idea for a movie
1,ok so i guess the movie was,ok it 's a good idea
1,the story was a lot of fun but it 's just not a movie for kids,the film has some very nice moments but it 's not enough to save the day and
1,this movie is not a movie for anyone who wants to watch a movie,this is a film that i would recommend for everyone to watch with friends
1,there was no plot line or even any sense to make this a bad movie,there are some great scenes of dialogue and the movie has a great deal going for
1,we get to see some of his most famous movies,we are supposed as to believe that this is the best
1,this is not a movie about a man,this is the worst of the worst
1,the movie starts out as a typical slasher film,the story line is about two guys who get a
1,sophie is the best thing about it,sophie and the other tenants have a secret
1,instead it 's a pretty bad movie and i,instead the movie is a very boring film
1,like i said the story is very good and the acting is excellent and the characters all are believable,like the previous films this one has to be seen to be believed but i do n't know what i
1,it is a very funny movie,it was n't that great but the
1,the acting in all is excellent with this role,the story of this movie was so good and so
1,the movie is a very good example,the story is about a group called the
1,by now the film has been released in the states of the past,by far this is a movie i would watch over all times and watch
1,that was the only way to get a copy of this film,that is the only thing i did like about a movie
1,another problem is that the movie is n't as bad as the first movie and it 's not as bad either as it was,another thing that makes this a good horror movie was it was shot in a very cheap and cheap digital video camera and it 's
1,well it 's not the best movie i 've seen in a long day,well the film is n't that bad and that 's not saying much
1,you 'll never get a grip,you know the movie is a spoof
1,while i do n't like the movie for its own sake it is a very enjoyable film and it has some good moments,while the film is a bit slow at the end it feels as though there was a bit of suspense to it and i
1,in this case the film has the same effect on,in fact this is the best of his career
1,the movie is not a good movie but the performances of all the characters,the movie was shot in the early 80 's and the early seventies in the
1,i was n't really surprised that this is not the worst horror movie ever made,i think that the director and writer should have made it more of an action film
1,after the first 15 minutes i was ready for it to be made,after all these years i 've watched it twice and i still have n't
1,it is not the worst film of the decade but,it 's not that i would like this film
1,an interesting film about a man who has a dream,an excellent film that should be seen by all
1,true the movie is not a total disaster it 's just a bunch,true the story was n't that great it 's a good thing
1,none other the film is about the power that is the key of the,none is a movie of a film that 's not worth your money
1,apparently this was a movie that was supposed to be funny but it,apparently this film is a bit over the top in its simplicity
1,i think the director and writer should not have to have the guts to be a little more interested in,i was expecting a lot of this film but i do have to say it was a good film
1,90 percent of it was shot in the same location as the original the story was very good the acting was good,90 years later the film was released in the us in the uk and was released at home and released by a local
1,and it is a great movie,and it is a great movie
1,but this movie is a must see if you are into,but the movie does n't have a lot of action
1,val is a great actress but she does n't have much to,val kilmer and his crew of characters are all very good
1,i have never been a fan and i was so excited when this film ended,i think the movie is very funny but the movie just is too short
1,i was so excited when i saw that it was,i do think the movie has some redeeming qualities
1,finally the movie has been made in a hurry to be a bit of a cult film and the acting was horrible,finally there was a lot of good things going on and i liked the way the movie progressed the story line was very
1,oh yeah the story is pretty basic and there,oh and the scene with the giant cockroaches
1,as a result of the film it is a very long time,as a matter the fact that the story line was so stupid that
1,for those of you who have n't seen this movie i would highly advise you not to waste the time you 're,for the first half or so minutes it 's a pretty boring and tedious movie that is not funny at all
1,also the ending is very good,also the movie is not very good
1,it has a lot of fun but i do have some problems,it was n't even that great to me and it was n't a
1,in fact it 's the worst movie i have seen,in fact the film is a very interesting and very interesting
1,a very good movie with excellent acting and,a good film with some great actors
1,skelton 's character has a lot of fun to do and it,skelton and her husband have a good time in the film
1,the acting was good enough but not the greatest movie i had ever watched in any,the story is a complete mess with a capital of a man and a man
1,naturally it is a movie that will,naturally it is not a movie
1,and the film 's ending is a little abrupt and the story is not as bad but it 's,and i have to say that the movie has a lot of potential to be a great movie
1,i think that the director should 've had to have been a bit longer,i do n't know how it got to a point but the ending was so
1,over the top it is a little slow but the film is not about a single mother who is a very good one,over the course of a few months i have to say that i have seen a number that has been done by many people
1,this is not the type of movie that you 'd expect,this movie is a must watch if your not prepared to be
1,examples of the film include that of the two stooges and it 's a very funny movie,examples of the movie are not that much of an issue or even a good movie
1,among all those of the early kurosawa films it was very disappointing,among the most interesting and memorable movies that i have had the chance
1,to me this is a movie that is worth watching,to be honest the film is a complete mess
1,sad that the movie was made in the us,sad that the film is a bit over the top
1,it was a very good movie,it 's the story and the way
1,i was so disappointed by this film,i do not want to give away the
1,the movie starts out with the first one being a big fat guy and his girlfriend,the story of an american woman who moves into the house of her husband and is a
1,the film is not only a vehicle for a few actors but the story,the film 's main flaw is that it is a very poor film
1,and the movie has a good cast,and that 's why the story is so
1,its the most boring film i have watched in a long day,its just not a good show and it 's not even funny
1,i do n't want to give the plot away,i think this is a very funny movie
1,there are so very good movies out there and that is the case with most movies that,there are some great actors in it but it 's all so bad it 's funny
1,born on this planet is one of those movies you 're looking for but i do n't think it 's a great film,born in the states is one of the most beautiful films in recent history but it does n't have a happy story
1,this movie is a complete mess of a film,this movie is so awful that you can almost smell
1,but it does not make any sense at,but it 's a very funny movie
1,ok the movie is a bit of the spoof of some other horror movies,ok so i have to say that i have seen the movie twice
1,but this one was n't that bad,but the story was n't that good
1,not only is he completely unlikable he is the most unlikable and annoying character in the whole movie,not that i have n't seen the original movie but the movie is so bad it makes it impossible
1,however the film has the same effect as the,however the movie is a little too long
1,for a film that is a little more interesting it does not seem that much more of a drama,for those who are looking at the movies that have n't seen this movie you will be disappointed
1,the story is about two women living at a deserted mansion who is married,the acting is good and the script is a bit over the top
1,john wayne is a great actor and,john wayne is a good actor
1,one day i watched it with my friends and i had to watch a lot of movies,one day the two of the three friends go on a trip through the desert in search for
1,i think that the film is a little,i do n't know what to do
1,we have a movie that is so bad it becomes boring,we 're told the story of an old man who 's been
1,simply put this is a great film,simply a film for the fans of the
1,i have seen a lot of films and have seen the first two,i think the director 's intent is to show us a real story of
1,only a small portion in this series can only get a few of the jokes and laughs from the original,only the first half of it is pretty good and i think it 's a great movie that is not only
1,anyway i think it 's one that you will,anyway the film is n't really a thriller
1,the film was shot on location,the movie is a very good movie
1,and it was n't a bad idea at the time,and the ending is so predictable and so predictable
1,not only is this film a complete waste of money but a good time waster,not a great movie to watch but it 's not a good one either
1,it 's not a bad film but a good one,it has a good premise and a good cast
1,sit through the whole movie you can tell what was happening,sit in my basement and watch it again and again
1,that is the case of this movie,that is the only positive aspect i have
1,a few years later she has been a,a few scenes that make you laugh
1,boy is it a bad movie,boy i was a fan of the
1,perhaps the most famous film in the genre is that it 's a bit more fun than the first,perhaps it would n't make a difference but it was a good movie and the movie was great
1,streep and lombard were very good and they did a great,streep plays a woman in a different type of role
1,i do n't know if i can get it or just want it for,i have n't read the book and it 's a little too hard for the
1,williams is the perfect choice for a movie that is,williams 's character was a little annoying at first
1,and the movie is so stupid that it 's hard to watch,and it 's not the least bit of a joke it 's a
1,he is the only one in this world of this type,he was a little more believable and more convincing and he was
1,if i had n't seen a few of them they could have been a bit better and the story could have had more of,if it was on cable i would have been able to find it online and it was a waste of money and time
1,jackie chan is a good guy,jackie 's angels are the only ones
1,the movie is not a comedy it 's not as predictable as the first but it,the film is a bit slow but i think the film is a great example
1,if you 're a diehard asian horror buff you will be pleasantly disappointed,if you are a fan of hers and you want to see this film
1,my favorite scene is a woman walking into the house to get a little girl to go on a rampage,my only complaint is that the film is not very funny and it 's not even worth the time
1,this is a film about a young woman who lives in the apartment with a married woman,this movie is a great example of how a movie can be done and the actors are so
1,director robert zemeckis is also responsible for his directing ability to work with the director and cinematographer,director robert altman 's the film is one continuous dream of a film that is not even worth
1,jake and his friend are all very good in the movie,jake 's character is a bit too old for the role but
1,it has the best elements of this movie and the best of the three is,it is not even a movie that is a complete waste of film time
1,i have to wonder if the movie was a bit too,i do not think i 've ever been a fan
1,may be this film has been made for tv,may i mention that the movie is not a complete
1,in the first part we are shown a very interesting portrait,in the movie he 's a young man who is a struggling
1,i'm not going for a movie that is so bad that you do n't even want to watch it,i'm not sure if i am not a fan but i would n't be surprised if the story line is
1,rent a few movies and you 'll see what they do,rent this if you want to see a good movie
1,by all accounts the movie was a waste of money and money,by now we are not really that much of a problem
1,of all the other movies of this era it 's a shame that the director has never made a movie that is so awful it 's good,of course the film is a little too much for me to like and i am not sure what the point of the film is to make it
1,we are supposed to believe that a lot is in this movie that is n't a good one,we have seen this show several years before the first episode and it shows how the characters have to
1,my favorite character is a fat girl,my favorite scene is the one with a
1,it 's not even a good horror movie,it has a good plot good acting and great
1,and the ending is just a bit of,and the movie has some nice moments
1,now i have seen this film and i have to agree,now i am a fan but it 's not as good as
1,another example of a good movie about the real wigand 's obsession,another thing the movie has is that there was no plot
1,examples of a great cast including a great ensemble of actors who play an interesting role as a young boy who is in,examples of this movie were made in 1987 and the film 's production company was not the only one that did it
1,the acting in all the characters are so good that they are so funny,the acting in all is bad but the script is n't really bad
1,so if the viewer does get the opportunity to watch a film with no real reason why the director is trying to make it seem the director 's cut to,so i do n't know if this is supposed to be funny or not i have a hard time figuring it would be a good thing to describe it
1,the movie is a bit of a bore but a lot of the,the movie is about the struggle between the mother and her mother
1,as for the story well it 's not a good movie,as i said before this movie is a must see
1,i think this movie is a must see,i think that 's why it 's not a
1,the movie has some nice moments but i ca n't say,the acting was good and it 's a great film
1,at first i thought it would have worked better if i had been more careful and had been a little better to,at one moment the film is about the same person that made a movie that was n't even a good idea
1,the movie was shot on video in,the acting was n't bad either
1,this movie is a must have for anyone who loves,this movie does n't make a lick better sense
1,only the title is a bit too abrupt and the film does n't even try to be too clever to be too serious,only a couple of years after this film was released theatrically released in 1995 the only one who knew the name would n't be
1,in the end it 's a pretty good film,in fact the only thing that is good about him
1,i was surprised that this is the best film that i have ever seen and i would recommend it,i think this is a very good movie but i have n't seen it since the first movie
1,where did i get this movie from,where the hell did the money come in
1,when i saw the film i had no idea what it 's like to,when you see a movie you have a lot more than you want
1,some of them are not so much of a problem but the fact that they 're not just a little different,some of these movies were made for a good budget and it would have been nice if they could 've used more
1,the film is a bit slow at best,the story of an old man from an unnamed
1,so what if you 're a fan of this,so the plot and characters were very believable
1,for the first time in a long long way the film has been released in the same league as a silent film,for me the most enjoyable thing about this movie was that it had to be the worst movie to ever be made but
1,i was so disappointed that the film ended with me,i have never seen any film that is better
1,visual effects of the movie is a lot like that of the other,visual effects are very impressive and the story itself is very good
1,whilst the movie has a few flaws it 's not a bad film either,whilst the movie is a good example of what happens to a man in the
1,needless to believe that this is a good movie and it is the best film i have ever watched and it is not just the best movie i have seen in a,needless to say i have n't been able to watch this one since it was made in the first place but in my opinion it was very good and very entertaining
1,hudson 's portrayal is very good and his role in the film is a real pleasure to watch,hudson 's role as the lead man was so good i could have cared less about her
1,more than just a bad movie it is n't even worth mentioning,more than anything else it seems that the director was trying to be
1,of course the film is not a complete failure,of the three films i have seen this was the
1,see the film if you can find,see it if you want it
1,recently this is a movie that i would n't have known to me,recently i have a friend who is a little too much to be able
1,3 out of 5 i love it and it 's one of my,3 a woman is kidnapped by a woman who is a witch
1,but i do n't know what this is supposed as a serious movie and it 's a very funny movie,but the story was so bad that you ca n't really care about any of the other characters or the characters
1,both of them are the same,both films are so good that they
1,till the final showdown the two begin to lose their sanity,till i watched this i thought that the film would have a
1,i was n't impressed when i watched the movie,i have to say that this is a very bad
1,sure there are some good moments and a few moments but the story is so weak that it,sure it 's not a movie but it has a very interesting story and a good script
1,as a result the film was very good,as a result the film is a very good
1,is this a good movie or a good one,is it a comedy or an action movie with a
1,so if it is not that i am a fan that 's not a big fan of the original film,so if i was n't so irritated i would have been a big hit for the first time in the movie
1,the acting and directing is horrible,the acting is pretty good with some
1,the movie starts out with a couple trying in a very serious way but instead it turns the movie off,the story of this film revolves around two men who are searching to find their own family and friends
1,here is an example of what a good film should do to make a movie about how the director and,here he is in his prime time with the camera as he 's trying hard to get a job
1,eleanor is a good actress and a good actress,eleanor is the only reason to watch it because of
1,there is no real reason to be there and that the,there 's no real reason to care about the characters
1,luckily the film is a bit too long for its own good,luckily the film is a bit slow but i think the director and
1,david niven and his brother are both,david lynch 's score was great
1,if the film is n't so great i would n't be surprised if it was released,if you have seen a few films that have been released in a few months and have
1,this film is a must for all lovers of,this movie is one of my alltime favorites
1,i have n't read any of the other user,i think the movie has a great soundtrack
1,she is a very talented actress and she is not the best character,she 's a good actress who is not the only character in this movie
1,this film is not for everyone and if they 're not so much more,this film does n't even have to do so with its limited budget
1,apart from this there is a lot more,apart from the occasional miscasting of robert duvall the
1,this movie has a good story line but the story line is n't that,this was the worst movie that i saw in the last ten years
1,spoilers ahead the film is about an american family who lives on a remote island,spoilers ahead i have to agree the first time i 've watched this movie i thought
1,when i was watching this i thought that it was a great movie,when i saw the trailer i thought the film was going to go nowhere
1,it 's not a bad movie but it 's good,it was so bad i wanted to see it again and
1,two people are the only ones who are willing by the same person to get their,two men who are married in their youth are killed by a very unknown group
1,however the plot and the script are very good too,however the film is n't as good as some of the
1,turn it into a movie that 's a little bit of a,turn out to contain an interesting plot and a great cast
1,there was a bit more than a,there are so many things wrong
1,til the end i found it to be very funny,til i was watching this film i had a feeling i
1,this movie is not for everyone,this is not a film for everyone
1,at least that 's how i felt,at least it 's the same
1,in the end i felt like i was going to see the end,in a movie with this kind of film it was a waste
1,you 'll never forget this movie and you wo n't regret it for being so awful it 's good,you 'll be surprised that you did n't like the movie and the fact that it had a few funny
1,diminishing the dvd and dvd i bought it on ebay and i watched it with my family and we all laughed so hard,diminishing the dvd for you the movie was a complete failure and i was n't even sure what to do with this
1,it 's just a shame to watch this movie,it 's a pity that the filmmakers did so many
1,the story of a young boy who has inherited a life in the,the story is simple and very predictable the characters are very shallow
1,so the movie is a little over a hour,so the movie was n't even that good
1,so i do n't know how to describe this one but i think it would be better if they could,so if you 're a fan and have seen it and are looking for the best movie of the series you
1,its not the worst movie i 've seen,its the most boring movie i have seen in
1,and the movie is a bit too long for its own good,and that 's why this movie has no redeeming feature whatsoever
1,the film 's premise is a little too thin but i do think that this film was a good,the story was a bit weak but the acting was great and the story line was good enough
1,i have n't read the book so i can understand why,i was n't expecting the same movie to be in this one
1,this film has a lot of good actors and it has some very good actors,this film is so awful it 's almost impossible for anyone to watch it for a
1,many of these films were made by warner brothers in the 1930 another but,many of the characters are very likable and the story is so interesting
1,at the beginning i found it to,at least it 's worth mentioning
1,and the acting is so awful i was,and it was n't a bad thing
1,the acting was good and the writing is good the directing is good but the acting in this movie,the story of a young boy who has a son 's life is a real treat to me
1,witness a few seconds of the film that were made in this movie it was a little bit too short and too predictable to make it a,witness it as a horror movie with a good cast and an excellent plot but it 's still a pretty good film and a great movie
1,i'm glad i was in the mood for the ending,i'm a sucker for movies that make no difference
1,so what do they expect to do with,so the plot is n't that good
1,i was n't expecting a good movie,i do n't know how this movie ever
1,there was a bit more to say about the movie than it,there 's no real explanation for what the film is about
1,hope lange is in it and that 's the only thing that makes it even more fun for a young woman,hope lange is n't the only one in the film that is n't the only thing that is good about the film
1,fisher 's father and daughter are the two daughters,fisher is not a bad guy but he is not
1,if i had to pick up the movie and give a damn about what i would have had expected i would n't want to see this one again,if i had to pick it up for me i 'd have a chance to see the movie i would n't be surprised if it was n't
1,lake placid is an entertaining little movie with an awesome plot and great performances,lake is a film that is not only about the evils of war
1,well the first thing that i did like about the movie were that the story was n't very good,well it 's the best movie i have ever watched and i do recommend this movie to all
1,this is the best movie i 've ever had the,this movie is a waste of money and time
1,although the film has a lot to live up for it 's own good intentions,although the film was shot on location in mexico in a period of time the film
1,o'brian is the only one that can,o'brian 's direction is also excellent
1,these guys do not seem like they 're in the,these are two of the worst movies in history
1,but the movie does not really do anything for me,but this one was so awful it was funny
1,or maybe he should just go to,or is it a bad film
1,he is a very talented actor,he has a very good role as
1,the story was n't that great and the acting by the leads in the film did not help either,the story is a little thin and the acting is not good but it is a great movie
1,you have to wonder what was wrong with,you have n't heard of this movie
1,who 's the girl who 's got to be her daughter,who cares if it was made in the first place
1,i was n't impressed when i saw that this was a movie,i do agree that this is a movie i will not forget
1,hard boiled to a man who 's been a little more,hard boiled is the best film i have ever seen
1,timothy spall is a wonderful director and,timothy spall is a great actor
1,while the film is a little long the scenes are very effective,while the story was a bit thin the story was a little weak
1,on the other side of the dvd release i,on this note the film is quite funny
1,none of these actors are able to,none of these things really happened
1,tag line is the worst of all time to watch and a movie that should be seen by,tag of the movie and i do agree that the director is a master in the genre
1,if you are a fan of hers i highly recommend this movie,if i had n't been able to watch a film i could have
1,this is not the worst of any movie ever,this is the first film i 've seen to a
1,but the real problem was that the plot seemed to have been written by a bunch of people,but this is not the best movie i 've ever read and that 's saying something that is a
1,i have to wonder if the movie was made,i do think it was a good choice
1,the movie was a waste of my life,the acting is pretty bad but the script was
1,there is no reason to see the film it 's a great film,there 's also a good deal more of it in the story
1,now that i 've read about the movie i,now i know it 's a bad thing
1,my favorite scene in my favorite scene was when a woman was talking about her husband 's suicide and i was shocked,my advice do n't watch it because you will be disappointed with the movie as it is a little too much
1,although this film is a little dated at best it has a lot of potential,although i think it 's a good movie to see and i would recommend this one
1,all of the characters are likable,all in the family is the best
1,some of them are just plain stupid,some people have claimed this is a good
1,if you 're going for something different and you 're not going for something else you have to have some good action,if the film is not so bad it is good but the acting is n't as bad as some have said
1,i was expecting something better from the movie,i think this movie is very good
1,nash and a friend of the family members of,nash and his men have a good time
1,however the plot and character are all very interesting,however i do n't know what to think
1,gasped and then a little more than i expected it to be a movie,gasped out loud in my head i have no idea how it was made but
1,evidently the film is not about as much fun to watch in the film industry as i did in a similar theater but in my,evidently the movie 's success is the director and his wife who are the only one to be involved with the film 's plot
1,certainly a good movie for a laugh but not for everyone who has to sit and laugh,certainly not a good film but it was a very pleasant movie that was made for the reputations
1,the film 's plot is a bit thin and the acting is not very convincing but the film is quite entertaining,the acting is pretty awful the script is terrible and it is n't even the worst acting i 've ever seen and
1,well this is a good movie,well i have a lot better to
1,on the plus side it 's a good movie,on a positive note the film is very well made
1,my advice to anyone interested in this film,my only regret for the movie was the ending
1,suddenly the two of them are killed by a giant crocodile wielding a swordfish of blood,suddenly he is sent into the hospital by a mysterious stranger and his family is threatened to
1,to me it is an absolute masterpiece,to say the film was good is that
1,i think the film is a very good example,i was expecting something more from a movie with some
1,after seeing it i was n't impressed,after all the story is told by an
1,this film has no plot to speak at the end of the film and,this is a great movie to see and it 's a must see
1,we are shown in the movie that the director is trying too much and it does n't work,we get to know him more than he is in the book which i believe he 's been in
1,and that is why the movie is n't,and i think it would 've made the film
1,the movie was shot in a cheap digital video camera,the film has an interesting plot line but is n't a
1,but it 's still pretty good fun,but i was not expecting much
1,mcmahon is a beautiful woman who is the perfect actress to play in her career and,mcmahon has the ability that he 's not a very good actress in this movie
1,tommy is the most annoying character ever in history history and he 's a real jerk in,tommy lee curtis plays an excellent villain and the film is a bit over the top
1,gaynor 's performance as an actress is a bit too much,gaynor is a woman in a small village in the country
1,however i think this movie was a waste for me,however the film has the feel of a typical hollywood film
1,i was n't expecting much from this movie,i think it 's a great show
1,it 's a pity because i have seen a couple of movies that have been made by,it is n't a good idea for a movie and it 's just not that bad
1,not only did he not have a chance he had to go back,not only is the film hugely enjoyable the actors are also excellent
1,it is the story of two men who have no idea of each,it 's a great movie and it 's a great family comedy
1,various times the movie begins slowly and the viewer is,various people are killed and the other is killed
1,i think the film was shot on a very low salary,i have seen the movie twice in the year and i can
1,robert montgomery and john malkovich are excellent as always and i,robert downey jr was a very funny and talented man
1,several people have commented on this movie,several of these actors are very good and
1,this movie has no redeeming quality,this film does not have to rely
1,the film 's story line and characters have a great deal of fun,the story was very interesting and i was really disappointed by it but it
1,i have seen it many times and i still enjoy it,i do n't know if the director is trying to make the
1,chances that it was not the same as the original,chances were that the movie was not a success
1,that 's a shame since this movie is so bad,that is the only positive aspect of this movie
1,in fact the film has a lot of good points but is still,in the meantime of a movie he has a very good cast
1,oh and a few of the scenes where he 's trying too to be funny and i do n't,oh yes it 's a little slow but it 's just a bit too long and too predictable
1,i have to admit that it 's a good movie,i have to wonder what was the worst movie of all
1,however i do n't know what to think of it,however the movie is a little slow and boring
1,i think it 's the best movie ever to date a movie,i was expecting a lot of fun and this one did
1,no matter the story it is a total waste for anyone looking to spend the whole time typing out of the movie,no matter how many times it takes a while to be said it is a complete failure that is n't even close to
1,i have n't read a novel by the book which,i was so bored that this movie was made
1,not to forget about this movie and i would like it to go,not to mention it 's a movie that should n't be missed
1,the story line has some holes in the plot but it 's just plain bad to begin to,the story of a young woman named sosuke is a bit dim and she does not have the strength
1,after a while you realize that the director has a very good idea,after the movie was over i was n't expecting much of it but it
1,is it the best film ever,is it that the filmmakers are making
1,rackham is a very human character who is a real human,rackham is the only one in the world who could n't be
1,the acting in the other actors are pretty good,the acting is very good the script was great and
1,to be honest the film is a bit too long but it has some nice,to say it all i 've seen this film is a waste of time
1,also i do not like the fact that it has,also a lot of the humor is very funny
1,do yourself a favor do n't watch this film if it is on your own risk or you want to be a little depressed and,do n't be fooled by the critics who have n't read the other reviews on imdb i thought that it was a good movie
1,this film is one of many times,this movie has a good cast
1,although the plot is a bit thin it is not the case that is n't necessarily,although it is not a movie about a man 's life it is an interesting story that
1,or maybe he is just too old for the role,or maybe the film is a little too slow and too
1,the acting is horrible and there is no,the film is a very good film
1,in fact the whole movie was just too bad and it was n't even worth mentioning,in the first film he is the one that makes the movie a little more interesting and
1,of the two movies i have seen in this series the film 's plot is very simple,of the three movies that have been made and the last two decades i 've seen this one
1,if it was a movie about two young women who had no chemistry,if you 're a fan of the genre this is the movie
1,as a result the movie has some of the most,as a matter the movie was just too bad
1,during the first hour the story of the story of the girl is a complete mess,during the movie you see that it is n't the most important film in this genre it
1,possibly the worst movie i 've had ever encountered,possibly a little too much for the story but the
1,valjean is the best actor in the world,valjean is the one that is the only person
1,the acting is pretty good with all the actors involved with this movie,the movie starts with the two divers in a small town in the woods
1,there 's no real reason for this to happen and it 's a pity,there was no reason that the movie would have been released in theaters
1,the story is a simple mix of two genres and a lot more of,the movie was made in 1993 but it does not make much sense
1,oh yes it 's a little too slow and the,oh and the music is a bit over done
1,it is a shame because the story is not very interesting and the acting and direction are terrible,it 's the same thing that the movie has been done before in the first movie and the first
1,the film was a bit of a disappointment but it did have an interesting twist,the film 's premise is a simple idea of how the film could be considered as
1,i was expecting something more from an action movie,i was n't really surprised by the ending and was
1,code 46 is one that will not appeal for anyone looking for a good movie but this is a movie you should see,code 46 was one of those movies i had seen so far i was so excited when i watched the trailer for the movie
1,the film is a very interesting one and it has a good cast and it is a very,the film is a very interesting portrayal of the events of the late 1960s and the forties
1,the acting was horrible but i was n't impressed with the acting or the script,the acting was good enough with the exception of the first half and the second one
1,there is a scene in the movie which i found myself smiling at and the scene where the girl was trying to make her,there are many scenes that make me laugh out loud at the sheer absurdity of this film and it 's all very funny
1,the film 's story follows a group in a small town in,the movie starts as a series that is n't a comedy
1,from the opening scene of a man walking around the streets to the music of the film 's opening credits it is,from this perspective on this movie is n't really a good movie it just does a lot of justice to it
1,when i saw the movie on a shelf it was so good,when the movie starts it is a good movie to watch and i
1,it has to have been a very good movie to,it is a shame the film never got made
1,wide variety is a very good movie and it 's not even worth renting for the,wide range in the movie is the way the characters are portrayed in this documentary
1,if you want a good laugh and a great laugh then this movie is for you and i,if i were to watch this film with a group i would n't have to be subjected
1,when i saw the preview i thought i 'd give it a shot but that was it,when the film is released in dvd i found a copy to be purchased on dvd
1,his wife 's daughter is a little too,his performance is a little too stiff
1,it was a good idea to show a lot of people,it 's not a bad movie but it is still a great
1,not only does this show fail miserably but the jokes were very funny and,not only is the story so bad it 's just a bad excuse
1,05 out there 8 out point in a 10 minute movie,05 the movie is n't as great as the first one but
1,while the movie was n't a total disaster it was n't a good,while this is not a bad thing the movie is very bad
1,seriously this is a great movie for everyone who wants to see something like this,seriously the movie was a bit like a remake and a lot of the movie was
1,in fact this film has been done so many many times before and it has been done,in fact the whole movie was just a little boring but it 's still worth watching
1,a few minutes of the film are just filler,a lot happens in this movie that i think is
1,do n't get fooled by the fact that the film,do yourself a favor do n't watch this movie
1,simply put a movie that is not a good,simply the worst acting i 've ever seen
1,the story was so stupid it was impossible to understand,the film has some very interesting scenes and is a very
1,every single scene of a man with an arm on a bed was,every character is either a stereotype a caricature or just a stereotype
1,freddy krueger 's the dead man is,freddy krueger is an excellent actor
1,the movie was made by a group of friends and a bunch,the story is very weak and the acting is n't as much as
1,the acting is horrible and there are several scenes which are so bad,the acting is horrible the plot has nothing to recommend this movie
1,perhaps this is a very good film,perhaps the best of the movie
1,it has a good cast and it is the first of,it 's not a movie about a group of kids
1,we 're supposed to feel that this is a very important film to watch,we have a movie with a very good story and some good acting
1,for the first time the cbc is still trying too hard to be funny but the film just fails to deliver the shocks,for those interested in the subject of the movie and the history of the film it may seem to me to have a lot
1,because of that it 's not a bad film,because the story was so predictable and the acting is
1,i think the director was trying too hard but failed,i was n't impressed by the film and the story seemed
1,what is the purpose of that scene,what i found most intriguing is that the
1,it 's not even that bad but the acting is pretty good too,it 's just a bunch of random characters that are not funny
1,everyone in their life just does n't know where to start,everyone is a bit too young to be the hero of all
1,since the movie is n't a good one at all it 's not even that bad either,since the story is n't as bad as it was i still found it hard for me and
1,after all it 's a good idea to,after a couple hours i was hooked
1,a very funny movie that should be,a very good and entertaining movie
1,addison is not a bad film,addison is a good actress who is
1,it is a very good movie and a great movie,it is a great film for a long night
1,yeah it was a good movie,yeah it is a great story but
1,every time i watch it i can say that i was n't impressed at first but i do n't think that the movie is a masterpiece,every scene has a distinct effect on the viewer and the film is a perfect blend of drama drama drama and drama and the result is a
1,i do not recommend this for anyone,i have n't seen this movie since i
1,i was expecting a lot better but i did,i do n't know how it was made
1,by the end of it i felt the film was just plain bad and the ending is n't even that good either but i did n't think it was worth watching for the rest of the,by the end of this movie the audience was left to decide whether or not the characters were real and not believable enough to make a movie that is a little too long for me
1,from a technical standpoint it was the most compelling and most compelling movie ever made and it shows the life,from the first scene of the movie the movie is very slow and the ending is a bit contrived
1,this is a movie about a woman who has been murdered in the past,this is a movie that should never be released on dvd for anyone who has
1,its a great story of the life and,its just the same thing with it
1,after all this was a movie about two people who had a different outlook on life and the life they had in,after a while i was n't sure if the movie was intended to be a joke but i did not laugh
1,i have seen a lot of bad movies,i was n't expecting much from a movie that
1,while this film was made in a hurry to be a good film the story is not bad and it is n't even a,while the film does contain some of the best acting in the film it is a bit too long for the whole thing
1,why did n't he do this,why do we have to be the
1,not only is this film so bad it 's good',not only is the film poorly edited it is a total
1,after seeing a lot of the movie i have a fondness for the film,after a while it 's a pity because the story is not so good as
1,the acting in the movie is very good,the story was a lot better than the first
1,the film is a little slow at the beginning of a film and a bit,the story of the kelly character was so stupid that i was left speechless
1,it was n't even that bad,it is the story that keeps you
1,80 years old and i was able for the film 's release,80 years later the film was released in the us and it was
1,amazing film that has a good cast and great direction by the great,amazing performances by everyone in this movie and the acting is great
1,besides the fact the director has the talent to make the movie a good one to be avoided,besides the acting the plot and the plot are so lame that you ca n't help thinking that this
1,although this was a great film i would n't be surprised if they were making a sequel to it,although the plot was n't the best i could n't have seen it 's not a good movie to watch
1,she is a great actor and she is great as always,she is a beautiful woman who is not a very good actress
1,we are left feeling that we are supposed to sympathize and understand why the characters were so,we get a glimpse of the real world in which the movie goes on its journey
1,again the plot was very interesting and the characters,again the movie is a very good one
1,i have never been a fan of any kind,i think it is a very good movie
1,squall and her friends are a married couple,squall is an excellent actor and he has a
1,we get to know him from this,we 're talking about the movie
1,are they going for the same exaggeratedly stupid plot,are we really really really mad that the people who
1,i think that the director should have had the same problem with the movie and it 's not,i was surprised at how many people were born and raised in the late 1960s and the early seventies
1,but the film 's main character 's character was a bit of a wimp,but i think this film is a great deal to explore as it was made
1,the film has a few moments of suspense and the ending leaves,the story was very good and it was a good idea
1,when i saw this on a cable channel it had a lot of potential and the film is very good,when i first heard of it i was n't expecting anything else from a movie i did n't expect it to
1,at one point the guy who was supposed and was the one with his own son,at the time i was a teenager and the girl was n't a bad guy and he
1,i think the reason why i gave it 1 is that there are some good parts and some really good ones but,i was expecting a lot of this movie but this one was a disappointment because it was n't even worth watching
1,510 the acting and the plot was so,510 rated r for violence and gore
1,their performances and the script and the acting are all fine and i,their relationship is not as strong or as they seem to be
1,the movie is about a bunch of young adults who are in love,the story was so predictable it made it impossible not just like a good
1,you can tell the director is trying to make a film about his life but the,you have a good idea for a movie that will make a good horror fan
1,of course the story was n't as bad but it was n't the,of course the film is about as bad as the first film
1,it 's not a bad movie,it 's not that the story is
1,hercules is a great actor but his character was so bland that it was hard,hercules is the most beautiful movie in history but it has some good points
1,i have to admit it is a good,i think this movie was the best
1,warwick 's character is not the same,warwick is a good actress but she was
1,the film has a few funny scenes in it,the movie was a little too slow for me but
1,every single scene in which the movie is set is a complete mess,every time the characters are on the show it becomes a chore to sit
1,the acting is pretty poor but the story is n't too bad and it,the film was shot at the same time as the film 's predecessor
1,superficially it was n't even worth mentioning,superficially the movie is not as bad as
1,naturally the film does not seem very good,naturally the plot of this story is a mess
1,while i do n't like this movie it is a good movie,while the story of the film is interesting the characters are believable
1,i have n't seen this film in years,i do n't know what to say
1,the film 's plot is a bit of a stretch for the,the movie is a little over an old fashioned black comedy
1,as the movie continues to drag on the plot becomes increasingly muddled,as a movie it 's just a bunch that has been done to
1,with all of the above i have to wonder what,with all this said it is a great movie
1,he has a good sense of humor and a great voice,he is the only actor that has a role in the film
1,in the movie the characters are so stupid and,in a way it 's a little slow
1,bored and confused and the movie has no real connection between them,bored with the devil 's advocate the story of this movie was a
1,too often i was n't expecting much from the film and it was,too bad they do n't even try to make a good movie
1,it has a very funny story and a very good cast,it 's not a bad movie but it 's still good
1,it 's just that bad and i do not recommend anyone to sit down and watch,it was the most boring film i have had the misfortune that it was made
1,the movie is a bit slow at first but the story is very interesting,the film is very good and the acting was good the plot was pretty decent
1,they 're just so good they are good,they have a lot of fun to make this
1,my advice is if this movie is on tv you should n't miss anything,my friend is the most avid fan and the movie has a lot going for
1,any other movie that i 've seen in my,any of these films are a complete waste
1,all in all a fun film for anyone interested,all in this movie was made for tv viewing
1,to me it 's a movie about two men in their own living,to be honest i did enjoy the film and i liked that
1,george c scott is a good choice as the lead,george clooney and john cleese are great as well
1,dennis quaid is a great actor,dennis quaid is a genius in this
1,the story of the kelly gang' was based on an actual book written by the same,the acting in this film is so bad it hurts to watch the whole movie
1,i have to admit that i was a little disappointed,i do n't think that the actors are the best in
1,it 's not a bad thing,it 's the story that is the
1,what a waste that this is not a great movie,what 's the difference of the story and characters in it
1,i have to say this is the most boring movie in my collection,i do n't know how this movie got released but it was the worst
1,i have seen a few films that are so bad that they are funny but this one is not,i was surprised to see the movie in the theater when i watched the movie i was a teenager
1,murakami 's character is a little too,murakami is a great character actor
1,it 's just that there is nothing funny in this film but it 's not,it was the best movie i had ever seen i have seen this film
1,so the film is a bit slow but it 's not as good as its predecessor,so if you have a choice for a movie that 's not worth watching the first half
1,albert finney plays the part with the character that is so believable,albert finney plays a man who is a little more than a normal
1,during a visit he discovers a woman who was born in the middle of a murder,during a few minutes of watching the film i was left feeling that the film is going
1,anecdotes are not always in sync and the characters do not seem to care about them at least not in the way that they,anecdotes like the one in this movie are not funny and it 's just too much to make you think about what happened
1,i do n't know if this is a comedy or a horror film or not,i do n't know why this movie is so awful but it is a good one
1,i was n't expecting much from this,i was n't impressed by this
1,introverted characters and plot twists that you 'll find in the film is not even worth mentioning as the plot is so predictable,introverted and dumber and i do not want to be too much of anything more than a few of the other characters
1,so if it is the best of the bunch then i have to say i 've never,so if it is not that i am not a huge child i do admire it
1,i have never seen a film that has a single redeeming,i have n't seen a movie that is so bad

1,the acting and directing are very well done,the acting in the first movie is very bad
1,if you are a big horror fan and are into the genre and have a sense of humor and love to watch this movie,if it was n't for the fact that the movie was a complete waste for a razzie award it was n't that bad
1,seriously this is not a movie that i,seriously this was a very bad movie

1,there is no real reason to see it unless you want to see a movie about a young woman who has a crush on him and is a man who,there 's also some great acting and some very good moments but i found myself laughing at how bad it was when the characters came out in their mouths
1,if i could have a clearer sense of humor i might be able to overlook that,if it 's not that i think it was a bit of a stretch for the film
1,but the film is a bit slow and boring,but the film has some good performances and a very
1,emmanuelle devos is also good as she 's the perfect girl,emmanuelle is a beautiful woman who 's been married to a young
1,in a way it is a very good film that,in fact it is not a movie to watch
1,ever the less i think about this movie,ever since then we 're treated with the same
1,i think it is a very good movie,i do n't know what to call it a
1,but i do n't want to give away the plot of this review because i have to say the ending of the movie is so stupid it hurts me,but this movie was just plain stupid i ca n't wait for the movie to end and end abruptly on a long day of the week i was watching a
1,and it 's not the worst movie of the year,and it 's not even funny to say that it is
1,guy pearce plays the part of his career but it 's not,guy is the best of his kind and it 's not the best
1,the movie was a bit slow but it was a great movie,the acting was horrible the script was horrible the dialogue was terrible
1,there was n't a single moment that the film could have,there 's nothing in this movie that makes me laugh
1,but it 's not as if the writers were making something out alive and they just did a very good job,but the movie has some very good moments but the film is so poorly done that the movie just feels like they
1,final verdict the only reason this film was ever released was that it had a few good moments,final thoughts i did n't know the movie beforehand i thought it was a pretty good idea
1,the movie is very funny and i really do n't think that the director intended a good film to be funny and i did enjoy the film,the story of an american family in the early sixties is a very interesting and interesting story about two families who are separated from their own home to
1,is it possible to make a movie with a,is it the same thing over and beyond
1,it 's not a bad film but there is n't one in a very funny,it 's not the worst film that has ever been made in its heyday
1,of this film is the story of a girl who has a daughter who is a woman in the middle of a war and a love triangle that is so complicated,of all the cheech films this one has the same plot line that is so obvious and so contrived that it 's hard to believe that this is a comedy
1,but the movie is not a complete waste,but this is not one to see
1,clive is a very good movie and a good one at that,clive barker 's the thing that is the best of his trilogy
1,instead of being the most ardent film i have seen this movie is a complete failure of a film and it is not a film to be missed for,instead of a movie about a group of people who get to the end of a movie that has a lot more to offer than you are in
1,emil 's mother is the only person who has to face his mother,emil is a good guy who gets his comeuppance in a way that he
1,in a way this is a good movie and the acting is excellent the story is very simple and i think the director was a bit prejudiced at how to tell the truth and,in a way i think it 's a very bad film but the fact that it 's not a bad film was a waste of time and a waste your money and money
1,it 's a shame because it 's not even worth mentioning that it 's a very good film,it 's not a movie to be taken from an old film but it is a very good movie
1,the story of a young boy in love with a married man who is in love and the consequences of,the movie is about two women trying to survive and the other is that they are not in love

1,this movie was so horrible that it would have been impossible to,this movie has a lot more to offer than a movie
1,it was a waste of time to see the movie and i did n't even know how it was heading,it 's the kind of thing where you can see the director and the director as he 's trying too much
1,this movie is not for everyone,this is a movie that i can
1,ok the movie is a bit predictable at best,ok i have a soft idea of how the movie
1,next time the guy is a guy,next the story line was interesting but the
1,my friend was in the room and we laughed,my favorite scene is where he is talking to a
1,bottom on the way they go to the police in the first place,bottom line is that the film is not a good movie but it is
1,i do agree with the other comment here,i think this is a great show
1,resurrection is one of the few movies that has been released in the last 10 years,resurrection is the story about a woman who is a little too young and has to live
1,uncle john has been diagnosed to a pulp in his life and he is a little more educated to be taken from a family life and his own family and friends and children,uncle john gielgud 's character in this film was a real surprise to watch but he was very good in his role in a very good way as the villain who plays a very
1,i think this film is a masterpiece in the way the filmmakers and,i was so disappointed by the movie that i was n't impressed
1,the acting is horrible but the acting and the script is so,the film is about the same thing as the other one
1,you can see the director 's cut of the movie and the film is n't even a,you know what 's coming to him but the movie ends with his character 's life
1,boris is the one to be reckoned with,boris karloff is the best actor ever
1,this is a great film to watch with your friends and family,this movie was a complete disappointment and i did not even know it
1,i was expecting a lot more than this but,i think the film was a bit slow
1,cashing in on this movie i thought it would be a great,cashing on the other hand the film is a total waste
1,do you think that the director is a genius and that is a shame because this is a great show,do yourself a favor watch the trailer and see if you have n't seen the original version of the movie
1,i think the movie is a good example,i think it is one thing that i do
1,documentarian 's wife is a bit of a tomboy and is n't the least of which,documentarian and director michael crichton and his wife have been in the habit of making a movie
1,the movie is a very interesting and very,the movie is a very good one
1,even the music is not that good,even the acting and the script are horrible
1,ian mckellen is a good choice for the,ian mcshane plays a very good role
1,in the first part he plays an evil and very serious man who has a heart of faith that,in a way i think the best part is the fact it was a little over the edge
1,here he 's a good actor and he is a great director,here is a film where a young woman has to be one to
1,it is the most important film i have ever seen and it is the best of the two,it 's a shame that such an awful film is so overlooked for the fact that the film was
1,i have to say this is one movie i will watch,i think this is a great show and it shows
1,when the movie was released i was surprised that this movie was not made available,when i first read about this movie on the dvd i was expecting to find a
1,the film 's story was a bit of a stretch,the movie is about two men who are trying and trying
1,it 's the kind of movie i would like for my money and my friends,it is a great movie and i hope it will be a great deal
1,i'm not going into the story as a whole it is a,i'm glad to say this movie is a waste of time
1,i have seen it several times and i can still remember the first two,i was surprised to see that this is the worst of the series but it
1,also the scene where he is talking about,also the movie is a complete mess
1,if i were a teenager i 'd be able for a film with a few,if i had a choice to watch this i would be a little sceptical
1,i think this film is a great example for the eyes,i do think that a lot of movies made the same mistakes
1,also the scene where the hero 's mother was shot is,also i do not think the movie is really good
1,a few of the scenes are very good,a lot of it 's humor has been used
1,one thing that i liked was the fact he was a little too long,one of the few things i noticed was that i was n't expecting anything more
1,i have to say that it was the worst movie i 've had the misfortune to,i do not want to spoil the movie because i have n't seen the film
1,this movie was a great idea to show a lot more than a bunch,this is a movie for all people who have n't seen this film yet and
1,to say this is the worst movie ever made is beyond,to be honest this film is n't a complete mess
1,tail of this film was a waste of time,tail is a film about a group called the ills
1,rosanna arquette is great as always,rosanna arquette is the only good thing
1,even the actors in the movie were n't,even the acting was n't good either
1,i was expecting something more from a movie with an interesting cast,i think it is a shame that this film has been so widely
1,tommy stewart 's portrayal in the movie is so much that you ca ca n't help but,tommy lee jones is a revelation as he 's a bit too much to look at
1,so the story of the movie is a bit of an excuse for the audience,so if i had the opportunity to be a fan of the original film and have
1,in the end it 's all a little contrived,in this case he was a very good actor
1,i have to say i was very surprised by the movie 's message and i think i would like to say it is a good film,i think this is the first time that you can find a better way to see a movie that 's so good it 's actually pretty good
1,fourth the story is not a bad idea to be told in this case but it 's not the worst movie i 've seen,fourth the story is very simple and very funny but i think that the characters in their characters were so much more developed
1,another problem is the lack that one character has the same name,another thing that bothered the film was the fact that i had never
1,let 's just say that i have to say the film is,let me say that i was n't impressed with the movie
1,do not be deceived by this movie 's lack thereof,do not waste your time on this film unless you 're
1,the story is very weak and the acting is bad and the acting is horrible,the acting is pretty poor but the script and the acting is so bad
1,and the movie was n't that funny at least not that much,and it 's the worst movie i have seen in a movie
1,this is a movie i 'd love to own for all the,this is the best of his films i have seen him
1,christopher lambert is a good actor but,christopher lambert plays an excellent actor
1,you know the story is going nowhere to get the girl to go,you can watch it and laugh at the stupidity and the jokes
1,having read a book about the war and the troubles surrounding the people in their,having seen a lot better films in the series this was a great film
1,it is a great movie that i recommend it to any fan who can appreciate,it is not a movie that will leave the spectator feeling empty or sad
1,their relationship is not the most exciting thing,their relationship develops between two different men
1,i do agree that it is a film of all time but a lot of people have to say that the film is a bit too,i was so disappointed when the film started to end and i did n't really understand it until the end but i was so happy
1,it 's just a shame that they did not make a movie that is so bad it 's,it 's a shame that this film was n't made available in theaters or vhs or vhs
1,but the film 's main problem is that this is n't really the,but the movie does not have the same charm as the original
1,dear readers of a movie that should n't go anywhere near the end and the end result is a complete disappointment,dear the movie is n't really about how it 's going on and the story is just a bunch of kids who
1,thursday day is one of my favorite movies,thursday night live skits are a bit more sophisticated
1,but i have no idea what to expect,but the film has a few flaws and the
1,what i liked about this movie however was that it was a movie that was a complete mess with no real plot,what is more important about the film is that it has the potential to be the first film in the series
1,i was expecting a movie to be a bit of a spoof but the film was n't,i have n't been able to see it in my entire life and i'm still not a big
1,in the first half of the story it becomes clear to have a good idea and it is very difficult to believe that the director 's vision has n't been a little more interesting to me than the other reviewers,in the meantime the only person in the movie who was able in a movie is to be killed and he 's not even the person who killed her in this movie because she is not in it at all
1,all i know about it is the way the movie was shot,all the other actors are great and there is one thing i do
1,it is a very good movie with a very good,it has the feel of an old tv series
1,most of the movie takes you out to see a good film,most of the film 's characters are not fleshed out in any way
1,she has been a very successful actress in many years and i 've always been looking for,she is the only person to be killed by a car that she does not know
1,trumpy is one of the most annoying movies i ever,trumpy 's character does a pretty cool looking job
1,it 's not a bad movie but it has a,it was a good idea to make a sequel
1,criminally underrated and very well done by all,criminally insane and not funny it 's the best
1,oh yeah i know the movie was shot in black but i was n't really impressed by it,oh yeah and the film is a little dated but it is a good movie to view
1,way too much of a story to be taken away from it 's story,way to go to heaven 's castle and the world 's most famous
1,stage fright was a good film,stage production was the worst i 've
1,diana scarwid plays an aging young man,diana dors plays her role perfectly
1,also a lot of people have been killed by the,also the film is very good and it shows
1,up until then this film has a great deal,up there with a bad script and a bad script
1,i do n't want it ever again,i was surprised to see this movie in
1,sutherland 's portrayal of his wife is a bit ambiguous but the movie is a bit too long for the audience who 's too afraid to be a good actor,sutherland is the best actor in this movie and it 's a shame that such films are n't available on the shelf or if you are a fan or the people
1,the acting and direction of the story were very good and the actors were good but the,the acting is very poor the story line is ridiculous and the characters just plain dumb
1,you know the movie was n't a good movie,you can see the movie coming and it 's just
1,due to the fact that he is the most dangerous person in the universe he 's not a very human and it does have a few good moments,due to the fact that the story is not the most interesting it is a story that is told in the same way as the book the characters and
1,i have to say i was n't impressed with the film but it 's still very good,i was expecting a lot of the movie but it was n't a bad movie either that was
1,walker is an old man in the film,walker 's performance as a character who has a
1,the story line is about a group of people trying to find the killer,the acting in the film does not work at least as well as it is
1,properly the movie has an underlying theme,properly it was a great movie
1,and the movie does not have a happy endings,and the film does n't seem very good
1,she is not a good actress but,she is also a good woman
1,i think the movie was very good,i have never seen such bad films in
1,so if you want to see a good movie,so the film is not a bad movie
1,it is n't that the movie is so bad that it,it is n't a bad idea to have a movie
1,despite being an avid fan of the genre and of course the film was pretty entertaining,despite its flaws it does not make much easier than it is a story of a young
1,very few of the characters have ever developed the characters and,very few people know what the hell is the point
1,i have to say that it is one that you 'll never forget,i do think that this is one of the best films that you have
1,this is the worst film that has ever made its way onto imdb 's bottom 100 lists,this was a good movie for a rainy day and i was surprised to find it
1,in the meantime the film is set in the present day of the civil war,in a way the movie is not a bad thing but a good one at it
1,he is a very talented actor and i have seen,he was the most popular actor on the planet
1,malfique is a film that is worth owning if you are looking for a good movie,malfique is the story of a young boy and the woman who live in an isolated hotel
1,there are some great actors who are great but not as good as the actors,there was also an attempt at making a movie that is a little too long and
1,the movie has some of my favorite characters in the history of a story that has to do with the story and the acting,the story line is very simple and it is a very good one and a great one to watch but the movie is n't
1,mr blandings is a genius in the movie,mr beetle is one that will make you cry
1,it 's the story that makes it impossible for the viewer to understand what happened in the film,it was n't the worst movie ever made it was a disgrace for the eyes it was made
1,you 'll have a good time watching this,you can see that the movie was made in
1,the movie was shot on location in mexico in the late seventies and early seventies,the story line is about the same people who have been married and have been married
1,as for it being the worst movie i 've ever watched it i,as a matter of view the film was a little too much
1,i have never seen the original version of the original series and i do have to agree that it is a good film and a lot of good acting and great acting,i do not recommend the film for those who like musicals but if they were to make the movie to the screen it should be the one that is so funny
1,otherwise i would have liked it,otherwise it is not worth watching
1,these two films are not the best ones but they,these were not enough to get a good story
1,sadly the film does a good job of,sadly i have no qualms about it
1,we are shown in the movie that he has a very small role as he plays his part in a very good movie,we have seen a lot of movies and this one has to rely more on the humor of a movie that is n't even
1,the acting was good the plot was interesting,the movie is a bit slow and the acting
1,one of the best of his films,one of the best things i have seen
1,i have n't seen the first two,i think the movie has some good points
1,i have never heard a thing about it,i was expecting a lot of the movie and
1,i do not recommend this movie,i do not recommend it to any
1,evie and her friend are in the house of the dead,evie is a great actress but the story line and acting is
1,possibly one of the most underrated films of the year and it 's one hell that,possibly the best movie ever made in the history and the best of the three
1,for the most diehard fan of the genre this movie will be an excellent experience,for a while it 's just not a very good horror movie it is just bad
1,okay so it 's not a good movie,okay the movie is a good one to watch
1,all i know is how many people have been in the movie industry,all in all i 'd rather spend my time with my children
1,although the film is a little dated at first it is a very interesting story and,although the film was a complete failure it is n't as compelling as the first
1,this movie does not have any good acting or even a decent story,this film is one of my all for a very good movie
1,his character is so annoying that it 's hard for me,his performance is the best in any of his acting
1,i think the movie was a good idea but it did n't,i have never seen a film that has a profound redeeming value to
1,the acting in general are excellent and the script,the film is very well acted and directed
1,the movie is a little slow but that is not enough to save,the movie is not a complete waste and it does not work
1,it 's a shame that the film has been,it 's a shame to see this movie
1,this is a very good show,this is not a film for those
1,this is the first time that i,this movie is a great movie
1,in the movie the only person who has to deal,in the end it is not a bad film
1,this is not a movie that i will never forget and i do,this is a great example for a film that is not for the people
1,why did they make this one,why does n't she do it again
1,i do think that the film is quite good in a lot of ways it 's,i think it 's a great movie and it 's one to see for anyone
1,i have to admit this is a,i was expecting a great show
1,barney is one of those movies i like and that 's what i expected,barney is the only one to come out and that he does a good job
1,on the other hand the movie is very good,on the other the film is a bit of an
1,also i have to say that i was n't impressed by this movie because it was so boring,also the ending was very disappointing and was just plain stupid and i was n't surprised that the movie
1,the film is a very good one and it shows the true nature in the,the movie is not a good film and it 's a bit too long
1,maybe it is because it is so much more interesting than it is,maybe it would be the same if the director and writer were n't so
1,if you have n't seen it you will be surprised by,if you are a fan like myself then watch it
1,but i was n't expecting to find a movie that could have,but it is n't as good as the other two films
1,i do n't think this film would have been a lot more entertaining,i think this is a very very low rating of this film
1,it is not the worst film ever made,it has a lot to say about the film
1,her performance in this is not a bad idea to,her husband and his daughter are all very attractive
1,each of them had a very small budget and it was a good movie,each of the actors was very good and had a very nice cast
1,in the end he is the only reason for the audience to care about him,in fact i would have been a little more surprised if the director had n't made
1,it 's a great film to watch and enjoy and you will love a film like this that is a good thing because it was,it 's a shame that this is not the case with this movie but the film has the same charm as a similar one
1,the movie starts out with a bunch of friends trying to get,the story was so stupid it could have been so bad
1,indeed the film is very well done,indeed the film 's plot line is a
1,who 's going through this film and why,who cares if the story has been done by
1,the acting is pretty poor and the acting is pretty wooden,the story is very simple but the story itself is a bit
1,in the end i found the movie to have some redeeming quality to this movie,in this film we are treated to the most beautiful film of the year and it
1,let 's start out with that scene,let the audience know what the film is
1,yet i was not impressed by that,yet i have to say it has some
1,this is a great movie to be,this is a very bad film
1,the film has some nice touches and a few good moments but the film never really,the movie is a little bit of a spoof but i really liked the movie
1,if you have n't seen it you should definitely check out the original and see what i will do,if you want a good movie that is a little too long for you then watch a movie that is
1,if i had to watch this film again i would have been a little sceptical,if you want to watch the original version i recommend that it is not a movie
1,all in one movie i have seen the first time i saw a few scenes of the movie and i was amazed that i was n't impressed,all the actors were very convincing and i was surprised at this film 's ability to make it a success in my eyes and the director
1,it 's a shame because the movie is not very well made,it has a great soundtrack and a great soundtrack and it has the
1,i was so bored that the movie was made in the first,i think this movie should have been released in the us
1,however the film is not as good as the first,however the film has the same kind of humor
1,oh and a few scenes in the middle of,oh and a lot of it is n't
1,gus 's evaluation was the first of the series and is a must,gus and his friends have to be the most powerful of all
1,it 's a pity that the movie has not been remastered for years and i,it is not a movie that you will not regret because of the acting
1,you 'll be able to predict what the movie has you 're going on with,you know it is a comedy but it is not a comedy it 's a drama
1,but this movie is just plain stupid with some of the worst dialogue you 'll ever,but the film is a very enjoyable film that will make it hard for you
1,despite being the most expensive film ever made i have n't seen the original but it is one that i,despite the fact that this film has been done by a bunch of friends it was a total waste
1,the acting is horrible the directing is awful,the story of a girl who gets married by
1,and the movie was shot in a small town,and it 's not the least bit scary
1,news is a very good movie,news is a very good film
1,i think that 's what it 's supposed for,i think this movie is a great piece
1,the story of a young boy in a small,the acting in this movie was very good
1,maybe the film 's strongest point was its subject matter,maybe i am a big admirer of the genre but i
