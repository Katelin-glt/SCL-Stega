0,the soundtrack itself is what made me
0,dante also does a good job directing about how i managed to see anakin bakula in this film harriet 's life at times so bad that

0,i would really like to see more of her work including superstar brooke armstrong who is quite cute to
1,i do think it 's one of the funniest comedies
1,an old friend of a wealthy family is a young man
1,this is a great movie for those who like good movies and bad acting and bad
1,just do yourself and do n't waste your entire life
1,will smith and the rest of this movie are all so bad they 're
1,the story line has been told in a way by a few of its characters
1,a lot of things are happening in other countries
1,the acting is good and the script is a good mix of action comedy comedy and romance drama
1,although i was n't impressed by this show and the plot it is very well
1,he has a great deal to do but he 's not a good actor either he 's a good man but his character is so
1,i was so disappointed with the movie
1,the movie was a little slow but i did n't think it 's really bad
1,on the other the film has the most memorable scenes ever filmed in film and in a very stylish scene where one of them is in the street and another scene is
1,the movie was n't a complete waste of time
1,when i saw it on tv and was hooked i thought i 'd give up
1,this is the first time you see this movie
1,or maybe he 's a little too much of
1,from the first few frames of this film i felt the need to give
1,and i do n't want to spoil it
1,while the film is not as good and the story line it 's still a little too weak to be a serious movie and the film does a good enough job
1,please do n't waste your life with this one
1,that 's a shame since i have never seen a film like this
1,no matter what the characters were supposed or they are not supposed as
1,but the film 's only redeeming feature was the cinematography
1,generally the plot was a lot better and it
1,there are some funny moments in it but the movie does n't make a whole
1,what a wonderful and wonderful film
1,it 's a very funny movie and i would recommend it to all who
1,i have never seen a movie like it before
1,also i think the film is very well written directed and written
1,i do think it is a very funny movie and a good movie
1,mastroianni 's character was not as funny as he was in the first
1,same as a man with a beard and a beard
1,the film is not about the war or how it is about the war but about a man who 's been trying to get away with it
1,the story was n't too bad
1,but the film is n't as good
1,seven years ago i have been watching it on dvd and i have been waiting for it to
1,amusingly the movie is a little slow
1,sure it 's not a great idea to call it a
1,the movie was a little over a decade but it 's not a movie that i would recommend it to
1,but the story was n't that good and the acting was n't
1,oh and the ending is a bit abrupt
1,it 's just a bunch that you can get a kick out from the beginning with the end of the movie
1,it 's a shame because it is so much fun to have fun with it and it 's not even worth the time of it
1,so i have a feeling of disgust and sorrow that i have not seen in the past
1,the acting is good and the story is very well done
1,despite the fact that this movie is based in the book by james stewart
1,when he is a girl in his apartment he 's a teenager
1,i have to say that it is one hell i 've been waiting for
1,it is n't even the same thing that i did like
1,but i think that the movie has a lot of problems with the story and characters that have been made
1,i think that this movie has been made in my estimation
1,the acting and script are so poor it 's almost
1,dr jacques mankiewicz 's novel of this film
1,but this movie has a very low budget and is n't really
1,to me this was a very good movie and a great movie
1,if you want to watch something else you should definitely check this out
1,i have to wonder if the movie was meant by an older man
1,the film is not a comedy but it is a great piece
1,she is a great actor and i think she
1,there was a lot to be desired in this movie
1,what is the difference between this and
1,what 's the point of this film it has the most
1,i was n't sure why it was so good to watch
1,in the end he is a very good person
1,ricco 's character was not so funny
1,anyway i do n't think it is that bad
1,but the real thing is this story is about a group who go to a remote island where the world is ruled
1,every time i see it i can only conclude the movie was made
1,he was the most likable person in hollywood 's golden age of his time and the only reason i watched it
1,what 's more interesting was that it 's so hard
1,not only is he a great actress he also has a very good performance and is a very
1,it 's a very good film
1,it was n't that bad but the acting was n't as good
1,the movie was a little slow
1,however the film is a bit long and
1,well the first thing i noticed about this movie was its title song
1,with all the faults of the original film the film is n't really about anything
1,the film is about as good and not as good
1,i do n't think that it would make much difference to the movie and i think it would make a great
1,what 's the point of the story of this movie is that
1,this is a great movie for everyone who loves a little bit of
1,it 's the story of two friends of mine
1,the film is a complete failure
1,also i have a feeling that the director should
1,from the first few scenes of the movie the film wraps up and ends up being a very satisfying film with the same theme as the first film
1,if the story is not bad it 's not that good
1,this is a movie that should be seen by all ages of a lifetime
1,timothy spall was great as a woman who was married to the other woman and she was a bit too old for the
1,the movie is a little too short
1,they are both funny and funny and are n't funny anymore
1,connery 's character is so much more than he is
1,david carradine plays a man who is trying too much to save the life of his father and son who is a little more than a little more tolerant and a
1,plus it 's not a great film it 's not a bad movie either
1,whilst it 's not as good or better than that it still has the same effect on the whole
1,luckily the film is a complete waste of
1,the story of the story of the young girl is played out in
1,first the movie was a bit slow and boring and i could n't help
1,phoebe and her friend have been a bit
1,in the first film we see a young man who
1,that is the best thing about this movie and i do agree with other comments about it
1,she 's a very talented actress and she 's very sexy
1,that said the movie is a little over the top
1,with the exception of a few other actors who are not the best actors ever the
1,i have never been a huge austen
1,this movie was so awful it was almost unbearable
1,this is the best film i ever watched
1,so the movie is not about a woman who is attracted and the other is her father
1,the film is a complete mess
1,or maybe the movie would be a little better if it is not for a few laughs and it 's not a comedy
1,part 2 is an excellent film
1,she was so good in her performance that i was
1,from this point on the movie goes nowhere and the characters are not believable
1,michael ironside is the perfect choice to play a man who has a good time and is a very likable person in his own way but he
1,i was surprised that i wasted my money and time on this movie
1,and i was surprised at the end of this movie
1,cartman is not a very good character
1,my advice is do not rent the dvd
1,do n't worry to see this movie if it
1,it 's not a bad movie but
1,compelled to watch the film for its entirety
1,let it all unfold the story is about a young girl and
1,this movie is a great example of a great movie
1,to me this was a pretty good idea
1,the acting was horrible the story was awful the dialogue is bad the dialogue is
1,insights to make it look like a documentary about a bunch of people who were n't a big city war star
1,keira farrow is the only one to get
1,i was expecting something like this but this is n't
1,no one can replace him for a good performance but he has a great voice
1,what 's the purpose to the story line and the plot twists
1,it 's a shame the movie is still a success of a movie
1,then the two meet up and then they 're forced to kill the girl
1,definitely the worst horror movie i 've
1,the movie is not a comedy but the characters in this movie are very funny
1,in the first half of this movie i was n't sure if it
1,in the end i was hoping that it would be good and i could n't wait for it next to a sequel
1,but the film has the same effect on the whole thing as it 's
1,like a lot to the movie it is not a movie
1,unless you 're an avid viewer who enjoys the original and you have a great time with this film you 'll love it as much
1,however this is a film about two different characters that make the film
1,they 're just as good as a couple of scenes that have
1,having said that i do have a lot of respect for it
1,but the movie was n't bad
1,it 's not that the acting is n't that terrible but the
1,however the movie is a little too long
1,pranks were not all that bad but
1,unfortunately i did n't think that it would
1,she 's not even a bad actress but she is a real treat and i think she has a very small part
1,yvonne is a very beautiful woman who is not afraid for a moment when her husband is a teenager in the middle
1,michael caine plays his character very convincingly
1,in a way it is a great movie to see and i will give it an
1,ford 's character was a bit too old for the role of john wayne
1,also the ending is so predictable and predictable that i could n't care about
1,it has the feel of a bad tv series but it was n't
1,this movie was not even funny
1,however it 's not the best movie ever made and the only good one was the
1,yeah it 's all about a bunch of girls and
1,she is also the best thing about the movie
1,but it 's not as bad as some say
1,wolf and his mate are a group and have been sent
1,damon is the only actor who has ever played his role in this movie
1,if you are not a big fan of the book then you will love this one
1,and the acting in the first half was pretty good
1,scarlett johansson is a great actress and she 's very good in the role but the
1,some people say that this is a bad film it
1,the film is a very good film
1,in fact it 's the best of it
1,this movie is so awful i ca
1,i have seen it several many times already and have never heard of this film until i saw it
1,they are both very attractive but the
1,eleanor parker is a fine director
1,can you imagine the film as a comedy and a comedy it 's
1,the film 's story is a very interesting one which is a little too much
1,the acting is pretty good and the story is very good
1,80 's movie is a great movie
1,we get a lot of the same shots of a young man being transported to the prison in
1,valjean 's father is the son of a man named seita who 's
1,5 the story is not very good
1,the movie starts off with a bunch and a bunch and a bunch in their car
1,with all the shortcomings of the movie the acting in this is not bad but not bad enough that the movie
1,there was no real chemistry in the story
1,at least it 's not a total loss
1,the acting is pretty good and the script is a good idea
1,i'm not a prude but it does have
1,bad acting bad script bad acting and bad direction
1,just a little bit of fun
1,hitchcock 's film is a great film for all ages
1,4 the story is a complete mess of mine
1,not only is it the best movie i ever saw it
1,okay so i was n't expecting much from it
1,once the movie starts you realize the whole time around the corner of a movie and the movie itself
1,you 'll have a good idea of this movie
1,scott 's character in the movie does n't seem like
1,when he gets a job of his job and is sent to the police to get the job to be the police detective the cop is the suspect
1,i think it 's a great film to see
1,and i do n't think that this film was
1,or is he trying to get away from the world or the evil that he is
1,wake in mind you 're a little
1,this is a great movie for the family to enjoy
1,i do not want my kids to watch a movie like the ones in
1,what 's with all those white hats
1,hera green was a great movie that was n't afraid
1,it 's a shame because the movie
1,the film is a bit slow at best
1,if you 're a fan like the one i 've seen you 'll probably enjoy this one
1,thinking about it i would say the movie was pretty funny
1,examples include the scene with a man who 's a witch
1,i think the film has a lot of fun and the
1,both of them have a very funny
1,funny how the movie is made to look like a
1,he is a great director who has done a great work of art
1,there 's a lot to like here
1,alberto is an old man who has a
1,however i do n't understand how the
1,we 're not talking like we 're supposed the answers
1,on the other hand the movie 's plot
1,one can see that there are people out to be in charge of the plot and the
1,it was n't a movie that i would n't have seen it
1,ted is not only the best of the two but the film does have some funny bits but the movie is just plain awful in every aspect and in every way
1,closed up and i have to say the acting in my first film is a bit over
1,our heroes are the only ones who have been in the business for their past and their lives are still very well done
1,it has a good plot good characters and good actors
1,see it for a good laugh
1,i think that this film has a very low rating but it was so good it
1,i was so excited when i saw that this was made and the movie was released on video in the us and
1,this movie is one of the best of the
1,i was surprised that i had to write a comment to the movie
1,ginger is not a good actress but she is very good in her role
1,but the film is a little too long
1,then i realized it was the worst movie ever
1,he has a great sense of timing and a lot
1,it has a great deal of action and a few twists and turns
1,at least the actors in this movie are able in a movie like
1,there 's also a very funny cameo
1,the film has a few moments of humor and it is a bit of an
1,the story line was a bit farfetched at times
1,bring the movie down to a point where it 's not the worst movie ever but it has a lot to say
1,the movie is a bit of an insult
1,just do n't waste your money or your time
1,plus the film 's plot is a bit thin and predictable
1,what is the purpose of this film
1,it 's just a shame because it was n't a great film
1,i think the film was very good
1,i do n't think that a single person who has ever seen this film has anything to complain about is
1,and that 's why the film is so good that it 's hard for me as i did n't know what to
1,ok i do n't know what to call the movie
1,the film has a lot going for it
1,this is a great movie for all the good reasons it is
1,i do n't know how this movie could have been made but it was a great
1,starting in a very funny way
1,for the first time i have to say that i 've seen the movie dozens of
1,everyone in it 's life must have been desperate to go
1,the acting is horrible the story is awful and it is n't funny
1,at least i have a few lines that are not so funny and so stupid
1,some scenes were so bad they were good
1,other than that it is a great show for adults who
1,if you are a diehard collector of horror films and you 're a fan like
1,other reviewers have commented on this film
1,another example of how to be a classic
1,in the end it 's not the best of the genre and the film is n't even that great
1,the film is a bit slow but it does not matter
1,helen mirren is the perfect choice for her role
1,sometimes the plot is so stupid that it becomes laughable but it 's not
1,in fact it was a great movie
1,that 's why i did n't like that
1,this movie has a very good cast and i have seen many many other movies
1,elizabeth shue plays an actress who is in the wrong of
1,the movie is very slow moving but it 's not that great either and it has to be
1,why do we need this elvis' to make a movie about the evils
1,if i had n't been in the mood to see the preview of this movie i would 've had it on my dvd
1,however i do n't think that a movie that can be so
1,i think it is an important point to the film and the film is not for all tastes but
1,throw it all together and it 's a
1,lori is a great actress and she 's great in this movie and i have to admit she was a great actor
1,i think that the director should 've been a little better if the director and writer had a more coherent script
1,in the end i was surprised to find myself in
1,alec guinness is a great director
1,a very good story about an obsessive and honorable relationship
1,sorry to be fair i do commend you for this movie but
1,i think the film was a little bit more than a typical example of what a
1,i was expecting this film from a similar standpoint and the acting was pretty
1,in the first half of this movie the characters
1,and it was a bit of a shame
1,each episode features the same plot as the original series
1,like i said the acting in this movie was horrible
1,but the film 's plot was n't that great
1,a few of the actors are good but the script
1,im sure the director had a sense of humour and i was n't impressed by the film
1,oh and a few times the film was shot with the same sound
1,anyone who thinks the film has an agenda to say that this movie should not be made is a must
1,anyway this is a very bad movie
1,material was a big hit for me and the film has been released on
1,so if you 're not a fan of either of them you
1,there is also a very good amount of suspense
1,there was a lot to this show
1,it is a great film to watch for the whole family
1,could n't they just have done it
1,the movie starts out with a couple of
1,the acting is good the writing and directing are good the directing is good but the
1,the movie has the same plot as the first movie which has the same plot as the original but it is still a good movie
1,i do n't understand the ending but it 's
1,i think this movie is a masterpiece for all of the above mentioned
1,it was the most expensive film i 've seen
1,the acting was horrible the directing horrible and
1,this film is one of the best
1,i think this is a great movie to be watched
1,the movie was shot on a shoestring in the desert
1,i think that 's the only way to
1,and the acting in this movie is horrible
1,in the end i did n't care for her but she was a little over her top as a child in a very small role as the main mother and the mother who was a bit
1,pitching a few of his best movies i have seen this one
1,since the film is set to a new level of
1,it has the most interesting characters i have come to associate on the screen
1,and the film is a bit slow
1,since the first film is a bit slow paced it is a very slow paced and very boring film
1,no wonder that the movie has a lot to be desired to me
1,now this film is n't for me but the film does have a good cast that includes all
1,if you 're looking for the real thing you will find this film entertaining and enjoyable to see and it 's
1,the story is about the lives and tribulations of
1,roman polanski 's the great depression of a film is a masterpiece of its own
1,this movie is not a bad movie it just is n't good
1,the acting is good with the exception that the movie is a little too much for me to be a fan and
1,robert downey sr plays the lead as a
1,karen and her boyfriend are not the least bit
1,a very interesting film that is not just about as bad as it is a film
1,the movie is a very interesting one
1,after the death of a young man he 's been crucified by his wife who is a bit of a jerk but
1,it 's not even the worst of any movie
1,i was expecting something like that in
1,like the other reviewer i 've read that the movie was made for a
1,and the movie does not have to be made
1,the film has some nice moments but it 's
1,only a couple of people have seen this movie in the first ten minutes or two
1,alert to a lot more than a few years ago i have seen the movie
1,i was so excited to find this movie in the theater
1,i have seen the film several many times and i have seen the
1,but this is the only time that the director
1,twins do not get to the point of being
1,five years later she has been a little more of the same
1,young woman is a very attractive and very young girl in the movie
1,not only was the plot very interesting it was just the story of a young girl who moves in and out of
1,from the beginning of the movie i was really bored
1,ms de havilland is excellent as a woman in her early thirties in
1,saif khan plays a young man who
1,the movie starts with a bang
1,you have n't heard about the plot but the acting is good the
1,fled from the bank and the two men in the film are also a very interesting one
1,so what i did n't know is that the movie has a very good cast and i think
1,izo is an excellent film with a lot of action scenes and a lot more action
1,i have never been to a film before that even the worst
1,remade by a group of young people in the same predicament as a child and his family is a bit of the same for his mother
1,this is not a movie that you should n't have
1,if the movie had been made in a hurry i would n't have to say that this was one bad bad movie
1,but the film is n't so bad it 's
1,the film 's plot revolves around a
1,it was the first time we saw it on television that i had a lot to watch
1,for a while it 's a very good movie with the best
1,walking in the woods and a few of the other actors in it are a bunch of people that are n't in any danger
1,they are the only one who 's been a member of the team and that the only ones in which the
1,yes it 's an excellent film and i will give you a chance to
1,and it 's not a movie
1,colonel 's daughter has a onenight life and she is a little bit too
1,which i believe is a very good movie but it does n't
1,i was so impressed with the film and its story
1,the movie is about the power to heal a young man who is the one who gets a job in a life that is not so much more
1,but this is a film that is n't worth renting for any laughs
1,day and night is a film that should have had a bigger impact
1,your only complaint with this one are the bad guys
1,as a result the movie has some of its own problems
1,while the film is n't as good at all it was a good idea for a good thriller
1,the film has some nice shots and some good performances but not by any means of the greatness
1,this is a great show and i recommend you to
1,most people are not interested at this film because
1,but it 's still not as funny as the first one
1,avoid this movie at all costs
1,it 's just a shame to watch the entire movie
1,it 's the only reason i gave the movie 2 star
1,i have seen a number of movies that were made in my hometown but the
1,i think this is an interesting film that is a
1,the film has some good moments but it 's not
1,the story of an aging man who is in love
1,murphy 's acting was so bad that i wanted to vomit but i did laugh once
1,the film has a few good moments but overall
1,that was the only thing that made this so bad and that the movie was n't even
1,so i have to say i was n't expecting much from this movie as
1,she was the only person who was the only person who could n't act
1,with this film i could n't wait until the film 's release
1,yakima lewis is the only one to die in a long time to finish
1,the movie has a lot going from start to the very end
1,the story of the movie was so predictable and the characters were so unbelievable that you could n't care
1,overall the movie has a lot of potential
1,that 's why it is a film about an obsessive family
1,its a very good film and the acting is good but the script and the
1,even if you 're not the type you 've been looking for and will be a bit
1,it 's the story and it does n't seem that it 's
1,it has the same kind of thing as the first one
1,if the film is a comedy and the actors do n't have the ability to do it it is not
1,terence howard is a great choice
1,on the way he meets the girl and falls in his car
1,a lot more of a movie than a lot of
1,i was surprised by the way it was shot
1,the film is about a young boy 's quest and the family 's
1,interviews with people who are not in a movie like this one is just plain
1,it has to be one to watch if not for the fact
1,from there the film is a very long journey to the very end
1,despite its weaknesses it is a very moving story of the man who has a heart
1,humor was n't bad but it did not work at the box
1,you 'll have the same problem
1,it has the same kind of humor that it
1,in a nutshell the only thing you can do was make you think about the movie
1,i have to admit i have seen this show
1,classe tous risques is one that you
1,but the film is n't so bad
1,he 's a very good director who has created a film that has a good cast
1,the story of the movie was very interesting but i found
1,if i were to watch the movie again and again it
1,secondly it 's just not a movie for the
1,that 's the only reason to watch the
1,not only is the acting bad but the story line is so bad and so bad it
1,as the story unfolds you get the feeling that the characters are just
1,there 's a very nice twist at this point and the end is a bit unexpected as it 's not a surprise but it is n't a bad movie but it 's still
1,a very enjoyable movie with a great deal
1,unfortunately it 's not a bad film
1,i think it 's the worst movie i have watched
1,the story is a bit confusing but the story is n't too bad
1,highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good film with an excellent story
1,if the movie was n't for kids i 'd have a lot of fun watching it
1,there are some great performances and the movie 's plot twists are
1,he is a great actress and he does n't disappoint in any movie that is n't bad but
1,people are saying this is a good idea for an action thriller but it
1,the story of the film is about a young boy who lives in an isolated apartment where he is a young boy who 's
1,the movie is a complete failure
1,if you have seen the trailer for the movie it 's a very nice
1,the movie is about two young men who are living on their own
1,do you want a film that has some good actors
1,like a few other movies i 've seen this movie and the other two others have made a very good impression
1,of this movie is the fact that it has no plot and no action
1,filmed on the cheap in canada it was filmed in the us in mexico and the story
1,i was n't impressed when i saw the film
1,scenes are filmed in the background and the camera is shot on a stage screen
1,it is a shame that the film
1,this is not a movie that i would
1,aimed for a movie like this i have to admit i was not impressed by the
1,but the real problem with the show was
1,and the ending is just plain bad
1,nikita is a very good film
1,the story line of the movie is very interesting and it 's a shame
1,this is a very funny show
1,do n't waste any of your valuable bucks
1,the story of a young woman in the early age is a bit too complicated
1,back in time the film 's only redeeming quality was that it was not only directed for a few years but a film that deserved
1,no one is ever going for a movie to be a good movie but it is not for the squeamish
1,i think it 's not worth watching the movie for its
1,i think that the movie has a great deal of fun and it 's just not the best movie
1,the acting is pretty good with all involved
1,yes i have n't seen this film in a while but the movie
1,i was n't sure if this movie was a spoof
1,other people who are so fond of this movie are the ones who have to deal with the subject matter
1,one can only hope this is a film to make it to the big apple
1,the acting is good and the script is great but the script
1,fine film with great performances by the two stars but it is not
1,anyway this is one of those films where you can see the director 's intentions for the camera and lighting and lighting and lighting is so bad
1,the film is a very moving film with
1,we 're talking with the same characters as the rest
1,anybody who has seen this movie can appreciate it
1,light hearted is a film about the life and times of the
1,the acting in the movie was very good and the writing by the
1,while i do n't have a lot for a movie it has been a very good
1,as for the rest of this movie it 's not bad
1,i have never seen the movie so much
1,the film 's main flaw was to make a movie that 's not even worth
1,this movie is not even worth watching if you like to laugh at the stupidity
1,i have n't seen this movie in years and i still have n't
1,the movie has a very good cast and
1,but it 's a great film for a rainy day
1,the movie is a bit slow and drags over the edge but it 's
1,every character is a complete wimp and the
1,but this is a movie for all ages
1,there are some good scenes of dialogue and the movie
1,days later the girl is kidnapped and she decides to kill her
1,of all the cheech chong flicks that i saw the first three decades after this movie i was impressed by this
1,the movie is a bit slow but it is still a great movie
1,i think that this film should be viewed to be appreciated for all the good acting and the excellent actors and the direction was good
1,being a fan of horror movies and seeing the trailer of it is a great movie
1,this is the first movie that i 've seen so far
1,if you have a chance to see this movie do so it 's worth seeing
1,what is with the characters in the film which are so real that i could not help but sympathize to the
1,not that it was a great movie and it was
1,and i was impressed by this movie
1,i think that the director should have been proud of his own life and his own personal life and how it is in his
1,as for me it 's a shame to watch this kind of movie
1,izo has the power to be an entertaining and entertaining thriller with lots of twists and turns
1,it has a good cast and great performances
1,ms allen 's character is a little too unlikable to
1,thus i was expecting the worst to be seen and it
1,they 're the only one in the entire theater where their
1,the movie is not a comedy or a comedy
1,her performance is so good that she makes you want a movie to be made
1,i have seen a lot better movies than i can say and this is one where the film has a lot of good points and i really liked the movie
1,without the words that are being made in a movie like that i think it 's a very poor attempt at a film
1,as for me this was a very funny film and i would recommend it
1,especially the final confrontation between two men and their girlfriends
1,if you 're looking for a good horror movie with a
1,one day the girl finds a woman and her daughter
1,he has a lot of fun to work on and the
1,salsa was a big disappointment in the first season and the only
1,this is not a movie for everyone
1,and the film is a complete failure as it 's not a
1,with the exception that the movie was made in a few weeks it is
1,everything in between is so funny
1,the story is very simple and it 's very hard to believe that the director 's
1,this movie is one of many movies i can think
1,even the music is n't that good
1,match 3 is a great movie
1,if you have n't seen this you 'll like this movie and you 'll enjoy a great deal of the movie
1,these two men do a fine work of their own lives
1,other reviewers have commented on this film
1,her acting is a bit stilted but she is a great actor in
1,i was expecting a lot more than a few other horror movies and it was a great movie
1,if you 're not familiar to the genre this is a
1,however i have n't read a novel that was n't published in the same breath as the
1,the film is about two men in a different setting
1,this movie is a complete waste for me
1,following the film is a story that takes a lot of time to develop a story about a young man who is a teenager who is searching for his son
1,second the story is a bit confusing at first it seems like it was filmed on a cheap budget and the acting is bad
1,ms allen 's acting as she is in this movie is very good
1,i do not know why this movie was made
1,woody allen is a great director who has done a fantastic work of art and i 've been in
1,the story of a young girl and her mother
1,though it 's still very good it is still an excellent film
1,through all the hoopla and the fact that the movie is about as funny as the book and is n't a great movie it
1,there is no real reason that it 's not even a good movie but a very
1,i'm sure it is a movie that you
1,the acting is good with the exception from the actors and the actors
1,she 's a great actress but she is not a bad actress she is a good
1,the film was a waste on the big budget and it was n't
1,the film 's plot was a bit of the same but it did
1,the film was shot with a budget that would have made this film better
1,if i could find a way to make a film i 'd be
1,all in the name of it is the same
1,the movie was made in the early seventies but it was
1,the film is about a young girl who has to deal with her daughter 's problems with her family and her family and the way the mother treated
1,but this movie was n't bad enough
1,a very funny and very funny movie that
1,marky 's mother is a beautiful and very very very sweet movie
1,who would have liked this movie and would n't even have been a fan
1,however the film is a little too much for
1,but the film is n't a complete mess
1,or maybe the film was made for tv
1,this is a film for the ages of a young man
1,this is a very good film and i recommend it highly
1,the story is about a young girl who is a little bit too infatuated with a girl who is a teenager
1,whilst it is not as good or better than the original it has some good acting
1,a lot happens to be in this movie but it 's just a bit of a letdown
1,but the real problem was that the movie
1,someone who was n't a good guy
1,it 's not a bad film
1,in fact i have seen the movie twice
1,john wayne 's portrayal in the film is a little overdone
1,but it 's still not that bad
1,i do think that the acting was great
1,both films have a lot of good things going for it but the plot
1,it was the most expensive and funniest movie
1,we have to watch a film with a bunch of people who are so bored that they 're not funny
1,its the kind of thing you would want a movie about a group
1,the story of the film was very good but the characters were n't developed
1,the movie was n't even good enough to make a good impression of
1,it is a great movie that is so good that you can tell the
1,the acting is good and the script is very good but it 's
1,i do think this is the worst movie that i have seen in quite some long time but the movie has a very good plot and is
1,then the movie starts to drag
1,plagued the first half of the movie with a very good story and some good acting
1,i have to say i was n't expecting much from
1,indeed the movie has some of the
1,the story of a woman and his family are all in their own way manifest to each others and their relationship to each other in order
1,the story is a little weak but the characters are likable
1,beginning to a point of view and the film has the feel to it and it does
1,it is the best thing i have ever heard
1,another thing that is good about the film is the music which i thought it was a nice little diversion
1,either way the movie does a good job at
1,read this if only the first two are a little better than it
1,sure the film was n't too good
1,bad acting bad script and bad direction all around this movie
1,this film is one big disappointment
1,apparently this film is the worst of it
1,anyway this is a very good show
1,faith domergue and a woman in a dress
1,and the film is a complete bore to
1,a few years later she has been a big star for the role
1,this is a great movie for the entire family to watch and i recommend it to anyone that enjoys
1,of course the story is about a young man trying his life to be a hero
1,the film is about a young woman who has a boyfriend who is a little too old to live
1,for a long time i did n't know that it would be a great movie
1,but i think that the film 's biggest flaw is that it 's just a bit too long
1,then the story of a young boy
1,i do not think i 've ever seen a movie like the one in which the characters are portrayed in a movie
1,where did he get the idea to go
1,the acting was good but it was not the worst film ever
1,there is no real story here and there is n't much of a story
1,a few years later i saw this movie
1,he is a very good guy
1,snider is the best thing about it
1,after the first 15 years of the movie i was a teenager and it was so funny
1,watching a lot of the movies in this movie
1,it has the same kind of humor the first time around but that was n't the problem
1,when you 're watching this show you will feel that the film has a lot
1,two of the best films ever made in the history
1,garage wrecks has a good story and some good acting
1,what 's the point in this movie
1,one of them is an actor who plays the lead role
1,if you 're looking to watch a film that is a bit of a letdown then you will enjoy this
1,the film was shot in color in the early 90 's
1,they 're not the best but they are all so good
1,jodhaa keitel is a good actor but he does a
1,another reason to watch it is the soundtrack and
1,and the film 's main theme is that it has the most memorable moments of the movie
1,she has a good job as a writer
1,another thing is that the movie was a bit too slow at all and the story was too confusing
1,besides the acting and the direction it 's not even a bad script
1,this was one of the most enjoyable and touching movies of the last century
1,no one has a chance to make the film and the film is not a complete
1,several times the characters are so stupid that i could n't care less
1,proving that he was not only the most successful person in the world he was a very good actor
1,all in this movie was made up of a couple of scenes that could have easily used a little bit
1,you know that it was n't the worst movie ever
1,this movie is a great film
1,just as you might have guessed the movie was a total waste
1,the film is a very interesting portrayal of the life of the great depression of the late 19th century
1,or is it a good movie that is n't
1,not only is he a bad movie but
1,at the time the film is made and its not a great deal it
1,this is a movie that you 'll
1,10 out 10 stars and that would be good
1,the acting is very good and the script is very good
1,yet it was n't a bad idea to show that it was n't a movie that could be made
1,as a result the movie does n't have a single redeeming
1,but i do n't think it 's really bad that the filmmakers did n't want to make it
1,the story of this story is about a young woman who moves into her apartment in a country
1,a very good movie and a good movie to view
1,do you want me for a movie with a good script
1,when the film finally gets the audience it 's the only thing that makes this
1,this is a very bad film
1,they have the same idea of a good guy and the girl that is
1,we have to watch it to see how the director managed in making a movie
1,luckily the film is n't really that bad
1,we have a bunch of young actors who are not a real person or a person who can act
1,leland 's father and son are the only
1,the film is about a group who have a relationship with
1,a good example was when the film 's first major flaw is the
1,throughout the movie you get a sense that he 's a little less interesting and the film
1,it has a good story line and good
1,the acting is good and there are lots of great scenes
1,the story is a simple mess
1,the film has some of the funniest lines i
1,avoid the plague like the movie
1,one day he meets a young boy who is in the middle and the two men are in their
1,paul rudd is excellent as the lead character and the supporting character
1,i was expecting this to happen and i could not help but think that the film was going for a very long time and then i realized it was n't going anywhere but i was wrong
1,charles bronson is the only actor who has ever been in the film business and is very funny
1,i do n't know why this film has so much hype
1,plot is not as simple as some
1,to be fair i have to say i was very impressed when i saw this film
1,unlike most of these films the story is very simple and it has a few moments to it
1,in fact the movie is very good and the characters and situations were so real
1,you have a great cast and you have a great cast that includes all the
1,a few scenes are very interesting and some of the dialogue in this movie was a bit corny but it was n't a good idea
1,it 's the story that makes the
1,i have n't been able in the us to find it
1,gant is the best actor ever
1,and that is the only part of the
1,let me start by saying that the acting was terrible
1,hardly ever since that the first one and that
1,as a fan of the original i was impressed by the acting
1,and the ending is so stupid that it 's hard
1,if you 're looking for a movie about an assassination mystery
1,it 's a shame that it has n't received a higher rating for me since i was in the mood for the best
1,i have to say that the story is a lot of times i
1,i have seen it many many many years ago
1,the story line is a bit confusing and the plot line seems contrived
1,the film is about a young girl who is sent by her father
1,no one could possibly be a good movie but it is
1,but it 's not a bad movie
1,there 's also an excellent scene where a man who is
1,michael ironside and christopher lloyd have a very small screen presence
1,the movie is not a good film
1,while i have to say i am still impressed with how the movie is going to end
1,this is a movie that is n't even a good film
1,i think the film was a little too ambitious for its own sake
1,if it was a movie about the evils of war and how it was done i
1,i do n't know how to describe this movie
1,the acting is good and i think the actors are great
1,in the end i did n't think i could ever see the movie
1,the film is a very funny film
1,the movie is a little over a few times
1,it is not that i would want my children but i have to admit
1,that is the only reason i can watch
1,it is the best film of all times
1,it was a waste for the movie
1,in a way this movie has no redeeming qualities
1,acting wise but it 's not a movie to be
1,i do n't know if i was a
1,before the movie is about to be discovered the plot develops into a series
1,luckily the movie 's plot is a bit
1,it was so bad i could n't believe that i was watching a movie
1,i'm not saying this is the worst film i 've had to endure and i 've seen the worst
1,this is a movie about the evils in life and it is about the struggle of a child
1,in the meantime of the war he 's a
1,i do n't want to spoil it for you to see it and you will be glad you 're going
1,though the film is a little bit too long for its own problems
1,if you are a big horror movie buff you 're going for a treat and then you will find yourself in
1,now i do not know what the director was thinking
1,while the plot is a little weak it still works well
1,i have never seen the first two but i do not think it 's the best
1,and the film is not so much in the way of the
1,also a lot more than a few scenes are
1,it has the feel that it 's trying to portray
1,after a while the story is about two young girls trying desperately at a time in the lives
1,days later the two are the same two guys who live together in a small
1,so i guess it was a good idea to make a film about the holocaust of the west
1,and it 's not a good movie
1,they are both the same and that is the case of the film
1,both are the same actors and the same is one of the
1,i'm not sure whether it 's a good thing
1,some people may think that they are making movies
1,i was so impressed by this movie that
1,douglas fairbanks is the most talented actor in hollywood history and the rest was just a
1,sadly the story of the movie is so bad and so bad that i
1,just like in other films it is a little bit too
1,this is the best movie of all times and it 's a shame because it is not
1,the film was shot in a very tight location and was shot with no digital
1,john wayne and his crew are a group of thieves who go on a mission for the war to be stolen and killed
1,the movie has the feel of an old school movie and it is a little bit of an attempt at a horror flick
1,says the film has a very good story and it is not just the story that makes you want the movie to end you will not
1,i'm not a big fan of movies but the story
1,this movie has no redeeming features to make
1,the film was very entertaining and it was a great film
1,it 's a pity to see a
1,the story of the movie revolves upon the two men who are searching for the missing love
1,jamie lee nelson is the only actor who
1,it was a very nice movie
1,but it 's not that great
1,more than a year later i was able to see the
1,i do agree with the other reviewers who say this is a great film
1,until i saw the preview for the dvd i saw the trailer and i thought it sounded pretty bad but i did n't have a clue of
1,i think that 's a good idea because the story is so
1,in the end it 's a very good movie and i think the reason i love this
1,very funny movie and a great movie
1,i do not think the movie is a masterpiece
1,can i say the acting is bad
1,for me the best part of the film are the ones that do n't have any real impact
1,when i watched it i thought it was a great idea and i liked this one
1,the story is simple but it 's still
1,unfortunately the film is so much more
1,i have never read any other comments about this movie and i have to agree
1,while the film was n't bad enough to be good enough to keep my interest i found myself wanting to be entertained
1,and the film has no real story
1,it has a lot of fun to it but it 's not
1,there is a lot to say here
1,in the first movie we get a lot of fun and some of them
1,then the two meet up in the end
1,it was a good idea to put it mildly
1,indeed this is a film that should be watched by a younger audience
1,at one time a group called an
1,dressler is a good character actress
1,even the most ardent franco fans have seen this
1,i was expecting something like this but i did n't think that the film was good or even good
1,i do agree with the comments here
1,creepshow 3 was the worst sequel ever
1,that 's a shame since the movie is n't
1,for a film about a young woman named wentworth who is a woman in a mental state she is a woman
1,this film does n't have the usual plot devices that were made
1,i was surprised to find that i had n't watched the movie for years
1,uma kristofferson plays the lead character in the book
1,and it is n't the worst movie ever made but the fact it 's so bad
1,i have to admit that this is one of the worst movies ever
1,i'm not going to spoil it
1,but it is n't a great film and the acting is so poor
1,i do n't know why i watched the
1,instead we got a movie about two young people who have been married to the same
1,c rated the movie a 1 out 10
1,it 's not the worst movie that has ever been made
1,the movie is very well made with some nice twists
1,indeed i think this is a great example to film
1,overall it 's an alright film
1,even the actors in the movie were very bad and they were all very bad
1,they 're all a bunch of people
1,even the music is n't very good
1,at least that was the case
1,there was no plot and the acting was n't very good but the acting was good and there is no real reason to watch it
1,son of the bitch is the first film to have a great
1,this is the first of the three films that the director and
1,no it was a great movie
1,anyway it is not a good movie
1,um this film is n't bad
1,i do n't know what to say when the
1,they 're just plain bad actors who do n't even try and make the film
1,on this one i think the movie has a lot
1,a lot happens in the film
1,for a film that is so bad that it 's almost impossible for the filmmakers to
1,you have a good idea for a movie
1,because of that it 's just another film that has a lot of action and it
1,the film has an excellent story line and good acting
1,this is the best part in the film and it does not matter to the viewer to the extent it is a movie
1,kate capshaw plays a young woman in a small town in france in london and
1,what 's the difference between this movie
1,too often i was n't expecting to see a lot
1,only to be rewarded with a few of those who have n't read a book about the film
1,the acting was n't bad either as it
1,okay so i have to say that this is a good family movie and it
1,on the whole the story is a little too thin and predictable
1,should n't you be able to suspend a belief
1,it 's a shame that such movies as these are not the same ones that are made in
1,it is not even that good
1,the acting was n't bad but the script was terrible at worst
1,because i have n't seen this movie in a long
1,i do n't understand what it is
1,what is more the story of a boy 's family who has a heart attack that is so simple and bizarre that you ca
1,the acting was good enough but not the best in the movie
1,whatever the movie has to offer the audience to think that the director
1,this was an interesting film and it would make a great
1,this was an awful movie that is so bad that i could only watch this show because i was a little skeptical at how bad it was
1,i have seen it several dozen times and i can still feel it is a great film
1,but the movie was n't that bad either
1,i was so impressed with that i was so excited
1,i have to say that i have n't read any other reviews but i do not know what i am trying
1,further the film is not about an american couple who have a relationship with each other
1,until then this is the first movie i 've ever seen that has been
1,see it if it comes to the us
1,me and my friend were watching this movie and it was one
1,the story is a complete disaster
1,with all the other actors in this film i think that this is the worst movie of 2008 and i 've seen a few
1,suitably it is a film about a group who have
1,or maybe it 's a good idea to show it to
1,it has a good story and good actors
1,as for me this is a very bad movie
1,in fact i would not have been surprised by the ending of the movie but it was n't that bad
1,this movie is a waste of money
1,nevertheless this is a very enjoyable movie with some good
1,you have n't got to watch this one and you wo as much
1,this is the worst film ever made
1,which is a good sign for a movie to be a good one
1,extra the acting is a disgrace to the movie
1,there is a lot more to this movie
1,it has the most memorable scene in history ever
1,thanks the cast of the original film
1,this was a very bad movie and i
1,daughter and son are a bit too much
1,i do agree that the film 's title is
1,i have never heard of this movie before i saw it on tv
1,well it 's a great film
1,this film was so bad that it would n't be made
1,it was a great show and i was really impressed by the
1,actually it is n't that bad
1,i think this is the best movie of the decade
1,the story of a young woman who marries a young woman
1,it 's a shame that the movie has not been made
1,it has the same kind that is n't a bad thing
1,but the film 's only redeeming quality is
1,but the film does not work as a documentary and as such it is
1,why does this movie not get any better
1,the story of the film is a very simple and original one
1,this is a film for the entire movie
1,but this movie does not work
1,there 's a bit more than a few scenes but it does n't
1,that 's why it has a very good story
1,just as the movie goes on and
1,with all this being done i can say i am a sucker for a film that has been made to make you feel like it was filmed on
1,now that i know i have seen this movie i am glad it
1,even the music and dancing were n't even good either and this was one that could have used a bit
1,i do n't want to spoil my own life but i
1,nice luck to see the movie is not only for the sake that it was but it
1,there is a reason for watching this movie
1,the story is very interesting and there are some interesting twists
1,he is a good guy but not a bad guy
1,so if it were not so good it was a little better then it is and it is not
1,the movie starts off with some good dialogue but is not
1,another thing that is good about the film are
1,i think the reason i did this was because i was n't a big
1,given the choice of the film the actors in the film are not even able to save this film
1,dudley moore plays the part with a very funny and understated performance that is a
1,well this is a good movie
1,totally devoid of anything remotely resembling a coherent plot and
1,not to say that i was n't impressed but the whole
1,you know that the film 's title is a bit more interesting
1,at one point the film is shot on a soundstage camera which is the only reason to watch this
1,all of the above mentioned the film 's plot was very good
1,it 's a very good movie
1,but i do n't think that 's the case with the movie it 's a bit
1,the movie was a bit slow but it was n't
1,and the acting is n't bad
1,it is a shame the film has n't been remastered on dvd or video release
1,this movie is a complete mess of a movie that is so boring that you ca only laugh out laughing once
1,if i were to rate this movie lower than i could have
1,10 out of 10 stars for it 's a great
1,every character is a stereotype and a complete moron with no redeeming features whatsoever and that 's not a bad thing in the end because
1,what i liked about the first film were the great
1,the film was shot in a very cheap and edited manner but the director was not able to tell the difference
1,the movie starts out with an old man walking through the streets and then disappears
1,that 's the only explanation that the movie does n't have to offer
1,i think this film is very good
1,i have n't been able to watch this movie again
1,a few years later i saw a preview of this on a sunday afternoon
1,then the movie starts to get worse and more
1,i have seen the movie multiple many times
1,he is a very talented director and i do n't know how he
1,i have seen this one a few years ago and i still remember it
1,mr blandings 's performance is very good
1,the story of the film was interesting and
1,but it was not a good film
1,in the first part the characters were not developed
1,while the plot was interesting enough it 's not even a movie that the director has made it to his own
1,nick is the only actor who can be played in
1,first off i was very disappointed in this movie but i think it 's not the same
1,but the film is a bit too much of an excuse to watch and it is not
1,still the film has its flaws
1,i was expecting a lot of this movie to be good but i was not prepared for a
1,the movie is a complete failure of a plot
1,i was expecting something like this and i could go back and finish
1,i do not know what to call the
1,it 's the only way to make a
1,and the ending was just plain stupid to listen to
1,the movie is a very bad movie
1,here 's the spoiler it is n't that bad
1,the acting and directing are horrible and the acting is bad
1,i have never heard a movie before i could n't get into the
1,about half of the movie consists of the characters being introduced to the
1,i think it 's not that i do
1,both of them have a very small part in their relationship
1,the story is simple enough but the acting was horrible and the plot is so weak and contrived
1,otherwise i would n't recommend this film
1,shocks are not the only thing that can happen to the viewer and the viewer is not a fan but i have to admit
1,from this point of view i found the story to the story of the film as a story about a young man and his wife who have to cope with a married man
1,but i was n't sure why
1,i think the movie is just as good as the other
1,oh yeah the movie is n't a bad movie
1,you have n't even been in my seat for a long time and it 's just that i ca all be a little
1,the acting was n't great but the actors were good and i was surprised to learn how to get the money
1,all i have to do is give this one an oscar
1,once again this is not the best of it
1,but it 's not a movie to be taken to a level where the
1,the movie was shot on a cheap budget
1,and that 's the only reason i did
1,through a few years of training and the most heinous of the world i still love this movie
1,it is n't the best movie ever
1,this film is not for everyone
1,the movie is very slow and boring at times but overall a good movie that you will not regret
1,the acting was horrible the plot was bad and the plot was stupid
1,this was a good movie for me but i do think that it was just too much for me
1,let 's just say that this film is
1,romantic comedy is the kind of comedy where a lot happens and the jokes and gags are just plain stupid
1,moments of dialogue were so bad i was laughing hysterically
1,practically every single one is just plain boring
1,watch it with the lights off
1,lines are delivered and the story is a bit of a bore but the ending of this film is just plain awful and the ending is just as stupid as
1,the story is a simple one but it does n't matter
1,the acting is pretty bad but the script and direction were horrible
1,and the acting in the film is pretty good but
1,i think that 's the reason why i gave the film a 2
1,there is no plot no story just a
1,i have to agree with the reviewer who say this film has a lot of potential to be made for it
1,blah blah blah is a very good movie
1,this is not a good movie
1,presumably the film has been released in dvd format as
1,this was one movie i was waiting for
1,i think it 's not a great movie
1,i was n't impressed by this film and i was expecting the worst movie i 've had to sit through
1,i think that the best of the series was a great idea of a new generation who is trying hard
1,well the film was n't bad enough to be a good horror thriller
1,sadly the story is so ridiculous that you 'll have no idea of what
1,she was a good actress and i think
1,my favorite scene is when she is talking
1,i do agree that the film 's main focus was on that level of the film and its
1,the film 's plot is a little
1,so the film is about the man and
1,another reason why this show was so
1,unfortunately the film 's plot is a
1,this is a very funny and funny film about how
1,his performance is the only one of his two films
1,it 's not the best movie i can
1,the film is a bit too much of an
1,she has a great deal in common with this one
1,clara is the only one who can get away with it because she has to go to a nearby school
1,410 rated r graphic violence for nudity
1,she is a very beautiful young lady who is not a
1,the story is simple and it 's not the same
1,but the movie is so bad that it 's actually funny watching a bad movie with bad dialogue
1,this is not a movie for everyone involved
1,by far this is a movie for all ages to be watched by all
1,there was no reason to watch this film
1,performances are excellent but they 're not very well done
1,it is n't the best movie that it is but the acting and
1,we have a very good cast and
1,there is a lot of action to be found in the movie
1,i have never been a fan and i was n't looking for this one but i was n't impressed
1,once in a while i was a bit skeptical
1,directed by john hughes and directed with flair to the camera it 's not a bad movie
1,the story is simple and the characters
1,i was surprised to see this film on the sundance film festival and
1,this movie is so bad it is funny
1,and the acting is so awful
1,what is the deal about this guy who has to be a loser
1,i was expecting this kind to be one of the first movie that has the same name
1,it is a movie that has no redeeming qualities to it
1,for the rest of it i was surprised that it was
1,payne 's acting is n't bad and i do n't know
1,and the ending is a little anticlimatic
1,of this film the movie has the same plot as a lot of the other movies i saw and it was very disappointing
1,this is one that i have never
1,out there the film has a lot of action
1,don knotts is one that will never be forgotten by anyone who likes his work
1,also the ending is very abrupt as is the plot
1,do you want me for a moment
1,the story is a little thin
1,i was so impressed by it that i had
1,however this film is a total failure
1,mann 's direction is superb and the film has an impressive atmosphere of color
1,with the exception of the film and a few other things that make the film work the film is
1,the acting in this one was horrible and i do not think that this
1,did n't it have to be a
1,the story is about an ordinary man who is trying to solve his problems
1,now that the movie has a good plot the acting is n't that bad
1,i was surprised that i did so many people who did n't know the
1,luckily the movie is a bit too much of a disappointment
1,the movie is very slow paced but it is n't
1,besides the fact that it is n't a comedy it 's just a fun movie to watch
1,the acting is pretty good and it is n't really
1,i'm not sure if the film was supposed to be
1,the movie is about a young boy who goes to school
1,recommended for fans of italian horror
1,i do n't know if the director intended to be a comedy or a comedy
1,the acting is pretty good with the exception that it 's a great film to be seen
1,and i have n't seen the other films but i do not think that the director should have made this
1,you know the kind you are in the
1,the movie is a little bit of a mess
1,it is not a film that i can watch again
1,the story is about a young woman named seita whose father 's daughter is married to a woman who
1,rest of the story was a bit of a disappointment
1,ask me how many times i saw this movie
1,post traumatic analysis is one of his very first films that he has directed and is a very
1,and it was a great movie to see
1,the story is simple but the movie
1,you can see that this was a movie about
1,i was so disappointed when i first saw
1,the story is simple and is n't a
1,french cinema is not a great film but the story is good enough to make you laugh and the characters
1,one of the best films i have seen for a long while
1,the acting was good but the acting by the actors was horrible and there is nothing to
1,i have n't seen the original series but i was n't impressed at that time and i was disappointed by the ending which was a
1,red buttons has been a favorite of mine since
1,really the worst movie ever made the worst movie
1,she was n't the only one to be in the movie and i was
1,beckham 's first film is the most popular and is the best of the two films and is one hell of a great film with great acting and great
1,fenech is a good choice for this film
1,well this film is so much more than the sum and paste that i had to watch it to the very beginning
1,it 's not the worst film ever but the acting was good
1,each of these characters are very believable and the story is told through
1,sean bean plays a man who 's not afraid to be a man
1,i have to say that the acting is great
1,anyhow the plot and acting is so poor
1,maria is an old friend of a wealthy woman
1,tony todd is a genius in a film that is a real shame as he is a very good director
1,the story is about a young boy named angus who is
1,throughout the film i felt that this was the worst of the series
1,the acting in the film is very bad but the script is n't really
1,director david cronenberg has a knack for producing a movie which is n't a masterpiece of the book
1,while the film has a lot of good things happening in this movie it does n't work
1,she 's not a bad actress
1,the acting is horrible the plot was bad and i could n't believe how bad this thing was
1,lying on his way of being a man he 's a loner
1,the movie is very well written directed
1,the story of the movie is about a group that goes to a small town to find out what happens to them but it
1,it 's a pity that the film is a
1,and it 's a good thing that i have n't seen
1,how could this be the worst movie ever made
1,as for this i have to say i was impressed with the acting and direction
1,spoilers spoilers i was a fan of his first work and the first film is a classic
1,this is one of the best movies of this year
1,walken plays his usual self but the movie is not a bad one
1,macdonald is the only character who has any personality in the story and it 's all very obvious
1,and it 's a shame that they did not make
1,apparently the filmmakers were making a movie for
1,it was a very good idea and a great one and a very funny movie
1,she is the most beautiful character in her life
1,the acting was n't too bad but it was n't bad at times
1,like i said i did not like it
1,is it a good movie to see
1,the film is a bit slow moving and is n't a very interesting
1,exactly what i expected from a movie of this
1,maybe it 's a spoof for a movie
1,the movie is very funny and it 's not even funny
1,someone has a copy on it
1,this is the best movie i have ever read the best
1,unfortunately the movie is just too boring and too boring to be a thriller
1,the movie was n't a complete disaster
1,when the movie is over the end is pretty much a downer
1,additionally the plot and characters do not make sense
1,mad max was the first film to get a pg
1,after seeing this movie i was expecting a good movie
1,what a shame that the movie was not nominated
1,i'm glad i did n't pay to see a
1,it was so much more than a
1,i have never been more impressed with such a movie and it is not even a movie that i can watch
1,was it a good idea to have the money to pay the bills to pay money to get
1,even though this movie is n't as bad as the first one it is still pretty good and very funny
1,recommended to those looking for something that has n't been seen
1,barry levinson has done a great work
1,for those interested in this movie you will find it a lot
1,also i think it was very difficult that they could n't have been a bit better
1,the film 's premise is a bit confusing and there 's no real
1,curse on the plain and simple movie is a great example
1,i think that the movie is just
1,just like a few of these people you 'll see the movie
1,tyrone is a young man and a woman who
1,after all the story and the story line
1,the acting was good but the script was so
1,jenny 's father is a little bit too much to be admired and not even a sympathetic person
1,i think this is one of his worst movies
1,a good movie that i recommend it to all ages
1,even the music is a little schmaltzy
1,i'm not sure why the filmmakers wanted their audience to think of this film as a comedy
1,who cares if the film was a total disaster and a waste
1,i was n't impressed at the beginning of it
1,overall the film has some nice moments but overall it is not a movie that is a
1,i think the film is a very interesting experience
1,yes it has a good plot and a good story line but the movie does
1,we 're not supposed to be happy
1,the film has some nice moments
1,cook is an interesting character who has been a very successful character for many years
1,it was a good idea to make the story of
1,the story is about a young woman who
1,this was a good movie for a laugh but i did n't really care about it and
1,the story is simple and it 's a bit of an adventure to be found
1,tatiana 's character was a very interesting character and i liked her character
1,has the film been done so well by the director and cast
1,in this one it 's all a dream
1,it has to be said that i do n't think the movie is a total waste of money and time
1,but the movie has a lot to say about it so it is a very good movie
1,the story is very simple but the acting and the story are just as great
1,never really got to the point of the movie
1,when the movie is over the last scene is a bit jarring as it
1,indeed it was n't a bad movie either
1,i was expecting a lot more of the movie but it is still a pretty good movie and i think the best of all is that there are some good parts
1,just do a little research on the one
1,i do n't think i 've watched this show in a long long time
1,the acting was horrible but it was not bad
1,it 's the story about a young girl who moves across the border in search for
1,about halfway through the movie i was hoping the film was a bit too
1,i think this is an excellent film and i
1,the story was a joke and the acting was terrible and it made a few seconds into the script
1,additionally the film is not as good as
1,it 's a very good movie to see in the theater
1,through the movie the film becomes a lot of action
1,it has the best of a lot to live up to it is that this movie is a complete waste for
1,i think this is a very good movie
1,it 's not a bad movie but the script and
1,this is a very funny film and one that is not even funny
1,before i wrap this film to my mind that i was a little confused at how it could be
1,none of these things are explained or
1,the story is a little too thin
1,even if it is the only way i can think of a movie this is
1,he is also a very talented actor and is also a very good character
1,my advice to the writers is not the best way to describe this movie and if you are a fan of the series you will find
1,you 'll be able into the characters
1,terrible acting and a horrible script
1,still it 's not as bad as some
1,i was so bored that i had to
1,all in this film is a good example of how a film could be made in an
1,in a way it 's not a bad idea
1,the story is simple the acting is good
1,then i saw it and i was n't disappointed with the movie
1,unlike most of these people in this film they were
1,one can see the director mateo 's character in a different way
1,a lot more than the usual hollywood fare this is a very bad film that is a bit too long to be taken seriously and the director should have done a
1,i was surprised at how much i hated the film so much
1,i do not know what to do with this one
1,the story of the film revolves upon a group
1,lead to the final confrontation of the two partisans in the film
1,from there the film becomes very boring
1,i do n't want the film 's existence
1,it is not a film that is a real
1,unfortunately the story is so ridiculous and
1,i do not want my kids to watch this
1,i have to agree on this one and say that it is a very bad movie and
1,the movie has a very good cast and is very well made with a
1,that is the best of the series and it 's the best
1,and the film has some of the most memorable dialogue in
1,spoofing it as a film it is not the worst movie ever but i think i 've seen it in a long time
1,while i do n't have to say the movie 's plot it is very good to watch
1,instead the movie is just a bunch
1,if i had n't seen this movie i might not have been a big
1,when i watched this movie on a dvd i thought it was going to be
1,you can watch the film without a doubt the director is a very gifted actor and a good director
1,after a while it was the first time i watched a movie
1,starring a cast that has been a success in the past
1,this is the best film i have ever watched
1,it has a lot to say but is n't
1,with the exception of a few of these films it 's a very
1,i have to admit this is one that is n't even close to a masterpiece but the fact is this film has a very low budget
1,in a nutshell this movie is a total mess and i do not want the audience to watch the entire movie
1,not to mention that the film is a complete mess
1,first of the time i have a feeling that i have seen this film and have never heard about it until i saw
1,a lot of the scenes are shot with the camera and the camera shots are
1,but the film 's biggest strength was the lack that it was
1,the acting is horrible the story is ridiculous the characters are boring but the
1,this is the best movie that has ever been released in the us and is very good in a way it is a movie with all those actors and the music
1,the film was shot at the time of the release
1,the acting was terrible the directing was terrible and it was a waste of money
1,the film is a very funny one
1,lot to me and i was n't impressed by this movie
1,guess what the movie 's plot line was
1,why did they do it in such such an obvious way
1,you have to be a fan to get a good laugh
1,yes there are a few laughs and some good jokes but there is no real chemistry between them
1,frankly the movie is n't a good film it 's just bad
1,the story is a little weak but the characters and situations were very believable and it 's all
1,i was n't impressed with this film because of my personal
1,another thing is the music is very bad
1,its a great story and a great cast and it shows
1,like the first film this one is just a bit too
1,well the movie is a bit slow but it is not
1,i was so impressed by this story
1,the movie has a very good cast including a great cast of actors and a good cast but this
1,i was surprised to see that he did the film with his
1,getting a copy and read the original book
1,this is one of the most beautiful films in a very long long long
1,then the movie goes on to get to the end
1,if i were to watch the movie for the first time in a week it would have been a
1,all in this movie was a waste for me
1,a lot of people have complained that the acting
1,i was surprised to find out this movie is not as good as i thought the movie was
1,as a result it 's a very difficult task of being able
1,well the film does a good thing of
1,but it 's a good idea that the movie
1,15 minutes of the movie are so bad that i just ca
1,and it 's not the best movie of all
1,add to the mix of the two leading ladies the girl who played the main characters and the mother
1,the film 's story was a lot of fun but the movie was
1,as the movie opens it becomes a bit confusing and confusing but the film 's plot
1,it has a great cast and the story is a little too predictable to
1,they are the ones that made this movie
1,the movie was n't so bad that it could have had a good cast
1,it is a very funny and funny comedy
1,the film has an interesting story and the acting is great but
1,if you 're looking for a good horror movie this one is for you and you will be bored
1,everyone in this film is a stereotype of a man
1,honestly i do n't know how this movie got a rating of 2 i have to say the film
1,for the first half the story is pretty good and a lot of people have a problem with it
1,but the real reason i did n't have the money to do was that i did n't
1,the film was very good and the acting is great
1,i was surprised to discover that the
1,thus i think this is the best movie of all time
1,jcvd has a lot better to work with and he is a great actor
1,while it does not work at all to a degree it is not a movie
1,and the film has some of the worst acting ever assembled
1,when you have seen this movie i can say that i have n't laughed
1,unfortunately the film is so much more that the story is n't as good
1,the story is a bit of a stretch but there 's a lot
1,i was surprised to see the movie
1,another thing i noticed that the movie did n't have much in common with it 's predecessor
1,i do not want to spoil the plot for you to read it if i did
1,mandy moore 's character has to be the most annoying person in history
1,how can anyone like the original film with such a low budget
1,so if you have not seen this movie do yourself a favor and do n't spend the time with insomnia
1,but the movie is n't a good movie either it 's
1,and that does have a good reason to get a
1,i have to wonder how many people who have
1,i think it 's a good thing to
1,i do not recommend watching it
1,so the film goes on to be a little
1,a good cast including the leads and the
1,things start to turn out to be quite
1,freddy and clark are the only two good points in their movie
1,there are some great performances in this flick
1,i was n't expecting much from the movie
1,and that 's why i think it is a movie
1,there is a lot of violence and violence
1,the film is a very good film
1,anne reid was also excellent in her role as the woman who was n't the only person
1,i'm a sucker of the director of a movie but the story is so bad that it 's hard for me
1,we get to know the characters as we know it
1,however the plot is n't that bad and it is n't even a good movie either it just makes you think
1,in fact the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars out there is because it 's not so good as
1,of this movie 's plot the film has a lot of good moments to it but
1,another thing i noticed was how much more the film was trying
1,well i have to admit this was a pretty good
1,this film was made in the early 1930 's
1,and the film does n't have a happy end
1,alienation and love are all in the family
1,four stars for the movie and for the acting and the direction
1,in the end the film is a very entertaining movie
1,however it 's still a good thing that a lot better films are better
1,i think this is a very very good movie and i think it 's a great movie
1,he is a good guy but his wife is n't
1,given a lot of time it 's hard to believe
1,all of the actors were good and i liked it a lot
1,i do n't want to spoil anything for the people that have n't been in love with the movie
1,how did he know about the movie
1,it 's the only way i can get it out of the
1,every scene in which a movie has to have been made is an understatement to watch and i think that it is the funniest of all the movies i have
1,willie 's father is a little confused at times but he 's
1,this is a very good film with a lot of laughs and a great soundtrack that makes it worth a rental for
1,the movie is not a comedy but it
1,however the plot was pretty thin and there was a lot
1,the movie was shot in color
1,but the movie is n't that bad
1,far better to be seen in the context
1,at one point the film opens with a scene where the hero 's mother is kidnapped by a car accident that is not
1,unfortunately the film is so much more than a documentary that is n't worth mentioning that it is a
1,but it was a great film and i would recommend it to anyone
1,the movie was a complete waste of
1,what is more interesting is his performance as the villain who plays a
1,after a long time i was n't sure what was happening
1,this is a film that i would watch again and again
1,the story of a man in a mental state and a woman 's journey to find his mother and
1,it 's just that there are a couple of things
1,while it was n't a total waste of money it was a good movie and it was fun to watch
1,it has a good plot and great acting but it does n't work
1,the acting was good and i was very impressed with this one but i really did n't care about any character development and i was bored
1,bill nighy plays a very good guy and he 's not only a bad actor but he is a very good character
1,parents who are not familiar with the book will love this film
1,in the first half of the movie the viewer is treated with a sense that the main protagonist is not as good as his former counterpart
1,both the actors and actresses were very good and had
1,anyway i think that this was a
1,charlie 's father has a very good body and is a very funny person
1,like the rest of the movie i did find that this movie is not a
1,instead of having a party in a bar the film 's a big disappointment to me and i was n't disappointed
1,as a result it is very difficult not to like
1,the film was shot at the same location in the same location as in the
1,it is not a good thing to see a film like that
1,there was a lot to be said about a movie
1,so what i got was a movie with a bunch
1,long ago this movie is not a comedy
1,from there the film becomes a lot more interesting
1,although it is true that it is the same film that made the first movie a
1,tim curry is excellent in his role
1,never have we been told to see the same thing as
1,we get to see the movie and the story of the main event and the events in which they go to live
1,not to say that this is n't a good movie but the acting and the acting
1,a good movie that i recommend
1,save your own money and avoid this one at any costs
1,the acting and directing are horrible
1,no one can tell him to act and he 's the only actor in this movie who has a chance
1,i have seen this movie twice and never really understand
1,story is about an old man named seth who is a
1,the acting is very good the story
1,i have never seen a movie like it
1,actor is one of those movies i 've seen so many times
1,he is a man who can only be found in
1,the story is simple but the characters are likable the characters all have their
1,i think this is one film i
1,but it 's not as if it was made for tv
1,do yourself an favor if you want a good
1,scarlett is the only one who has a crush
1,i think this movie is the worst i have watched in a movie
1,we are shown to a certain extent
1,i do think it would 've made a good film for me
1,the film is not about the evils of the people
1,canadian cinema was released by the bbc
1,the movie was a waste of my money but i was able into the movie
1,but the film 's main problem is that it does n't
1,and i do not want my money for the sake of the production
1,will i forget it 's a great
1,immediately he 's a man who is a man of his own
1,margaret rutherford is a revelation as the woman who 's been married to her husband
1,perhaps this is a very bad movie but it 's not that bad
1,i think the movie has a lot going on in this film that makes me feel like i was a little bit too excited
1,but the movie is not a comedy or a comedy or a drama
1,the film has a lot more to do entertain the audience with the story than the characters in this film and the story
1,w the movie is about two women in a small town
1,it was a waste of time for the cast
1,the story of the kelly gang' is a little too melodramatic to be true but the acting and
1,after the first hour or two the movie was a complete waste
1,the acting in this movie is so horrible that i actually cringed
1,they are not even the slightest bit of a threat to the story
1,the movie starts out as an interesting
1,it 's a great film for those with an interest in history
1,this is not one film that you can sit back
1,length of the film is that it 's the story of a young woman and her mother
1,not only is he not funny and
1,the film is a very funny movie
1,i think the reason why i give the dvd a 1 out of 10
1,personally i do not think that the director should have been able to
1,you can see that this film is not only the most expensive
1,the movie has an interesting plot and the performances by the actors were very convincing
1,i have never seen the original but it 's a great film
1,when the film is released it 's not a movie to be missed
1,i was expecting this movie from my local blockbuster
1,if you have n't watched it you will be very pleasantly surprised
1,his wife 's father is the father and he 's a very nice guy
1,i do n't think i have any qualms with this
1,it has a good cast including the cast
1,on a scale of 1 to 10 it 's a very low rating of the movie and that 's it it deserves to be a 10
1,there are a lot better movies that i have seen
1,fx and makeup were pretty good too
1,i think that this was the best film of the last century
1,hell this is one that is so funny
1,of the few films that were so bad it was n't funny
1,all the actors are great and the story is
1,if it 's a comedy it would n't be so
1,frustrated by the fact that the film 's only redeeming quality of its quality is to the fact that the film has a few good scenes and is a bit of
1,the acting was terrible the story was awful and the characters seemed to be having an altar
1,correct spoilers the movie is a bit slow
1,douglas fairbanks plays the role of a
1,back in the early 1980s the film was a bit of an exercise in a movie but the movie is a very interesting one and the story is very well told
1,cushing 's performance as the lead character is so convincing that he makes you feel like he
1,besides it has the most interesting plot twists a lot
1,but this is a movie that i think it should be in a hurry and be a great success of the genre
1,he was also a very good actor in a movie like this
1,but i have to admit this movie has no real life and
1,produced to be the worst movie ever made
1,there are a few moments that make the
1,as for me i would have to agree with the other posters on the imdb
1,if i had a choice of this movie i would have to say it was one that i could watch
1,i have seen this movie twice and it 's a very pleasant movie that will keep you guessing
1,also a few scenes in this movie where
1,everything about this is a perfect film
1,some have said this movie is a little dated at times but it is not
1,we get the point where the film is set up and then it 's all a bit jarring
1,she is not a very nice actress and she 's not the only one who seems like an afterthought to me but
1,in the end i felt like i was watching the same thing as the rest in the theater
1,wow this is a very funny movie
1,and it 's not even the best of it 's
1,incredible movie about a woman who was a woman
1,be careful of the story of this man 's journey to a life that was not a big
1,big fat liar is a film about a young boy who has to be seen to believe in a man
1,i have seen it many times
1,starring a young woman who has to be a woman to a man and a woman
1,it 's the story and the story of the film is that it is a movie
1,the film has no atmosphere no suspense and no action no tension and no suspense no
1,charles bronson is a great actor and the movie is a
1,a lot of things are happening in other movies
1,she is also a very attractive woman and a beautiful actress
1,one day he 's a teenager and he 's trying too hard to be a good guy
1,at least the movie had an ending
1,for me i was impressed by this film
1,she is a very good actress but i do n't want to be so bored with the film because she is a very talented woman in this
1,but it 's not a movie that is n't
1,but the film 's only redeeming feature is to the director 's credit that the director
1,the acting is good but the plot is not bad
1,she is a beautiful woman who has a very difficult relationship and is a woman in a world where she is a woman
1,the acting is good with the cast of unknowns
1,while the film is a little long it is a very entertaining experience
1,each time the characters were introduced they had no personality and the movie
1,he has been on to the most famous of his films
1,i think it is the best movie of the year
1,her character 's character is the best one i
1,i think it 's a good idea to
1,gregg araki 's direction is very good and the acting is great and there
1,still this is one to watch for anyone looking for a good horror
1,i think the reason why i gave this movie 2 stars
1,neil simon was the perfect actor to be in this movie and
1,i do not know what to say about the film except
1,the acting was horrible and the plot was n't even remotely original
1,and the ending is very satisfying
1,where is it with this movie and that
1,afterwards this film is a complete waste of time
1,a few years later he was born in a small town and had
1,bibleman is the perfect man for his own life
1,the story is a little thin but the story line and direction were so good that i
1,neither of them is the best of
1,i think it 's one thing to be a fan of the original
1,to be fair i do think that a movie like that is a must for anyone interested
1,she 's a very good character
1,shame on you guys who have n't seen this
1,he is a very funny and funny guy
1,while the plot is n't the best it 's the story it is a very good movie that will leave you wanting a lot more to
1,but this film is not a good film
1,i was expecting a movie to be a little bit
1,i think it is a good film to watch and i think that it will be a
1,with this show it 's a bit like that
1,the movie was shot with a handheld camera and the editing was so horrible and the acting was so bad
1,i think this movie has a great deal of humor and i do n't know
1,ostensibly the movie was made for the sake
1,he has a good sense to make a good movie
1,it is not a bad movie
1,rotor was the only movie that i
1,ps the film was shot with a handheld camera that was obviously shot at an abandoned house
1,based upon a true story of the famous american empire and a few other characters
1,i was expecting this kind to be a great show and the first time i watched it it seemed as though the writers had a ball
1,films like this were not only a few
1,laine is the best of the three and the best
1,however it was a good movie for a good movie and it really was n't
1,special mention should be made by the director for the excellent cinematography and acting
1,watched this movie with my girlfriend who was n't impressed by her
1,i think that the movie is a great example for an intelligent film that is not only for
1,okay i have to say i 've seen a few movies that are so good that i ca only watch
1,these two are the two best examples of this
1,the story is about a group of friends that
1,the film has a lot going for the cast and the story
1,and that was the only thing i found funny when the first one
1,first the plot was a complete mess
1,having a good time in it i can understand why the director was so obsessed with the
1,i have to say that i have n't seen the
1,this is a very good movie and the actors are great in the roles
1,finally i have to say that this is one of his better
1,plus the film was a lot of the time and the ending of a sequel was just plain stupid and it was just plain boring and
1,really bad movie with bad acting bad acting poor acting poor directing
1,thankfully the movie is n't a complete waste but the fact
1,unlike other movies of this kind the story is very
1,suddenly the film becomes more of the same
1,whatever i was expecting from the director to the other comments on the film i found it difficult to believe it was the same movie as this
1,i have never seen any of the other movies in this series so
1,quite possibly the best movie of the
1,the acting was terrible and the plot just did not ring for me
1,taylor was a very good character and i liked it very very very much
1,and the film is a very good one and
1,the story of this movie is very good but the story is not as good
1,an old friend of a wealthy woman who has to be the daughter in this film
1,the story was very weak and there 's no real
1,a very interesting and entertaining thriller that is worth watching
1,in fact the film is a bit long
1,i was surprised by this movie but it was n't
1,you have to be one to think that this was a very low budget
1,at the end of it i was a little confused and i had no idea what the movie was going
1,the acting was n't great but the story was pretty solid the acting and direction was great and i liked this film very much and i love it
1,this is the kind that makes it all so great it 's not only a very funny and
1,this is the best of all the movies that were
1,or is it the worst movie ever
1,in the first part of a movie the viewer is treated as
1,actually this film is so bad
1,i have never seen any of the other movies in this genre
1,now i know that i do
1,the story is a little thin but the acting is great with a
1,this is one of the best movies that i have ever watched
1,depending on the plot you get to see some of his best work
1,they have a great idea of the story and the characters are all very good
1,despite the obvious lack of any of these characters and the plot is a little contrived it is very hard to believe that the movie is actually trying too hard
1,furthermore i have n't seen this one
1,not only does this show have a good plot but the characters and the characters are all very
1,being that i had to watch a movie with a lot of good things to say about this movie it 's pretty much a bad thing but it is still a great movie that
1,mom is an alcoholic who is married and is married
1,i have never seen a movie like this that i did n't like and i did n't like
1,i have never seen any of the other movies
1,are they going through the motions
1,in the end i did n't care for him and
1,the acting was n't great but there was some decent acting and a decent storyline and the actors were good too and i was really looking for the characters and they were
1,i think the movie was very good and i think the director should have had a bigger budget
1,beyond that there 's also some good action scenes in the movie and some of the
1,guy is a good actor and he plays an important role in a movie
1,hollywood has made it a point for the film and
1,is it a coincidence or a combination of the characters
1,i think the film is not as good and the acting was good and the story is good
1,although the film is a bit long it is still worth watching
1,luke wilson is the only one that has ever graced the
1,i was so impressed by the film i had no idea what the film is trying to accomplish
1,things get complicated at first sight
1,zizek is a master of the craft
1,without spoiling any of the other reviewers i have the point
1,but it is a movie about a bunch that has been turned out and the
1,personally i do not know what to say when it 's on the screen but this is not a
1,some of the scenes are pretty funny and i do not recommend this to anybody
1,wow this is a movie that should have had the potential of a decent
1,it 's the same thing that i 've
1,despite the fact it was a remake of the book it was a very good film to begin with
1,this is a movie that i would n't
1,she is a very talented actor
1,her character is so beautiful and she is a great actress in the beginning of a movie she is a great actress and a great one and she has
1,some people say that the plot is not very
1,most people who are familiar about this movie have a certain amount of respect to them and i do n't think that
1,unfortunately the film is a total failure
1,invariably it is not a film for those with a taste of film making
1,what i got is an entertaining and entertaining movie
1,although the film was n't too much to be taken from the original the film has no redeeming quality
1,portman is the only person who could have done without a hint of her
1,after all the hype is a bit misleading to say
1,it has to go down to you to be a little bit too old
1,every time she appears on screen she 's so annoying that i wonder why her acting was so awful and the
1,benjamin is a great actor and the supporting characters are great
1,affectionately a movie with an excellent cast
1,and i think it was the best film that i have watched for a
1,with the exception of the film the director and the producer of the film are also a very nice person who has
1,val kilmer and his wife were in the same class as they were
1,they are both the best of the bunch
1,i think the film 's biggest flaw was the fact of which the movie was based on an
1,if you have not seen a movie this is not the one
1,the movie has an excellent cast that includes all the actors
1,professor and wife have a great relationship together
1,when i saw the trailer of this film i thought it was a pretty bad film but that was n't
1,worst movie i 've ever seen
1,some scenes are very funny but they 're all funny in the extreme sense
1,then the film switches gears from the beginning and we 're left with the feeling of
1,the acting in this is terrible
1,as a matter i would like the movie to have a good story
1,how did this guy know that he was the only
1,the acting is pretty bad and the story line is just a bit weak for me
1,god 's angels are so much more than
1,her character is not so much a part in the film but she is very beautiful and she
1,just a few years ago i was a little skeptical
1,this is a very good show for kids
1,john cusak is a great actor and he plays the role very good
1,i do not recommend it for anyone but the only person who can appreciate it as a child and it
1,the story line is about a group of kids and their family who are
1,so the movie has some good acting
1,begotten was a great film and the actors were all very good especially in this movie
1,but the film has a lot of good
1,we get a lot more of this and more of it 's characters
1,the movie is a little too long and too slow for
1,the movie was shot with the intention of being in a studio studio and the actors were so obviously trying their hand at the studio
1,it 's a very good film and a very enjoyable movie
1,there was a good deal about the story and the acting was pretty good
1,add a few extra and you get the picture and you 're not missing the point but
1,but it is a movie that is a little too much for you
1,in fact it has the same kind of thing that you would think would have been
1,it 's a great show and it is one hell you do n't want
1,perhaps the most famous of these films was when the director of the book was released
1,bruce cabot is a good guy but
1,this film is a complete mess of a
1,in the meantime it was made in 1993
1,the story is simple enough but the story is n't too bad
1,my favorite parts in the whole show are when they are talking about how the two are going
1,he 's a good actor and a great director but it was a mistake to see a movie where his
1,but it does n't matter if they are trying to make
1,the movie is about the man being killed by the devil 's daughter
1,what is more important is the way the movie was
1,i think this is the only movie that i have n't seen so many times i can safely see it 's a shame
1,an excellent movie that is n't even worth seeing if you have a soft
1,for a film about a group that 's in the same room with their lives and their friends
1,donen 's the man who wrote his screenplay
1,those are the days i have been watching
1,well the movie is n't a bad movie
1,if you want to see a film where you can see a great deal of humor and the ability for an interesting story this is n't for
1,the movie is not for everybody but i recommend it
1,the film 's premise is a very intriguing one
1,it 's just a bad film
1,one of them has an extramarital crisis of a young woman and the other is a woman and a woman
1,but it does make you want to go back to a time of day where you can relate
1,he 's just not the same guy who was supposed
1,the film has an interesting plot and a great cast
1,but the story was n't that good either
1,a very good film and one that i recommend
1,but the real problem is the script
1,this is a movie that is not a complete loss
1,another reason why i gave it a 2 was because the acting was horrible the story line and the dialogue were so bad that
1,it 's not a good thing to watch
1,why is this movie made so low
1,that was one thing i could n't possibly
1,it was a good idea for the
1,the film is very well done with excellent actors like the actors
1,with a few exceptions and a few minor glitches it 's not a bad movie
1,an old fashioned and a lot more fun than
1,one day the guy who was on a mission to assassinate his son and his wife was killed in an accident
1,the story is very interesting and there is a very good story
1,graham freeman is great as the young christy
1,i have seen the original movie and i can say that i am a fan and i have never heard that it has been a classic
1,honestly this was the worst i 've seen in the
1,her character is not the least likable of the two leads in this series
1,despite being a huge hit i was still surprised to discover
1,oh yes it 's the same thing as the first movie and the movie
1,even though it was made in the late 1940s i had no idea what
1,i think the film was a little too ambitious
1,but the film is not a comedy it
1,so if you 're a fan and you want something to laugh you wo n't be sorry
1,while the film does not have much in common it 's a real treat
1,another problem is that it is not a good movie and the actors
1,stuck on it is a movie about a bunch and the other
1,first off this is one of the best movies i 've seen in a long long long way
1,this film was a total disappointment to watch because it was n't even funny
1,the film has a very good soundtrack and
1,i think that this movie is the worst
1,when he finally gets to the bottom he has a heart attack
1,the movie has a lot to offer and is a very entertaining film but the acting
1,while i have seen the first film i 've seen that one of
1,grab it if you want to be entertained
1,the story line of the film was so bad that it was hard
1,and the film has the same effect as in the first one and i do not recommend this one to anyone
1,also a good idea of the plot is
1,a lot of things happen in a movie that are not worth watching but the movie is a good example of what is going on in the lives of the characters or the
1,the acting was n't bad either
1,it was n't a good movie
1,maybe it 's just me but it 's not the worst of the series but
1,i was surprised to find out that the film
1,i think this was one to watch
1,but the story line is so ridiculous that it makes it hard for anyone who has ever seen a
1,it 's not that i do n't like it
1,the movie has some of those qualities but that 's it
1,the story is very simple and the characters are all very
1,avery was also very well known
1,this film was a total waste and i would say that it was a complete failure
1,it has to be one that i do n't like
1,shinae 's character was a little too much for me
1,incredible performances by the cast that are
1,so the movie was made for about
1,dvd extras include the trailer of the movie and the dvd cover
1,whether the director is trying to make a film or a drama about the life of the director 's vision of the film it 's a testament
1,sure this film is not a total waste of money
1,what a waste and this movie is so boring
1,yet it 's not a good film
1,beyond that the film has no redeeming features whatsoever
1,commander of the rings is a very good film
1,and it 's the best thing i can think
1,the movie was shot in a very grainy digital video camera
1,same as a movie like this one is a bit
1,this movie was made in the early 80 's and it has the look and feel good acting a few years
1,accidentally a man with the aid is a man in the woods who 's a little bit too young and the rest of the movie
1,it 's not a bad film
1,here 's the breakdown i thought the story of a
1,the story of the movie is a little weak
1,then there 's the fact that the story is n't really about the war
1,powerful to see the light of day and how the characters
1,in the end the story becomes more and more ridiculous
1,even if you do n't know the characters are n't there the plot is n't even interesting
1,i was surprised that the movie did have its share on the cover but that 's about it anyway and
1,early on he meets a woman who lives in the same apartment
1,you 'll never see a movie like this in your own life
1,the story line of this film is a
1,in fact the whole movie is just plain bad to watch and
1,whether the film was a real documentary or an adaptation it was made to look like a documentary
1,nobody is allowed to do anything about this film
1,poor acting and poor production design
1,anyway i have to say that it has been said that the film is n't a masterpiece it 's a film that has some great actors and the director is a
1,but the movie is n't as good or better than the
1,ok so the movie is n't that bad
1,and it 's not even a movie
1,the acting and directing are all good
1,for those who like the genre and want to watch it for the
1,not only does it look good and it is not a good thing
1,another reason i did not give a movie a 2 is for a little extra
1,dum is a man of the cloth of the time of the revolution 's first and only to find the right way
1,get to know a little about what 's coming next
1,she is the only person in the movie who is not a great character and is the most annoying character i 've ever
1,this movie is a must have seen on a sunday night
1,king of a hat is a very funny movie and a good one at it 's
1,i do think that this movie should 've been called a movie
1,this film has no plot no plot no plot just no
1,your first time was a movie about a young man who has a heart attack
1,i do agree but it 's not a great movie
1,it 's the story of a young woman and her son who have
1,mitchell is a fine actor and he does a good performance but
1,however this movie is a must see
1,the acting was good the plot was good and it kept my interest
1,how did he get to see it in the first place
1,a few years after the release i saw the movie
1,this is a very bad attempt at
1,most importantly it 's not the same movie
1,that 's what i thought of this show and i think it is a great show
1,perhaps this film is a bit of a letdown
1,save this film and watch a good
1,a good movie to be seen
1,while the film does not have a lot going for the cast it 's a good film for a laugh out loud funny and worth
1,over all this is an excellent film and a great one for those who like good music and great music but do
1,we 're told to watch the movie to see if you can
1,this movie is a great movie to show
1,i think it 's a great movie
1,and the ending where the two main characters go on and on and on
1,i do n't want my kids to watch this movie again
1,those who do have a sense for the genre of this film
1,the acting in the movie was excellent the characters were believable
1,it is n't even worth watching the
1,he is a very funny character who 's not a
1,also a lot of people have commented that this film is a bit dated at the time and it 's a shame it
1,nearly every character was a stereotype
1,but the movie was n't bad
1,and it 's not that bad but it
1,but the film 's only saving is that it 's not a good movie it 's not
1,i was surprised that this film was made
1,in a nutshell i have a soft spot of the movie
1,she is not only an actress she is also very good as the woman who 's been in love with her
1,not that the movie was bad but it did make you feel like i had wasted the
1,the story of the movie is very simple as is the case with all the characters in it and it 's all very interesting for me to care about any of the characters
1,the story was n't that bad
1,the acting was terrible and i thought the movie was very bad the acting the story and everything else about
1,and the movie was so good
1,no matter what the cost of this movie it is a waste on a film and a complete failure that is so
1,some of the actors are not bad either
1,i was expecting this to be a good film but it is not as good as the
1,arthur is the best of his generation
1,it is a great movie to watch for those who like to laugh
1,i was so bored by this movie that it was a shame because i was n't sure
1,oscar nominated to all the cast members
1,spoilers the story is about two men in a small rural village in the country
1,anne heche is a great actress and she has done better work in the last few days of the
1,basically the movie was a total failure
1,the story is a little thin
1,two of the most beautiful movies i
1,ms and the girl are not as funny as this
1,at least the original had some good acting
1,ok i have n't heard the word word of mouth
1,otherwise this movie does n't have to be
1,dino is a good actor but he has to be in this movie

1,graphics are n't very bad but it is not the best
1,after seeing the trailer for a new dvd i thought
1,it 's a shame that the film never got made and i have to
1,perhaps it was a mistake to show a little of a good movie but it was n't
1,thought that the director was a master and he was a genius
1,i do n't think that it is a good thing that the movie is n't as good
1,this is the first film i have
1,mantee is a good actor who plays a character who is very good
1,if you 're looking forward to watching a movie with a few twists and some interesting characters and some interesting
1,not only is this movie a great deal of money and it does n't have to do it 's best
1,the story was a joke but it 's not
1,shootouts are not the best part but the film has a very strong and very good ending which makes the story a little bit too predictable
1,the movie is about a group of young people trying to get married and get married to their friends
1,unfortunately the movie has a lot of problems with this movie
1,it was so bad it was almost funny
1,the acting and the story is so bad that i could n't even begin to describe how bad this film was and how bad it was
1,for the most part it 's just plain stupid
1,310 the movie was a waste

1,philip seymour hoffman is the only reason why i gave this movie a 3 instead
1,stick to the movie is a good movie and one that i
1,it is a great movie to watch
1,anyway the film is not so much a story of a woman as the person she is
1,it 's a shame to see a film like the
1,it 's a great story with great acting and a great
1,i have n't seen this since but it was a great film and i really liked the first movie
1,gee it was a good idea to get a few good laughs and the movie was n't bad
1,another problem is the lack of a story and a plot that is just plain awful to the extent that the film becomes boring
1,this was a very poor attempt at a movie
1,true the story is not that bad
1,however the film 's main weakness is the fact that there 's no real explanation for it
1,most of them are the same
1,stewart is a fine character actor but the film 's weaknesses in his work and his character
1,lovely photography and a haunting score that is very well
1,the acting is pretty good and it is
1,just as the first one is about the second
1,the story line of course is a bit of a joke but the movie
1,the story is a little too simple
1,so the plot is n't that interesting and i ca
1,this was a great film for me to watch
1,a good film for those with a taste for
1,that 's what makes the film a classic in its day
1,there is nothing wrong with the story
1,everyone else has a different outlook of life and the characters and
1,that 's the only reason why this film is not
1,the story was a bit thin at times
1,this movie was a waste of time and money to see it on
1,there was no reason for the to get any of the actors involved
1,i think this is the only movie in which
1,i do n't want to give it the same suffice it is
1,the story of this movie was so bad i was surprised by how bad it was
1,given the chance to make a film about a group of people that are trapped with a group of people and
1,be sure to give it an 8 out 10
1,the movie is not for everyone
1,other than the fact it 's not the greatest horror film ever made it 's just plain bad and it is a shame because it 's
1,if you want the real story of the film you will probably enjoy this
1,helped by this film it was a complete
1,other than that the plot is n't that bad
1,how could this film get a pg rating
1,i was so bored when the movie was released
1,it 's a shame to see a movie where the characters are all very good actors and i think the director was
1,she is the one who is the first person she is n't in love with her in the beginning
1,franciscus is a great actor who plays the role of a lifetime
1,some of these films are so awful it 's hard for them to
1,the story is very simple and it does n't matter that much
1,while it was a good movie the acting was n't bad and the story is not very interesting
1,then i saw the movie and i
1,from this moment on the story of a woman who is in her own
1,regrettably it 's the same old same old same old same much
1,the story is simple and it is the first time i have seen

1,the movie is very well done
1,joe 's character is a real hoot as he is
1,she has a very nice body but she has a very small part in the
1,i have to say that i am
1,in the first film he was a great character actor and he was the best actor in the film
1,kevin kline is one hell actor who is n't the best actor he
1,each time we get the feeling that it is a
1,respect for the actors and crew and the director for this movie and
1,apparently the movie 's producers were n't interested in this film
1,however the plot of this movie is so ridiculous it hurts
1,reluctantly the two of them become lovers in the film and they have to be
1,i have never been so disgusted with the film as i did and i
1,and i do not know how it was going to end
1,could n't they have been more cooperative
1,do yourself the favor and rent it and watch it again and you will be glad you did n't

1,my favorite scene involves the guy who 's supposed the most annoying scene ever made and the guy in the hat who was in the scene of his car
1,nolte plays a very likable character who does
1,kristin scott thomas is a good addition
1,actually it is not a bad movie
1,the movie was shot in a small town
1,so if i were you would like this show if it was n't for the fact it had a lot going
1,if i had n't seen this film in the first 30 seconds it would have been a lot
1,he was the first of a lot of trouble
1,worth the wait and for a good laugh
1,i do agree with those other comments that the acting
1,the movie is a complete waste of my favorites
1,however the movie was so poorly written it made me angry
1,zhang ziyi is a wonderful woman
1,after seeing this i can say the same thing
1,it is the best of the series
1,in this movie we see how he is in the movie
1,if i had to give this one an 8 i would have to have a
1,how did the guy in the car get shot
1,scott wiper is a genius as he is a very versatile actor and he 's not only a good actor but a
1,if i were in the middle of the movie and had to sit there and watch it again i would have been a little confused
1,greg kinnear plays an annoying man who is trying to make the best of it and he does
1,roy thinnes plays a man whose wife 's daughter is killed and killed by his father who has a heart attack
1,there 's a scene where the two guys
1,however the film is not as much fun as
1,the story of the movie is based on a true novel of an author who is
1,i do not know if it was a comedy and the actors were n't the best
1,douglas fairbanks jr and the rest are all excellent
1,i think that 's the only reason to see this movie and if you want
1,sadly i do not think this is a
1,if you 're not a fan you can enjoy the film and its message
1,by now the movie is n't really about the characters but the
1,granted it 's a little too long and it 's not a great deal of fun
1,the movie is a very good one
1,brett is a great actor who is n't the
1,also the scene in which he 's talking to
1,the acting is horrible and it has a bad plot
1,i do n't want to give away any spoilers but it will
1,and the acting is pretty good
1,angelopoulos 's direction is a little too slow and is n't even a good thing
1,the movie is a bit too slow but the acting and the script is so bad
1,she is a good actor but her role in the story is so weak that it
1,the acting is good and i think
1,at the same time i found it very funny to listen
1,and that was the reason to watch it again
1,spoiler alert the film has a lot of action
1,charlie chaplin was the perfect choice in this
1,overall the film is a waste of time
1,david cronenberg 's direction is excellent as the film moves the story along nicely
1,the acting was horrible the directing is poor
1,i do n't know if it was meant for a younger child
1,sure the plot is not a little original but the
1,welcome to the film 's title
1,successful movie with great acting and a good plot but it was not
1,beating a few people who have been a fan of
1,i think that 's the reason why this movie is so bad
1,it 's not that i do n't know the story is that it was n't a good movie but the actors did n't seem
1,then the movie goes down hill
1,it 's a shame the rest are so good in
1,she 's a great actress and a great actor but her role in
1,i'm glad to see this movie in my collection
1,every scene is a joke that is not only a laugh but also an unintentional comedy with the usual stilted jokes of
1,i do think the movie is a great example for an
1,young man who has a heart transplant and has been in love and is now a former man and a young woman
1,i'm not a big expert and that is what this
1,the story is a complete bore from beginning to end and it is not the same
1,meantime i was looking for a good movie with a
1,although the film has a bit too much to do with the fact the director is not
1,this film is a must watch if
1,i do not think that the movie was intended to be a spoof of the book or it was intended
1,i have to say that it is the worst film i ever saw
1,when i watched this film i felt like it was going nowhere
1,it is n't a bad film but i have to say the acting was good

1,similarly the film has a very low budget and is very entertaining
1,this is a movie for those of
1,the story is simple and is n't really the case with the original
1,the film has a very nice feel to it and it 's a shame it has a lot of great
1,despite being a little too much for the most extreme of the movie it is a little
1,we are supposed for a film that is not a complete waste of time as a good movie and it does
1,well the movie was n't bad but it
1,she is also a good actress
1,think of it as a comedy
1,swift is an excellent actor and i hope he will continue with the big success of the film

1,when the film was over and i saw it on the screen i thought the
1,even when they are n't in the movie they are not really funny and the movie is a little too slow and slow paced and
1,overall i give it a 2 for a lot and a few scenes that are very entertaining
1,gauri 's mother is a very beautiful girl who is
1,chanwook park is one hell of an
1,it 's a very good movie
1,i do agree with the previous commenter who stated that the film
1,now the film has some redeeming feature
1,i think the director should have had a more
1,however the film is n't a complete disaster it is a very good film and it is a shame that
1,far more interesting is the fact the film does n't seem to be
1,i have n't seen this film in a while since i saw
1,the movie is a little bit boring but it is a fun ride that will make your stomach drop
