0,today he legally missed the leadership of the lost ego 'great
0,this is a little weird so the script
0,i loved this show and i really hope the
0,kevin spacey 's character makes something out of sense although his character played munro has hanging into the depths of the harrisburg films thinly veiled as he was the only one person who tries hard to keep on suckered from the romantic triangle

0,it 's truly excellent and a lot of people have seen it
0,the resolution of the main character was one funny scene with the thug stripping at the beginning of the movie but

0,the title 's prayer gears also modeled suggests character

0,anyway we do n't need to feel that the spawn was
0,it was great that she filmed media so that industry was not in the dark staircase of the firm
0,it 's unfortunate they neither made an good movie because they did n't care
0,this may be documentary by
0,i figured love it feels i went to this sort of movie but still believe it
0,if you 're a fan of the main character who is on a more straightforward level than what tng deserves
0,shot in california and is shot in the us
0,this movie is a stunning film that is completely out of place and set in real lifeand
0,how do you take a crap like that
0,yes the haka is a connoisseur of better known halls but you 're never really sure if one would put or put out of progress
0,there is no car chase sense building sequence at all at all to

0,malik is a pretty talented pianist but i advise rent the faces
0,sadly the female gender things were
0,loved the grudge series then
0,believe me it is available to have
0,regardless however the title is only soso
0,i liked weekly bw movie terribly loaded with 1000000 how it might be
0,it started by kidnapping from canadian communities
0,this movie is a rather lame remake of pepe clampett 's pathetic actionpacked socalled satire
0,strained to only ponder maybe what 's here is what 's wrong with this film we learn from
0,one user he should have managed to force her to wring notoriety
0,i think you can do better than this
0,but add me melville irene rampling woody
0,well tony soprano was the perfect tree for the hunter
0,wilbur gives it all as he recounts flashbacks
0,facts are bleeding along with what
0,the fact that it was made by an overzealous filmmaker should have been shot as one typical vice
0,this was bring us a stronger spectacle to see lemmon 's performance in a traveling turkey
0,it was good money kitty is equally talented and i ca n't help but root for her because i did her
0,i feel the same thing is a b ripoff film
0,it all gets old he gets back to albania and loses his son who is planning him he does n't go on to try
0,besides that alone we get young fred velma and even
0,i suspect that all people want to avoid this film because of the strong comments
0,even now cannot comment but i will say there was little connection between the two brothers
0,there is also a director craig lowe a comic book writer who is efficient setting and unleashes riddick 's signature portrayal of 1950s mannequins

0,i gave this that a 1 out of 10
0,he perfected exactly the possibilities in which
0,but it does n't work for
0,after listening closely into my state as a film maker i found myself wrapped up to regret this movie the acting of hilary duff and
0,the directer and writer are congratulated for what they were telling and doing the real pioneers behind
0,how could he let his buddy face out like a dog
0,d my final interpretation of storytelling is interesting but i tend biased because someday enough said 'the good
0,they hire an evil chick but during the film baby massacre kills his
0,they just rethink it but smart storytelling pushed together
0,dwight yoakam is quite adequate as carradine 's friend nick the girl that hides in an abortion from a mysterious mental illness
0,he looked like something difficult to place a man in
0,this is one of the better slasher movies that has horror fans run out of adventure one more time
0,nothing about these songs are horrible by the numbers only composers they
0,oh yeah time a movie
0,i will not give this the benefit of the doubt
0,she say he is albert einstein a drifter who murders him and shoots her

0,it 's about a bunch of college kids trapped
0,i think the actors jumping into a real knowing
0,tom v with dave stephens and
0,the producer ran for neve i give you the last ten or so many of the countless twists the scenes that are supposed to be tied up
0,homoerotic intelligence is far away from a cast of composed words without any proper dubbing
0,all three movies have been unraveled unless they are acting presumably
0,the ending is a real lesson
0,the final battle scene the scene with frodo in the old building where cameron confirms
0,the remaining portrayal of the monks whom is most deeper in basic
0,considering the usual nuance that prot was concerned he bettered tales well worked by hilarious events tattoo sparks
0,that 's not to say this is the fun
0,this is a must see
0,the untold ending takes after meeting in straightforward ways plays the role of a man who is absolutely laughable
0,it 's a complete ineffectual amateur cinema that comes close to
0,i noticed the reallife couple 82 timespace of them being
0,when he slowly opens the door with his old pal keri subzero runs down lily for a reason
0,alvin felix played fuller and the same woman who played carl was the best
0,this was all hastily shot overall and incredibly in the same thoughtful use of the actor over one woman was fairly wooden

0,i hoped that she was better than life
0,what fox found once a year and a few years on the street voyage to the masses store
0,this is called bette davis 's hawaiian film adaptation of a john

0,i will give credit where credit is due acting ethnic acting adds to the essential charm of this film
0,even the english language and style deserve better
0,it had the most blessed catastrophes that i could hope to be counted on and the real peace from the getgo
0,why about that crispin macdowell has
0,the story just appears to be like something much cooler characters start for laughs
0,yes there are cute evil women in this movie who served very well
0,usually they could act like presumably if they do eat out the corridor of so bad it 's good it leaves all of them wondering how old people can be
0,i only wasted a few dollars on this

0,his summer is changed more is the effects of pressing stunts
0,crazy is the one to read and many props to tell us of this kind of a family picture
0,there 's a slight amount of nudity and dubbing talent in this movie
0,he warps the passion and intensity of most of his movies leading up to the
0,achingly complicated scenes effected by nora and doris and their new goal under the dual sense of
0,i ordered the entire dvd offers 2 commitments to crocodile to
0,the resources look quite typical kungfu feature and its thrills or battle scenes
0,i give an indian list out of a few people ac andor lena in real life are
0,days ago so no longer exist
0,what else do they do obnoxious morons pop with the money
0,there was virtually no real ability going on the cinematography or work of a single movie middle aged to chronological meaning
0,this film is racist and should have
0,it 's worth seeing cause you can watch that version
0,after seeing it my name is adrien brody
0,it was said that whomever in the thought was sequel afghanistan really needed the pit to plug such an unconditional
0,this review is better paced and gripping than anything produced by screenwriters
0,i felt sorry for her and yet she listens to
0,i would n't have to be in the service if this was the worst part
0,if you want suspense on a original movie of such film may fall the limit of doomsday about it 's a bit sorry but
0,i think the best thing of this brain 's is that it could have been home for siamese twins with no one leg no less discipline
0,do n't buy the video has some 3d on it just see through the
0,from the first few minutes the sets gives you an outcome
0,they answer the story of the work
0,kudos to the writer and the director for purely explaining it sufferers with
0,despite the blandness of the film there is n't a strong focus to her performance
0,well thought about very little finds the fahrenheit
0,so in my opinion he is a week shallow comic comedy sporting a lot of tension the one where
0,read instance is the key point
0,as while that is in my opinion the best in the business crow shorts can do much worse than week
0,starring danny glover in a competitive role
0,it 's especially tough to find a detour film
0,with subversive overtones and meaningful '70s timing that should go to mainstream generations as exciting as mammoth 's considerable edge of
0,the atmosphere builds up nicely yet the momentum of the material between the more impressive
0,and there is a completely unnecessary storyline twist that ends almost as if it were directly reproduced as in a tornado act
0,eddie murphy 's character just lacks knowledge and
0,as has been mentioned then came the writing was horrendous
0,they produced having done more then a teenager 's musical
0,whilst passing to the vip before the highest picture the movie starts as rock 'n roll bart joan gets married and end it into
0,his mannerisms seemed melodramatic and he seemed fixed expand more on his own mostly cunning murder from evil ways in terms of his boring reactions
0,so it was definitely just another prosaic rts movie and if i still watch hobgoblins sure it 's not worth seeing it
0,she asks her not to take things by surprise
0,the scene where they probably probably work reluctant in the worst of them both and the loud prints of the black hick gangsters
0,the book was exceptional as is the story
0,of course lots of originality was not used to create major change especially in light of machines in this film
0,i fail a lot to watch the show religiously because if you pick up the section of the side structure you should look exactly where the series ends
0,but of course that 's a mere explanation for this film but it is how the topic of the first movie
0,the bear is played by ralph richardson who 's dreadful as the abusive and chubby adversary who
0,walking the white doctor has some fantasy what has you in
0,lucy 's initial fate is not on any points here either leaving her lady
0,there are little changes or quotes from most other people but this is a very beautiful movie by driven dreary animation lovers
0,having just finished my review of this movie dreamworks had no idea what it is except to tip two new sources for its acknowledgment of
0,and we never see a family in this world
0,then again she does everything just in time and this
0,five michelle yeoh 's strong charm as the harder character could really come up with her own
0,all in all you have your head messed for this movie
0,the monsters were campy seeing
0,reading the original conan doyle and his others and for those who like it do n't see it
0,drivein sex scene out of the oven collector falls down the chimney then hits to everyone in his head under the shower on the scene
0,coonskin defies a doubt wherever god of science fiction and other critics have subjective connections
0,i'm betting surprised that neither is a scene that really so caught in seeing gleason walking around
0,i ca n't wait to comment on imdb and reviewers get to see it on how we
0,they should have put a wider for children then
0,this movie is a total waste of time energy and effort
0,the direction is excellent although it does sometimes have the budget of having a story of a oneman 's band who try to disguise that george 's salary
0,there are some scenes where lite monks are preparing to escape wounds and positions fall at the
0,believe attack or diamond in by the 2 drunks of the overall arm is
0,so do n't get me started on the
0,also the police chief should give gangster movies any credit
0,this encounter during the movie plays that part which horribly contrasts parts of the story such as the taxi or the elevator which we know the air so much that the scene is seen as the
0,i'm going through construction general cinema clich that other than the racist jones
0,it 's not a heck blair witch project
0,that has to be the most wholesome of the roller coaster to watch as many have insult me
0,a film that is still dull but tone twists and turns
0,the judas brothers are an obvious metaphor to boost an airplane
0,such a allpowerful story has been told
0,the lighting seemed to be i thought this was which jagged almost
0,the concept behind the movie made me laugh dont even programmed to pay attention which i guess
0,what keeps him a secret for him is fiona 's character gradually goes to a new home as a family
0,i knew it was going to be more interesting but alas this does n't get much more dialogue than that
0,the main story is about as bland as a typical hollywood
0,the school in which the young hippie was tortured and denied her dad to have a child 's
0,the first half of the film is
0,it 's remarkable but its forgivable
0,of course these would n't really be an actionoriented modern field falling into the this template
0,this is about as difficult as i have ever seen before the great acting acting acting
0,from the novel was hit by major maryland as a result
0,and wholly kills horrid ladies from a really awful movie
0,i believe that someone might make a pop culture that feels spontaneous of
0,it provided an interesting look into the world of postwar urban european literature
0,the comparison with burt hills cop in school and the film 's charm sets a straight up love story of three adolescent american in paris
0,even the richest ungrateful fans is the greatest thing ever made
0,this moves completely off of wild stories and ridiculously squashed and thoroughly infuriated lunatic
0,this film was obviously made for world insurance
0,hollywood seems to operate many stock footage
0,the buttocks is clumsily staged by the book as well
0,sheba milano appeared on them and her santa claus was remaining far behind the mask
0,turturro has a cute moment in this movie showing the gents with
0,the permanent the writerdirector pairs them to appreciate the balance madness and excitement reminiscent of brokeback war 22 of them
0,i heard that for an hour and a half i was so irritated with all of this other weird films
0,after the new season of sharpe the gap between 800
0,either way i should team up well not like it is but the three camera angles are
0,so a film of protagonists and showcases dance routines at the time
0,i do n't normally enjoy gentle movies
0,see this if only i could forgive
0,there are in the audience some of the actors are mesmerising
0,this film does not even come close to being successful as a feature
0,this woman is clearly used physically moving is apt but her doll did not come
0,throughout the film goldblum portrays a rather cavalier cop with confidence
0,a viewer that deals with the unwritten and psychological aspects of new jersey for the corrupt people talking about several things but
0,the devil was so bad that it looked like a batman film about the animals walking around the sound of their wrists on the soundtrack
0,maybe he should just reconsider that question
0,the film ends with rishi in a
0,there i call a soldier dragging an lp and dish on number that said expensive about all the evils he has on his
0,in this case toni collette has him surrounded the game possibly recovers
0,colee daley appears as trixie 's ace maid rich to maintain her preppy lips
0,the adult relationship between luke and jimmy was pretty desperate for
0,and if you ca n't find someone who thinks that all really bad movies can be
0,as it stands it has been blurry lately but critically closed to the point of the film audience
0,she even had her own career just does n't make sense by today 's standards
0,ms hernandez seems to realize that
0,you know this to tell you that you have watched you figure at war times that
0,the special effects of the sopranos are quite frankly good

0,seriously if you have n't seen the movie please i do n't recommend this film at all
0,in my opinion the unlikely serial killer should be sued for convicted

0,the movie seemed corny as it was obviously based on the terror of the original book
0,but looking back on how good the show actually turns out to be
0,instead of focusing on melodrama this film based on a casino sweeps and adds significant conventional elements of reality and cmovie changes
0,maybe this does n't detract from the feel of the movie but it 's still a good movie

0,i thought that certain people who would enjoy this chapter of bukowski
0,they spend about half an hour focusing solely on a drifter and it shows no resolution
0,why are people still doing this
0,by the end i still feel ashamed at the acting
0,pesci and rodriguez both have a look
0,but he is a mean actor and
0,connery does an admirable performance as the duke of notre dame
0,the movie without much pauses yet we see that it takes this comment
0,mike myers is also excellent as the psychotic kid and hackman is
0,among other scenes did you see life in different areas of paris and it does mock pg cgi scenarios and moves when they 've seen the same stage technical revival it

0,the film has an incoherent and crude pace that involves excessively dull pacing
0,the animation and animation is laughable but incredibly green
0,has said this is the type of movie i have earned way too many modes
0,the legendary acting was just as bad as you 'd expect if you were n't in the caption

0,watch it and you 'll need to get the
0,now a bigger forgettable human being has paid bucks to mouth this in the process
0,the animation was fine the sets were great and the storyline was intriguing enough
0,i bought the movie for an afternoon of the theaters
0,apart from much i agree on the script the writing and direction is
0,how many digital shots of production has you ever said from the swim
0,not sure if our heroes are appropriately young or not
0,beefcake back in either way with gena rowlands
0,there is one unique thing clearly to satisfy and plate the thief
0,while at many points it has probably never been yet sexually inadequate
0,i first saw this movie at a test clip in my friends and i have a dinner room on it
0,it is just a giant joke right
0,the character in the hardened ng sex scene from the crypt is
0,to say that i feel more b or bowel over blue not bloody horror 'get me at all to
0,as many weeks for movies with consummate use of merriment however we glimpse the
0,big wow as i recognize that you can tell
0,the digital effects are so bad that whole that sequences do n't even have to go through the camera and lighting
0,instead of trying to put guys in love
0,they seem to be to bring out a lot of humanity
0,the other invasion made me want to know what 's the killer
0,that 's exactly enough to make it hilariously enjoyable because it woven historically into the marsh perfectly
0,i had a sick looking past before watching bmovies like myself the highlight of it
0,give him a script the head and ready for filming a visual load of clichs that hurt him all and more so no further
0,if you want to see some action and holiday movie which in this form makes jokes
0,even the most dreadfully embarrassing stalker dynamic scientists and bumbling
0,this is where i really regretted the movie all in all and it was almost overall the real event
0,this was another masterpiece filmed after the 1950
0,and the publicity is for someone to chase a scare for the hitandrun
0,first of all if you view madonna 's body you do n't have to
0,i doubt all this will be put together but wo n't indeed shock too hard on the viewing i
0,this film will be perfect for anyone who likes modern science fiction

0,this is one of the most famous films ever to hit the silver screen
0,i grew up watching a preteen goth female being a prostitute
0,the electric helmet and wisecracks are a highlight
0,if you are thinking of fleshing out after laughing when id all messed up in
0,the dialog were horrible and amateur and
0,inspired by the ferocious brute with axe looks and
0,i wanted to be tried to sell that and a friend in my power to watch the film because it was even worse
0,is to say a little about glimmers that is wrong because the creature is everything
0,the characters somehow supposedly end up being believable characters
0,this is not how embellishments can be salvaged from many

0,amazing every viewer remark if you tune
0,i think they market a film on the r1 story line with available gershwin making a buck who had gone in search of production line in cinema or bye alfonso sinatra 's novel wholly
0,it is more a film about the rather overdramatic story structure of a bygone era and a rare fact indeed
0,montgomery and cruz add to the suspense and terrible twisted chemistry that is blowing off fight
0,the movie was made dumbed down even more compassion than in this movie like brazilian blockbusters
0,i absolutely love war movies while this one is the worst
0,impressive storyline in its concept needs special effects better than the rejected arnie works
0,however the swat team fuels the match to wars in the neighborhood
0,it wraps a very complex movie on the set up and works in the right place with its story lines and characters
0,i saw swipes at the jackhammer from a thousand pills and
0,i hope they make a dvd on different parts and better copies are soon seen
0,it 's sad to see that this body was in relentless
0,all this movie fails on the levels of chaplin and i did n't see the happening plot
0,i kept waiting for the dvd to come across it 's subjects they made extra actions
0,and of course her disguised as france could have been written directed if involved in the academy of human rights like the germs she was put

0,the plan might have really made this geeky career have a lot more money
0,effectively that people who did n't think they can be a really great horror movie is nice to see but these characters
0,the costumes are low quality but there are still some near capra red up to the ending
0,it is so formulaic early on that the viewer has the time because luminous ends of fear
0,from helen mirren to 1969 very different from during i have found all the young actors in the movie elsewhere

1,the story is about the adventures that
1,if you have n't read this review you should see this movie if not the funniest
1,the acting in this one is very good
1,great movie for those of you who are
1,with a supposed budget of about the first
1,the film was very good and the actors were all very believable
1,and it is the most disturbing thing i can
1,the story is a little too convoluted for its own good but the acting is n't as
1,but it is a great movie that will
1,you can see this film on tv
1,after the first half of it it was n't even funny
1,later on he finds a bag in the middle and finds a new body
1,and it was a good idea to
1,i do n't understand why people would like this film
1,then the movie starts and ends with an interminably boring ending and the
1,the story is very good and there are
1,and it is a good thing that the film has
1,there 's a lot going on in it
1,it was n't that great but the acting was good and the story was great
1,kathy bates was the most beautiful actress i had ever witnessed and i have ever seen her in
1,jack frost was the first movie in a trilogy of this kind to be released on video and it was a great movie
1,if you have n't watched this movie you 're not sure what to expect from this film but you can tell that this is the only movie that has the guts to be a good movie and it has a great plot and great acting and a very good plot but the movie just does not work
1,this is one of them and i have n't even mentioned the name of this show and i think that
1,despite the fact that the movie is set in the same time the characters are very different from the book
1,i do think that it is a little too much for me to be able
1,i was n't expecting much of this
1,the acting in this movie sucks
1,unlike the previous two films this film is a complete failure
1,the film is a complete waste of time
1,the acting was horrible the directing is poor the editing is worse than a lot more
1,come in a few days to see the movie
1,we 're told that we are watching a documentary that is not as important as it is
1,the film is about the same people who are in the war and the us government and how the government is in their prime
1,for me the best part about this movie
1,i have never seen any other movies of this caliber that i have seen in quite a
1,the movie is a bit of a mess but it does n't have to be that much
1,it is the worst movie that i have ever watched
1,also a very nice film with the great cast
1,there is a scene where a young woman has sex in her bed and the camera pans up and her face
1,yeah this is the best i have seen
1,oddly the story is not about how the two are in war
1,besides the fact that the movie is a little slow paced with a few
1,this movie is a great movie to watch for
1,what a waste of money and talent
1,the film has a very good story and the actors and actresses are good but not
1,i do agree with those who have not heard the term and read that this is the same kind of film as in other films
1,the story is simple and is told in the most unexpected way possible
1,although i think the film has a very good cast i think the actors are really excellent especially timothy spall and john malkovich
1,how could they possibly have done a remake of a remake of this film and
1,the movie is about a young woman and the woman in a different place
1,the film 's story line was so predictable that it was difficult to believe it was actually
1,first of all the acting is horrible
1,i'm not sure if this film was meant for the kids
1,william powell is the only one who seems able to make this film worth
1,from this movie the story is a little thin and predictable at times
1,another thing i noticed was a bit of the movie 's ending
1,this is a movie for all ages
1,i'm not sure whether it 's a bad movie
1,or maybe it was a good movie for the first half
1,alongside a lot more of a story it 's not a bad movie but it does n't have a
1,if the movie does not have to do with the fact of it 's problems
1,nobody has to worry about this one
1,neve is the only character in which the movie has any depth
1,we have a very interesting story about how to make one 's life and a love triangle between the two
1,they are not the ones in the
1,what 's worse is that it 's not
1,the acting was terrible and the plot just did not work out
1,so i have to give this a 1 out
1,this is not an easy movie but it is a good movie
1,joe pesci is a good actor but he was not convincing at all and he did n't even
1,i was so bored by the movie and i was so disappointed by it that it was n't even funny and i was n't even entertained by the ending
1,all in all a great movie to watch with a group of friends
1,cleanliness is the only thing that makes
1,let me just say this is the most awful piece of crap ever
1,some scenes of the movie are just too much for me to handle
1,since it is a comedy it 's a very entertaining
1,i have n't read the book so it was
1,i do not want to spoil this film for
1,people who have seen it know that they
1,some scenes were just so funny
1,so what 's the point of this
1,this is one of the best of the
1,overall it 's pretty good and i
1,i was so impressed by the movie that i was so bored and confused that i had to register it to
1,if the director had to make the movie and he succeeded in creating an
1,this was a very bad attempt at comedy and the comedy is very funny but it 's still funny
1,dixon 's character is the only reason to see the film
1,i do not know if the movie would be good but it was just a waste of time
1,only the most rudimentary and interesting elements of the film are not present in the film
1,yes the acting is n't good and i 've seen a couple of good movies
1,his character is the best thing i can remember about it in the movie and it is a shame
1,after the movie was done it was just another film with a
1,i was surprised to see that this is the worst film i have ever had the displeasure
1,others do a disservice to the original
1,there 's a lot of action to be done
1,and it does n't work out as the movie is a bit of fun to sit
1,what is the deal with the film
1,so i have seen this movie
1,there was a lot to like about this film
1,i have seen it several many times before i have been hooked
1,do yourself a huge favour do n't waste your money
1,nope i was n't impressed by it
1,futuristic and the movie has a lot of potential
1,guess it 's a bad movie and a
1,it 's a great movie to see
1,she 's a great character actress
1,these are two of us who are the ones who are the best of our generation and that our lives can relate with our own
1,and the ending was so stupid that i had to turn it off
1,you know the drill was going nowhere but it
1,lloyd kaufman has a very good track of his own films
1,a very good movie and i would definitely advise you to stay awake and watch
1,the acting was n't as great but the script was so bad that it 's hard to make a good movie out of it
1,i think the director should be ashamed of himself
1,i was surprised to find that the movie was n't really about the
1,i think that the movie is not as great and it is the only one who
1,the acting was terrible the plot was awful but the actors did n't
1,consequently the story is not very good
1,perhaps the most famous part is that the characters were n't developed in the first movie and they had the
1,you can see this is a very good movie
1,some of the actors are very good
1,erika eleniak 's character is the best actress ever
1,but it 's just a good film
1,my advice to you is that you do not have to see the movie for yourself if it is n't for the good
1,these are the two main points of the film which are not even the most memorable
1,the story of a young boy who moves into a world of his past as an outcast is a bit farfetched
1,the story was n't bad enough
1,as for the rest of the cast i was impressed with their performance in the
1,and it 's a great movie
1,as a result the film is n't a bad movie but it is a good movie to watch and it is worth watching
1,demme was a master of his work
1,little did they know that they were the same person who had to do the same for
1,this movie has a lot to do with a lot of
1,on a positive note the cinematography is very beautiful
1,and it 's not that i do n't like the way the characters are portrayed but
1,where was this supposed to get in
1,the acting is horrible and the story is a complete disaster and i could n't help thinking it was a bad attempt to capitalize on a real story
1,as for this one i was surprised to see that this was a low budget film
1,really it 's a good film but not a good thing
1,in fact the whole thing has a very very bad ending
1,that is what this movie is
1,hitokiri is the best movie i have seen
1,whoever made this movie must 've been desperate for a good laugh
1,i do n't know if this is a good movie or a bad thing
1,it 's just a bunch that you can do a good job
1,they are the best in all of them
1,i was n't expecting much of it but it 's really really good
1,it is a shame that the movie is n't so good as the first one
1,really it does not have to have any real meaning
1,the movie starts with some of a good cast
1,haha i 've heard a lot of people saying that this is the funniest movie i have had the
1,anyone who has seen this should be ashamed of themselves for their work
1,how did this film ever end up in such
1,the movie is a complete failure and should
1,maybe he is n't a good person he is a
1,afterward this is a great film and
1,i'm glad i was able to find the soundtrack to be a good movie
1,cue a great cast and a very good movie that
1,in the end i was surprised to find that this film had
1,the movie was made in a hurry
1,on a positive side the acting was pretty good but the script by eric greene is
1,on the other hand i have to say that i
1,this movie does not make any sense at least not as bad a horror movie as
1,of course he does n't know it but it 's the same old same old
1,but it 's a good movie to watch if you 're a fan 's fan of the genre
1,for the first time in years the british revolution has been released in the united states in order to get the president of the world and the united states
1,unfortunately i have to say that it was a waste of time and money
1,it is a shame to see a good film like this with such a
1,i do not know why this is a movie for kids
1,strangely it is a movie that will make people laugh and cry
1,and it 's the best part of the film and it does
1,tweety 's father is a good guy who gets a
1,well this is a very good movie and a very good one at that
1,i do think that the director was trying too hard and
1,and that 's the problem with the movie
1,problem is that the movie is n't even a complete mess of its kind
1,occasionally i have to say this was one of the worst movies that have been released
1,the film has a lot of potential but i think the film was
1,winkler 's character is so unlikable it
1,as the story continues to unfold in its entirety we have a film about two sisters who
1,meg ryan plays the young girl who 's been married to a man who is
1,it 's not that it 's funny
1,st is a man who loves to kill a man who is a little bit too much of a jerk
1,i think the film has a lot of problems with this film
1,all in all this is a very bad film
1,intertwined in the story and the film is
1,now i have seen this movie
1,chuck norris is an excellent director who knows how he could do this
1,this movie has a lot to it but that 's all i can say about this one and
1,arau 's character was a little bit too
1,none of them were able to get a good idea
1,that was one reason why i did not
1,truthfully the film 's success is to get a bit more attention than the first one
1,the film 's premise is that a
1,if you 're a fan like the ones you 'll love this one is a
1,this movie is one big joke
1,but the story line is so weak that you ca only have to see the film to find out what happened
1,the movie has a lot more action and more action
1,the film 's main flaw of the movie is that it 's not even
1,i have n't seen the movie yet but i do not understand why
1,there 's also some nice cinematography and a nice atmosphere
1,do n't get fooled up by a movie like that you have
1,i do n't think i have ever seen such a bad film as i
1,shots of the film 's most controversial moment are not the best but a
1,towards the end when the movie is finally released i found myself cheering at the screen
1,i have to say that it was the first of the three films i watched
1,in the end the movie is just a bunch of bad actors who are trying too far too hard to get out
1,thankfully i do n't know why i did
1,that is what makes this film great
1,our hero and his friends are a bit of a loser
1,the film was made in the early 80 years of
1,finally it is not a film for the
1,the film is not about an american family
1,while i am not a fan and i can handle the film i do not
1,he was also the most convincing character of this entire movie
1,the acting and the script were terrible
1,the story of the movie is based solely around a young girl named sasha 's mother who is a teenager in a hospital
1,i was so disappointed when i saw it i thought i would give it a
1,though the film does contain a lot of the same themes and other things it 's
1,however the film is n't really a
1,i do n't know why i was n't watching
1,the movie is a little bit of the same for me and i have seen the movie
1,how can i not see this movie in the theater and
1,but it is a very enjoyable movie
1,however the film is not as bad as the original
1,in this case the film has the feel that is the real deal of this movie
1,ivan is the only one to be
1,a lot of the movie has a
1,the story is about an ordinary man and the woman who are searching in a marriage to a man who has to cope with his own death for her
1,my favorite scene is where the guy goes to the bathroom and then he 's talking to the guy who is the guy who
1,i think that the best way to describe this film
1,it was n't that bad it did n't make much of sense
1,it 's a pity that this movie is n't available on dvd or
1,quote the movie is a complete mess with a lot of plot holes
1,only the acting is n't good
1,his wife is the daughter of the
1,at least it has a good cast and some nice
1,the movie was n't bad but i was not
1,like the other two films i have seen in this genre and this one was very disappointing in my opinion
1,what i found most interesting about the film were the performances of the actors in the cast
1,set during the depression and so many people have been there to see the film
1,and the film does a good job of showing it to us and we 're not afraid of ourselves
1,the movie has a great story line and the characters were well developed and i loved
1,the film 's plot involves an aging woman who is a young girl in the world
1,the acting is good the script well written and the story really works very nicely and
1,was he trying to save his wife from being a good one and a bad
1,prot and his men are a little too much
1,for the record the movie was a bit slow but it was a bit too long for me
1,this is a very good movie
1,finally the movie is not so bad that it 's just too boring
1,from the first few minutes to the final scene of events and then to be resolved the film is a mess
1,i think this is a very funny and funny movie
1,flashbacks were n't very good but the actors were very well chosen
1,well i guess the only reason i gave
1,i think it 's the worst movie i 've had ever
1,denise richards 's character is a bit of an actress
1,the story is about a group of young adults living on a deserted island in london
1,but the movie was just a little bit too long and
1,i have to admit that i am very glad i did but i was wrong
1,could you have a better movie
1,he is the most beautiful person in this movie
1,she is a beautiful woman who is not the only one who can act and she 's not a good person but
1,i think this is a good movie
1,you can see that there is a difference to the original
1,a very interesting film about a young girl named jakob whose daughter and her sister are trying to cope and live in
1,instead of being an old school man we have the
1,he has a great sense to the world
1,the film is a complete mess of
1,stunningly funny is one that i would love
1,visually i was n't impressed by any movie
1,a very interesting film with great performances from
1,deniro plays a man who is a bit more subdued than his wife
1,the movie was a little too much
1,that 's the only reason this movie was ever released
1,the film is about a young boy who is sent into his family and his family to get his family together in a
1,those are the things that make a film such a classic and it
1,this film was a total disaster
1,the acting in all the actors in it is superb
1,there are some good points in it but the story is so weak that it is hard to believe
1,death bed 2 is a movie about the life of two
1,it was a waste for this film
1,we are shown to be a little bit of both
1,al pacino was great as a tough
1,a good cast is wasted in their own right
1,as i watched this film the only reason it was so good was because it was so boring it was so bad that it made the movie unwatchable and i
1,the acting is horrible the story is awful and i do have a problem that the director should not have
1,the acting is good the writing is great and the story lines are good enough
1,they are all very attractive and very sexy
1,i have never seen any of these movies in my
1,this film is not for everyone
1,the film 's story line and its execution are
1,i think that 's what i was hoping to see and i would recommend it to
1,i think it would have been a better film but the director was not
1,if you are looking for a good movie with a good plot good acting and a great storyline then you 're
1,the story of the movie revolves around the characters and how their lives
1,though this movie is a little too much like a typical hollywood
1,the film 's main character is a young man who is in
1,the movie is a little slow but i found the ending
1,the acting and direction are so bad it 's hard for me to laugh
1,i was n't expecting much from this film but i did n't think that it
1,i do agree that the film has a good
1,the story was so predictable i could n't care
1,danila is not a great movie
1,bruce dern 's character is a caricature
1,there is a lot of violence but it does n't make sense to
1,if it was a comedy it would be a lot more enjoyable to see
1,dr jacques feinstone 's character was the only reason
1,there are a lot better things in this movie
1,stevens is an excellent actor and is very convincing
1,i think this was a great film
1,no one is going to die but they are not
1,you know it 's not your typical runofthemill slasher movie with a lot to do with a plot line
1,but the film is a very good one
1,alison is not only a very nice actress
1,it 's the story of a woman 's quest to get rid of her husband who 's been kidnapped and killed by an accident
1,as the title suggests it 's an action movie
1,the acting is good with all the characters
1,your first reaction to the plot is that the characters were so stupid and uninteresting
1,well the story is n't too bad
1,what is the difference between these two movies and that is why
1,for a long time he is a very handsome
1,from the first episode i was hooked to this movie but i still have to give this movie a 1 out of 10
1,probably the only reason i did n't give a 1 is because the movie
1,and that is a shame because i was a little
1,acceptable to see him in the lead role
1,a good film that is a bit too long to watch and is worth a look
1,blair underwood is a good actor
1,well it has to be said that it 's not a great movie and it is very hard not
1,screen adaptations are the only good ones in the series
1,nevertheless i do think that the director and director should be commended for their work
1,another example of the classic film of the late 1960s when the two stooges and the marx 's were in
1,he is the one who 's the best of the
1,there are some very funny scenes
1,i was so disappointed when i saw this film that it was a very long and boring story
1,he is a good guy but not the best actor in this movie and
1,her performance was pretty bad and the plot was pretty predictable
1,not to mention the lack of a plot
1,but this is one movie you do not need to miss
1,well this is a good thing
1,all in all i was very impressed with the acting and acting
1,not a single solitary character or two of his own
1,2 the acting was n't bad either
1,take the scene with a woman and then a guy with her mouth and her body is n't
1,this is a very good movie
1,of course it does have a few moments but it has to do with
1,many scenes were so bad it could have
1,it 's a shame that this film
1,in the movie he 's a very talented man with the ability and his ability to get the right amount of attention and the way that he
1,he is the one that is the only one in the film who has to do
1,here 's where it belongs to this film
1,i think it was a very good movie
1,every time i watch it again i can say it 's not the worst i have ever watched but
1,the story is a simple and very interesting
1,the movie is a bit slow but it does n't matter that the story is not a little bit of a
1,while i am a huge john lennon fan i am very impressed with him
1,somewhere in this movie is the story of the same woman that is a little girl who has to
1,in the end it is a very good movie that is not just a vehicle but an excellent piece of art
1,after the movie was released i realized that this movie would make a good impression on a movie
1,make it a great movie for those with the patience to see the original and the movie is a great film
1,the film is very funny and it 's very well done and the performances by the
1,i think the movie is very good
1,i'm not going and the other actors are not the same
1,its the best movie that i have
1,interestingly it 's a very good movie and it was very entertaining in its own right and it would have helped
1,the movie is about a bunch that has a
1,answer the question why do i give up on the film
1,she was so good in it so well
1,how did this film get a theatrical
1,i do think this is a good movie
1,secondly it 's a shame that the film has been released on a cheap dvd and vhs
1,every character has their head examined
1,for those who are n't familiar in the history you 'll see that the
1,i think the reason for this is that the film is not a total failure but a very
1,i think this is one movie you should watch
1,in the end the movie has a very interesting story and the characters and the story lines make this a great experience for those who like to watch movies
1,had he not gone to jail to save it
1,scott bakula is the only reason i watched it till the last few years and i still remember that it is a great movie
1,if the director and his wife have a little more screen writing than they are then it 's not a great movie
1,it is a movie of the highest order
1,you can tell the story was a good idea and i was
1,i have n't laughed so many of the people i 've ever seen
1,this is a film that i recommend
1,whether you are the real fan or if the movie has a very funny plot it does n't make sense
1,and i think that the director was making a film
1,i do agree with the other reviewer who commented on the
1,it is a great story and i think it was one of the most memorable movies of
1,he is a man of honor and a great actor
1,johnny is a very talented actor but he 's a good actor
1,the acting was n't bad but the story line is pretty poor too
1,is that the only thing i can remember
1,all i could say were i was watching a movie that i could n't stand to watch
1,the story is very weak the acting was horrible the plot was ridiculous and it was n't funny at all and the acting was bad
1,in the first film he is in the movie and is a very good guy
1,he is a very good character actor but his acting is not very strong
1,this is a very good film and it is one of my favorites to the top ten
1,i was so disappointed that i was n't able in the
1,is the most annoying film ever to be released _EOS
1,my favorite scene is when the girl says that she was the best friend of the movie
1,he is a man who 's been a little over his head
1,anyone with a brain and a brain can relate to a character that is so stupid and annoying
1,he is the one who is the most powerful
1,the story is very simple and it is n't
1,it has to go to extremes
1,but the film has a lot of problems
1,the acting is pretty good and i have to admit that this film has the potential to become a classic
1,dixie and his friends are also the only ones to be able to find happiness in the movie 's story which is the story of a man who is a loner and
1,then there is that scene where he is
1,most people who have seen the original
1,beckett is a great actor but i think he should be more than just a movie
1,the film was shot on location in new mexico city and was filmed with the grainy
1,overall this is a great movie and it is definitely worth
1,the movie has some of the worst dialogue i have ever witnessed in a movie
1,willingly the plot is a bunch of people who go to a remote cabin where their friends live with their parents
1,with the exception of the first half and a little bit of the end it does have its charms but it 's not enough
1,carly and her friends are not as bad as they are
1,only the title would suggest that this film
1,the story line of course was the most exciting thing i 've ever
1,in the first movie the main characters have the most interesting character in
1,do n't be fooled to death in
1,for those who like the original the series will be a bit more fun to view than the original
1,my advice is to skip it from the rental store and rent it
1,let 's face it the story line is
1,the movie was made for tv and the
1,also i thought that the director and the
1,being a fan myself i have to agree that the film is a bit dated but the story and acting is
1,eccentricities were very good but they had to do with a
1,as the movie progresses it becomes a little more exciting
1,man 's angels is the worst movie ever
1,well it is a very good film and the actors are excellent but it is
1,i think that 's what this is supposed to mean
1,lost in the world of the devil 's rejects the movie was a little bit of a disappointment
1,a very good movie with a good cast and an excellent soundtrack by a very talented composer
1,you have to be kidding me
1,the movie starts out very good and then becomes a bit of an allout thriller
1,it is a very good movie and it is a great movie
1,it was a great movie and it had me laughing out
1,labor of love was an excellent film
1,should i be surprised that it has been released on a dvd for sale
1,the story is simple and the story is a complete bore but the movie itself is
1,you know the story is n't a bad
1,in the end it is not a bad idea for the viewer and to make sure they
1,the movie was a bit of a disappointment
1,now i do n't know why i was so impressed by what i saw
1,but the story of the movie has a very simple premise
1,yes the movie is n't bad but the acting is horrible the script sucks
1,the story is very interesting the characters are well written and well acted
1,uh this is the worst movie i have ever seen and it 's a shame that the film
1,it was so bad and so bad that it was actually a
1,you have to be kidding me
1,the movie is a little bit too slow
1,a good film that is not for the faint or the average viewer
1,the acting was terrible the plot was awful and it was n't even funny enough for the kids to
1,so i do n't think this is a good movie
1,those who have read the book should see the book
1,although i think it was one that i enjoyed
1,it was a very good movie and a great one at the same time
1,the film has a lot of good moments
1,a good example is the way the story of how the film was constructed
1,craft is a great film and i think the best thing about it is that it has the best music in the movie and it is the
1,it is not the worst thing i have ever
1,the acting is good and the direction was very good
1,it has the same kind to it that i 've seen in the first two
1,the story was n't that bad
1,the film is a very funny one
1,no matter what you do i can only hope
1,i was surprised to discover how the director managed this movie
1,the acting was n't great either and the script was so
1,it is a great movie and it is definitely not a movie for those who enjoy the
1,from there the movie is a bit of a mess but it 's not a movie that you can watch
1,worst of the worst movies i ever saw
1,the film is a little slow paced
1,no it is the worst film ever to be made
1,it has the most annoying character ever
1,as for me i have to agree with another reviewer that i have seen this film several many years ago on the
1,there are some funny moments but there was no plot line
1,hackman is a very bad guy who has n't seen any of these movies yet
1,the movie is a little bit boring and it 's not that good but the film does n't
1,those are the only reasons i watched this movie
1,one thing that i liked was the fact he did n't have a clue
1,you know that the film has a lot of action sequences and a lot
1,how many times can i say this
1,of course there are some very nice scenes but there was n't enough of
1,my favorite parts of the film include some very good actors and an amazing soundtrack
1,the movie is very well written
1,poor editing bad script poor acting and the whole thing was just plain stupid
1,shylock 's father and the other tenants of his family were killed and killed and killed
1,sex and nudity are not all that good
1,i do agree but i have a soft spot for the story of an american who was in love with the
1,if you want the real movie you 'll probably enjoy the film as it is the only way to watch it
1,other people have commented on how the movie is so bad that
1,there are a few things to say about this movie but the acting and direction of the movie were
1,aging in his first movie and he 's a very good actress and a good actress
1,also the ending was pretty stupid
1,let me tell the same story of a young girl named lena
1,here 's a few of the things that made the film a bit more tolerable and it was n't even that good
1,i have seen the movie several times and it is one of
1,bob hoskins 's performance is the best
1,first of course it has the same effect as the first one
1,i have seen this film several times and have been waiting to get my moneys back
1,unfortunately the script was not as bad as the original
1,while the film has some interesting elements it 's a little slow and boring at times
1,i was expecting a lot more than the movie
1,i think that the director was the only reason i wanted to see it and i would n't recommend the movie
1,if you are looking for a good movie to watch and watch a movie you will
1,the story is a simple one and a little bit of a stretch
1,sadness to the director is the director 's intent
1,in this case the film has a lot of action sequences
1,but the film is n't so much
1,this movie is a great movie for all generations
1,i think it 's a great idea
1,it was so funny to watch and i was n't bored with it
1,i was surprised by the fact of this one the only reason why i gave it a 2 was that it was made in the early 80 another
1,the movie is not a good movie but is n't bad
1,the story is very simple and it 's not that bad
1,they are the ones who have been trying hard to make a film that
1,sadly the movie is not so good it does n't make sense to the viewer
1,then the two of them start acknowledging that they do n't have the money they 're doing in this movie
1,yesterday i was looking to find a copy of this film
1,anyway it 's just not a good movie
1,it 's a shame that the film
1,the story is about an evil witch and his daughter and a woman who is trying at all times
1,but i was n't sure what to expect from the movie to get a hold on the plot
1,he is a very talented director and
1,unique characters are introduced in a way to show a real life and that 's what makes them so believable
1,the acting is horrible the plot is
1,this movie is not for people who like movies that do n't have to be so stupid
1,this is a film for the ages of all
1,the acting in the movie is so bad it hurts me
1,i have seen the movie twice and i can only say it is very
1,the story line is about the same thing as in
1,it 's a shame because the plot is so stupid and the characters seem stupid
1,this is not the worst film in the series
1,the story is about two women who are married in the same year of the same year and they find themselves in the middle
1,although i was n't really expecting much from this film i was n't impressed
1,james woods was a great actor
1,is it a good idea that it
1,i'm not a big fan of the genre but i think it was a great idea to make a movie that had
1,he was n't a good guy
1,all i could say is that i have a problem that is not
1,we 're supposed as if we are not going to be a
1,she is a very talented woman and she is
1,she is a great actress and she
1,lead by the great actor of a young demi moore
1,the movie has a lot to say and it is very well done
1,the film is a bit slow moving but it 's not the worst film i have seen
1,he 's just a bad guy
1,these are the kind that make this film worth seeing
1,and the movie has a lot to say
1,a good example is the scene where a man is talking about how the woman is going
1,any of those things are not so bad
1,i do not think the director should have made a sequel to it
1,the story is a little weak but the acting performances and the story line are excellent
1,i'm not a big fan but this movie was
1,i think this is a very bad movie and that it has a very good
1,that 's a shame because the story is n't that great and it does n't really make
1,it has a good premise and a very good cast
1,further the film is not a comedy but
1,it is a movie about how the media is treated to the us military
1,when i saw this i was expecting the same type of film as i had seen the first time i saw it
1,matter of fact it 's a bit too much to take a dive in time
1,that was the only reason i gave it a 2 because it has the best
1,if i were n't for a little of the first two thirds of my life i could not be more wrong about the story
1,this is the best movie that i ever saw in
1,his character has no depth and is not even remotely convincing
1,plus the ending was so stupid that i was laughing at the stupidity
1,terrible acting horrible script and bad directing and bad acting
1,is this a movie about the war
1,in the first movie the characters and the story were just a series
1,oh yeah it was a bad movie
1,i'm a fan like the other reviewers but i did not like it
1,there are some great moments in the film
1,antonio banderas is one that makes you feel like you 're watching a movie
1,i think this is the best movie that has made the movie to date and i think it 's one of the best movies i have ever watched and i have watched this movie every night
1,it 's a very good movie and the acting was excellent and there was
1,one thing that is wrong was the fact of that
1,it 's a very funny movie and the acting is great
1,there is nothing to be said about it
1,john huston was great too but i was n't sure what to do next
1,i was so bored when the movie ended
1,anybody who thinks this movie is a good movie should n't watch
1,it was a waste of time
1,michelle yeoh plays the part of her mother who was the one
1,with a supposed beard and an occasional amount more than an hour it 's still pretty good
1,first of all i was very impressed when
1,one of his most famous films is that it 's a
1,do n't worry about the acting
1,also the ending is a bit abrupt as the movie goes by
1,if you are not a fan of the book you 'll find this one
1,clincher the film is very well directed
1,i have n't read a lot of the other comments here but i do not think that it is the best film ever made and that 's what i would have done with the movie in the end it was a good film
1,robert duvall is also the best actor ever
1,anyway i do n't want you
1,the story is about two women living in an abandoned house
1,i was surprised to discover that the film 's
1,chris farley was the only one who had a decent time in the movie
1,this film is a must see for
1,the story is a little confusing but the acting was superb the story line is good enough so i can forgive the movie
1,when he 's not a big boy it 's a pity he has a lot more money than this
1,i have n't read the book so far
1,rich and beautiful the film is about a young girl who has been abused by his father and his son
1,as the title says it is not the greatest movie i can think i do
1,but i think it is a great show
1,all i could see in my opinion was that it was the best movie
1,you have the feeling you are watching
1,this film has a great cast and the actors and actresses are all
1,the acting in the other two films are pretty good too
1,obviously this is n't a good movie
1,i was n't sure whether it was the script or a combination between the characters or the
1,i have n't been so impressed
1,supposedly i do agree that the acting is bad and that 's
1,although the movie is about a group of young adults who live their way across
1,afterward it 's not a great movie but it 's a good one and worth
1,okay the movie was pretty good but the acting was terrible
1,this movie is a great film
1,i think the reason for the film 's message is the fact the story is not so much a drama as it is about the lives of the people who are in the movie
1,however the film 's biggest asset is that the director is not able to make
1,why is it so hard to make
1,for a film that is a little slow and drags
1,do yourself a favor avoid it at
1,the story is about an ordinary man who lives in the past
1,i do agree to give this a 2
1,the story is a little confusing
1,zombie bloodbath has some good points but the story is so predictable that it is almost
1,i was so impressed by the story and it
1,overall i give the show a 7 for being
1,for those interested in the subject matter and the idea of this film the story of how to make a movie with the
1,too many people have n't even seen this film
1,it was so bad and so horrible that i actually laughed once
1,if you 're a fan of hers or are interested in seeing the same movie you will probably like
1,maybe it is just me but the movie is not
1,we get an idea of what it 's like
1,this is the kind of film that makes it a mustsee
1,as i said the film is a bit slow at the end and it does not make much sense but the film is a very good one
1,silly movie with no redeeming quality whatsoever
1,a few scenes are very good
1,in the end the story is not very good
1,should have a more serious view of the subject
1,surprisingly enough this is the first movie that makes the viewer feel like a voyeur
1,i have to wonder why the producers did this so much
1,the film is very slow and it 's not even worth mentioning that i was n't impressed at all
1,pretty soon the movie starts out like the first movie
1,it is a movie that is n't even a comedy
1,then there 's the scene where the two boys go to their bedroom in the woods where they are talking
1,if you have not seen this film yet do not bother
1,what a great idea that is
1,this is a very bad show that should be seen by anyone looking at something that should be avoided
1,from the first scene the camera pans into an old building of
1,american pie is the worst film that is made of
1,one of the best movies i have had to endure this year
1,i do agree but it 's a good movie
1,as for it 's message the film is a bit too long
1,practically the entire film takes the first of its
1,in the first movie he was just the right man to be the one that he was
1,it is not that i do n't have the patience of a movie
1,it 's a very funny movie and the acting was excellent the directing is superb and there 's
1,instead it 's just a bunch of random characters who do n't know what to make of their
1,cable has to have a great deal
1,most of the actors are very good and it 's a shame that they did n't try
1,what 's with all the good points
1,liked the movie and i would say it is a great film for all ages
1,well the movie is a little too long for
1,instead of being a big budget movie this one is a complete mess of
1,haiku is a very bad movie
1,but the film 's only redeeming quality is the fact
1,the movie has a lot of action scenes but there 's a scene with a couple of guys running through some of the
1,an excellent film with excellent performances by both mcqueen
1,i think the director and director should not have made this movie at all
1,it 's a very good movie with a
1,that 's the only way i can think
1,on a side note the movie is about a young girl trying to get to the bottom line of her own life and is a little confused
1,i was n't sure what to expect when it was originally shown in my hometown but it was n't
1,the story was a bit confusing but it 's not that great either it 's a very good movie that i would
1,in the first film there is a lot of action
1,it 's just a bad film
1,it 's just a bad film
1,i do not recommend this movie to anybody who has n't
1,i have seen it three times
1,they 're the best thing about this movie and it
1,the movie is about a man who is in love with her
1,this movie is not for the squeamish or for those that are n't interested in seeing a good thriller
1,i do n't think that the actors were trying to portray a character that would
1,story line is a bit of the spoof but it is n't a bad
1,and the acting was so bad that i could barely care more about any of the characters or the actors
1,a very interesting movie and a great movie
1,this is a movie that should have been banned in a
1,think of it as the worst film in the world
1,he 's a very good director who has made a good film
1,those who are n't familiar in this film have a lot of fun with this one
1,from a technical point of view it 's not a movie to
1,john cusak is one of the most talented directors in cinema history
1,but i have no idea that the film was a real treat and it was not the best
1,a very good movie that is n't even funny
1,on this level it 's a very good movie with a lot more of a good script and a good cast
1,after a few minutes i was laughing hysterically hard
1,ballistic is one of the few movies that has a good plot and
1,from there onwards the film is not as bad
1,there 's also a good deal to be found here
1,it 's not a bad movie
1,but the film 's biggest problem was it had a lot more to it than the first two installments
1,every scene is the same as the first two films
1,the film is not only boring and boring and the acting is wooden
1,the film was a waste on the first two films
1,if it were to be shown on tv i 'd have given this movie a zero instead of the
1,hotel is a film that has no plot and is a very good movie
1,its a shame that it is n't available on
1,upon the arrival the movie begins with a group in the desert in the desert and the final battle between the three protagonists in the film
1,sam raimi 's direction is the best i 've ever
1,the movie starts off as a series of events and is
1,despite the fact that the film was made in color and
1,very little of that is the case of the film
1,ben stiller plays a character named sam and he is a bit of a jerk
1,anna paquin was the most convincing and beautiful woman i 've seen in years
1,i have n't been a fan for the past few years and i was n't impressed by the story
1,however i was not impressed by the movie and the movie was so boring that i was laughing hysterically
1,i think this movie is a masterpiece for those who
1,or even a little bit more than that
1,nevertheless it 's a very enjoyable and very entertaining movie with some very memorable scenes but it 's
1,apart from the fact that the story is about the characters the characters and their personalities are all over
1,what 's more the story is a simple one and one that is not
1,similar to that of the original and the original film
1,the story line of the movie is
1,i think that 's why i gave it 7 out there 10
1,robert montgomery as a young woman who has a onenight stand in a hotel and has a very small affair and a young man who has been in
1,some of the acting was horrible the story was weak
1,the movie was made by a bunch
1,i think that 's what this movie was about and i do n't think it was a bad film but it was n't bad
1,this is not the case with the film it is a very boring movie
1,instead the director is a master
1,even if it 's not a good movie to say the same
1,it is n't a good movie
1,pat morita was great as the villain and his character is very good and i think
1,i have never read so far as to say that this was the
1,from the first scene the viewer is reminded me of a very good movie
1,soon the two men get involved in the investigation of their respective friends and their friends
1,the film has a very interesting premise and
1,this is not a movie about a man in the world and
1,emulating the movie is an insult to all
1,ursula has to go through the process of finding her
1,still the film is not a great film
1,a lot like the film in the book but it was n't
1,despite this the movie does n't have the same plot line
1,when he 's a teenager and the girl is n't a good guy she is a little more tolerable and she 's just a bit
1,the film has a lot more going for them than the usual suspects of today
1,however the story is not very original and it 's not a surprise
1,audiences will find this movie a waste of my time and energy
1,preston 's mother has to be the best person to be killed in this film
1,this is the kind i have seen for years to finish
1,robert montgomery is excellent in his portrayal of the character
1,gem was a great movie for the time and it was a great movie
1,now i have seen the original version of the movie and i
1,matthew modine is a good choice for this role
1,mort has the power for the role of the young man who is the most famous character of the entire film but he 's also very convincing as a
1,even though this movie was made for the first half of the film it was a very
1,some of the acting was horrible
1,none the less a lot like it
1,this film is a must see for any fan of
1,however this is not a movie to be taken lightly
1,when i first watched the film on a sunday night in the early 90 i was shocked at the fact of me that this film has
1,i think that 's the point i do n't want
1,at first it 's a bit of an exercise in logic
1,franco 's direction of a film that was n't as polished as the first
1,a lot of it was shot on location
1,it was a very good movie
1,it 's a shame that it 's not available on dvd as a dvd
1,i was n't sure why the movie is so
1,she has the same role as a child
1,i think that it was a very good idea and i
1,one can also say that this is a movie about a woman and his daughter who are in love but are n't afraid to
1,the acting was good and the writing was very good but the movie did n't have much to do to redeem it
1,the story of the film is that the writer is trying too hard to be serious and the audience
1,not only did it look a little too much like a typical hollywood movie but it did have the same
1,it was so bad it was almost painful and the whole thing is just plain boring
1,the movie is about the power and the struggle of the people who have been affected by their lives
1,so i do n't think this is a good movie
1,the acting is good and i think that the
1,if i had to watch it again to see how the movie ended i would n't be able
1,i have never seen such a bad movie
1,i'm not sure why i did this movie because it was so stupid
1,in fact this is a very poor film that 's a
1,if you have a craving to see this movie you 'll find a copy of this film and you have a lot better on it
1,additionally it was not a movie
1,pretentious plot is a very bad one but i guess i 'll just say that it
1,even the music is n't the worst i can remember
1,one thing i can do to make me think that it is not a movie is it
1,jack lemmon plays a character who does not seem like a normal character
1,i was n't impressed when i saw this movie
1,fifty the story is not as simple and the acting as it is are in the
1,sorry but this is the worst film of the decade and i have n't read the book
1,adding a sense of realism to a film like this
1,the movie was n't even that great at first
1,the film is not a complete mess it does n't make much of a difference
1,of the three stories of all of them
1,i have seen it several many many many times
1,had the writer and producers of this movie have been a fan of the original and
1,in the end i found myself cheering for a good movie and it was so bad that it was actually funny to
1,in the first movie the characters are not so much more developed as the plot is revealed in the first
1,the movie has a lot to offer
1,too bad the film is n't even a good action film and is n't worth the time
1,it is the worst film i 've
1,angie dickinson was the only one who could n't get the part she was playing
1,probably a few of them are the ones that have the ability
1,with the possible exception that this movie was a major success i had a hard time believing the film was a success of mine and the director
1,plus this movie was so bad i could n't help to
1,first of the movie 's plot is about a group that is sent to the planet and the two
1,i have n't seen a movie that is worse than
1,but the story is so weak and ridiculous
1,i was surprised to find that this film was made on a budget
1,let it be a warning to all the people who made this movie to be
1,in this case it seems like the director has a camera and is n't a good editor and he 's obviously going
1,it is not the worst movie of it but i do n't think it is a bad movie because
1,so if it were to be made to be a good movie it 's a must
1,i have never seen a movie that has a good cast and a story about how
1,anyway i have to say that this movie is not for me
1,an old friend of mine who has been living with his father in the us suburb is now a very gifted man
1,a very good film that should have been shown on a more wider audience
1,the movie is about the same thing as a lot like that of the other
1,if you are into this sort you will be rewarded with the movie and the story
1,as i 've said the acting is superb but not a good performance
1,but i do think that the movie is just too long
1,there was a scene that was filmed in black and white and i would like to say that it is the
1,despite the fact that the movie was made on a shoestring in this film it 's a pity that it is not
1,another reason is that the movie has some very good actors
1,then the film is a bit of an oddity to
1,i have seen a lot better and more realistic and more realistic movies in this type
1,some people say that the movie has some redeeming qualities but it 's a little bit boring
1,andy garcia plays a young man who
1,zen is the best thing about the movie but
1,this is a film that should be seen by anyone who loves the book
1,by now you can tell that this is a very funny movie that 's a bit too much
1,but the real reason why the show is so popular has is that it
1,really the film is a very good one
1,but it 's not that good and the movie is a little too much
1,the film has a very interesting and very very very interesting feel to them
1,it 's not a good film but a lot of good
1,return to lonesome dove is a movie with no redeeming qualities to it but it is a very enjoyable
1,he 's a very funny actor but the rest of the cast is
1,despite this it is still a very good show
1,th film has a very good cast and a very nice pace to boot and the movie is very
1,the story line is very good and i think the director and writer were the only ones who had the patience to be a good person to get the
1,antoine was also in a coma with
1,the movie has a very nice atmosphere and a good pace
1,the movie has a lot of problems
1,unfortunately i have no idea why i was able to watch this movie because i could never get
1,mother is a very good movie and i hope that the next one will be able
1,power rangers is a very entertaining and enjoyable
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,takes the time of the film and make the story the characters in the movie is a bit of an
1,the story is a bit of an excuse to explore
1,i was so excited to find the film on the dvd
1,keanu reeves is a fine villain and he plays the
1,as i said it has the potential to be a classic but the story is n't really that great either
1,if i were to make a movie i would not be so engrossed with a good movie i have to say that i was n't disappointed
1,this is a movie that you should watch if you can get it on
1,why does n't she do the trick for her
1,as a result it 's not a bad film
1,two years later he is invited to a mental hospital in the woods of
1,do n't worry about this movie it is
1,say that the director was n't going
1,the film has a very interesting and interesting story
1,the merry and the dead end of my chair is a very good film
1,i think the movie was made for a buck and it was made
1,to make matters of the movie 's story line the film becomes a bit boring
1,ms de carlo was a very beautiful actress and i think
1,highly recommended for fans of the classic horror fan
1,i do think it 's a very good film and it
1,it 's a pity the rest of the movie was just as bad as the first
1,well the film was n't a bad one
1,in the meantime he 's not a good guy
1,the movie was a bit of an action thriller and the ending did not seem like
1,acting is ok but it 's a good film and a good film to watch with a couple of people who want a good film and some great actors to watch
1,the movie is about a young boy named seita played with a younger sister by a young woman who lives in the same apartment with
1,i was surprised to see the film
1,after all it 's a good thing to see a movie that has a good cast
1,however the plot was a bit thin for me because of the plot
1,it 's a shame that this movie did have some of the best parts in the movie
1,it 's not a good movie but it 's not
1,mickey dolenz 's performance is very convincing
1,i was so impressed with the film i was so
1,alex 's father is a man with a heart and a brain and a mother he has a crush in her
1,it has a very good ending
1,another thing that is missing was when he was in a wheelchair and a girl and a girl and a girl
1,and the ending is a little anticlimatic
1,hell it is a very good movie but not as much of an issue of the holocaust
1,ironically the film is about a woman who is a
1,main character is the one who gets to the heart and the other one has
1,i think the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,the movie has an interesting premise but that 's not a good way
1,he was a good guy but the movie is n't really
1,showing a woman in her underwear and a woman standing in the shower and talking about how she has to go back to the past and the girl
1,in the end it 's a very good movie and a very good movie
1,the film has a lot of problems but it is a very good story and a very good
1,steven soderbergh is the most talented filmmaker on the world
1,appear that it has been a long time since i 've watched a film with a similar theme and a story of
1,the film is very good and the acting by all is excellent as well but the story is so bad that i was surprised to
1,underrated film with an excellent cast including the likes of john gielgud
1,made in the seventies the film 's success is the fact that it is a very good movie that is a must watch
1,but the movie was n't really that bad
1,the film has a lot of good moments but i found the story very weak and the
1,did n't it even have the decency
1,i was expecting a movie that was a little slow and the plot had some
1,so i guess it 's a great idea that it is a movie about an ordinary woman who is a woman and is n't afraid for a woman
1,many things happen in the first film but the film does a very good thing with the characters
1,not to mention that it was n't a movie
1,for me it was just plain bad and the worst thing i 've seen in
1,for me the most important aspect of this movie has been that there is not a lot to recommend about it but it is
1,if i were to watch the first episode i would have been a little more
1,i think this movie should be made
1,almost every episode has its moments but it is still
1,suspect it is a film for a rainy afternoon
1,it is a movie that is so bad that the viewer should not be fooled by a
1,even when i was in a theater of my own i could n't stop watching
1,he 's the best actor in it
1,as for me the film is very entertaining and the acting and directing are superb
1,this movie is a complete mess
1,its a good idea for a film
1,as the story develops the story unfolds in the form of one
1,and the ending is a complete mess
1,overall this is a very enjoyable film and it 's definitely one
1,the story of the film was a bit too much for a movie of the week
1,how could you not get into the story and relate to what the movie 's plot had going for you
1,i do n't know how this movie ever got released theatrically
1,despite being a bit preachy the story is not that bad
1,it 's a very funny show and i really enjoyed it
1,no wonder it has to be a sequel to
1,i think it 's a good idea
1,this was a great story about a woman who is a bit of a geena davis fan and i think she is a great director
1,however the film is a very good and entertaining film with the best performance of a young actor who i 've watched in a long time
1,the film is about the struggle of the people who have the power to overcome the odds and the consequences
1,ted is an interesting character but the rest of
1,i think it is a great show that is a must see for
1,later i saw a preview of this film and thought it would suck
1,the film is not a documentary about how the media
1,in fact it 's not even that great
1,then there is some good acting
1,as i said before i was not surprised at how
1,made me feel like a fool in the first movie
1,boards of the movie is a film about the
1,it is a very funny and very touching experience of the whole
1,the film 's plot was very interesting but i was n't really sure who
1,this is not the worst film in the world
1,however the story of this film is so weak that it is almost
1,it is not the type movie i have seen but the film
1,instead of being able into a movie that is not only an attempt it succeeds in being a comedy and a drama
1,but the story is so bad it is hard to believe
1,i have n't seen the original version but it is still worth watching
1,a few years ago i watched it again
1,i have never been to a nintendo school where i can only hope this show
1,eventually he finds a way of collecting the information that the president is the one to kill him
1,bmovie 's are a bit more than that
1,in the movie 's defence it was the first film of the trilogy that was released
1,apart with the fact that the movie was a complete waste of film it would
1,there is nothing in my head that i can watch again and still laugh
1,gary is not a good actor but he 's a real talent
1,but the movie is a good mix
1,danny devito plays the part with a little
1,if it was n't for the good acting it would have been much better
1,it 's just not a good movie
1,the acting is good the story is good the characters are believable and the story is a little weak
1,i was so disappointed when i saw it
1,the movie has some nice moments in it but it just is not enough
1,the story is about a group who are trying to get a
1,well the film is n't as funny
1,but the film has the best elements of the film and the acting performances are superb and the story is a bit too complicated
1,i think this movie is a great piece
1,to be honest the story was so weak that i did n't care for the actors
1,while the film was shot in the seventies it still remains one to see and for those looking for the best
1,instead of the usual hollywood formula it 's not even a film
1,like the previous reviewer said the movie is n't that good and it does not make it any easier to follow the story
1,contrary the fact that it is a comedy it is not a movie
1,ok it 's not the best film i 've seen but
1,410 for the first 10 minutes or so
1,if you want something to watch and enjoy the film then you should definitely enjoy this movie
1,after a while you get a sense of the story and
1,bon diem was an amazing movie
1,nellie is a great actress and she is a great actress
1,it 's a shame that such movies are not available
1,ok the plot is pretty thin and there 's a lot more of them
1,c'mon this movie sucks it 's just plain boring
1,also i think the film is a good example of how a film can make you think that the director should have
1,i do n't know why this film has been made
1,the story is a little thin
1,it was n't even that great
1,martin scorsese 's direction of the film
1,anybody who has seen the original knows that the story is a bit different from the book
1,and it is a great movie
1,the acting is good and the script by neil simon and the characters are well developed
1,ive also heard that he was in a wheelchair when he was a teenager and it was a great movie
1,it was a good film but not in a bad movie
1,i have to say that i was impressed with the ending
1,kevin costner is a great choice for the role of the
1,answers are that there is a story
1,the movie was a complete disappointment
1,there was no real plot development and no plot holes
1,he was a very funny character and
1,he was a little more convincing than he did in the first film
1,the movie is not a comedy or an action movie
1,when i saw the movie it was n't that great
1,they are all the same but they 're not
1,watch this movie and then you wo like it is
1,being the first movie i was expecting to see a lot of movies and i
1,thanksgiving is the best of this series and the most important aspect
1,i do n't know what to do
1,there is a lot going on here and i 've seen
1,the movie was a complete disappointment and i do think that there
1,charles durning is the only one who can save the film
1,i do n't understand how anyone can get a hold of this film
1,of this movie 's plot line and its characters and the plot the acting the direction the cinematography
1,i do not recommend this movie unless you are looking for a laugh or a laugh
1,i have seen a lot more of them but
1,this movie does n't make a lick of money and it 's not a good movie to be taken
1,its not a bad thing to say that it has
1,but it is not that bad it is just not that funny
1,the film is about as good as the original and it is n't that
1,is it that the film is a total mess
1,this is a very funny movie
1,i do n't know what this film is trying to say but it 's not that
1,her character is not a very likable character and
1,but the real thing here i found was a good idea
1,if you are not familiar with the book you will probably find this film to really
1,not only is this film so much better
1,i was so excited when i saw this movie i did n't like the movie i did
1,knowing that the director and writer have a great deal going it is very good and it
1,ok the plot was pretty bad but
1,what a waste that this was a waste
1,through this movie we are left with a
1,i was expecting this to be a good
1,this is the kind i 'll watch
1,paul rudd plays the role with a smile and he 's a great actor
1,i have never read the novel and it 's not as good as i
1,but the film 's plot and the script are so bad that the whole
1,the story of the movie was very original
1,of the three films that i have seen in the past twenty years i have a fondness
1,i have seen a couple of episodes that i 've enjoyed but the show has been done
1,while this is n't exactly the best of it it is n't a bad film either
1,one of the best films ever to have graced the screen
1,although the film was made in the early 1990s it 's a great movie to look at
1,there are some very good performances in this movie but i ca
1,charlton nachle is a very good movie
1,i think that the movie should have been more successful
1,while the movie is a good idea
1,now i am a big fan
1,on a side of the screen we get a very
1,my favorite part of this movie is that it is n't a bad thing
1,while the film was n't as good and as i mentioned above the film is a complete mess
1,the movie is a little bit of the spoof but it 's not a great
1,when the film is over and over again and the movie is over
1,i do n't think i can see the movie again
1,the film is about the power of
1,it was so bad that i actually had to laugh out
1,the film is a very moving film
1,i think this is a great show and a
1,he 's just not the right type for the movie
1,it 's not the worst film i 've seen in my life but i have seen the
1,still it 's a very good and enjoyable movie
1,do n't get this wrong it 's a very entertaining film that is worth checking it out
1,this is one of the best films of
1,it has the most annoying characters in history and they 're all just stupid and uninteresting to boot
1,i do n't know if this was a bad film or not i
1,after a few minutes of torture and violence the film settles into
1,perhaps he should have known better but this was not a
1,no matter where you get to the end of the film it
1,the movie was made up of the
1,different characters and situations and the story of a man searching for his own life
1,duke and jane are a pair of men who get married and
1,i do n't think i can ever get enough time for this movie to go
1,by all means watch a good movie
1,s the best movie of the 90 year old virgin and
1,still the film was very funny
1,i think that the film would have made more sense if it had been a lot more
1,four years after i was born in 1980 and i was a fan of this film i was looking for a new film
1,considering the subject it is a very good film
1,any one of those who do not have to see the movie should see it
1,indeed it was a good idea for the movie but i do think it
1,she is the only one who is the only
1,every time she is on screen you 'll have to be very very hard pressed and for a movie to be a little too long
1,as a result of this film 's success it 's a very enjoyable film to look at
1,sometimes it 's a good thing to watch a film that
1,mclaglen is an interesting character but the story is a little too contrived
1,it is not a movie that is not only a visual feast but
1,errol flynn is excellent in his portrayal of the character
1,i was n't expecting the same to
1,the movie is about as funny as watching paint dry
1,so the story is not as good or original as it is a film
1,leading to a few scenes of the film i was surprised that it was n't
1,this movie is a waste of time
1,when you have the opportunity to watch it again and you 'll find yourself in
1,to say this is one of the worst films i have seen i 've seen it has to be one to avoid
1,the film is about as good as you 'll see
1,the acting is pretty good and there was some great action sequences
1,well it is a movie about the holocaust
1,and the film is not about the battle of war and
1,perhaps he is the best actor on this movie and it is n't a good idea for the director
1,i have n't seen this movie but i did find myself laughing
1,here 's where the similarities end
1,from a very young woman she has a good sense of humor that makes this a fun movie
1,i was so excited to find out about a movie
1,the story is a simple mix of two characters and a very good one at its most
1,the movie was n't a good movie
1,maybe the best part of my entire career was the fact the film was a bit long
1,in the movie 's case the movie is about a young girl
1,but the film is a little too slow
1,it 's a pity that it 's not available
1,all the characters are so likable that you feel the need
1,it 's just that the film is a complete bore that 's just not the right time to watch it
1,the movie has the same kind as the first one
1,how many times did you get a hold of a movie
1,the story is simple and the acting performances are good and it is a
1,everything about this film is so awful it makes me wonder how
1,but the film is a very good and enjoyable thriller
1,his character is not the most interesting character
1,but the story of the film was n't bad
1,when i watched this movie it seemed to be on the same shelf
1,a very good story about the struggle between the brothers of the family of both of the
1,i do not want a film to be a bad film
1,the story of the kelly family and the relationship between the two main characters
1,i think it 's a good film
1,sandra bullock is perfect as the woman who 's not a great actress
1,you have to wonder if the director was making a film that is so much more
1,the movie starts out well with the first half hour of the
1,what a great cast this film
1,lois chiles is a great actress
1,without the aid and the danger he has the best of him
1,almost every single one is a complete rip off
1,the film is about a young man who goes to his uncle 's house and
1,i was so excited that it would get a 3 for me
1,i do n't know how many times it
1,if you have n't seen this movie i would recommend it
1,all in all this is one to miss for a long time
1,starring john hurt as a young man who is sent
1,finally the story is a mess but it 's a very enjoyable film that
1,of all this i 've seen the original the lion king and the lion kane series and i was really impressed with
1,the film was a little slow but it was a bit too much
1,i was so excited to have a copy from my friend 's
1,her character was the best thing about this movie
1,she has a lot more fun with her than her character is
1,let 's face it the characters are not likable
1,i think that 's the best thing about this film
1,ultimately this was the only movie i saw that i would n't have liked
1,if the story had been told to have a good story line and the actors would have been better off it would have
1,the film is a bit slow but that 's all i have to recommend it and
1,cruel intentions were the most controversial elements to the movie
1,of course the film is n't as good as some other films but it is a good film
1,the film is not a bad thing
1,it 's the same kind that the director did n't even try and make a movie
1,clich and the movie has some of my favorites
1,this is the first film that i have seen in quite some time
1,the movie has some great moments and a few moments of humor
1,those who have seen the movie and have seen the first film have a sense about the plot and characters
1,the acting and the plot is very weak and it has a few flaws
1,the movie was shot with the intention
1,he is a man who can be seen in a very light manner and that
1,the movie is a complete failure and i would have to say that it was a waste of time and money i spent on this movie
1,not to mention that the movie is a total mess
1,here is a movie that you will see as the main theme of a man 's journey
1,grant and the rest of us have the most difficult to watch the film
1,now this is a film that i would n't have missed
1,well i do n't know why i did not watch this movie because i was so bored
1,being the first of a string that was released i was expecting a lot more of the same kind of thing
1,i think it was a great idea for the movie to be a bit of fun to follow
1,because of this movie i have to admit that i am not going to give this movie any
1,theres no spoilers at all but it
1,death wish is a very good film
1,jack nicholson plays a young man whose
1,yeah the acting is bad and there are no good actors in this film either but it 's a good movie to watch
1,at least it 's not a good
1,my favorite part of the film was when a girl is killed by the girl in a car accident
1,sidney 's character has a great deal of time to go on and the movie does n't have a whole lot to
1,then the story goes downhill and we see a bunch of people who do whatever you want to know
1,stunningly bad acting horrible script and a very bad soundtrack and a few moments of
1,patricia fitzgerald is a very good actress
1,this movie does a good job of
1,but the real thing here was that the director and writer did not seem to have any idea of the real world
1,the film was made by the same guy that made the first film
1,the acting is pretty good with some of her usual lines and some of the acting was decent enough to be good
1,yet it is a very enjoyable movie
1,one of the most interesting movies of the year was the first time i saw the first one
1,all in all this is not a movie that i would watch over a month ago and i have n't
1,the story of the film is a little
1,as a fan of this series i was surprised by how many episodes i 've seen
1,typically i think the movie is a bit of the same
1,all the characters are so real that it 's
1,we get an insight into the characters
1,good luck for the director and the director for this film
1,it 's just that the story was
1,i have to say that the acting in this movie is horrible
1,was he trying hard to make it a success to the public
1,audiences will not find this movie to be a total waste of time
1,it is not a movie that you should watch and you
1,all the actors and actors were all great and the acting was good and the writing was excellent the directing was ok the costumes were good and i was impressed to find out that it was n't going near be an epic film but
1,rimmer is one of his most underrated and most successful film noir and
1,but it 's a shame that the director did n't even
1,keanu lancaster and the rest are just
1,the film was shot in black and white
1,as for the film 's message the movie was a bit too predictable
1,the film 's main drawback is that there is no plot
1,a lot more of them are made in a
1,the movie starts out with a couple going to the woods where a group of friends are invited into an old house where they
1,not only is the film hugely engaging the characters themselves
1,look like they 're going through the same thing
1,he was the only person who knew how to act and he
1,recently i have been looking for a copy for
1,the story line is a little confusing
1,the story is a bit confusing and there is a lot to like
1,he was a very good guy but i was wrong
1,we are left with the feeling that the film was going to make you laugh
1,this was an excellent and very entertaining movie that had a good cast and it was a real treat
1,good movie with a good cast a good
1,tanguy is one who has to deal and adapt
1,strong and believable characters are all in the way of a great story
1,the acting and the script are so
1,i think this film was a waste of
1,it 's a shame that the movie is so bad that i do
1,right now the story is not a good idea and i would n't have cared for the characters
1,the movie has some of the best scenes i have watched in a while and i have to say the whole thing was so funny and i
1,christopher walken 's character has the ability
1,sudden impact is the story that makes
1,let 's face that the director has a lot better to do with it 's
1,but the story is so weak that it becomes laughable and the characters are n't funny either
1,do n't be afraid if your a big b fan
1,i have to say the movie has the best acting i can recall
1,it has been done by other directors and directors and i have seen some pretty good ones
1,when he 's not a bad actor he 's just not good
1,save this film at any costs
1,maybe it 's a good film to watch
1,can you believe the film is about the same thing as the other
1,one of the best things i have ever said
1,the movie was a bit long
1,for me the best thing about this movie was its lack
1,this was the only movie i have had to sit through
1,and the movie was a little too short
1,it was the worst film i have seen in a while
1,practically the whole movie is about the man and his wife being killed by the police
1,an excellent movie with excellent performances by all concerned
1,4 a woman who was a woman in the middle east
1,it 's a very good film
1,it 's a shame because the plot is very thin the characters are underdeveloped and so are all the
1,we 're not supposed for a film to linger in any kind of sense
1,it 's a great movie that will be remembered for all its faults but the film is
1,until the final battle scene we get an idea about the origins that come from the first two films and how
1,congratulations for the cast to be the best part of the
1,to be honest i do not think that the director was aiming to be
1,and the acting by the whole cast is very bad
1,there was also a scene in which
1,55 minutes into the picture i was n't bored
1,however i do n't think that the movie is so good it was n't
1,last night i had a chance to see it
1,the film is a bit long and i would n't have been a better
1,probably the best movie of all time
1,this movie was not for me but it is worth watching for its visual style
1,if you are a fan and have seen the movie you know that
1,those who do this film are a very good film and should be avoided by everyone
1,the film was shot with an almost limited budget but the director and writer decided it would have been a lot better
1,this film is so bad it is almost comical in a
1,it 's a very good film that
1,quick spoilers ahead i was surprised by how much of this movie is
1,well this is a good movie
1,note that it is the most controversial film i have seen in a
1,i have to agree the same way the director did a very good job of making it to the screen and i think it was very good
1,it 's not a great show it 's just not as bad and i can only imagine that it is n't a movie for everyone
1,but i do n't have to worry that
1,however the story is n't too original and there are too few holes in the
1,much like i did n't get it
1,wenders 's direction and the cinematography are excellent
1,and the ending is very good
1,the acting in this film are horrible
1,paz kotto 's performance in the movie is
1,likewise the film has a lot to offer
1,i think the director was the only person who could possibly be sued
1,perkins is a very strong actor and i have seen many movies
1,if you have n't seen this film you have no idea how to
1,his character has a lot of fun to it but it is a little bit
1,do n't waste my time on a bad
1,this was the first movie in which the actors were not professionals
1,you can see that the film is a very good film but
1,and it is a very good movie
1,then the two of them are killed and killed and killed and they have a baby and they are both dead together with the same girl
1,we 're told the truth of a film that is n't as good as the
1,watch the original film instead because it is a good
1,note that i do not like the movie
1,i have to say i did n't care about the characters
1,first the plot was a bit farfetched but i was
1,rudolf is not the most interesting character but
1,i think this film is one of my favourites to see
1,i do think the movie is a little too long for the
1,sorry but this is a great show
1,in a sense of the story of a serial mom in the past
1,as the story continues it 's a little too slow and too
1,some of the other comments here are so good
1,maybe it was because of the fact i was watching the film
1,russell crowe is a great actor and i hope that the producers will get the chance for
1,in fact it 's not the worst thing in the
1,see the original version of the original
1,like the first movie it 's a bit of the same as the original
1,this was a movie i would watch again if it had been made
1,in fact the film has no real plot no plot
1,admittedly the film was a waste for
1,he 's the kind of guy who gets his ass kicked by an angry woman
1,the film is not about an aging woman who has been murdered by a child and has a daughter named missy who has her own life
1,major spoilers ahead the story is n't really bad but it 's not enough for you and i think that is the case
1,i have n't read a novel that i 've
1,i have never heard about a movie where the characters were supposed and the story lines are not that good
1,this is a great movie to be sure if not for a laugh
1,this is not a movie to watch if only to have the opportunity to see again and again
1,i think that 's a good sign
1,two men are sent to prison to investigate the murder of the president
1,you have to be a fan to
1,and that is what it does in the end and
1,my advice is to avoid this one
1,cuba gooding jr plays the lead character
1,the film 's main drawback with the film was the fact the director was
1,first of the film is a little slow and boring
1,fun to see but the rest is n't bad enough
1,or the fact it is n't even a
1,after all this is a great movie
1,i think that this is a very good movie and i recommend it to anyone looking for some good
1,he is a very talented director
1,it 's a shame to see such an ensemble cast of characters
1,but i think this is the best of all the movies and that it 's not the
1,the film was made for a few bucks
1,if you want a good scare watch this
1,all in all i would recommend watching this
1,duane 's mother is an excellent character
1,this is a film for those of you who want
1,a lot happens in the movie and i have to admit i was very impressed with this one
1,but the real problem is that the film is so
1,yes i know that the movie is not about an actress who 's been a star but i think she 's the
1,he 's the only one who has ever graced the screen
1,back in those days i have been watching a movie that is so bad that it 's almost funny to watch because it has a few funny moments
1,if i had to choose to watch the movie again i could have
1,it is a movie that is not
1,dame judi dench is a very talented singer and is very good as the young lady and her mother and daughter
1,i was so impressed by this story of the real mishima
1,if you 're a fan of hers and have seen the original you know you are not missing anything
1,i was expecting something more from a film with a few friends who would have been better off renting it
1,for the most bizarre and stupid of all of these
1,she is a very talented woman but she is not in this movie at all
1,too bad it is n't a film
1,guy pearce 's character is the only one who seems to know what he 's doing in the first place
1,the movie is a little bit of an attempt to cash in at the very very
1,maybe it would 've made more money if it had a more competent cast
1,granted the movie does n't have a plot
1,so what if the film has to go
1,on a positive note this film is a masterpiece in the sense of realism
1,on top of this the movie is very boring
1,2 the plot is very simple and the characters are n't believable and are n't believable
1,as a result the plot was n't even that bad but the acting and directing were horrible
1,i was expecting this movie from an old vhs player to watch it and i
1,films are not so bad it is good
1,the movie is a very good example
1,a lot of the scenes were just plain stupid and i could n't help but laugh
1,it is a movie that you will
1,this movie is not for everyone who wants something to watch but it
1,but the film has some good points in it
1,aspects of this film have changed from other films
1,the story is very interesting and the characters and situations are very believable
1,outside of the movie 's plot is the main character 's character
1,according to this film 's title the film is about an english woman who has been kidnapped
1,off of the other films i had to watch this one
1,ace and the beast is an enjoyable movie that is worth seeing
1,if i had to pick my head i 'd have the right amount of luck for a film that
1,at least it is n't a good film
1,i have to say that i was impressed
1,of this type is that the film is a very good movie
1,still it is not the greatest movie ever made
1,instead of a bad guy in a rubber mask and the
1,nestor de janeiro was an excellent movie for me and my friends and i were watching the movie for the first half
1,of course the story is a bit too much
1,i think the film was a great success to
1,in fact it 's the worst movie ever made
1,the film 's plot is about a group of four friends in the same town
1,and it 's not the same
1,there 's no real reason to watch it unless you have n't read the book or seen it
1,the story is simple and it has a very good story but it has some good twists and turns and some good action sequences but it 's
1,whomever wrote a script for this movie must 've
1,the movie is a very good film
1,its a great movie to show that you can do something about it
1,the film is a complete bore to watch but the story itself has its moments but
1,why does the film have a plot and a few
1,i think the movie has a great cast that is n't really a good thing in the movie
1,this movie is so awful it 's funny to sit through and it does not even try
1,the story is very simple and the characters are so real and believable and so well
1,the movie was a little slow but the plot was pretty weak and i did not care about the characters and their motivations were just so stupid
1,the movie is a complete mess of an action movie
1,also the movie was a complete mess in my opinion
1,helene is an interesting character and a good example of what a young actress can be and she 's just a bit
1,is it a bad film and a good film to be sure
1,it is n't a good film
1,it 's a shame the only negatives are to see the movie
1,it was a great movie to show that you could not be a fan
1,when the two main characters are killed they are not even close
1,this film is not only a comedy but it is very
1,the film 's main weakness was the fact it was n't a complete waste of
1,i think this is a very bad film
1,the acting in general was good
1,but it is n't that bad either it 's
1,i do agree but the movie was n't so bad it 's good i just saw it
1,garish is the only one who has
1,the film is a very funny film
1,it is the story of a man who has a heart of gold
1,does anyone know if the film will
1,apparently the filmmakers were not aware about the story
1,you know the movie was n't a
1,obnoxious and dumber and the worst of
1,the story is simple and the acting is very good with some of the finest performances of her
1,wow the movie was a little slow at times but the plot
1,meanwhile a man who has been killed by a woman who was a child and a man
1,summarily a group is killed by a group of bikers in
1,the film is about two men who have sex with each
1,why do i care about this movie so many times i have
1,it is not even a good movie
1,them all are the best things about the
1,i was n't impressed with this film and it was a waste
1,not to be confused by the end but i think this film will appeal as a film
1,do n't worry to watch the movie
1,i'm glad i did n't have a chance to see this movie
1,but it 's a good movie
1,on the other side of the spectrum the movie is very funny and it is very funny and funny at the very beginning
1,so what 's the meaning of the film
1,shot in the dark it is an intimate and realistic story of a man 's quest for a man who is a man
1,it was so funny and so sad
1,ordinarily i was expecting a movie about an old lady who was a little more interested and she would be a
1,this is one movie that i would recommend to anyone who enjoys
1,i have never heard a movie so well so so much more
1,you have a lot of fun
1,i have to say i was a bit confused about the movie
1,it was a waste for the time
1,what 's more i can say the movie was
1,if you have seen this movie you have no idea what it is about
1,it is the best film i have ever seen
1,one can say the movie 's biggest flaw is the fact it was shot
1,their performances were excellent and the acting was good
1,as i said before i have seen the movie and i do n't
1,i have to wonder if the director had to make this movie to the bottom
1,we have a bunch of people who are in their late thirties and have
1,in fact this movie was made for television
1,perhaps the director is trying too to make this film look like it was shot on the cheap video camera
1,the acting in general are very good
1,here 's another thing that is good about a film
1,but the real reason for this film to have to be to
1,as a fan of his films i was impressed that he was n't in this one
1,michael dudikoff plays a character who 's a little bit too old for his part as a villain
1,he 's not a bad guy he 's not a bad actor but he
1,the movie starts out well enough but then turns into an overlong melodrama that is n't even remotely
1,if you are a huge fan like me and enjoy it and you want to see
1,never mind a good movie that has been made
1,keep this movie at a time
1,this is not a movie for you
1,at least it was funny but i was not prepared enough to get the movie out
1,the movie starts out with an old man walking through the woods with the help of
1,oh yeah it 's a little slow at
1,your average viewer is the type
1,fortunately this is not one film that i can only assume it 's a little bit more than just
1,who is a man who is in a coma
1,if i had to give it the benefit of being a good film
1,the story is simple enough but the story itself is n't very well done
1,give it an 8 if you are a fan and want to be entertained
1,the acting was n't too bad
1,and it 's not even a great
1,210 i was a bit surprised that it was made in
1,its a good movie but not the greatest
1,it 's a great show for kids
1,it is a shame to have seen
1,see it if only to see it again
1,the story is simple but there are some good twists to keep
1,i was surprised that this movie did have
1,but this is one of those movies i 've seen
1,not only does it have a few moments in common with a lot but it also is not that funny to watch and it 's
1,when i was watching a movie i felt like i had just wasted my time with this movie and the movie did n't
1,the movie has an interesting premise and
1,the acting was good but the story and acting was
1,thanks to the excellent performance of the young victoria the young woman is a very beautiful
1,as i watched this film i was very impressed
1,the film was shot in a small town in california
1,not to mention that it has a lot of potential for it
1,this is not the case in that one
1,yes it is n't a great movie but it is a great movie
1,well i was wrong and it is a very bad movie
1,the movie is a very good movie and it 's a good thing
1,that was the best thing in it
1,this movie is a great piece
1,michael ironside plays his role in this
1,once again the movie has been a lot better
1,patrick mcgoohan is a genius as the storyteller and the movie
1,cornell is a good actor but i ca n't say i am surprised that he is a good actress in his career and that
1,310 i was a bit surprised by the ending but
1,if it 's a film that is so bad i would be ashamed for a refund and not watching it again but i will say i did n't think
1,but the film 's biggest problem is that they are n't even in the film
1,later on she becomes a very young man who 's been a bit too long
1,that is the best thing about this film it
1,leonard maltin was the best in the business
1,i do think that the director should have been shot at the beginning
1,for a film that has been released on video and dvd it is a very good one
1,estevez is a good actor and he 's very believable in the lead but he is n't the
1,sometimes the movie is a bit long
1,but it is a movie that is
1,i do n't understand why they would n't have made this movie
1,this is a film for everyone
1,lets face this movie is a very good movie to watch
1,it is a movie of all time that is not to be missed
1,as the movie opens the story becomes a little bit confusing and boring
1,my favorite part in the entire episode is the one with luke
1,the story of a woman and his son who live in the same age as their husbands and their parents is very good
1,kevin costner was a great director
1,ever since then i 've seen a few movies that are good and this one is not one
1,if it had been released theatrically it would have been a little better
1,american city' is a film that is not only a
1,still it is the worst film of 2001 and the
1,ultimately the movie has a lot more action and
1,this was the first of three movies
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,after a few years of the week he was murdered by a group he has to be a big man
1,fans who are not in the mood for the
1,a good example is how the film 's story is about the
1,adam west plays his usual self and the character is played by an extremely talented cast and a nice supporting
1,some of the scenes were just a little too long
1,there was a bit of nudity but there was a lot of sex scenes that are not even
1,i was so impressed with the story
1,directed with great skill by the talented director and director john boorman
1,it 's not even a movie
1,his performance is very good and the movie does a nice enough of it
1,spoiler spoilers i was expecting something like this
1,were they going to be in the film for no real reasons
1,just a few examples of this movie
1,i think this was a pretty good film but the script was so weak and the dialogue was
1,those of you looking for something like this
1,the story line has a lot of holes in it
1,in the end he 's a good person who can be a hero
1,you can watch the movie and enjoy watching it
1,s the only one who could actually act and is not a
1,she 's not a very talented actor
1,such as the scene where he is in an accident where the girl is lying at the door and the camera is blurred and the camera pans around the screen in the background
1,baseketball 's character is a little bit too much for the character to play in
1,watch out for a good story
1,with the exception of the first film the movie is pretty much a rehash of the original
1,first of all the acting was horrible but i did not think it would
1,i have n't been a great critic but
1,this was a movie i would n't watch again
1,nothing is ever explained and i do n't think it was meant to have a plot
1,it is a movie that is a
1,i think the film was a little too slow for
1,from this perspective it is a movie that has a lot to offer
1,the movie was shot in color and it was a big budget
1,for those who are interested in this film i would say that the film is not a good film
1,after seeing this movie i was very impressed
1,during a time when the young man was
1,if you want a movie to be entertained by a bunch of bad actors then go see the
1,that 's a good sign for this movie but the fact
1,but the movie is a bit too long
1,the movie was n't even bad enough to make me laugh
1,however the film does a lot more to
1,a lot more than the average hollywood film
1,regarding that the movie is n't about a man and his mother who have a relationship and the two become friends and
1,am i going to say it is a good film
1,one can also imagine that the director and writer have a lot of problems with the movie and that it is a good film for the whole
1,the acting is good and it 's hard to imagine why they did this
1,as a result i could n't help to feel sorry for the actors
1,well it 's a good thing that the director has done so much with the movie and his films are the most expensive
1,i have to say that i 've always loved the movie but i have
1,thus it 's just that the director and
1,it has a very good ending
1,that was a very good thing
1,the story line has a lot to do with a good story but it 's not enough
1,the movie was a bit too much to be taken as it was in the film as
1,no matter how many years ago i saw it again on tv at night and was very impressed
1,too bad the film is n't a good movie it 's not as funny as the first two
1,the movie starts out as an interesting idea but it does have its moments in it and it 's a
1,the acting is horrible the story is bad
1,because the story was n't bad
1,once again the movie was a complete disaster but i was surprised at what it is trying to achieve with the film
1,beautiful photography by john mctiernan and an amazing cast
1,the movie was shot on a cheap camera in a very grainy manner and the editing was terrible
1,and the movie is so funny
1,burn the clock is the first of a trilogy of the series
1,when the movie is n't over the head the movie is n't a complete
1,an old friend and his daughter are trying to get their money across the border
1,it 's a shame the movie is n't available
1,but the film does n't really have to be
1,a very interesting and entertaining film about a
1,now the film 's plot was pretty
1,wow i 've seen this movie and i have to say the acting was pretty good and there are lots better actors
1,remember that it was the first of three tours to be released
1,it has a very good plot line
1,the story of the movie and the characters is so interesting
1,as a result the plot is a bit of an excuse for the
1,as for the rest of his work i would like
1,the acting is horrible the directing is worse than usual
1,it 's a pity to see a movie with a budget that has
1,but i was so disappointed by that
1,we have a lot better movies to watch
1,and it is a great film for the time
1,for those who do it is the most accurate thing in the
1,marianne is a very good actress and she is a joy to behold and is one of the
1,to make this film more of an oddity it was made in the first place
1,serial killers were a lot better than this
1,i think the reason why this is a good thing was that it 's not a movie
1,hotter yet the film is a very good one
1,cool and funny this was a great show
1,the movie was made in the early seventies and the film is
1,anyways i think that it 's not a bad
1,in the first part the characters were n't really a bunch of people who had a good time together
1,in this film we see the two young lovers of the same age
1,piven is the only one who has
1,the story of this movie is about a group that is trying for the same thing
1,they 're not the only people that have been able
1,there was no reason to be in this movie
1,as a matter of view i was n't surprised to find out the
1,would n't it be a good movie
1,the story is about an evil man who kills people
1,if you want something a good movie you can tell the story is a little too convoluted and too predictable for
1,fortunately the movie 's plot is so predictable
1,there are a few moments that do n't really matter but the overall story of this movie is very very good
1,yet the story is so simple that you can feel
1,otherwise i 'd say it is a movie that is not only
1,some people say that this movie is a masterpiece
1,when i was watching this movie i thought the acting was great
1,a few years back the film was released in a similar format to the original
1,the film is very well directed but the script is
1,now i am a big fan but it 's a shame that such movies are not given more credit for this
1,the film 's story is about the search for the lost
1,crime and the beast is a film of a film that has no redeeming value whatsoever
1,all of the actors and director have done better work
1,to make a long film about the story is the fact that there is a lot of action in there the film is n't as exciting as it sounds but it 's still a
1,other than that the film does n't make a whole
1,the story is simple and the characters are very
1,i do think the film is quite a good movie
1,the story is very interesting and it has a very good cast that includes the great
1,sure it 's not the best movie ever made and i have n't read the novel
1,then there was a little girl
1,he is the only person that could possibly have a better chance to be
1,i have never read the original book and i was very impressed by it and thought it
1,they have to make the movie as
1,but the film does have its moments
1,and it 's the only thing you can do to save the
1,she has the ability and she 's so beautiful in her role
1,the film 's premise is a little confusing but the acting and direction is excellent
1,no one has to have a clue about the
1,though it 's still very interesting and the story itself was good it
1,i was n't impressed by the film 's plot
1,a very interesting movie that should be viewed for all
1,the story is about a group that are invited from a
1,i have to wonder why they did so
1,since i have never been so compelled into watching it again i can only hope that someone else would make it a
1,while it 's a little bit of an extreme to watch a movie with a few exceptions i still found myself nodding off
1,considerable spoilers the movie starts out as an interesting premise but the characters do nothing to advance the story and the characters are all
1,the acting was good the plot was ok and the story
1,william shatner plays an excellent role in the movie
1,in fact it is n't a great movie
1,just like i did i had to watch it
1,whenever i saw this movie i thought it was
1,as a result the film is n't as good as it was in the book
1,i was n't really impressed with the story and i found it to have been a bit too long for my own
1,barbara steele 's acting is very good as well as her acting abilities
1,it was so funny and it was so refreshing to
1,if you 're looking for a film about a young woman you should
1,flesh and gore are not the only ones that are n't bad
1,how did he come to be
1,the movie is a little slow but it is n't a
1,during a time of the civil west a group of friends are killed off by a group that has escaped from the island of new york
1,years later when the movie was released it 's not
1,still it was not a bad movie
1,i have never been so disappointed with the film as it
1,one of the most interesting things about the film is how the film is shot
1,this is not a movie for everyone involved in the making of this movie
1,well the movie does not have a excite ending
1,this film is a must see for any fan
1,but the film is a little too long
1,as for me the film is a very good film and the actors are great and the script is great
1,the film is a complete mess with a very bad ending and an awful acting
1,the acting was terrible the script was awful
1,the acting and direction are very good
1,you 'll have to see the movie if you 're looking to see it
1,this film was a great movie
1,by the time i watched the trailer for this film the film had a
1,this was the first time i saw the movie
1,i do think it was a great show
1,if it had been made in color or the music and it was a bit more of it 's time it would have been much better
1,this is the kind that makes this movie so great as it is in the same category
1,van sant 's direction is excellent as the camera work is breathtaking
1,the acting is very good and the
1,sandler is the only one who is a good actor and he 's very good
1,the film is a complete waste
1,a good example is how the movie 's
1,the story is simple and is not a good thing to watch
1,you can see the director of his own life in the movie
1,now this film is a must see and for all ages
1,in fact the only thing that is n't really the most ardent of
1,i was so impressed by the story
1,that 's the best thing to come out
1,the acting is good and i have to mention that the film was a bit slow at all and the ending was
1,do n't get this wrong it 's pretty good
1,and the movie does a great job with the plot
1,the movie has an interesting message about the lives and problems and relationships of those people
1,lucky enough to be the best movie of all
1,but the real reason for this is that the
1,there 's no reason for that
1,i think the movie was a little
1,at least it 's worth the wait to see
1,normally i do enjoy this film but i did n't think it was
1,this film does a lot better than the others in it 's own right but it 's not that bad
1,the acting is very good and it has a very good cast
1,not a great film but a good enough to be able for the viewer in a way that i never felt
1,young woman is an excellent actress and she
1,the acting is horrible the story line and continuity are so bad that it 's laughable and the
1,john cusak plays the lead and he does a decent turn here
1,the film is not about the war or the war of the war it is an excellent example of
1,in the end i found myself wondering what was the point
1,when i saw the preview for the first time the movie
1,hooper is a genius and he 's not a good director
1,this film is not for people who want to watch it
1,bravo to the cast for this one
1,unlike other movies this one is a bit of the fun
1,just like the previous film the film was a
1,the movie starts out very promising but the acting was so bad it 's almost embarrassing
1,it is a shame that such a
1,at the same time a movie that is supposed and tries to make us laugh
1,we have a bunch that is a bit too old
1,i have never been a huge austen film buff but
1,the film was made for a very low budget and the acting was pretty good but it
1,bend your socks and you 're a big
1,i think it 's a shame that the movie was so bad
1,and that is why i gave it a 2
1,he has to be the most talented character in the history
1,even though the movie has a lot to do with the story the acting the story and the direction all make this a must watch film
1,this is not a movie that is so
1,that was one reason why this movie did n't make any sense at
1,this movie has no plot and no
1,still it is not that bad it is
1,a lot like that in this film
1,that 's a big problem for a movie about the evils
1,this movie is so bad it 's funny to watch but the fact is the movie has a lot to it that makes it a good movie to watch
1,he 's not a bad person
1,excellent acting by the whole cast and the actors who are all very talented and are also excellent
1,since it 's a very bad thing that 's just wrong
1,he has the right amount of money and he is not
1,what is the deal with this movie which is a very good movie and a very funny
1,mornay and her friends and the other actors have a lot better to work
1,the movie is about the struggle between the two main characters and how it
1,if i were to watch a movie i could have been a little more
1,it 's a shame that the director never got the recognition to make this one
1,they are the only one in this movie and i think that is the point
1,the acting was good but the story line was weak
1,as i mentioned before it is n't the worst movie i 've
1,now i have to say that it 's a great movie
1,dear readers of the show and i do n't think that the
1,when the film is released i can see how the director of photography and film should have made the film a classic
1,while i was n't expecting much from the film i was very impressed with
1,do yourself a big favour and go watch this movie for yourself it is a good example of
1,her acting is so good that you can feel sorry about her
1,i have never been a fan ever since the first film
1,i think that 's what the story is about and
1,when you see the first one you will notice how it will get the rave
1,what 's the difference with the movie and why not
1,resourceful to his own son and his mother he is a little more than he
1,plus it has a lot to live with
1,this movie is so much better than this
1,naschy was n't a good director
1,this is the kind of film i have to watch over the weekend and i have never forgotten it
1,a few minutes later i was bored
1,my favorite scene was the scene with tom selleck
1,chicago is a movie with no real life
1,de palma 's film is an excellent and entertaining movie
1,just a little bit of a stretch for the viewer
1,these are some of his best work in this film
1,initially i think the movie is very good
1,the movie was shot in a very small town with some of the best
1,after all this is a film that is so much better
1,for the first half or two i was surprised to see that the
1,jason priestley and john goodman were great
1,the acting was terrible the directing is awful the directing
1,we 're not sure if the actors are the bad guys and the
1,i think the director should have been
1,it is n't a good film and it is not for everyone who loves
1,bryan lee 's performance is so overthetop and the plot just does not work for the movie
1,it 's a shame because the story line is n't very good
1,this film is a complete mess
1,you have a good time watching it
1,so if it was a comedy i would n't

1,however the plot is not that good
1,in the end i found myself wondering whether the writer had a
1,the movie was a little slow but the story was very interesting
1,if i was to watch it i 'd say that i am going through the whole movie
1,pretty soon the story becomes a bit more complicated
1,the story is simple and the characters are believable
1,the movie has a lot of action
1,i do agree that the film is not
1,the story of the movie is a bit of a mess and it is n't
1,i was expecting something from a movie to be a horror movie

1,when i first saw the preview on this movie i was very impressed
1,films like these two are the ones that are made for
1,if you are looking to see a good movie about a serial and an old man
1,although i was n't expecting much from this movie and was expecting a great movie i was disappointed
1,if you have n't read the novel or read this review read it and watch it
1,an excellent film that is worth seeing
1,he was the most likable actor in the movie
1,in the meantime the only person who has to be
1,and the film is n't that bad
1,the story is simple the acting is bad the effects worse the plot is stupid and
1,disney has made a movie about a bunch in the past that is a great movie
1,but the film 's plot and direction are
1,as for me i was surprised that it was n't available for
1,and i do n't care about any of the people who are trying to get the best out of it but i ca only say it is n't
1,the story line is a joke and the acting was horrible and the story was so bad that i could n't believe the actors
1,the story line was very predictable
1,when the first episode was released in 1993 i saw the movie and i was amazed that i had never seen such films like this and i 've seen
1,and it is a very funny movie and
1,my advice is to avoid it
1,my favorite part was when the girl and the girl are talking about it in an old house where they are trying
1,it 's just not a bad movie
1,i do n't know why i did this
1,marisa martino is the best thing here but this film is n't a complete disaster
1,the acting and the direction is very good with the cast and production values
1,the story is very simple and it is not a good idea that the story is a good thing
1,but it was a little bit too short and
1,12 years ago the movie was released in a very small budget of 500
1,in the first part of the movie the characters were very well played and they were all very likable
1,i do think the movie is very good
1,this was the first movie to get me to believe that the film
1,technically i think it 's a very interesting story
1,you know the kind you 're watching but it just does n't seem to have a sense of humor or tension or meaning to it either
1,making a movie about a woman 's love for a young woman who is a bit of fun with
1,and that 's what the film is supposed to do
1,he is a great actor and a great actor
1,all in all this is one of the worst
1,most people will probably find it unsatisfying that they are not allowed to make a film like this
1,and the acting is pretty good
1,another thing the movie has is the cinematography
1,some of them are so good that you wonder
1,as for the film it has some good acting and some good performances
1,towards a certain time when the movie was released i was expecting a lot of the same old stuff
1,one of his most important films is the story of a young girl who is attracted to his wife 's death
1,there was no need to be told that the director wanted a lot of the same actors to
1,on the way to the prison the movie becomes a very interesting and entertaining thriller about a young man who moves into a world that is
1,it is a movie of a young woman and her
1,you 'll never know what to expect
1,the story is simple and the acting is n't great but the story and the acting is great and i think that it is a must see
1,consider the fact this film is a comedy
1,this movie is not for me at least for me it is not
1,anyway this movie is a must for all fans of the genre
1,everything is so bad it 's hard
1,it was so bad i was n't laughing at it and
1,most of these people do n't have much
1,nearly every character is the stereotypical and annoying stereotype
1,it was a good idea to put
1,and that 's why the show was so popular and the show
1,yes i have n't been to the extent that this was a movie that was
1,as a fan i was not disappointed with this movie but it is very good
1,unfortunately the film is so boring that it 's hard
1,let me tell you that the movie has a lot of problems
1,i was so bored by this flick that i could barely see how the film ended up being so bad
1,kathleen stanwyck 's character has a lot more than she bargained for
1,it is a shame that such a film is so overlooked
1,i do n't know why i did n't watch this show
1,this movie was so bad it was
1,that is the only reason i gave the film a rating
1,the movie has an allstar cast
1,this was a movie i 'd watch over the summer of
1,its a good movie and i recommend this movie for anyone
1,then there is the fact it 's a little too long
1,this is a movie that is a waste of your talents to watch
1,while the movie is n't as good as its title the film was a bit
1,yes it 's an action film
1,a good cast is wasted in a very small part
1,i was so impressed when the film ended
1,interviews with other people and the director of the film is a bit too harsh
1,of course the story is n't that bad and there 's a lot of bad acting and the acting was bad
1,obviously this movie is a complete failure
1,rather than a movie with no plot no character development no real plot and no suspense
1,on this one he is a good actor and is a real treat to watch
1,nowhere near the caliber of his films
1,the movie was made in 1993 and it
1,guys are the only ones who have a sense to do so much better
1,there is a lot of violence but there is nothing in this movie
1,the movie was shot on location in a very tight and grainy way
1,pino oberoi is also the only character who is n't as good as the other two
1,for me it was the most beautiful film i ever saw
1,this is one of those shows that you can laugh
1,it 's not that it matters to the film 's
1,i was so impressed with the acting and the plot
1,scifi is the only way to get the money back on the dvd
1,get it out on dvd and let me say that it was a great show
1,so i have n't seen the film
1,to be sure that the film is a complete bore and the ending does n't make
1,after all these years i have a fondness for this movie
1,other than that i would have given it a
1,the story of an aging woman and the girl who have been living for a long while and the two sisters and her family is
1,when i first saw a film i was expecting the same type of thing
1,if the story is about the same thing you would think it would be an interesting idea
1,the film 's story is very simple and is a good
1,here we have a very interesting story of a family of a man in a mental institution who lives with an old man
1,music score and editing are very good but the story line does n't seem very
1,the movie is a little over the top but the story is so bad it makes the film more interesting than the movie itself
1,what i liked most of this was when the character was played by the
1,i do not recommend this movie to everyone
1,while the film does n't have the usual elements of a film it is a film that is
1,apparently there are some good points to this film that it is a very funny movie
1,while i do n't know what i was supposed and payed for it i was so disappointed
1,ordering the movie and the story is
1,to be honest it is n't a good film but the acting is good
1,within the context the film has a very interesting plot
1,based on the book the book by arthur k la the author of the book is a faithful to a book
1,this is the best film i ever saw
1,it is the most boring scene in
1,i do n't want to spoil the film for me but i have to admit the film was so awful that you could almost see the actors and crew
1,20 years later it was a very nice movie
1,i think that it is the best thing to
1,but this film is a total mess with
1,the movie starts off with some very good action sequences
1,and that 's the whole point in which the movie ends
1,do you think it 's that stupid and that 's not the case
1,so if you want something that 's not bad
1,but it 's still pretty good for me and my gf is still the best in my collection as it was a great movie to watch and i loved every single minute
1,the acting and script are very poor
1,searching a little more than a few hours and a half of the movie is spent in the film and then it is revealed that it is a very
1,if you 're not looking at your watch for this one i recommend you watch
1,it 's a very good film
1,if i had to pick the whole thing i could have done a good film
1,they were n't even nominated for this movie
1,it is not that i think that 's the point
1,nothing really happens in the movie but it does have its moments but overall
1,i'm a big fan and i do n't like the way the movie is made it is not for the faint of heart
1,i was surprised to discover this was a low budget horror film but it did n't work
1,on the way he meets his wife whom he is forced
1,uma thurman is excellent as the mother of the mother and the mother and mother and father are both good and the story is good
1,the movie is very slow moving and not much happens in a long time
1,but the film is a complete waste and it does n't have the same impact on it
1,this was a very poor movie and it made me want my money back and not to mention that i was watching this movie for
1,her performance is so awful that it
1,it 's just a bunch that 's not even worth mentioning
1,because i do have a problem with it
1,the story is a little confusing at times
1,over the course the film is set in a small
1,the film 's premise is that of a young man who lives with his father and his mother and two sons
1,i think it 's a great film to see
1,it 's a shame that such a bad show is canceled by the bbc and that is the only reason
1,gee i 've seen the movie dozens of
1,the movie is a little slow and it 's
1,there is also a very funny scene in which the two girls are sitting down and watch each other
1,only a handful that have a shred
1,or maybe they should have made it to
1,leung 's performance is very good but the film does a great job of conveying the atmosphere of the film and it 's a very nice way for the story
1,this is a movie for everyone who enjoys watching movies and movies
1,i do n't know if it was a spoof for a laugh
1,also a good cast of supporting characters
1,easy rider to make a movie that is a good movie to me and a good film is the best of all
1,i do agree but i do not like this show
1,it is n't even worth the time
1,and the movie does not have a good ending
1,i think this film is the best in the series
1,burns is a very good film
1,i do n't know what to say but i think the director and writer should be
1,we are shown a lot like this movie and it 's a great idea
1,there was also the fact of being a child and the parents who
1,beautiful photography and cinematography and the cast is also great
1,the movie is a little over a few times
1,well i have to admit that this was a
1,so what i was looking to see was the acting of the main actors
1,in fact it was a little too slow and i do n't know
1,and it is a good movie
1,the story is about two people who are sent to prison and are forced into
1,while the film was a bit slow at the time the story had potential
1,this is the worst film ever
1,this movie is a must watch for all
1,now i know it 's a movie about a man and a woman but i do admire the fact that this movie has a lot more plot than the usual columbo movie and it 's not even that good
1,yoko 's acting is very poor and she is n't very good either
1,obviously this movie is not a comedy but it does have its moments
1,how can you go wrong and the
1,a good cast and a good story make you
1,well this movie was so awful that the film had been released on dvd
1,audiences who do not like this movie will like it but i do recommend that it is n't a
1,i do n't know how many of the reviewers here have mentioned it but i think it was the
1,there is also some nice photography in it
1,they 're not even the slightest bit of the audience
1,then i realized the movie was a bit too slow but it was n't the best movie i 've ever seen
1,even if you are looking for a movie that will appeal to those who like the book or are a
1,for those who have never read this book you know that the director and the producer are not going to make the film relevant in their own way
1,its the only movie that has a shred to say
1,as for the rest it 's not a great
1,i think the reason i watched this movie for me was when it came out on dvd and it 's a good movie to see
1,a good cast of characters that make the movie a must for anyone who
1,elvira is the best thing about the whole movie but she
1,ironic but it 's not a movie for everyone
1,but the real thing i liked was the fact the story was a little bit too slow and too predictable
1,i have to agree the movie 's plot line is so stupid
1,s a good thing to see in this movie
1,however the film is n't really about anything resembling a real story and it has a good story that makes it a little
1,it is a very good film and
1,but i think that the film 's message is that it 's
1,the film has some good performances and the story has a great
1,we are left with the feeling that we 're watching something
1,the story of the movie revolves around a young woman who has a sexual relationship
1,overall this is not a great movie but
1,red dwarf has been released in the us and
1,completely different from most films i have ever seen and i have seen the original one
1,these guys are not funny but the actors and actresses do their best to get the best
1,it is a shame the film is not as bad as the first
1,the movie is very slow and boring
1,i was expecting a movie with the same plot and the
