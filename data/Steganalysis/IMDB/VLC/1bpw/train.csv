0,a cool film that has a punch at the box office regardless of the stellar madonna as thomas storm although the lack of sparkle in the allies magazine provides more praise than to have 25 cent under the opinion that the creators should know from the other viewers who needed to add boredom to her film debut,a real shame that branagh can possibly put some effort into this film so he decided to give him a minor chance dealing with the conventions masquerading as another film where aaron spelling does discover himself somewhere in the film as the accidental visitor horse that he opens with the angry dapper builders square against them

0,the very end he slipped back after trying so hard and yet trying to predict for himself when driving around it to find out what he was able to do with all of its hitherto unlikable characters,the abundance of people deeply accepting issues of death and hatred and how it can be used against manned associations that keep hoping that knowledge are taken in in the younger non music scene is beyond me

0,it was so long ago that it sure felt to lead to,it should be required viewing to all your collection of this
0,in every words the film tries to tell the story of what happens when combining protagonists story less than in climax schemes and on repeated outcomes,in addition disgraceful donna and her family running towards as irritating and paraded out as a gemser sports outing with a promiscuous adolescent mouthed reverend wife lures

0,i do see robin hood cop one touch,i recommend everyone to see black hop
0,nevertheless despite excellent performances by jim scott and nia yen this movie just did n't work at all it was rather direct to video production that only made it available to modern standards,nevertheless the film does not let the end finished its plot line just the dinosaurs will reappear coen murphy has a warm command that drives it so i had deep disbelief throughout the film
0,from up to impressionable villa boy dr joe dawson for a small grand kicker with mayor hauser don hunter to top the team orange a nuclear peddler on the powell county and end,from reactions is it 's creator to decided to tell us about how badly submachine you can of showing a mistake for either drool or running that country shill 's work forever

0,however there is only one problem,however it definitely feels out of place
0,but is the real tiny crew that,but there is not saying enough
0,stewart is at his absolute best most traits in the 1970s often he depicted a weary flustered mob,stewart looked strangely handsome and married to brett she 's uncomfortable in giving a strong innocent performance

0,not particularly crappy as in some of the other comments i,not the ps3 at all but i would remain here
0,onj 's attempt by appearing to be such a chomp is,onj runs through the film with a younger decent atmosphere
0,the movie also goes into the mill of sheer perfection since david lynch has,the atmosphere is used as paul karlson 's the framing of the penguins

0,great movie i 've seen and awesome summer kids,great cast great plot script and a 3 track movie
0,cary grant is in a league of comedies most notably for looking forward to vis a handful of memorable films that for the most part did,cary grant plays robin hood a deliberate handsome devious john stewart who joins bombing heights and sings one of cesar sanders 's and kurt cobain

0,on the other hand this gives the film an edgy blend of color and atmosphere,on the other side of my comments the screenplay does even seem rushed with lame performances
0,the biting tone used throughout the decades was considered instrumental by not following a film seamlessly or by presenting painful,the innocence level is reminiscent of what is a study of what ally persons 's appetites could have been

0,the secret service one of the most controversial families in,the relative man 's emotions were apparently dead inside
0,the overt lack of budgets tells us nothing about our glimpses by serbs and the robotics that make the us networks in media sales shop were distributed in media imagination,the fx by playboy playmate jack seem prevalent in this show near the end of the wolf outdoor sonic impersonate topless women are a couple of in all shape ever in

0,it puts people accustomed to planner 's amoral ways of his own dinosaur but finds the money and many volatile and deadly treating which is essential,it was an excellent film its 1950 capture to the screen crew to deserve credit for its fine class and by the inclusion of special ops characters
0,the rest of the cast particularly cho really served the bill the voice of,the fights seem like they are filmed but either sometimes affectionate and halfbaked
0,ok so if he had that including him smile on and his fingerprints i wo n't be surprised by some claim,ok it 's too bad the end of the film is a times hinting at stuff that 's no point
0,there are a couple of pretty funny moments played these characters often with a bit of romance romance and horror,there is also one scene where the day of the 19th century yanks open doors on by the men from time
0,if you do n't permeate the movie by hard to figure out which hard thing can send you apart where the truth is you take out the movie you get a cohesive experience,if 94 you wish to cost money with the definitely minutes of the movie bullets i would advise you if you 're interested in snakes they should be defeated by his parents by taking

0,the lone stuff is also hampered if you want to talk about how greg goes through the cafe,the guy who owns the soundtrack creates the crew of children does n't even care about them
0,maybe some serious genre and slight cameos make this a director no legs to emerge from american soldiers in a regard but nevertheless,maybe it was deliberate to let these sailors realize that they were eavesdropping on the truth to celebrate the petition for them
0,nice story and plenty of true,nice and funny very enjoyable
0,the crazed critics vote on this picture for the longest 5 of the year,the death of actor offers random ticks and the cgi dye scenes easily lighting lit
0,the film has n't been set for thanksgiving dinner,the production design by walter blair should have been great
0,billed as a prequel to the western classic from the first three wo n't ever be,billed by the filmmakers here firstly for one scene rudolf is planning a marriage party
0,do yourself a favor watch counselor which is how horror movies look take them out,do we really get sucked into the tragedy that passes at a downward speed

0,the rest of its kids are great and make a serious difference,the movie was enjoyable enough and it was really nice to see morris
0,i ca n't imagine how sure this screenwriter actually seals his work and never directed it in his life,i would recommend it to everyone kids or men families or children with some scantily clad bodies who have no
0,because she is actually finding a real flop in her boyfriend 's life but manages to live up to her addiction and fulfilment and do not escape emotionally through where the teacher is on her,because we do n't likes it just because it seems allot of extreme significance in which it feels like we 're thrust into a film 's world where some pain is put in jeopardy

0,we were n't so expecting johnathan to make it like that,we never see the land seeing norma and hardly together on the
0,he plays far more refined and devious the compelling kindness than his character him and the dialog is acceptable but the storyline requires nothing to do,he is fascinated by jason 's trials and this textured guilt between soon we are in the same joker that happens in the first film
0,the two actors though not trip above caricature,the personalities themselves are faded and making the actors
0,but much of the blame lies from time,but the plot is the most interesting
0,this is a way to learn a good lesson of buying this movie since signing every corp mistake but with the plucky i,this is what we mean abstract events like raymond one pity british neighborhood a kid church and a student around the pyramid
0,it 's impossible to say but the lovely assassin was very,it is a beautiful experience that stars in the limbo
0,very bouncy and smart this imaginative and experimental melancholic ode to preteens such as,very good acting by a cast that falls completely flat at its core

0,that begs the question what message can you do,that 's a bad thing i suppose might be the
0,the plot was so utterly unbelievable that it was unbelievable,the music is good and the performances by the actors are
0,it 's only about halfway through the dance distribute,it 's been n't the fans used to compensate for
0,the soundtrack was so well chosen it makes for an excellent first class and unexpected medical drama and a undiscovered,the old jones is pretty cool and the cast of stalwart actors and actress carrre is truly a treat
0,it seemed dumb throughout and format of this movie was pathetic because of that character,it 's only experimental handheld origins do n't make you stronger to find it being there
0,it 's all so painful to watch,it is in fact and distancing private that
0,wow that 's about it,wow i'm not a latino scifi
0,murdered was what penny 's snake needed,murdered lovers of pay with randomly the snakes
0,the plot is nothing to write home about though another sad role,the poster looked pretty good and it has really good artwork
0,phillip 's got to go kill and everyone 's bali is immediately silenced by the bunch of yakuza regulations,phillip edwards appears to have been doing only a few good films he called his works but slightly better
0,this movie does n't stand out and leaves us squirm,this is a film for streep who worked perfectly by her
0,but man 's opinion it 's a scifi film the dear remains a fair thing and i'm am being,but later here it was elizabeth taylor who applies for dramatic acting and gorgeous rod steiger as angel
0,i ca n't see any criticism until a bravura jury contains this movie,i do n't know what the people who claim to demonstrate but of course
0,lumumba is a great film,lumumba is charming or provocative but
0,i will only list a few things that did n't require that would help,i must admit that the dictator or iii based solely on her movies pretty much
0,yet coyote sends his heart and tries what has to be the worst thing about,yet the worldweary thriller remains one of the few oldtime dramas i 've seen
0,despite great cinematic experience the aspect was quite weak and took my helsing to move my index finger further,despite the tantrums and a few scenes that seems to me the essence of this is intentional badly scripted and
0,then when all men put their differences on the old man 's brain the rex blows them up,then we are led to believe that peter brown is his brother and he spends a few years back
0,apparently he loves crawford and when she is his own and you will just read you could forget,apparently this film was the result of someone knowing that known this movie is simply pure garbage
0,since the shift is depressing or not why the hell did n't they just drag back together in one shot,since 911 is mainly about rookie attitude by films of our lead i courtmartial if unhappy to distribute expeditions
0,okada you 're supposed to look like you know what you 're dealing with,okada is still one of uttering the monster movies that arise to deliver
0,classic acting and directing all across this flick what 's up with the crappy 80s locations and cursing down the toilet with breakfast,classic level of irreplaceable logical stress turns into a thoroughly compelling and provocative portrait of love on any day of the night
0,the script is perhaps for a rarity and as you watch the action unfold in suspense it becomes painfully annoying but it really ca n't be that far as we are,the film starts off as a somewhat sloppy bore with robert englund overacting and a dry biting display of jack lemmon via his camera movements and james bond 's scope
0,all i can say is that nobody has any,all icing returns to riches equal time style
0,without sure the implication could have given him a little reference to previous films in cinema as he pursues the rest of the,without words because of the beautiful cars by the major players of the hundreds they referred to brando as our main character
0,there really was n't a lot of interesting information here a plot and turned out to be a true love to stunts from the first movie,there is a breast fire and several explosives exploding a crisp malls yet it looks as if they hear what looking for joe 's nite distaste anyway
0,michael niven is quite brilliant as what the lone ranger has to do if you can complete the brooklyn skyline,michael rooker 's early movies with bogart he did so many of his factory roles frequently made his performances both potentially
0,half of the movie is spent any real reason it does n't satisfy the need audience,half the movie is yes of a job just watching an episode closely unrealistic if you understand
0,the rest of the movie is a mishmash of boring jokes one leads up against others for a return to the film and the final sequence reveals that in the middle of the movie the ugliness of the conflict between the two men simply did n't make much sense of going behind a visible shootout as a psycho a student some black guys that kill a dozen weeks later,the idea of a divorce being turned into a performer of the annual wb era institutions and we have a character that receives hold of the same hardnosed pageant and questionable yet does provide one race against our society and starting in on a smaller try by waking up thousands of rwandan peasants this film ai n't 'another science or kurt russell but only a year before the great opening
0,from the start this film finally made me lose a dime in the 80 's but that 's all,from these faults cheesy disappointment is n't worthwhile and it is no surprise that it always does n't come right
0,having to choose the blind situation between alan and hank the girl is enough to,having read oscar wilde the reviews and romances of foreign cinema were beautifully constructed
0,lets start with the series resemblances to other animated episode and the slightly unexpected appearance of jon pertwee as diahann 's reallife officer,lets live without violence angry with wife even in the pants of a medical organization which would literally include a term hint of the
0,this fine movie bears unique excitement without resorting to much of coarse brutality and the one portrayed by several giant detectives is putting a remarkably devastating interviews between them,this film seemed to miss luna even mentioned samantha mitchell on early the sunday season cinemax rejected the fat children who were first timers with their eyesight and dishonesty they
0,in fact porky is his supposed muscle friend and a friend of remorse with the ignorant maria,in lisa 's room he feels like a leggy lady if you ask me tell spongebob

0,rather than profit she has to cope with data ends and costumed family situation,rather than a movie intentionally by it 's soundtrack the plot is n't nearly as
0,i did n't like the comprising some trying to get so a message that will and bore but we get to believe that in the end this is a great film and is n't serving very well either,i was totally enthralled this was one of diane keaton 's most recent film in the charlie chaplin collection and with queen rex i had not yet had an argument with the film due to lack of motivation for
0,because almost none of the singers are timeless and musicians spoke french accents,because i believe this he breaks in deep and becomes erect enough to release
0,amenbar is presented as a menacing nonentity who is also effectively human but never he enjoys her,amenbar would stop it most other captured critics must confront our fears our intelligence our sympathy for ourselves
0,but the acting is great films',but it 's to be on the
0,if any one person were impressed by this travesty and not just hated the first one it,if they could have been created by simon this film could have been a nifty franchise

0,i deeply enjoyed that god help the adopted nurse and they are lovers coming,i remember seeing films like scooby doo and 'the trash of zodiac colon this corpse
0,now off to the con man of all trades if she is away from something,now you can play the more russian version of amelie playing chimps like that
0,i kept watching this film from the director and that only left me dumber to the picture that was happening idiots working,i love mind that all movies are sinister to despise since they abandon pierce brosnan or something missed in his films
0,her longing for a stuff though never works,her performance and camera work in fleischer as the
0,perhaps without other ww2 bias this human led a lot of the killer rules and tries to protect the folks that it was based on,perhaps not all but admire most people who make you want to see a movie that will do you love you killed and appreciated thx
0,i learned scorsese 's class in tomorrow and learned about a tribeca musical instruments because the scriptwriters knew more much for giving us had to,i could not believe how crap this flick was but it was one of the worst films i 've ever seen in my life

0,you tell me when you are screaming which those you hate,you know through a window of yahoo that you feel some empathy
0,the rest of the movie contains gory images from the rock witch up until find the vampire house,the film is shot to a young named newland who is now involved in some with disdain
0,for those who think that los angeles 's real cool side of the stone is made a little more noble i ca n't really say much so i cannot say that this is a big flop and they seem one of the worst acting i have ever 're watching,for all the endless age of the bargain bin the film presents carrie a creepy thriller performer who served minor purpose such as male life and physically aborted masculinity annoyed parties envelop a young starving woman on this planet wasp etc although this is much superior to the equally simple
0,this time around to the surface is like one dreary rogue in the other makes the villain more palatable,this also leads to a somewhat schmaltzy final showdown involving robin using one of the dullest suspects to convince us
0,seriously the movie is a path that is authentically wasted with such rubbish but that cynicism cannot in fact bring more emotional emotion to theater seat,seriously enough this is zoey 's early model that she soon develops us often treated and the cast quote is huge and little soliloquies to them
0,being a mustsee but the main subject of the film not the others are forty miles away,being in the crusades preserve the surrounding religious regime behind morbid america of the victimization of mr black
0,classy experiences remain boring moody incestuous sad unsettling yet an unexpectedly unoriginal intellectually stunning film with very good costumes and a plot that might have,classy contact with the irs 's charles durning has given a walk to frank to performing a prison present as a live homicide agent

1,he 's not the only actor in,he is a very good actor
1,have you seen a film that is so good,have the writers of this film ever read the book
1,sorry to say i did not enjoy this movie,sorry but this is a movie that i can only
1,simone is the one that makes it all her life,simone 's character is a little too unlikable to be believable
1,but it is a good film and a good movie to watch,but the film 's main flaw is the fact that it 's a
1,seriously i think the film is very good,seriously this is the worst film i 've seen
1,tagged by a few other commentators here i was impressed,tagged on the film is a very funny film
1,when the movie was released it 's a very funny film,when i first saw the movie i thought that it was going
1,basically it is not a movie,basically the movie is about the same
1,i'm not a fan of this type of movie,i'm a fan of this movie and it is a
1,as a matter of fact the film has a lot of problems,as for the acting i think that the director was a bit prejudiced
1,the unguarded world' was a great movie,the merry is a great movie that will
1,how can a film be so good,how could you possibly have to have the
1,i was n't impressed with the movie,i have seen this movie twice
1,what a great movie this was,what is the point of this film
1,last year 's eve is an excellent film that is a must for anyone who loves a good drama,last night i saw the movie on tv and was impressed with the fact it had been a long long
1,indeed the film has some very funny scenes,indeed it is a very good movie
1,it 's a shame that this film is n't even nominated,it is not the best movie ever made but it is a
1,the movie was shot in a small town and it,the film is a complete waste of my time
1,the film is about the same thing as a typical american movie,the movie was a bit slow and the ending was predictable
1,henry winkler is the only one in this movie that has been a good one as he,henry fonda plays a very good guy who has a very difficult time with the girl
1,ultimately it 's not the worst film i,ultimately the movie is a complete mess
1,beards are n't the only ones who have the slightest bit of common sense to them and,beards and the beast are the only ones who are willing and are n't the same
1,it 's a shame because the movie was n't so bad it was funny,it is not the worst film ever made but it is still a good film
1,not to mention the fact of this movie is the acting and the script is so awful that it is almost impossible for me,not only does he not have a good time but he 's also very good in the movie and he is a great director
1,still it 's not a good movie,still the movie is n't bad but the
1,it is not a movie for the,it 's a very funny movie
1,but the movie is not a good one,but it 's a good thing to see this
1,there is no reason for this movie to have a plot,there are some good moments but the story is so predictable and
1,i have to admit i was n't disappointed,i was surprised to see this film
1,like the other reviewer said it was a great film,like i mentioned earlier that it was n't a bad film
1,ok so i was expecting something like the original,ok i have seen this movie several times
1,i have seen the original version and i have seen the original,i was n't expecting much of this film to be a good film
1,so i was expecting a lot of the movie to get the point of,so the film is not as good and the performances are n't bad
1,one of the most interesting films i 've seen,one thing i did n't like was the fact that
1,why did n't they make it to,why is this film so bad
1,i have seen this film several years and,i was n't impressed by this movie
1,the movie was a waste of my life,the film is about a group of people and
1,the film is about a young woman who is a teenager,the movie was a waste for me and my gf
1,this movie was a waste of time and i do not know,this is a movie for those interested in the subject matter
1,what a waste for a film that was,what is this movie trying to say
1,her character is a bit underdeveloped,her performance in the film is a
1,i'm a big fan and have never been so disappointed,i'm not sure why i did n't like this movie
1,the film is a complete mess,the movie was shot in the early
1,you can see the movie in the first 15,you know that it 's a good movie
1,moore is a very talented director,moore 's performance is the only reason
1,for a film that is not only a comedy but also a comedy,for the first half hour i was n't sure what to do with it
1,we have a very good movie,we are supposed for the characters and
1,the movie is a complete waste of my time,the film has some of the worst acting ever assembled
1,the film has a very interesting story line,the movie is about the same thing as the
1,by far one thing the movie is about the way it 's made,by the end of the film the audience was laughing at the stupidity of
1,this is a very good movie and it 's not just,this movie was so awful it was funny to watch
1,the film is about the struggle of a man,the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,but it is a good film and a good one,but the film 's main flaw is the fact it 's
1,not to say that it 's not that good,not only is the story interesting and the acting and
1,george clooney is a great actor,george c bush has done an excellent
1,it is not the best film ever made,it 's a shame that the movie has n't
1,the movie was shot on location in the middle east,the film is a bit of an exercise in the genre
1,i was n't expecting a movie to get the point across but i did not,i have seen the movie and it 's a shame because it 's not a bad
1,okay i know that this is a good movie,okay so the film is n't a complete mess
1,it 's a shame that this film has n't made it to dvd for a few bucks and i,it is not the best movie ever but i think that the film is not a good one
1,so the film is a bit of,so i was expecting something more
1,i have to say that i was very disappointed with this movie,i was surprised that this film did n't get released on video or
1,if i were to give it an 8 out of 10 it would be a little better than i,if you 're a fan of the original you will love this film and you will love it
1,pecker 's performance was the best i have seen,pecker is a very good film and it is a
1,here 's the spoiler i have to say i did not like this film and i was n't disappointed,here is a film where the director is trying to make the film a little bit more interesting and more
1,the film has a lot of potential and the cast is very well chosen,the movie is about a group of young people who have been living in the
1,it 's not even a movie,it is a very funny film and
1,los muertos is the most interesting movie,los angeles was a great movie
1,eyes and ears were the only thing i liked about the film,eyes of a woman is a film that is not only a very
1,is this a good movie or is it a good movie or a bad movie that 's not funny or funny at all,is it the best movie ever made and it 's a shame because it 's a great film to watch and enjoy and enjoy
1,pretty soon the film becomes a little too long,pretty much all the characters were killed and killed
1,some of the scenes were so bad they could n't have been,some people say it 's the best movie i 've seen
1,i'm a fan of this movie and i do not think it was,i'm not a fan of this type but i have seen it
1,everything is illuminated and it is a very enjoyable movie,everything about this film is so awful that it is hard
1,buy the soundtrack for the movie and you 'll see what i mean if it 's a comedy,buy it if you want a good movie with a great story and great acting and a great cast
1,the film has a very good story line and the,the movie is about the power of the characters
1,i have seen this film several years and,i was n't impressed by this movie
1,i have to admit i did n't enjoy this film,i was surprised to see that this was the first film
1,yes it is a little bit too slow and too predictable for the audience but it 's not,yes the movie was n't a total waste of time but the movie is n't that good
1,instead of a good movie it 's not,instead it 's a movie about the life and
1,some of the acting was good and i was impressed,some people say that this movie is a masterpiece
1,with the help of a friend who has a secret to his wife she is unable,with a supposed beard in the film the film is not only the most compelling film of
1,i have to admit that i was n't impressed by the movie,i was surprised to find out that this movie is not only the
1,whatever the reason it is a great movie,whatever it was i would n't have to watch
1,the film is about a group of people who have been living in the past and are forced into prostitution,the movie was a waste of my life and i would have to say i did n't like it
1,as a result of this movie i have to say that i have seen the original and i 've,as for me i have to admit that the film was very good and the acting was superb
1,arthur 's character is the only one,arthur is the best of all
1,as a result the film is not a bad movie,as for me it was n't a good movie but i
1,like i said it was a good idea,like the first film the acting is pretty bad
1,this is a movie that i can recommend watching,this movie was a complete waste of time
1,i have to say that this movie was so,i was surprised that this movie was made
1,walken 's performance is very convincing and the film has an excellent performance by the,walken is a good actor but his performance in this movie was so awful
1,a lot of people have commented that this,a few of the actors were good
1,peter o'toole plays the role as a cocky and manipulative man who has,peter falk is a good actor and he 's a good director
1,also i do not know what to say,also the film is a bit too slow and
1,then there 's the fact that it is n't the worst movie ever made,then the film is set up as a series of flashbacks that have a very
1,we have a lot of fun to watch,we are supposed to be rooting for him and
1,i was n't expecting a lot from this movie but it 's not,i have seen the movie twice and it 's a great movie
1,after the first hour i realized that this was a movie that was n't really a good movie,after a few years of watching the movie the film is a very interesting experience of the genre and
1,be warned that this is a movie,be prepared for a few chuckles
1,while the film is a little bit slow moving and the plot has some holes it is a film with,while i was not impressed by the film i found myself wishing that the film would have ended sooner
1,all the characters were so bad that,all in all a great movie
1,what is this movie about the story,what a waste for the time
1,my favorite part of this movie was the scene where the girl is talking about the girl,my advice is that if your looking to see this film is a waste your time
1,i was n't expecting much of a film,i have seen the original version of this movie
1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,on a technical note the acting is superb,on the plus side it 's not a good
1,there are some very funny scenes and the movie has a lot of funny moments,there is no real plot to speak and no real story just the basic story
1,so i was expecting something like the movie to get the best of the,so the film is a little slow but the story is very good
1,by the time i saw it i had to see,by far the worst movie i 've ever watched
1,a lot of people have commented on this movie,a few of the actors were very well chosen and
1,neither the acting or acting is good and the plot line was so predictable that it could n't have been more,neither of them is a real good guy and the story is so bad it 's almost impossible for them
1,anyway i was n't impressed with the film,anyway the film has a lot to do
1,anyway the film is not a complete disaster but,anyway i was surprised to see this movie
1,or maybe it 's just the fact it 's not,or the other two of them are the same
1,i have to admit i did not like this film,i was surprised to see that the film is a little
1,if you 're looking to see a good movie with the usual plot holes and a good story line then you,if i were n't so engrossed i 'd have been a little less confused and had more of the impact
1,when the film was released the film was a complete failure to sit down to watch and,when i saw the trailer for the first time in my life i was very impressed
1,clearly the film 's biggest flaw is that it 's,clearly this movie is not for the faint hearted
1,as a matter of view the film has no real redeeming qualities,as for the acting it 's a bit too bad that it 's
1,the film is about the same subject as the first film and it 's not a bad movie,the movie was a bit slow but i did not expect much from the film to begin
1,there are some very funny moments but it is not,there is no real plot and the characters are so bad
1,every scene in this movie was a joke,every time i watch this movie i was n't
1,i was n't expecting a movie to be so boring but i was n't expecting much from it,i have seen the movie and it is one of my favorite films of the last decade
1,the film is about a young woman who has a boyfriend who is married to a woman,the movie was a waste for me and i was surprised that the movie did n't have a
1,this movie is a complete mess of the first movie i,this is the first movie i have ever walked across
1,breaking the rules of the movie 's end of the film is a little,breaking your head is the worst movie i have seen in my life
1,but it is a good movie,but the film 's main problem with
1,this movie was so awful that it,this is a very good film
1,i'm not a big big fan of the genre,i'm a fan and i do not know how to
1,the film is a bit slow but it 's a great film,the movie was shot on a low level of 35mm camera
1,upon arrival the film is about as good a film as you 'll find,upon the arrival of a young man he meets the man who is a man
1,i was surprised that this movie was made in the first place,i have to say that this movie was a complete disappointment to watch
1,villon 's performance in this movie was a bit too much for me to like him but,villon is a very good actor and i think that the movie was a great success
1,if you 're looking to be scared by a movie you should n't be able to watch,if i were n't so irritated by the film 's portrayal i would have been able
1,not only is the acting terrible the story is awful and the characters just,not to say that the movie is a complete waste of your time
1,there are some good scenes and the movie is a good one,there is no reason to watch it and if it is not a
1,i have to admit i did n't like the movie,i was surprised to see that this movie was released in
1,the film is a complete mess,the movie was shot in the early
1,everyone else in the movie was just a stereotype of,everyone is entitled to a certain level of humor
1,i have to say that i was very disappointed,i was surprised that this film did n't get a
1,i was surprised that this movie did n't get a wider audience award nomination,i have to say that this is one that i have seen in a while
1,he 's a very talented director,he is the most annoying character in
1,his character is a caricature of a man,his performance in this movie was so good that
1,and it 's not a bad movie,and the movie was so boring
1,without a doubt this movie is the worst movie i 've seen in my life and it is not a good film to me,without the words of the director 's previous film this is a must see for anyone interested in the history of the world
1,no matter what the cost of the movie it 's a very bad film,no one is going for the movie to be made and the film is not
1,its a shame that the movie has n't been remastered,its not even that good and it is not a bad
1,what is the deal of this film that it is not a movie,what a great film this is and it 's not even a movie it
1,what is the point of this film,what a great movie this was
1,i have seen this film twice and i still have to say it is one of my favorite films of all time,i was n't impressed by the fact it 's not the worst film ever made but it is a good film to see
1,the film has a very good cast and it 's a great movie to see,the movie is about the power and soul of the people who live in the ghetto
1,i was n't impressed with the film,i have seen this movie twice and it
1,basically it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen but it is still a great film,basically the movie is a mess of the original and the story of the movie was very good and
1,in fact the film was shot in the same location and the lighting is very poor,in the first movie the characters were not believable and the plot was so weak that i
1,in the end it 's not even worth the time,in fact it is not a movie that is so boring
1,all the actors are great and the movie,all in the name is the same
1,this is a movie that i would,this movie was a complete waste
1,without a shadow of a movie this movie was a waste,without the aid and the great acting of the actors the film
1,it is a shame that the film has n't received a wider release,it 's not a movie for the faint hearted viewer but it 's not
1,there are some very good moments and the film,there is no real reason to see it
1,the movie is a bit slow but it is a great film,the film has some good moments and the acting was good
1,when the movie was released it was released on dvd,when i first saw the movie in the theater it looked
1,the film has some good moments but it 's just too much,the movie is a bit slow and the story is n't that bad
1,the film is a bit of an exercise into the culture and,the movie was shot on location in the early 1800 's
1,if you want a good movie with a good plot good acting great action sequences a,if i had to watch it i 'd have to say i was n't impressed
1,the film has a lot to do but it 's not,the movie is about a young man who has been kidnapped by
1,the film is about a young woman who has been living with his mother in a small town in a remote,the movie was a waste for me and i would n't have been surprised if it had a good plot
1,this movie is not for everyone,this is the worst film ever
1,many people who have commented that the movie is a bit,many of the actors in this film were so good
1,the film is about the struggle of a man,the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,four stars for the movie and the script is a bit over,four years ago the film was made and the story was a bit
1,if i were n't for the first time i 'd have a headache and then watch it,if you 're looking for something that 's a bit more interesting then you 'll probably enjoy this
1,simply put this is one of the best films ever,simply because it is a film about a man who is
1,a lot of people have commented that this,a few of the actors were good
1,as for me i have to say i was impressed by this movie,as a result of this movie it is not a bad movie but a
1,in fact the only reason why this movie is a waste is the way it is filmed,in the first film the characters are not very likable and the plot is a little weak and
1,there are some very good moments and some good acting but it 's not that good either,there is no real reason to see this movie unless you 're looking to be bored
1,thus i was expecting a lot more than i expected,thus the movie is about the man who is trying and
1,i have to admit i was very impressed with the film,i was surprised to see this movie in a theatre
1,kissing a few of his fans,kissing the killer is a very good
1,however i do not think this movie is a masterpiece,however the film is not a complete disaster it 's not
1,wow this movie is a total waste,wow i do not think that the movie
1,directed by the great director of a classic film by a director who is n't afraid of the original story it is not a good film,directed with the help from a group of young kids who have a very small budget and are able to afford a new job of the world
1,but the film 's biggest problem is that the story does not make any sense,but it is a great movie and it 's a great movie to watch with your
1,you know that it 's not a good movie but,you can see the movie coming out of nowhere
1,i have seen the original movie,i was n't expecting much from this
1,this movie was so bad it 's,this is a very bad film
1,a few years later the film is a,a lot more of a good film
1,when the movie is about a man who is n't really the,when i first heard about it it 's not even funny
1,so i guess it was a good movie,so the movie is a complete waste of my
1,the film is about the same subject matter and it 's not a movie about a young man named kenny who has a crush,the movie was a bit slow but it was a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes to watch movies
1,he 's not a bad actor,he is a great director and a
1,our heroes are not the same as they were,our hero and his wife are the same
1,i was surprised to see this film in a theater and it is not even a movie that,i have to admit i was n't impressed by this movie but i was n't expecting much
1,i was n't expecting a movie about the holocaust but it was a good movie,i have seen the movie and i can safely tell you it is n't
1,so the movie was made for tv,so i guess i 'll just say it
1,disney has made a movie that is a masterpiece,disney 's the big studios are a great combination of
1,here 's the story the story is a bit thin but it is n't,here is a movie that is not only a very good film but a very
1,there are some very funny moments but the movie is just too stupid to watch,there is no real plot and the acting was horrible and the plot was so predictable
1,for the most of the movie the acting is very poor and it is not even that good,for a movie that was supposed to have been a success in the first place it was a great
1,it 's a very good film,it is not a film that will
1,just like a movie that was made for tv and a lot more money,just as the movie is about the same people who are trying to get their
1,america is a very good film and i hope that it will get more attention from,america 's most popular movie was the one that made me think of the world
1,will smith 's character is so stupid and so unfunny,will the viewer have to see it to see if it
1,i have to admit i was n't impressed with the film,i was surprised to see this film in the us
1,the film is about a young man who has,the movie was a waste for the movie
1,it 's a shame because the film is a bit too slow and too slow for a,it is not the worst film i have seen but i 've been a big success
1,i have seen the original movie and i can safely tell you it,i was n't expecting much from the film but it was n't
1,yes the movie is a bit of a stretch but,yes it is not the worst movie ever made
1,none the more i think the film is a little bit of an exercise in a film,none of the characters were believable and i found myself wondering why they were so hard
1,as a matter the movie was made in the early 80 'searly 80 minutes and it was n't a total,as for the rest of the cast i would n't be surprised if they were n't in the movie
1,the film is a complete mess of the original,the movie was shot in the same location as a
1,kaurwaki is the best character of all time,kaurwaki 's character is a bit dim but the
1,this is a very bad movie and i would have to agree that the acting is n't bad,this movie was so bad that i could n't even finish watching it and i did n't care about
1,there is no real plot and the acting was horrible,there are some very funny moments but the movie is n't
1,it 's a very funny film and it is a shame that the movie has n't been released on video,it is not a movie that is so bad that you can laugh at it and it is not funny it
1,yet it is not the same as a movie,yet the film is a little too long
1,i was surprised that this movie was n't released theatrically,i have to say that this movie is one that is
1,along with the other actors the movie is a complete waste,along the lines you get a movie with the best of the
1,but the film 's main problem with,but it is a good movie
1,dreamers 's character was so annoying that i was,dreamers is the best of the three films
1,i was n't impressed with the film,i have seen this movie twice and it
1,keane is a very funny film,keane 's story was a bit of
1,i have to say that i have n't read,i was surprised that this film was made
1,flying on a plane and the two of them are in the same place,flying in the rain is a film that will be remembered as one of those
1,having seen the movie i was very impressed by the fact,having said all that it was a very good film
1,so i was expecting a lot more from this movie but i did n't expect much from it,so the film is not as bad but the story is so weak it is hard to believe
1,another problem is the lack thereof,another thing i did not like about
1,aside the movie was a complete waste,aside from that it is not that bad
1,generally i think the film was shot in the,generally the movie is not a complete disaster
1,as for me i have to admit that the film is very well made,as a result of this movie i have to say i was n't impressed by
1,troma is the only thing good about the movie,troma 's the first film is the best
1,but the film 's biggest problem is the fact it 's not even,but it is a great movie and i recommend it to all
1,the movie was a waste for the movie and i think that it was a waste,the film is about a young man who is a struggling man and a man in a
1,accidents and the fiends are a bit too long,accidents are n't the only thing to do with this
1,having seen the movie i had a good time,having said all that it 's a great film
1,i have seen this movie several times,i was n't impressed with this film
1,the movie was shot on a low budget and the actors were all pretty good and the plot was pretty good but it was a little,the film is a bit slow but the acting is superb and the direction by the way is excellent and it is a great movie
1,what a waste for a movie,what is this movie trying for a
1,i have to admit i did not like this movie,i was surprised to see that the film is not as
1,yes the film was shot in the early seventies but it 's not,yes it 's a bit slow and it is not a good film
1,he is the only person who can be identified with the fact,he 's a great actor but he is n't the best
1,lone ranger is the best of the three movies,lone wolf and the beast are all very good and
1,do n't worry that i did n't like,do not waste your time on it
1,sometime in this movie he 's the one who has the ability to be the one who has,sometime on the movie the director and the producer decided to give the movie a good look
1,modern day is an interesting movie that is a must see,modern horror films are not the only thing that is n't bad
1,the film is a bit slow but the acting is excellent and the direction by,the movie was shot on a low budget and the acting was n't bad
1,the film is a bit slow but it 's a good film,the movie was shot on a low level of 35mm cameras
1,with the help from his friend he is a bit reluctant,with a supposed budget of about the film tarkovsky is a master
1,this movie is not a good movie,this is the worst movie i 've seen
1,the movie is about a group of young people who are living in the,the film has a lot of potential and the cast are all fine
1,luckily the movie has no redeeming features,luckily it 's not a good movie
1,in the end the film is a bit of a bore but the film does n't really have to be a thriller it is,in fact it 's a shame because the movie was so bad that i could not even watch the movie to the end
1,in fact the only thing i can think about was that it is not the,in the first film he was the one who was in the first one
1,this movie is not for the squeamish but for the,this is the worst film i have ever seen
1,i have seen the movie twice,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,tokyo was a very nice movie and it is,tokyo is the best of all the movies
1,after a few minutes i was hooked,after the first half of this movie the
1,the film has some of the most,the movie is a complete waste
1,well the film was a bit too slow for me but it,well i do n't think i can ever watch it again
1,the movie was a bit slow but i did n't expect much,the film is about the same subject as the book and it is
1,pursuing the story is the same as a child who is a loner,pursuing a few of the actors and actresses in the film i have to
1,three years later the two men are in the same place,three of them were the best in this film and the best
1,but it 's not the best movie i have seen,but the movie was a bit of a mess
1,especially the scene in the bar where the two men are in the car crash and they are all talking about how they 're going through their lives,especially when you consider that it 's not the worst film i have seen in my life i 've seen this movie and i 've seen it twice and
1,maybe it was the fact i did not like,maybe the director should be ashamed of themselves
1,i'm a big big admirer of horror movies,i'm not sure what to expect from the movie
1,the movie was a waste of time and money,the film is about a group that has a very
1,if you want a good movie with good acting and good acting,if i had to watch it i would n't be surprised
1,the movie is a complete mess of a film,the film has some of its moments that are n't
1,but the film is not as good,but it is not a movie
1,or the other one who has a crush in the film,or maybe it was the fact i did n't get to know
1,the movie is about the power of a young man and his wife,the film has a very good story and the actors are good
1,rik mayall is the only one who has ever been,rik birch plays the part with the same character
1,no matter what the cost of the film,no one is going for the movie
1,it is not the worst film ever made but it 's not bad either,it 's a shame because the movie was n't so much a lot of it
1,maybe the movie was made in the us but the,maybe it 's because the movie was so good
1,the film is about the struggle between a man and a,the movie was a bit of an attempt at humor
1,it is a very good movie,it 's not even the best movie
1,but it 's not a bad film,but the movie was n't bad
1,i was surprised that this film was released theatrically in theaters,i have to say that i have seen a lot of bad
1,i was surprised to see this film in the us and it is not as good,i have to admit i was n't impressed with the movie but i was surprised to find
1,pants and the fiends is a very entertaining film that is worth watching,pants are the only thing they have to say about the movie and it
1,although the film is a little bit of a comedy it 's a very good movie,although i have n't read the book it was a little too coincidental for my liking and
1,steve mcqueen is the perfect actor,steve martin plays the part of a
1,rounding out a copy of this film and,rounding it out for a good laugh
1,no matter what you do n't want to see this movie you will be able to see the movie and enjoy,no one is a fan of the genre but the film has some great moments and the acting was good
1,postproduction is a bit too much for me,postproduction and the script is so awful it makes
1,the film has a lot of potential and the acting was good,the movie is about a group of young people trying to find their
1,i have to say i was n't impressed by,i was surprised that the movie was made
1,acting was ok the story was pretty good and the characters were likable,acting is n't bad but it is not a good movie either
1,i have to say that this movie was so,i was surprised that this movie was made
1,virgil is the best character ever,virgil 's character is the only reason
1,this movie was so awful it 's,this is a very good movie
1,fortunately the film 's only redeeming quality,fortunately it is not the same
1,it 's a very good movie and it 's not just a comedy it is an excellent film that will appeal for anyone interested in the genre,it is not a film for everyone who is interested in seeing a film that is so good that it 's hard to believe it is a comedy
1,apparently the film is n't as good as the first one but the film does n't seem like a,apparently this movie was made for tv and i think that the movie is a bit too long
1,there is no reason for the to be the,there are some good moments in this film
1,i have seen the movie twice,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,i was surprised to find out the movie was a complete flop and i do n't think it was a waste,i have to admit that i have n't read the novel but i have to admit that the movie was very good
1,it 's a very funny film and a good,it is not a movie that is n't
1,i was surprised that this film did not have a chance to be released on video,i have to say that i was n't disappointed by this film but it was a great
1,but it is not the worst film ever,but the film is a little too long
1,charlie 's character is so stupid and stupid that i could n't help but laugh at him and the movie,charlie is a good actor and he is very good as a villain who has to be a little too difficult
1,the movie is a bit slow but it is n't a good film,the film has some good moments and the acting is pretty decent
1,i was n't expecting much of this film to be a good movie,i have seen the original version and i have seen the original version of
1,he 's a very good guy,he is the most talented actor of
1,richard gere plays the role of the father of a man in the film,richard widmark is a fine director and the director of the film has an interesting
1,it is not a movie for everyone but if it is a comedy you should n't be surprised by it,it 's a very funny movie and it 's a great film to watch with a group of friends
1,maybe it 's because i do n't know how,maybe the movie was n't a complete success
1,his character was a bit of a jerk,his performance is so good that i ca all
1,they 're all very funny and the,they are all in the movie
1,but it 's not the worst movie ever,but the movie was a little slow and boring
1,a lot more than a little more than a little bit of,a few years ago the film was made in the uk
1,the movie was a waste of time,the film is about a group that is
1,oftentimes it is a very poor movie and i do not think,oftentimes the film has some good moments but it is n't
1,if you want a good laugh out of this movie you should check out,if i had to watch this movie again it was a total disappointment
1,i have seen the movie and it is one that is not only a very good,i was n't expecting a movie to be so bad but this was a waste
1,i was n't expecting a movie to be a horror movie,i have seen the movie and it is a very accurate film
1,this movie is a complete waste of time,this is the first movie that has a very
1,as for me i was n't sure what the point of the film was but i was n't,as a result of the fact that it is a movie that is n't a complete failure
1,i have seen the movie twice and i have to,i was n't expecting a lot from the film
1,after a while i had a feeling that the movie would,after the movie was over i was n't expecting much
1,okay so i was expecting something like the first movie,okay i have seen this movie several times and i have
1,she is a very good actress,she 's not the only person who
1,salman khan is a good choice to be in,salman is the best actor in the movie
1,that 's the only thing that makes this movie so bad it 's just bad and,that is what makes this film great and the film is a very enjoyable film
1,however i was n't impressed with this movie,however the movie was a bit too slow for
1,it is not a film that is n't even a comedy it 's just,it 's a very good film and a good example for a movie
1,cinematography is very poor and there are some good actors,cinematography was good and i was impressed with the acting and
1,it 's a very funny movie,it is not a movie for the
1,definitely a must see for anyone who enjoys,definitely not a film to be missed
1,the film has a very good cast,the movie is about the power and the
1,indeed it is not a bad movie but the,indeed the film is not a good movie
1,oops i know that 's a good idea but i think the film,oops it 's not that great but it is a good movie
1,everyone else in this movie was just plain awful,everyone is entitled and they are n't even in this
1,i was surprised that the film was made,i have to say i did not enjoy this
1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i have seen this film twice
1,this movie is a must for anyone who likes to laugh,this is the first film i have ever walked out on
1,an interesting film that is a must for anyone interested,an excellent film with great performances from the cast
1,the movie was a bit of a mess but i did n't think it would have made much of an impression about what happened in the end,the film is about the struggle of the people in a world where the world is ruled and the world is ruled by the evil spirit
1,sequels are not as good as the original but the film is a little slow,sequels like the lion and scan game have been done by the same director and made
1,it 's not even a good film,it is a very funny movie
1,in the end it is not a good film,in fact it is a very poor film
1,the film has a very good story and the acting is excellent and the characters in this,the movie is about the power of a young woman and her life in the world
1,also i think that it was a great idea,also the movie was a bit slow but it was
1,3 the acting is horrible and the story is so,3 out 10 out 10 stars for the acting
1,the movie was shot on a low budget and the actors are,the film is a bit slow but the acting is superb
1,not only does it look like a bad movie it 's,not to mention that the film is not as good
1,the film is a complete mess,the movie was shot in the early
1,this is the first movie i have seen that made,this movie is a complete mess of a film
1,it 's a very good movie and it 's a great movie,it is not a film for everyone who is n't interested
1,the film has a lot to offer and the story is a little confusing,the movie is about a young woman named seita played with a younger brother and
1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,at least the movie is n't as bad as the first,at the same moment the film is a little bit too slow
1,other reviewers here seem like it was a little too much to bear and the film is not a total loss,other than that it 's not a good movie but it 's not a bad movie either as a whole
1,and it is not a good film,and the ending is so bad that i
1,having seen this movie several years ago i was able,having said that the movie is very well made
1,although the film is not a complete masterpiece the story is a bit slow and the story is too thin to follow the story,although i have n't seen the movie i can only imagine that it was made for tv and i do n't think it is the
1,all the actors were excellent and the movie is a perfect blend of drama and romance and the film has,all in the family and the film is a perfect combination of the two and a half hour long
1,all the characters are likable and believable,all in all this movie was a disappointment
1,i have seen this film several years ago,i was n't impressed by this movie but i
1,it is not a movie for everyone,it 's a very funny movie and i
1,then the movie starts to get worse,then there is the scene where he is
1,the movie was a waste for me and my friends and i rented it for a dollar,the film is about a young woman who is attracted by a young man to find a woman
1,any movie that has a good cast and an excellent cast is a good idea,any of these movies have been done so well that it 's not a bad film
1,from a technical point of fact the movie was a total failure,from the beginning of this movie i was expecting something more
1,i have seen the original version of the original and i have seen,i was n't expecting much of a movie to watch the movie
1,an excellent film that is a mustsee for all,an interesting film about the holocaust of a young man
1,and the movie is so boring that i could n't help thinking it would be an enjoyable,and it 's a shame that this movie is n't even available on dvd or vhs
1,at the same moment the movie is a bit slow,at least the movie is a little too much
1,but the movie is a bit too slow for the most of the,but it 's a great film and it 's a great movie
1,the movie was shot in a very,the film is a complete waste
1,one of the best films of the last decade,one thing i liked about this film was that the
1,there is no reason for this movie to be released,there are some good moments but the story line is just
1,however the film 's biggest problem is that the film is a,however i do n't think that this movie is worth seeing
1,tremendous acting by the actors and the director and cinematographer and,tremendous movie that is not a complete waste of time
1,this is the first movie that has a very,this movie is a complete waste of time
1,i have seen the movie and it 's not even the worst,i was n't expecting a movie to get a good idea
1,like i mentioned earlier that it is not the best film,like the other reviewer said it 's a good movie
1,this movie is a must see,this is the first film that has
1,director michael curtiz is the master and the director is a master of his own,director john mctiernan has a very small budget but is not able for a film that
1,so the film is not as good as it is in the first place,so i was expecting a lot of fun and this was a great film for
1,stewart is the best in this film,stewart 's character is a caricature
1,then there 's the fact that the movie has no real purpose,then the film is set up for the first time and the second
1,it 's not even a movie it,it is a very funny film
1,they are all very good and the movie has some good points,they 're all in a bad movie and they do not make it
1,well the film was a bit too long for me but it was a bit,well i do n't think i can remember the last time i watched it
1,it 's not a movie that you will enjoy but you will be glad to have seen the movie,it is a shame that this movie is not only a movie for the fans of a good film
1,he is a great actor and a,he 's not a good guy
1,it is a shame because it is,it 's not a bad movie
1,you can tell the director was trying to be funny,you know what i mean but it is n't
1,it is a very good movie and it 's a shame that the film has been released in the us,it 's not even the best of the genre but the fact is that it 's a very bad film and
1,steve martin is the perfect actor,steve mcqueen plays the part of a
1,i have to say that i have n't read,i was surprised that this film was made
1,ray liotta plays the role of the father of a young woman who is a little too young and too healthy for the part,ray milland is a fine director and the director of photography is very well known for the role of a man who is a master
1,there is a scene in which the girl 's daughter is killed by a,there are a few good scenes but the movie is n't as good
1,the movie was a waste of my time and money,the film is about a group of young men in the
1,basically it 's not a bad film but the acting and direction is very good,basically the film is not as good as the original but it 's not a bad
1,nothing is explained in the movie that the film is a bit of an action film,nothing really happens and it 's not a good idea to begin with the story and characters
1,after the first hour i realized that this was the worst movie ever made and it was a shame that the movie is n't available on video or vhs,after a few years of watching the movie the first half hour of this movie was just plain awful and the acting was terrible and i was bored to death
1,her performance in this movie was very good and the acting was good,her character is so stupid that it makes you feel sorry about the character
1,written directed by steven soderbergh and starring edward g robinson and directed by robert de,written by the director of a novel by the name of a famous director
1,but the movie was a little slow and the story,but it 's not the worst movie ever made
1,lord of the rings is a film that is n't even worth a rental,lord and son of a man who has a secret affair to a small group
1,confident to say that the film was a complete mess of a movie,confident that the film was shot in a small town in new york
1,and it 's a shame because it is not the worst movie ever made,and the movie is so bad that it 's almost impossible for anyone who likes
1,so the movie is about the man and the,so i guess it 's a good thing
1,but the movie is not a complete,but it 's a good thing
1,an excellent film with great acting,an interesting film that is not only
1,the film has a lot of potential to be funny,the movie is about a group of people trying their luck
1,she is the only person who can act and she,she 's a little too much to be ashamed
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,do not waste my money on this one unless you 're a diehard,do n't worry about this film it 's a very bad film
1,i have seen this film several years ago,i was n't impressed by this movie but i
1,great movie for the first half of a movie,great acting and a great cast make this a great
1,i'm not sure what to say about this film but it 's not a bad movie,i'm a big big admirer and this is the worst movie ever made and it is a
1,earlier on he is a young woman who is a little more than a little bit too old to be taken,earlier in the movie we get to the end where he 's going through a window of a car accident
1,and it is not the best movie ever made but the,and the ending is a little too long for me
1,the movie was a waste of time and money and money,the film is about a group that has a lot of fun
1,i have seen this film twice,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,this is the first movie that i,this movie is a complete waste
1,heshe 's a very funny movie,heshe is the only one who is
1,if you 're a fan like myself and you have a strong sense to the plot,if i were to give this movie a 1 i 'd be a little generous
1,well i do not know what the director is trying for but i do not know how to make a movie about this movie and,well the film is n't a bad movie but the acting is n't as bad as the other two movies i 've ever watched
1,in fact the only thing i can say about the movie was that it 's a little bit of a mess but the acting is pretty good,in the first film he was the only person who was able and the other was a little more believable than the others in this film but the
1,tarzan and his men are a bunch and the two,tarzan is the only reason to see this film
1,hmmm i have seen a lot of bad films,hmmm this is a movie about the evils of war
1,so the movie was a bit of,so i guess i was wrong
1,this is the first movie that i,this movie is a complete waste
1,anyway i was n't impressed by the film 's lack,anyway the film has a very interesting plot and a good
1,with the help from the local sheriff who is a little more of an obstacle than the other he 's the,with a supposed budget the best thing about it is the fact that it 's not even a good film
1,this is the first movie i have ever seen,this movie is a complete mess of the original film
1,not only is it not funny but the acting is good,not to say the movie is n't a total mess but the
1,the movie was shot in the same way as a,the film is a complete mess of a movie
1,events like this were n't explored,events are n't really explained in the
1,i was n't impressed by the fact it 's a movie,i have seen this film twice and i still remember the name
1,i have seen this movie several times and i have to admit i,i was n't impressed with this film but it was very good
1,what a great film this was,what is the deal of the story
1,i have to admit i did not enjoy this movie,i was surprised to see that the movie is not as
1,obviously this movie was made in a hurry to be made in the early 80 's but,obviously the film is n't a complete mess but it 's a great movie to see
1,minor spoiler ahead the film has a very interesting plot,minor spoilers the film is a little bit of an action
1,on the plus the movie is a bit of an,on a technical level the film was pretty good
1,sure the film was a little too slow but,sure it 's a little bit too long
1,if i were n't so irritated i 'd have to say that i was n't disappointed,if you 're looking to be a fan and you 're a diehard horror buff you will
1,at the end the movie ends abruptly,at least it 's a little bit of
1,loren is the best actor in this movie,loren 's character is so annoying that i ca
1,public access to a film like the one in which a group member are,public enemy is a film that is a must see for all ages
1,william shatner plays a very good character in the film,william wyler 's direction is a bit too high for this
1,if i were n't for a few minutes i 'd have been able to sit through the entire film,if you 're looking for a good movie with a great cast this one will make you laugh
1,with a supposed budget the best thing about it is that the actors are not bad at all,with the help from the local sheriff who is a bit of an observer to the film 's plot
1,while i was not expecting much of the movie i was expecting a lot more from the director,while the film is not as good as the original the acting and the script are very good and
1,people are n't even aware that the movie is not as bad,people who have n't read the novel will know what to expect
1,while i do n't know what the appeal of this movie was to be it was n't that,while the movie was a little slow it did n't really have to do with a plot
1,it is not the best movie ever but it is a great movie,it 's a shame that this film has not received any oscars
1,ok so i was n't impressed,ok i have seen a lot of
1,historically accurate is a film about the life of the,historically inaccurate and the movie is a total bore
1,as for me i was impressed with this film and it was very good to see,as a result of the film 's success it is a film that will appeal for all
1,i have to admit i did n't enjoy this film,i was surprised to see that this was the first film
1,anna friel plays a woman whose husband is a little more of an insensitive jerk than a man who is n't,anna paquin is the perfect choice to be the character of the film and she 's not a good heroine
1,gino is the only one who has to deal with his own demons,gino 's father and son have a relationship and the relationship is resolved by
1,i have seen the movie twice,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,by far the best of the series is that the characters are all very likable,by the time the movie ended i felt like i had wasted my money on the
1,parading the velvet is an interesting film that will be forgotten by anyone who enjoys the genre of the late '60s,parading around the woods and the next morning we see the same old lady who is trying to kill her but the
1,it is a very good movie,it 's not even the best movie
1,still it is a great movie and a,still the film has some redeeming qualities
1,it is not the best movie ever made,it 's a shame that this film is not
1,this is the first movie i 've,this movie is a complete mess
1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,the film is about a group that is,the movie was a waste of time
1,the movie is a bit slow and boring but it is a good movie to see,the film has some good moments but the rest is just plain awful and the acting was
1,much like the movie the story is very simple and it 's not a bad movie but,much of it was made up by the director and the actors who are in it
1,forgive the pun and you will see a few of the,forgive me if you want to see a good film
1,i was surprised that the movie did n't have,i have to say i was very disappointed
1,think of it a good idea and it,think about the movie and the plot
1,and it 's not even that funny it 's just a bad bad movie that,and the movie was a bit too long for the most unrealistic movie buff
1,the film has a lot of potential to make a good film but the script and acting is so bad that you ca n't even tell if the actors were actually trying to make it or what,the movie is about a group of people who are trapped in a small town in a small village in new york city and they have to deal with a new york neighborhood where they can live in
1,less than the sum it is a very good movie,less of a psychological thriller with the same theme
1,finally the film is about the man who is trying and,finally i was n't impressed by the film 's plot
1,there are a few good moments in the movie but it is not a movie,there is a scene in the film where a man is talking about the death penalty
1,john wayne 's character was so stupid and so stupid,john goodman is the only actor who can save the movie
1,of all of these films i 've watched this one,of course the film has some of the worst dialogue ever
1,this is a very good movie,this movie was so awful it 's
1,i was n't expecting much from the movie,i have seen the original movie and it 's
1,frank morgan plays a young man who,frank sinatra is a fine director
1,wooden acting and bad acting make this movie a waste,wooden script bad acting and a terrible plot make it a
1,i was n't expecting a movie to be a horror film,i have seen the movie and it is a very good movie
1,the film is about a young woman named,the movie was a waste for me
1,the film is about the same thing as a child 's dream,the movie was a bit slow and the ending is predictable
1,but it is a good film and it is a good film to see if,but the film 's main flaw is that it 's not a good movie
1,but the film 's biggest flaw was,but it is a great film
1,the movie was a waste for the movie and it 's a waste,the film is about a young man who is sent to prison to investigate
1,i have to admit that i was n't disappointed,i was surprised to find out that this was the
1,even though it is not a movie it 's still an excellent,even the most diehard fans will be disappointed by this film
1,describing this film is a very good idea for the movie,describing the story of a man 's journey to the world he
1,there are a lot more to be said about,there is a lot of violence and violence
1,she 's not the only one who,she is a very good actor
1,but it is a great movie and i recommend this movie,but the film 's biggest problem is the fact that the film
1,yes the film was shot on location but the story was so weak and the characters,yes it 's a bit of an action film but it 's a good film
1,from the beginning of this film i thought it would be a great,from a technical point of view it 's not a good film
1,the movie was shot on location in the middle east and was filmed on location,the film is a bit of an exercise in the plot but it 's a good
1,yes it 's a little slow and it is not a movie,yes the film was a bit slow but it was n't
1,and the movie is a bit of,and it 's a good movie
1,he is the only one to be able,he 's a great director and he 's a
1,it is a shame because the movie,it 's not a bad film
1,i was n't expecting a movie about a man who was born,i have seen the movie and i have seen the original
1,this movie is a must see,this is the first film that has
1,teaching me the story of a man who is a woman who is a woman,teaching the story of the lives and family dynamics and the consequences that come to life
1,the movie is about the power of a young woman and her family,the film has a very good story and the acting is excellent
1,years ago i was a teenager in a small town and i was a teenager and i loved it,years later the movie has a lot of problems and it is n't a good movie to watch but i
1,from a technical point the film is a very good film and a good film to,from the beginning of the film the film is set up as the story unfolds
1,the film is about a young woman who is attracted by her father to the devil and the mother of the mother,the movie was a waste for me and my friends and my family were laughing at it and the movie was so boring
1,in fact the film is a little too long,in the first movie he is a good actor
1,in fact the only reason i watched this movie was because i was so bored and wanted to see it,in the first film the main character 's father was a young boy who is a little more interesting
1,hot women and women are not the only ones who are,hot chicks are not always the best of this type
1,however i was n't impressed by the fact that it was n't the worst movie i have ever seen but i 've seen,however the movie was a little slow and the ending is too abrupt and predictable to be enjoyable but it 's not
1,eko 's character was a little too much to be considered as,eko is the only person who is able in his life
1,on a positive note the film is very good,on the other side of the spectrum the film has
1,the movie was a bit slow but i did not think it would be a good movie,the film is about the same subject as the first one and the third half is pretty much
1,after a while the movie becomes a little more enjoyable,after the movie i thought that the film was a little
1,then the film switches gears from the beginning and we see the,then there 's a few scenes of a woman 's body
1,anybody who thinks that the movie has a lot to do with the original story should have been left with the feeling that the movie is,anybody interested in this film will be able to relate with it and it 's a shame that it 's not available in the uk
1,basically the movie is a complete waste,basically it is not the same
1,but the movie was a little slow and the story,but it 's not the worst movie ever made
1,but it 's not the best movie i 've ever seen but it is a good movie,but the movie was a bit of a disappointment and it was not even that funny to me

1,the film is about the struggle of the people in a different culture,the movie was a bit of a mess but i did not like the
1,full of clichs and the occasional sex scene,full moon has been released on dvd and the
1,even the most ardent of the characters are not funny,even though it 's a little dated it is still very
1,i was surprised that this movie was made in the first place and i,i have to say that this movie was a complete disappointment to me

1,that 's the way it is portrayed in the movie,that is what i think of this movie and it is
1,a few years ago the movie is a bit slow and boring,a lot more than a few of those films i have to admit
1,i was n't expecting much from this,i have seen the original movie
1,never before have i seen such a terrible movie,never mind the film is about the power and love
1,sadly it 's a little bit of a mess and it 's not even that good,sadly the movie is a bit too slow and too predictable to keep the viewer interested in

1,my advice is to avoid it like this plague,my favorite part is when the girl is talking to
1,after the movie i was n't expecting anything more,after a while the film becomes more of an action
1,in fact it is a very poor movie with a very poor cast and the acting is horrible and the script is so awful,in the end it is not a movie that will leave you feeling depressed and angry at the same matter as you do
1,but the film 's main problem with,but it is a good movie
1,comprised is the best movie ever,comprised of the same old people who
1,russell 's performance as a character is a bit overdone but he is very good as the conflicted and frustrated,russell crowe is a great actor but the movie is n't as bad as it is in the movie
1,while the movie was a bit long it was a bit slow and slow paced and the acting is very poor and,while i do n't know how to make this movie a masterpiece of a film it 's not a bad film
1,the film is about a young woman named,the movie was a waste for me
1,maybe it 's because the movie was so good,maybe the movie was made in the us but the
1,poorly written poorly directed poorly acted badly directed,poorly scripted and directed by john woo this is
1,first of all i was a bit skeptical when the film,first off i was n't expecting much of a movie

1,it is not the best movie i have ever had the pleasure of watching,it 's a shame that this movie has not been available on video or vhs
1,or maybe the director was n't trying too much,or the fact it was a movie about a man
1,most of them were very good,most people have commented on the film
1,a few of the scenes are so funny that i,a lot of people are complaining about this film
1,when i saw this movie i was a little sceptical,when the film is released i have to admit that i
1,this movie is not for the faint hearted or otherwise,this is the worst film i 've ever had to endure
1,well i do n't know what the point of the movie is,well the film was n't so bad that i could not even watch
1,i was surprised that this film did not get released theatrically in the,i have to say that i was n't impressed with this movie

1,the movie is about a group of people trying to find a cure to the earth and the people who are killed,the film has a lot of potential to be taken seriously and the acting is pretty good but the story is so weak
1,there are some very funny moments in the film,there is no real plot and no character development or
1,i was n't impressed with this film but i did not expect it,i have seen this movie several times and it 's still very funny
1,stanley tucci plays a very likable character who is a very good character actor,stanley kubrick 's direction is excellent and it 's not a good film

1,it 's a shame because it 's not a,it is not the worst movie ever made
1,peter falk is a good choice for this role,peter o'toole plays the role of the father of a
1,sadly it is not a movie,sadly the film 's biggest problem is
1,sucked in the first half of this movie,sucked from a few angles and the camera angles
1,your only real complaint is the fact it 's a movie about the,your average movie goer will be able to relate to this movie
1,he 's a great director and a good,he is the only one to die
1,how can a film like that be made,how could you possibly get a movie with such
1,could have been a lot more fun,could n't have done a better job of

1,there is a lot to like in the movie,there are a lot of good things to be done
1,she 's a little too old to play a character but she does,she is the only person that has a shred to her face
1,there is no reason for the to be made,there are some good moments in this film but it
1,talking to a friend who has been in the past,talking about the film is a very good film
1,i was n't expecting a lot from the film,i have seen the movie twice and i have to
1,there are a lot of things to criticize here but the movie is a bit slow,there is a lot to be said but i think that 's a great idea
1,the film is about the same thing about a,the movie was a bit slow and boring

1,in the end the movie has a lot to,in fact it 's not a good film
1,the film has some good points and is very well done,the movie is a bit of a bore but the story itself
1,if i had to give it a zero because i would n't be surprised,if you want a movie to be entertained by a few of the actors you
1,perhaps the director was trying too much too much to be too serious and too hard to be funny and it,perhaps it 's a bit too long but it is still worth the wait and a good rental for anyone
1,i have seen this movie several years ago,i was n't impressed with this movie but i
1,pidgeon is the best in this film,pidgeon 's character is a caricature
1,from a very young woman who is a woman in a mental hospital,from the opening sequence of the movie i thought that the film was going
1,it is a very good movie and i think that the actors are all good and i think the director should be commended for making a film about the holocaust,it 's not even the best of all the movies that are so bad that they are just plain awful and that is the reason i did n't give this a
1,america 's greatest strength is the fact it 's a movie,america is not a good film but it is not
1,feel free to be a good film,feel like it was filmed in a time
1,now that 's a bit of a shame,now i know i 've been watching a lot

1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,a lot more of the same,a few years later i was a
1,do not waste my time on this,do n't worry about the movie because you
1,to be the only one that i have ever walked out on and the movie was a bit too,to the end of this movie the viewer has to wonder if the director is trying too hard

1,sharky is the most interesting character in the movie and it is a pity that he has n't made it,sharky 's travels to the us to find a new partner is the most intriguing part of this movie
1,as a result of this movie it 's a shame because it is a movie about a young man who has a heart transplant and is a man who is not a good man,as for me i have to say that this is a great movie and i recommend you to watch the movie and you will be hooked by it and i will give it a 1010
1,after a few minutes of watching the film you get to know the main characters and the characters,after the first half hour of this movie i realized i was watching a bad film and i did

1,yet it is not a film that will,yet the film is not a comedy
1,the movie was shot in a small town and it,the film is a complete waste of my time
1,there are a few moments of humor and some of the scenes where the hero 's character is revealed to be the one that is n't in any other,there is a scene where the two protagonists are talking to the camera in a scene of a woman walking through the woods with her eyes and legs
1,stewart 's character was so unlikable that it could n't even be explained in the first five seconds of the movie and the whole thing is,stewart is the only one to come out of the ordinary and he is not the only one who has to deal with his problems
1,but the movie was n't so bad it 's good it was just plain awful and,but it 's not a good film and it 's not even worth the time
1,the movie is about a young man named kenny played by a man named luis,the film has a lot to do with a lot more of the same

1,role of a woman is a real shame,role is a bit too old for the part
1,of all the movies i have seen i 've seen this one,of course there are a few things that are wrong but this movie
1,anna friel is the perfect choice to play a character,anna paquin plays a woman whose husband and daughter have been

1,great movie for the whole cast,great acting and a good story line
1,this is a very good film,this movie was so awful that it

1,regardless of the fact that the film was made,regardless the film was made in a hurry
1,actually the film is a bit slow and the story is too predictable to follow,actually it 's not that good but the movie is very entertaining and the acting was
1,for a film about a young man who has been abused by a man in a mental hospital,for the first time i saw this film on the big night of the morning and it was a

1,a few years ago i saw the movie,a lot more than the sum of its parts

1,we have to be careful of the story and we have a lot more of the same characters,we are not supposed to be a fan of the genre but it 's a good movie
1,the film is a complete waste of my time and money to watch this,the movie was shot in a small town and the locations were so bad that
1,then there 's a few scenes of a woman 's reaction,then the film switches gears from the beginning and we get to
1,also the movie was shot in the us in the seventies and the movie is shot on,also i think that the director should have been able to make the movie more interesting

1,amazing acting by the entire cast and the characters,amazing movie with a good story line and great acting
1,the film is a bit of a bore but the acting and direction are,the movie was shot on location and it 's a very nice movie
1,later on the film switches into the story of,later the movie settles around the same path
1,if i were n't for a good time i 'd have been a bit more surprised to find out that the film was a complete mess,if you 're looking for a movie that will make a good deal of fun watch this one and watch the original instead of a good one
1,most of them are not even funny and they are not even funny and the acting was horrible,most people have seen the movie and i think that the movie was a little too long for the

1,the film is a complete mess,the movie was shot in the early
1,how can you go to the cinema to see a movie like that,how could it be that the movie is a little too long

1,hazel is a very beautiful woman who has been in a relationship,hazel 's performance in the movie was a bit too much
1,perhaps it 's a bit of a stretch for me but i think that 's what it is,perhaps the director was trying to get the audience to sympathize and then the audience would n't be allowed

1,this is the first movie i have seen in my,this movie is a complete mess of a movie
1,this is the first movie i 've,this movie is a complete mess

1,the movie was a bit slow but i did n't think,the film is about the same subject as the book
1,the film has some of the most,the movie is a complete waste

1,a few years later the film has a,a lot more of a good movie
1,i have to admit that i have n't read the book but,i was surprised to find out the movie was a remake
1,either the director is just trying too much to make,either way the movie is not a bad film
1,a lot of the scenes are shot in a very,a few of them are not so much better
1,the film is a bit of a mess but it 's a good movie to see and it is a great movie,the movie was shot on location and the acting is pretty bad but it 's not a bad movie either it is just

1,the film has a very interesting story line and a great story,the movie is about the same thing as a typical hollywood movie with
1,even though the film is not as good it 's still very good,even the actors who were n't in the movie were very good and i
1,none the less the movie is about the power and the love,none of these characters have developed any real depth or charisma
1,and the ending was so stupid that i was left wondering if it would end up being so bad,and it is a very good film and a good example for a movie that is a must watch for
1,whereas i do n't know why the film is so good i do n't know,whereas the movie was a bit slow it was n't really a good film
1,being a big budget fan of this movie i was expecting a good movie but this one is so bad it makes me wonder,being the first movie to have a good cast i have seen a few of the films and this is one of them
1,john wayne 's performance as a man,john goodman is a great actor
1,it is a very funny film,it 's not even a movie it

1,this is a very bad film and it 's not even that good either it is,this movie was so bad it was good to see the actors playing the characters
1,instead of being the most popular movie of the year it is not even,instead it is a film that is not a comedy or a drama
1,what is this movie trying for a,what a waste for a movie
1,the movie was shot on location in the middle of nowhere,the film is a bit of an exercise in a plot that
1,this is a movie for those who love the genre and are interested to watch it,this movie was a waste of my time and i would have to say that i have
1,ok so the film is n't a bad movie,ok i know that this is a movie for kids
1,recap the movie is a very good movie and i recommend it,recap a few of my favorite films of all times and this is

1,one thing i did n't know is how much of the film 's plot is about a man who is a man and a man who is trying too,one of the most interesting things about this film was the fact that the film was shot on a budget that was shot on location in a studio
1,i was surprised to see that the film is not as,i have to admit i did not like this movie

1,it is a very funny movie,it 's not even a good film
1,or maybe the fact that it was made in a small town in new jersey is a real shame,or the fact that it was a long lost movie that i could n't even get to see it was
1,the movie is about the power of a young woman who has a heart attack and is a woman,the film has a very good story and the acting was good but the script is so poor it makes

1,we have to be a little more forgiving of this,we are not supposed for a moment of relief
1,a few years ago the movie is about the same thing that,a lot more than a few of the actors are good
1,the movie was shot on a budget of about a million dollars,the film is a bit slow and boring but the story itself is
1,there is a lot of violence in the movie,there are a lot more to the movie
1,the film is about the struggle between the two men,the movie was a bit of an action film but it
1,to be fair i did not like this movie,to me it was the worst film ever
1,i have to say i was very impressed by the movie,i was surprised that the movie did not get a wider audience
1,the film is a bit of an exercise in the plot and it is not even worth mentioning that the movie has no plot and the,the movie was shot on location in the middle east and the story was a bit choppy but it was a good movie to watch
1,this movie was a waste for the whole movie,this is a movie for everyone who loves the book
1,rather it is the story that is so stupid and the acting was horrible,rather than a movie that is not only a comedy it 's a drama and
1,in the end it is not the best movie ever made,in fact it is a very good movie and it is a
1,some people say it 's the worst film i 've ever had the displeasure of watching but it,some of the scenes were so funny that you could tell the director was aiming at straws
1,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen,this movie is not a good movie but a very
1,i was surprised that the movie did n't have,i have to say i was very disappointed

1,the film has some good moments but it 's not enough to make you care,the movie is a bit slow and the story line was very predictable and the ending
1,it is not the best movie i have seen in my life,it 's a shame that this movie has n't made any money
1,this is the worst film ever made and i have to admit that i have seen worse,this movie is not for everyone but if your a fan of hers you 'll probably like it
1,christopher plummer is the perfect choice to be in the film,christopher walken plays the role as a cocky and manipulative character who
1,the movie is a complete mess of a movie,the film has some of its moments that make you
1,we are not told to believe the truth about the situation,we have to see the film to see what the director is
1,basically the movie was shot on a budget of about 50 million dollars,basically it is a movie that has a few laughs and it is a
1,kal ho na is a very good,kal penn is a good actor
1,this is the worst movie i 've ever had the displeasure of,this movie is not a good movie but it 's not
1,the movie was a waste for me and i would n't have to sit through the whole thing,the film is about a young woman who has been living with her mother in a very small apartment
1,too many of them are not funny and,too bad it 's a good thing
1,there is no real plot to speak and no character,there are some very funny scenes and the movie is a
1,the film has some of the worst dialogue i have ever seen,the movie is a complete waste of time and a complete insult
1,i have seen this movie several years ago and i still remember it fondly,i was n't impressed with this movie but it 's not that good
1,heck i do n't think that the movie,heck it was n't a good idea
1,at least it 's a little bit too long for me to be able to suspend the impression of the film 's plot and the acting is n't bad,at the end the movie ends abruptly and we see a lot of people who are n't even aware that they are in love with the same person
1,i have to admit that the film was very good,i was surprised to find that the movie was not as
1,the film is about the struggle of a man,the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,also the movie is not a complete waste of film and it 's a waste of time,also i think the director was a little prejudiced at the time and the director and the writer
1,to be honest i was n't expecting a movie to be so bad,to me this was the best of the series and i think that the
1,also i do not think that this,also the film is very good
1,i have seen the movie twice,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,in fact the only thing i can say about this film was the fact it 's a remake of the classic classic film,in the first film he was the only person in the movie who was a bit more than he bargained for and he 's
1,no matter what the movie was about it 's not,no one is going to be a good guy
1,it is not a movie that is so boring that you can see it in the background and the film is a complete mess,it 's a very funny film and it 's a shame that it was n't nominated for best picture for the best picture oscar but
1,also the film has a lot to do to get it,also i do n't know what to do with this movie but
1,another thing i did n't like was the ending,another problem is the ending which was so predictable and
1,and the ending was a bit too abrupt and the story line was just too predictable,and it is a shame because the film is so bad that i could not even watch
1,while i was n't expecting much of the movie to be a horror film i did,while the film was shot in the early 1980s it is still a great film
1,however i was surprised to find out the film was made in the early 90 's and the early 80 's,however the movie is not as good as the original but the film has a very good cast and the story line
1,because of this movie it is a movie that is not a good one to,because the movie was so bad that it made it hard to watch it
1,it 's not even the best movie,it is a very good movie
1,there are a lot more of them than the ones that have made this movie so far,there is a lot of action in this film and the ending is a little unsatisfying
1,i have to say that i was n't disappointed,i was surprised that this film did not have the
1,poor acting bad script and bad acting all round,poor direction and poor acting and a plot that was
1,some people say that the film is a little too slow and too predictable to,some of the acting is pretty bad but the story is n't that bad
1,his character is a caricature of the character,his performance in this movie was a little too
1,there are some very funny scenes and the movie is a,there is no real plot to speak and no character
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,overall the film is very good and,overall this is an excellent movie
1,amants a venezia is a very entertaining film that is not,amants is the only thing that makes it worth seeing
1,but it is not a movie that is,but the film is not as bad
1,sure it 's not a good film but the story is n't too good,sure the film is n't as good but it 's a good one
1,one thing i did like about this film was that the actors did,one of the most memorable films i have seen in a while
1,this is a very good movie and it is,this movie was so awful it was funny
1,attenborough is a master in the film industry,attenborough 's film has a lot to do but

1,the movie is about a young woman named seita played by the great actress selma,the film has a lot to offer and the story line is very interesting
1,to be fair the film was a little slow,to me it 's a very bad movie
1,your only real complaint is that the movie,your average movie goer will enjoy it
1,big brother and sister have a great deal to,big fat liar is a very good film
1,instead of a good movie it 's just not that good,instead it 's a movie about the evils of the human condition
1,sunny deol is the perfect actor,sunny abner was a great movie
1,this is a very good film and it is a great film,this movie was so awful that i could n't help but laugh at
1,tunes are used to convey a sense that this film has been made in a way that makes it a little bit more enjoyable than the first,tunes were very bad and the movie was n't even funny at all and the acting is horrible and i have to admit i was bored to death
1,unfortunately the movie does not work as a film,unfortunately it 's not a bad movie it 's just
1,i was n't expecting a movie about the holocaust but i was n't disappointed,i have seen the movie and i can safely tell that i am not the
1,this is the first movie i have ever seen,this movie is a complete mess of the original film
1,yet it is not the same as a movie,yet the film is a little too long
1,granted it is n't a good film but the story line was good enough to,granted the movie is n't a complete mess but it 's a good movie
1,the film has a very interesting plot but it is n't,the movie is about the same subject as a book
1,half of the film is spent on the first two minutes,half the movie is about the characters and their relationships
1,until i was in the theater for the movie to be released,until the end of this film i was a little skeptical
1,no one is a good guy but the movie is a complete mess of a film,no matter what you 're talking about and the film does n't even have to be the
1,the film has a very interesting story line and a great story line,the movie is about the same thing as a typical hollywood movie
1,anyway i have to admit i did not enjoy,anyway the movie was a bit too long
1,the movie is about the same thing about a woman named seita,the film has a very interesting story and a good cast but it
1,this is a very bad film,this movie was so bad it 's
1,although the movie is not a complete disaster it is a great film,although i do not think that this is the worst film i have seen
1,also i do not know what the point of this,also the film is a bit slow and boring
1,i'm a fan of this movie,i'm not a fan of this movie
1,i have to say that i was very disappointed,i was surprised that this film did n't get a
1,the film has a very good story and a good story line and a great cast,the movie is about the power of a man and his wife who are trying too much
1,i have to say that this is one of the worst films ever,i was surprised that this movie did n't have to be seen as a
1,from the beginning of the film the film is set in the,from a technical point the film is a very good one
1,until the last 15 years i saw this film in a,until i saw this movie i was a little skeptical
1,two men are sent into a prison to,two of them were the same people
1,eddie murphy is a good choice for the part,eddie izzard plays the part of the young man in
1,if you 're looking to be scared and want a laugh out of the movie you 'll probably like this movie and,if i were n't so irritated by this movie i would n't be surprised by it 's lack of redeeming qualities
1,the movie was shot on a low level,the film is a bit slow but it is
1,the movie is about the power of the characters,the film has a very good story line and the
1,i have to admit that the film was very good and i liked the ending but i did not,i was surprised to find that the movie was not a comedy but it was a good one
1,the film has some of its most,the movie is a complete mess
1,why is it that the movie has a lot more to do,why did they have such a bad script and poor direction
1,were they trying to make it a success to the masses,were we to assume the director 's intention was that he had
1,our heroes were n't the only ones that did not have the decency,our hero is the only person that has a shred to him
1,what is this movie trying for a,what a waste for a movie
1,as for me it was a great movie and i would,as a result the film has a lot of action
1,wow this is a good movie and a great one,wow i was so excited that i had to watch it
1,obviously the movie was made for tv,obviously this is a movie that is not
1,not only does he not make it through his life and he does,not to mention the fact that the film is a complete waste
1,but the movie is not a good one either as a whole as the first two films,but it 's a good thing to see a movie that has a lot of potential
1,definitely not a movie for everyone,definitely a must for anyone interested with
1,it 's a very funny film,it is not a movie that you
1,his character is so unlikable and the acting was so bad that i was laughing at him and laughed,his performance in the film is a little too long for him to be the only one who has a
1,it is a very good film,it 's not even the worst of
1,but it 's not the worst movie ever made but it 's not a bad film,but the movie was a little slow and the ending is so bad that i could not
1,i was n't expecting a lot of,i have seen the movie twice
1,immediately the film begins with the two main protagonists returning,immediately he finds out that he is a werewolf
1,the film has a lot of potential to be funny,the movie is about a group of people trying their luck
1,this is the worst film i 've seen,this movie is not for the faint of heart
1,if you 're a fan of horror films you will love this movie,if i were to give it a chance i would have given it 0
1,swept away by a bunch and then a few of the characters are introduced,swept up by the police and the police officer the cop is killed by the
1,so i was expecting something more like a movie about a bunch,so the film is a bit slow and the ending was too abrupt
1,like i said the movie was n't so good,like the first movie the characters are so stupid that
1,i was surprised to find that this movie was made for the first time in a very low,i have to admit that the movie was very well done and the actors were all excellent
1,when the movie was released it was a very funny movie and i was n't disappointed by the fact that i had n't heard of,when i first saw the movie in my childhood i thought it was going to be a comedy but i did n't expect it
1,whatever it is i have to admit i was,whatever the case i was n't expecting much
1,columbo is a great character actor,columbo 's performance was a little too
1,it is not the worst film ever made but the acting and the acting,it 's a shame because the movie was n't even good enough for the first
1,just like the other two movies i 've watched this one,just as a film is about the evils of war
1,john wayne is the perfect choice for the part,john goodman 's character is so unlikable that it 's
1,you know that the film has been made in a very long,you can see that the director was a very talented filmmaker
1,for a film that was a little too long and was n't very good it was a bit too slow,for the first half of this film the audience is treated with a feeling that it is a comedy
1,the movie was shot on a budget that was shot on location in a small budget,the film is a bit slow and the story line is n't that bad but it is
1,i have to say i was n't impressed with this film but i was n't expecting a lot,i was surprised that the movie was made in the first place and the director did n't seem interested
1,in the end it 's not a bad movie,in fact it is not a bad film but a
1,i was surprised to see this movie in the us,i have to admit i was very impressed by the film
1,i have seen the movie and i can say that it is one that i have n't read,i was n't expecting a movie about the evils that the germans were trying but the movie was just
1,the film is about a group that is,the movie was a waste of time
1,this movie was so bad that it,this is a very bad movie
1,i have seen the movie twice and i have never seen it,i was n't expecting a lot from the film but it was n't
1,the movie was shot on location and the acting was so poor that i was n't expecting anything from it,the film is a bit of a mess but the story is a bit too thin and the ending is just
1,overall this movie was a waste of my time,overall the movie is very well made and is very
1,i'm a fan and i do n't like it but i think that it is a great movie to see,i'm not a big big fan but i have to admit that i was very disappointed with the movie
1,however i do not recommend it to anyone,however the film is a bit slow at times
1,the movie is about a young man who has a crush on a woman who has a crush on her,the film has a lot to do but it is n't a good movie and it is n't even worth mentioning
1,it 's a very good film and a great one at that,it is not a film that is n't a comedy it is n't
1,i have seen the original version of this movie,i was n't expecting much of a film
1,but the film 's biggest problem is the lack that it is,but it is a great movie and i think it 's a good
1,i was n't expecting much from this,i have seen the original movie
1,it is not a movie for the,it 's a very funny movie
1,jack lemmon is the perfect actor for the part,jack frost 2 is a very entertaining film
1,i was n't impressed with this movie but i,i have seen this movie several years ago
1,i have seen the movie and it is a very good film,i was n't expecting a movie to be a horror film but it
1,complimentary and the film has an interesting plot,complimentary is the best of the three
1,i was n't impressed with this film,i have seen this movie several times
1,however i was n't impressed by the film,however the movie was a little slow
1,all in all a great film,all the characters were so stupid that
1,kutcher 's performance is the best of the lot,kutcher is a good actor but his role in the
1,i was n't expecting much from this,i have seen the original movie
1,the movie is about the power and the,the film has a very good cast
1,i was n't impressed with this film,i have seen this movie several times
1,while i was not expecting a good movie to be honest i did n't like it so much as i was expecting a lot more from the director and i was n't disappointed with the story and i,while the film is not a complete masterpiece it 's a great movie to see and enjoy and enjoy and it is a joy to watch and a great movie for anyone who loves a good story
1,imagine the film as the first film,imagine a movie about a young woman named
1,these are two things i have never seen before and i do not,these two are the best actors i have seen in any movie
1,and it 's a good movie to see,and the movie is a bit too long for
1,she 's a little more convincing and a lot of fun to look forward into,she is the only one who has a chance to be a good actress
1,this movie is not a good movie but a good movie to be,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen in my life
1,but it is a great movie and i recommend this to all,but the film 's biggest problem is the fact that it is a
1,he is the most talented actor in the film,he 's a very good guy and a good actor
1,yet the movie has some of the most interesting and touching scenes of the film,yet it 's not a bad film it 's just a bad film and a complete
1,her character is so stupid that it makes her,her performance in this movie was very good
1,and it 's not a good film either it is a good movie,and the movie was so bad that it was almost unbearable to sit at
1,by far one of the best movies i 've seen in a while and i think,by the end i could not believe how many people who actually liked this film
1,the movie was a bit slow and boring,the film is about the same thing about a
1,this is a very good movie,this movie was so awful it 's
1,the film has a lot of potential to be taken seriously and the film does have a,the movie is about a group of people trying to find a cure for their own
1,it 's not a bad film,it is a shame because the movie
1,and it 's a good movie to watch and,and the movie is a bit too slow
1,how can a film be so good,how could you possibly have to have the
1,as a result the film is not as good as the original but it is a,as for me it was n't a bad film but i was expecting something more
1,the movie is a complete mess of a film,the film has some of its moments that are n't
1,why is it so hard for me,why did they make this movie so awful
1,only the first half of the movie was pretty good and,only a few minutes of this movie are worth mentioning
1,pg13 rating pg13 for the graphic violence,pg13 rated pg13 for violence violence violence and
1,all in the family is a very funny and very entertaining,all the actors were great and the story was great
1,the movie is about a group of people trying to get their hands together,the film has a lot of potential to be taken from a book
1,this is the first film i have seen that made it a,this movie is a must for anyone interested with the genre
1,the film has some good points but it is n't enough to make it a good film,the movie is a bit of an insult to anyone who is interested in a film that has
1,my advice is that if your looking for a good laugh and you 're going to,my favorite part of this movie was when they had to go to a party
1,writers and directors have a lot of fun making a movie about a group that is not,writers of this film should have had the same problem with this film as the original
1,and it is not a good movie to begin with,and the ending is so bad it 's almost painful
1,the movie is a bit of an action film,the film has some good points but the story is
1,it 's not even the worst of,it is a very good film
1,the film has some good points but the rest is just plain awful,the movie is a bit of an action movie but the acting and direction
1,once the movie starts to get better the story becomes a little too thin and too predictable to be interesting but,once again i have a feeling that the movie is not a complete disaster but it 's a great movie
1,i have seen this film twice and it is a great film,i was n't impressed by the fact that the movie was made for
1,even the actors who are n't good are n't bad,even though the film was a bit long and boring at
1,lots and lots of action and lots,lots of people have to say that this
1,why did n't they make a movie about the evils that were supposed to have,why is this film so awful that it 's so bad it 's good
1,one of my favorite films of all times,one thing that really annoyed the film was that
1,james stewart plays a very good guy and he 's not a bad actor,james caan is the only actor in the film who is able in the film
1,what a great movie this was,what is the point of this film
1,most of the film 's plot involves a young man who has been killed and has,most people are not interested in the plot and the plot is n't that good
1,the movie was shot in a small town in new,the film is a complete waste of my life
1,this is a movie that is n't,this movie was a complete disappointment
1,at least the film was n't so good it 's not even worth watching,at the same time the movie is a bit of an exercise in the book
1,but it is not a movie,but the film is not as good
1,actually the movie is a little too,actually it is n't that bad
1,it 's not even the worst of,it is a very good film
1,i'm a big fan and have never been so disgusted with,i'm not sure why i did n't like this film
1,they 're all in the middle and the movie is a bit of a mess but it is n't,they are all very funny and funny and the story is very good and it 's not a bad thing
1,raiden and his wife are all very funny,raiden is the best of the three
1,it is a very funny film and,it 's not even a movie
1,that is what makes it a classic,that 's the only reason i gave this
1,the film is a bit of an action movie,the movie was shot on location in a small town
1,but it is a great film and i think it 's a good film,but the film 's biggest flaw is that it 's not even a good film
1,he 's a very good actor and he is very,he is the most talented character of all time
1,i have seen this film several times,i was n't impressed by this film
1,nick nolte is a good choice to play,nick stahl plays a very good guy
1,i have to say that i have seen a few,i was surprised that this film was released theatrically
1,on the other side the film was a bit too slow and the ending is too abrupt and too abrupt to be a thriller,on a positive note i think the film was very good and the acting was superb and the acting was superb and the acting is
1,you can tell the story is n't a bad,you know what i was going to do
1,nothing really happened in this movie but it 's not that good either,nothing is ever done in the movie but it 's not a bad film
1,the film has a lot of action in it,the movie is about a group that is attacked by
1,yet the film has a lot of action,yet it is a great film and a great
1,basically the film is not as good as it is in this,basically it 's not a bad film but it is n't
1,yes the film was a bit too slow but it 's,yes it 's a little slow but it is n't
1,trying to get the money to a bank robbery and a bunch of people in the city who are n't in the same league,trying hard and hard to get a good laugh out of it is the fact it is a movie about a young woman who has
1,on a positive note the acting was pretty good and i liked it,on the other side of my mind i found the movie to be very
1,her character was so stupid and the acting was so bad that it was almost painful to watch,her performance is a bit stilted but the film does have some good points to be found in this
1,when i first heard about this film the first thing that i did was the first time i was in the theatre,when the movie is about to be a good movie it 's a good thing that i can not find it
1,the film has a lot to do with a lot more of the same characters,the movie is about a young man named kenny played by a man named sam who
1,later the film settles into a very predictable plot,later on he meets up again and the two begin
1,otherwise it is n't that good,otherwise the film is a bit slow
1,there are a few moments of humor and a few moments that are n't funny,there is a scene where the two protagonists have to fight the urge to get rid
1,it 's not even the best movie,it is a very good movie
1,learn from the first movie that the,learn a lot from the film
1,i was n't impressed with this movie,i have seen this movie several years and
1,there is no reason to watch it and if you 're a,there are some good scenes and the movie is very funny
1,with a supposed beard and a beard that is n't even remotely amusing it 's a very funny movie that will appeal for anyone who enjoys good movies,with the help of the two men in a bar they are forced into the world war ii and the two men are reunited in a very very different
1,from the beginning i was expecting a good movie,from a technical standpoint it is an excellent movie and
1,the film has some good moments but it 's not,the movie is a bit slow and the story line is
1,freeman 's performance as the lead character was very good and the story was very interesting,freeman is a great actress and he is a joy to see in a film like that
1,i have seen the original version and i have seen it twice and i,i was n't expecting much of this film to be so much more
1,she is the one who is the,she 's a very talented woman
1,i was surprised to see this movie,i have to admit i was very disappointed
1,in the first movie the characters were very believable and believable,in fact the film was shot in a small budget and the
1,this movie was so bad it 's,this is a very bad film
1,the film has some of its most,the movie is a complete mess
1,c'mon i know that this is a good movie but i do not recommend this movie to,c'mon the acting was horrible and i was surprised that the movie was n't released theatrically
1,obviously this movie was a complete disaster,obviously the film is a little too much
1,jody is a very beautiful woman who is a very beautiful and very sexy young,jody 's father and his son 's son is the son of the family
1,the movie is a bit of a bore,the film has some good points and is a
1,but the film is not as good,but it is not a movie
1,the film has a lot of action and the story is a bit confusing but it is n't too,the movie is about a group that has been sent into the woods to find the missing treasure
1,any of the characters are so stupid that i ca n't even remember the names,any movie with the same name as the first one is not the same
1,i was surprised to find out the film is n't going to be good but i think that,i have to admit that i have seen this movie several years and i still have nightmares
1,how can a film like that be released on video,how could you possibly get a movie that is so awful
1,so i guess i 'll be watching the movie,so the movie was made in a hurry
1,i was n't impressed with the movie,i have seen this movie twice
1,i was surprised to find that the film was a complete waste of time and money,i have to admit that the film is very well done and i would recommend this film
1,in fact the film was shot in the same location and it 's a very good movie,in the first movie the characters were not believable and the story was not very interesting
1,you can tell the story is a bit,you know what i was going through
1,as a result of this movie it is not a bad movie but a,as for me i have to say i was impressed by this movie
1,the movie was shot on location in a very tight and very very very,the film is a bit of an action film but it 's not
1,i have seen this film twice and it is one of the most beautiful films i 've seen in years and i have to,i was n't impressed by the fact that the film is so bad it is n't even funny it 's just plain awful
1,has the movie been a success,has a good story and good actors
1,together with a couple 's other films the movie has a lot to offer and,together they are the only ones that are able to get their hands together
1,ravishing in a way of making a movie,ravishing and funny the movie is not for everyone
1,but the movie is not as bad,but it 's a good movie
1,whereas i have n't read the book i do n't know what the film was trying for,whereas the film is a little bit slow moving the plot has a lot of holes and is
1,evil is a good movie but the story is so weak that it 's,evil dead is a movie that is not just about the human race
1,regardless of this the movie is not as bad as it should,regardless the movie was a complete waste of time and money
1,this movie was so bad it was good,this is a very bad film and it is
1,i have seen this film several times and i still have nightmares and nightmares,i was n't impressed by this film but it 's not a bad film it
1,it 's not a bad movie,it is a shame because it is
1,otherwise it is a good film to see,otherwise the film was a waste of time
1,in fact it is not the best movie ever,in the end it 's a very bad film
1,it is a very good film,it 's not even the worst of
1,also the film is very good,also i do not think that this
1,some people say that the movie was made in a hurry to be made,some of the acting is good but the story is n't really good
1,if i were to give it an 8 out of ten i would,if you 're a fan of the original you will probably enjoy it but
1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i have seen this film twice
1,i was surprised that this film did not get a theatrical release,i have to say that i was n't impressed by the film 's
1,it 's a shame that this film has not been released on video or vhs,it is not the best movie ever but it 's not as bad as the others
1,lucia 's character is the only one who is a real person,lucia is the best actress ever to play the role of a lifetime
1,this movie is a complete waste,this is the first movie that i
1,there are some good moments but it is not,there is no reason for this to be a movie
1,why is this movie rated so high on the,why did n't he just kill the girl
1,when the film is over the top is a little too much,when i saw this film i thought it would be good
1,if i were n't for a few minutes i 'd never have seen this movie,if you 're looking for a good movie with a good plot this is n't for
1,but it 's a great film and a good movie,but the movie is a bit too long and the ending
1,broadcast in the uk the film was made in a time when the world,broadcast is the best of all the movies that i have ever watched
1,this is the worst movie i have ever had to endure and i have,this movie is not a good one but it is a good film
1,it 's a shame that the film has been released in dvd so that it will be released soon and will be forgotten,it is not the best film i 've ever had the pleasure of seeing but it is definitely worth seeing for its portrayal
1,it 's a shame that this movie is n't available on dvd or dvd release,it is not the best movie i 've ever watched but i have to say it
1,i was n't expecting a lot from the movie but it was n't,i have seen the movie twice and i can tell you it is n't
1,we have a lot of people who have been so affected and have been in love with the same woman that they have,we are supposed to be a little more forgiving of the characters and their motivations but they do not seem very realistic
1,the movie is about the power of the characters,the film has a very good story line and the
1,through a series of flashbacks we learn a lot about the story and how it is going to end and,through the movie i thought that the movie would have made it a little better but i was wrong
1,in fact it 's not a bad movie,in the end the movie has no real story
1,i was surprised that this film did n't get released theatrically in the,i have to say that i was very disappointed with the movie
1,even though the movie was a bit long,even the actors are n't very convincing
1,firode 's film has been released in the,firode is a master of the macabre
1,maybe it 's just me but i think that 's the,maybe the movie is n't a total waste of time
1,did i mention that this was a very low production and not a good,did n't they think that the real world would be a good place
1,arthur is the best of all the cast,arthur 's character is the only reason i gave
1,i have to say i was n't impressed by,i was surprised that the movie was made
1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,in fact it 's a very bad movie,in the end the film has a lot to
1,not to say that the movie is n't a complete waste of time,not only is the acting terrible the script is awful the script was horrible
1,i was n't impressed with the film,i have seen this movie twice and it
1,he 's a very talented actor,he is the most annoying person in
1,willem defoe is the perfect choice for this film,willem dafoe plays a young woman in the film
1,it 's not even a movie it,it is a very funny film
1,in fact the film is a bit too long,in the first movie he is the only person who
1,now i have seen a lot worse,now that i have n't read the novel
1,neither of them is a good thing,neither the acting or acting are all bad
1,it 's not even a good film,it is a very funny movie
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,and the movie is a complete mess,and it 's a good thing
1,it 's a very good movie and it is not a bad film,it is not a film for everyone who wants to be entertained by a
1,shortly after he has been killed he is rescued by the devil and,shortly thereafter the movie is a bit too long for the story
1,i was surprised that this film did not have a chance to redeem,i have to say that i was n't disappointed by this film
1,if you 're a diehard horror buff and want a good scare movie this is the movie to be,if i were to rate this movie a zero i 'd give this a 0 out of 10
1,this movie is not for the faint hearted,this is the worst film i 've ever seen
1,unfortunately the film is not as good and the performances as it,unfortunately it is n't the worst film i have ever seen
1,so i guess i 'll be a fan,so the movie was made in the early 80
1,a few of them are very funny and i think they were all funny,a lot of the scenes were filmed in a way like the ones in which
1,well the movie was a little slow but i did n't expect it to be a good movie,well i guess i 'll be a fan of the movie but i have n't read it so it
1,some of the scenes were just too long and the story was too slow and boring,some people say it 's a good film but i do not recommend it to anybody who
1,the film has a very good cast and the actors are very good and it is very well acted and well acted,the movie is about the power and soul that the people who have been in love and the life of the two families
1,the film is about the struggle of a man,the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,i was n't expecting much of a movie but it was,i have seen the original version of the scarlet pimpernel
1,of all of these films this is a must see for all ages and,of course the film has a lot to do but it is not
1,i have to say that this is one that is a waste of time,i was surprised that this movie did n't get released on dvd or dvd release
1,rogers 's performance as the mother of the family and his mother is,rogers is a great actress but she does not have a chance
1,no matter what you do n't want you to do,no one is a fan of the original but i do
1,samir is the only one to survive in the end and he is a good guy,samir 's character was the only one that could be the one that he was
1,however i was n't impressed with this movie,however the movie was a bit too slow for
1,i was n't impressed with the movie,i have seen this movie twice
1,finally the movie is about a man who has a wife and a daughter,finally i have seen the original version and i can safely recommend it
1,interesting and funny and i really enjoyed this,interesting to see a movie like this
1,if i were to give this movie an extra rating it would be,if you 're a fan like myself you will probably like it
1,we are not supposed to feel sorry for him and,we have to be careful to see this movie
1,there are a few moments of brilliance and a couple of moments of humor,there is a scene where the hero 's character is revealed to be the one
1,considering that the movie is about the same subject as a movie it is a very good,considering the budget of the film it 's not even that bad it is a waste
1,the film is a bit of an exercise into the genre of the genre but the story is a little bit too easy to swallow,the movie was shot on location in the early 1800 'searly 1950 and the early 90 's and early 90 's and the late 1960s and
1,i have seen this film twice,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,yes the movie is n't a bad film,yes it is not a bad film but it
1,all the actors are excellent and i have,all in the name of the movie
1,being a fan of the original i was very impressed with this film,being the only one to be able of the movie the story is very
1,he 's a great actor but his performance in the movie is so poor,he is the only person who has a shred of respect and is a very
1,there are some very good scenes in this film and the movie is a perfect,there is no real reason for the existence of the killer to kill him
1,the movie is a bit of a mess,the film has some good points and some good
1,son of a bitch was an interesting film,son and son is a very good film and
1,well i guess it was a bit too much for the movie,well the movie is a bit slow and boring but it is a
1,and it is a shame because it is a great movie,and the ending was a bit abrupt and i was n't sure
1,in the end the movie has a very good cast,in fact it 's not a good movie but it is
1,he 's a great director and a good,he is the only one to die
1,supernatural and the movie has some of its most memorable scenes and the best,supernatural thriller has a lot of potential and it is a great movie
1,he 's not the best character he 's in,he is a very talented actor and a very good
1,but it is a great film and i think that the film was a good idea to make a good film and i think it is one of the better ones i 've seen,but the film 's biggest flaw is that it is not a comedy or a comedy it is just a bunch of silly jokes and a few scenes that are so bad that you can
1,if i were n't so irritated i 'd be able,if you 're looking to be a fan of this genre
1,it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen but i have to admit i was n't disappointed,it 's a shame because it is not the worst film ever made but it 's not a bad one
1,none of the actors were particularly convincing and the story is,none the more it 's a good movie to see
1,there is no reason to see the film and it is not even a movie,there are some good scenes in the movie but it 's just not enough
1,i have seen the movie and it 's a great film,i was n't expecting a movie to get the message across the
1,the film is a bit of an action film,the movie was shot on location in a very small
1,i was surprised that the film did not have a chance,i have to say i did n't like this film
1,please please please do not waste time on it,please do n't waste your time on it
1,janet gaynor plays a young girl who has to deal with a young girl who has a crush on the young woman,janet mcteer is the only one that is able to make a good movie and this one does not have the good qualities
1,other than the aforementioned plot holes it 's a pretty dull movie that is not worth watching,other reviewers have commented on this film and i think it is a good movie to see if
1,great acting and a great cast,great movie for the first half
1,there are some very good moments in this film but,there is no real reason to watch this movie
1,the film has some good moments but the story,the movie is a bit slow and boring
1,the film is about a young man named kenny who has been living with a woman and,the movie was a waste for the whole family and it was a waste of time
1,reissued by a group of young men and a young woman who 's been married to a young man who is a little too young and too,reissued in the early seventies and the early 70s and the early 1960s and the early seventies it 's a great deal to be reckoned with
1,i have seen this movie several years ago,i was n't impressed with this movie but i
1,fats 's character is so stupid that,fats is the best of all
1,this is the first film i have ever seen in a while and i have seen,this movie is a must for anyone who wants to see something different and interesting
1,riding lessons are the only ones that are n't so good,riding the streets and the car chases are the best
1,inevitably it 's not a bad movie,inevitably the movie is not as bad but
1,trapped in a small town with a group of young people in a small rural town who are in a small,trapped on the ground is a film about the life and death of the young girl who is a woman
1,i was n't impressed with the film and the plot was so predictable,i have seen this movie twice and i have to admit i was n't
1,wow this movie was so bad it,wow i do n't know why
1,the movie was shot on location in the early 1800 's and early 80,the film is a bit of an exercise into the culture of war
1,she is the only person that is n't a very attractive,she 's a little too old for her own good
1,even though it 's not the worst movie i have ever seen i have seen worse acting,even the most ardent fans of this genre should be advised that the movie is a bit too
1,and it 's not even the best of,and the movie was a complete waste
1,not to mention the fact that it was a complete,not only does he not make a good movie
1,from a very good opening scene with the giant squid and the lion 's advocate of the film it is not that bad,from the opening scene of a young woman masturbating to a man who 's been crucified and the other woman 's death is the
1,unless it is the same old man who has a heart of mind that he has n't seen it,unless you are a fan of the genre and have seen the original series i would recommend the movie for
1,not to mention the fact that the film is a complete mess,not only does he not make it through his life and his wife
1,putting the movie on a list is what makes this movie so,putting it bluntly on the dvd player is a good example
1,cult movies are not always a good thing,cult films have a lot to offer
1,had the director and writer have a little bit of fun to work on and they,had it not done for it it might have been good but it was n't
1,but the film 's biggest flaw is the lack of any,but it is a great film and a good movie
1,it is a very good film,it 's not even the worst of
1,and the movie was so bad that i,and it 's not a good film
1,meanwhile a woman is killed and she 's left with a mental institution,meanwhile the film is a bit slow and the ending feels tacked on and
1,but the movie was n't so much of,but it 's not a good movie
1,grandma is the best character ever to be seen and,grandma 's father is the daughter of the family
1,a few of the scenes were filmed on a shoestring note,a lot of people are talking to the camera and the actors
1,at the end the movie is about the man and his son,at least it 's a bit of a stretch to sit through
1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,javier bardem plays a very good role as the villain who has to be the most sympathetic person,javier is a great actor and i think that the movie is a good one to watch
1,sends the film to the big screen is a very interesting film that will keep you,sends a new generation to a small town and a new life of the world
1,i have to admit i did n't enjoy this film,i was surprised to see that this was the first film
1,based upon the book the author and writer and writer of this movie should have had a lot more to do,based on a true story this is the story about the lives of two friends who live together and each other in
1,for a film about a woman who is a little too much,for the first time i was n't impressed with the movie
1,you know that it is n't a movie,you can see the director 's intentions for this
1,but the film 's biggest problem is that the film does not seem to be the same,but it is a great movie and it 's not a bad movie it 's just not that
1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,thats not a bad thing but the,thats what it 's all about
1,absolutely nothing happens in the movie,absolutely no redeeming features are made to
1,but it is a good movie,but the film 's main problem with
1,one of the most interesting things about this movie was the fact it 's a very,one thing i did n't know is how many times have i seen this film
1,as for me it 's not that bad,as a result the movie is a bit too
1,you can tell the director was trying too hard to be a,you know what i mean but it 's a great film
1,i have to admit that i have seen a lot worse than this,i was surprised to find out the film was a complete waste
1,personal instinct of the film is that it is not a film,personal born is the most interesting thing in this movie and it 's
1,ok i know that this is a movie that is,ok so the film is n't a bad film
1,i have seen this movie several years and,i was n't impressed with this movie
1,she 's a very talented woman,she is the one who is the
1,it 's not a movie that is so bad it is funny,it is a shame that this film has been made available on video
1,i was surprised to find that the movie was a complete mess,i have to admit that the film was very well made and i
1,although i have seen the movie many times i have seen it twice and i still have to admit that i was n't impressed by,although the film was made for the sake it is a film about the holocaust of war and the war of the united states'
1,then the movie starts to get worse,then there is the scene where he is
1,i have to say that this is a great film and i hope it gets a dvd release of the dvd release of,i was surprised that this movie did not get released theatrically in theaters and it 's not available on video or dvd
1,mind the film is a complete mess,mind you i am a fan
1,so the film is not as good as it is in this movie but it is a good movie,so i was expecting a lot of fun and this was the first time that i had heard about the
1,of course there is no real plot to speak and nothing interesting,of all the films i have seen i 've seen this movie
1,the movie is a bit slow but the acting and the direction is so good that i ca all,the film has some good moments and some good acting but the story line was just too bad
1,nobody seems to know what the hell was happening and why,nobody is able and it 's not a bad thing that they
1,that is what i think is a good,that 's the way it 's supposed
1,none of the characters are believable and there is no development in the story and,none the more i assure you you 're not a fan of this movie
1,that is the only thing i can think,that 's what makes this movie great
1,it 's a shame because the film is a bit too slow for the first,it is not the worst film i have seen but i 've seen better
1,it is a very good movie and it 's a great film,it 's not even the best of the genre but it 's a
1,apart the movie is not a complete waste,apart from that the movie was pretty bad
1,the movie was shot on location in the early 1800 's and early 90 's and the early 80 effects are very cheap and the acting was n't bad but it 's not that good,the film is a bit of an exercise into the culture of war and it 's not a very good movie but it is still a good film and a good one at it
1,this movie is not a bad film,this is the worst movie ever made and
1,okay i know that this is a movie that i would watch over and read but it 's not,okay so the film is n't a bad film but the acting and the direction are so good
1,unfortunately the film is not a complete waste of time,unfortunately it is n't the same as a lot
1,with a few exceptions the film is a bit slow and boring but it is,with the exception being a bit too long it 's a very good film
1,the movie was shot on location in a very tight location and it was filmed on,the film is a bit of an action film but the story is very good
1,donnie yen plays the role as a very cocky and loving character,donnie darko is a great actor and he is very good in his
1,unlike most movies of this genre it is a little too much to ask,unlike the first film the story is a little too thin and the story is
1,it 's not a bad movie but it 's a good one and a good one,it is a shame because it 's not the best film ever made but the acting and
1,i was n't expecting a lot from this movie,i have seen the movie twice and it 's still
1,if i had to give this movie a 0 i 'd be giving the film an extra star rating for the acting and directing,if you want a movie that does not need a good story line or a good plot this is the movie to watch
1,i have seen the original movie and it is very much like a movie that,i was n't expecting much from the movie but i was n't expecting much
1,both the story of a man who has,both of these films are the best
1,yeah i know it 's a good thing,yeah it was a little too long
1,after the movie was over i was n't expecting much,after a while i had a feeling that the movie would
1,its a very good movie and it 's not a bad movie but the,its not a good film but it is a great film to watch
1,gus 's direction is a little shaky but the film is a bit slow,gus van sant is the master of this film and it is one that you
1,2054 in the dark is a very entertaining film,2054 is an interesting movie that will be forgotten for
1,no matter how much you want it to happen,no one has ever heard of this film
1,men and women are not the best,men are n't always in their twenties
1,the film is about a young man who has,the movie was a waste for the movie
1,you can see the director 's intentions and the director 's intentions to be a little too much,you know that it is n't a bad film but the acting is so good it 's not funny
1,the film is a bit slow but it 's not as good,the movie was shot on a low level of the budget and the
1,the film is about the struggle of the two,the movie was a bit of a mess
1,but the movie is a bit too slow and boring for a while,but it 's a great film and it is a great movie
1,what a waste for a film,what is this movie trying to do
1,all in the name is the same,all the actors are great and the movie
1,when the film is over and over the top it is not,when i saw this film on tv i thought that it was a
1,this movie was so bad that it,this is a very bad movie
1,so the film has its charms,so i was n't expecting much from
1,one of the best films i 've ever watched,one thing i liked about the movie is that the
1,sorry to say i was disappointed but this film is a,sorry but this is the worst of the worst movies
1,i have to say i was n't impressed with this film,i was surprised that the movie was made in the first few
1,this is the first movie that i,this movie is a complete waste
1,and the ending was so bad that it,and it is a very funny film
1,at least the movie is a bit slow and the plot is too thin and predictable to follow,at the same moment the movie has a very long shot and a very long shot of the car
1,the movie is about a young man named benjamin and his,the film has a lot to do with the plot
1,walter brennan plays a young woman who has a crush on her and her husband,walter matthau is a fine actor and he 's not just the bad actor but the
1,in fact the film is not a complete disaster but a very good film and a great one,in the first movie he was the only one who had the ability to make the movie even better
1,btw the film is not as good and the performances were good,btw i was surprised to find out that this was a low production
1,i have seen the movie and i have seen it several times and it is one that i would recommend,i was n't expecting a movie about a man and his son but the story is so simple that it 's

1,if i were to rate it lower then the rating it would have been,if you 're a diehard fan of the original you will love it
1,wells 's film has been done in the style of the first film,wells is a master of the craft and the director of the movie
1,in fact the only thing that makes it worthwhile is that it is a bit too much,in the first film he is the one who has to deal and solve his problems
1,aside from that the film was a total waste of my,aside the movie is a complete waste of my life
1,i have to say that this movie is one that is,i was surprised that this movie was n't released theatrically
1,as a result the film has no redeeming qualities,as for me it was a very enjoyable film
1,i was surprised that the film was n't so much more of a comedy than a horror movie,i have to say i did not like this movie but i was n't expecting a lot

1,apart the movie is a complete mess,apart from that the film was a total
1,this movie was so bad it 's,this is a very bad film
1,he 's a very good actor,he is the most talented character in
1,a few years later the movie is,a lot more of a movie
1,ho hum is one of the most underrated films i 've seen in a long time,ho vinci code is one that is a must see for anyone who loves action
1,anna friel is the only one that is good in this movie and she 's not a bad actor,anna paquin plays a young girl who has a crush in the world and is not a good actress but
1,the film is a bit of an action film,the movie was shot on location in a very small
1,i have to say that this is a great film and it,i was surprised that this movie did not get released theatrically
1,in the end it is a very good movie,in fact it is a great film and i hope
1,viggo mortensen plays the part with the character of a young woman who has been,viggo mortenson is the only one in this film who has a good time
1,although i have seen this film many many years ago i still remember the title of the film,although the film was a bit long it was a bit slow moving and not very interesting
1,yes the film is n't as good as,yes it 's not a bad film
1,the film is about a group that has a lot to do,the movie was a waste of time and money and time
1,several people who have seen this movie are either mentally ill or disgusted,several of the characters are very interesting and i do think they are all
1,in fact the only reason i watched this movie was that i had a crush on a movie called a movie called,in the first film the main character 's father was killed by the devil and he was a little more human
1,there are some very funny moments but the movie does not,there is no real plot and the acting was terrible
1,i have to say i was n't impressed with the movie,i was surprised that the movie was made in a time where
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the movie was shot in a small budget
1,i was surprised that this film did not have a chance for the director to be in it for a few minutes and then i realized it was n't a,i have to say that i was n't disappointed by this movie but i did n't think that it was a bad movie but it is a great movie
1,avoid it like i did n't like the first,avoid this one at any cost and if you 're
1,my favorite scene is where the guy gets the girl to eat him,my advice to anyone who is interested in the genre or if you 're
1,i have to say i did not like this film,i was surprised that the film was n't so bad as
1,the film has a lot to do with the story and the acting,the movie is about a young man named benjamin who has been sent to
1,i have to say that i was n't impressed by the film 's,i was surprised that this film did not get a theatrical release
1,it is a shame because the movie,it 's not a bad film
1,basically the movie was shot on location and the camera work is very poor and the editing was horrible,basically it is a movie that is not only about a young man 's life and the life he endured
1,if you want a movie that does not need to be made in a theater or a good time do,if i had to give this movie a 0 out 10 it is a good film to be sure
1,fortunately the film 's biggest problem is,fortunately it is not a movie
1,after the movie i was a little skeptical about the movie,after a while the film is about as good a film of
1,the film has some good points and some good,the movie is a bit of a mess
1,imo the film has a very nice,imo it is a great movie
1,get a copy of the movie and you 'll be disappointed by it and you will see,get to know a little bit about this movie and it 's not a bad movie
1,in the end the movie is a complete waste of your time and time,in fact it 's not even the best movie i 've seen in a while
1,this is a very good film,this movie was so awful that it
1,everyone is entitled to a certain degree,everyone else in the movie was so bad
1,at the same moment i thought the film would be a little,at least the movie was n't so bad it was funny
1,all the characters are all very likable,all in all this is one that i
1,widmark is the best actor ever in the movie and it is a,widmark 's character is so unlikable that he is unable to cope
1,it is a shame that the movie has,it 's not a movie for everyone
1,another thing that i did n't notice is that the film was shot in the same way as a film,another problem with the movie was the fact it 's not a good film but the acting was good
1,spoiler alert the film is a little slow but it 's not a good movie,spoiler ahead i was surprised that the film did not have the potential of a sequel
1,i'm not sure why this movie is not available in dvd format,i'm a big fan of horror films and this one was a huge
1,the film has some of its moments but it is not,the movie is a complete mess of the original film and the
1,but it 's a great movie,but the movie is a little slow
1,the film is a bit slow and the story is too predictable,the movie was shot on a budget that was filmed in a warehouse
1,much of the movie takes place in the middle of the desert and it is not until a very gruesome ending,much like a movie that was shot in a very small town in the early seventies it was filmed on location
1,for the first time in a while i was a little skeptical about the film and the acting was n't bad but,for a film about the evils of the human condition the movie has been made to be a very good movie
1,so i guess it was n't a bad idea,so the movie is a bit slow but it 's
1,but it is not a movie,but the film is not as good
1,i have seen this movie several times and it 's one that i would,i was n't impressed with this film but i did n't expect it
1,episode 1 is a very good movie,episode 3 was the first one i had
1,acting was ok the story is a little weak but it is,acting is n't bad but the script and direction is terrible
1,i was surprised to see this film in the us and i,i have to admit i was n't impressed with the movie
1,thank god i did not pay for it,thank you to me for the movie
1,and the ending is so bad it makes,and it is not a good movie
1,for a film that is a little bit too slow for a horror film the,for the first half hour or two i was n't sure what was happening
1,i was surprised that the film did not have the potential,i have to say i did n't like this movie
1,would n't it have been better,would you have to be a big
1,it is not a film for everyone who wants to be entertained and to be entertained,it 's a very good movie and it is not a bad movie but a great movie
1,that is the best thing about the film,that 's what i thought it was
1,my favorite scene was when he is talking about his father and his dad,my advice to the filmmakers of this film are the ones who have to watch
1,but it 's a good thing to see this,but the movie is not a good one
1,this movie was so bad that i could not believe that i wasted watching it and it 's a shame,this is a very bad movie and i do n't know what it was like to be a fan
1,but it is not a good movie,but the film is not a good one
1,she is the only one to be rescued by the,she 's a little more than she bargained to
1,that 's what makes this movie so great and i have to admit,that is the only thing i did n't like about this film
1,her performance is a little stiff but the film 's direction is very poor and,her character was so annoying that i could not care less about the characters
1,to me it 's the best of the three,to be fair the movie is n't a bad film
1,i have seen the movie and i can safely tell that i was n't expecting much from,i was n't expecting a movie about the holocaust but i was expecting a lot more
1,those are the only things i can think of in this film,those who are not familiar with this film should see it
1,i have seen this movie several times and i still have to watch the,i was n't impressed with this film but it is a good movie
1,there are a lot more to be made in the film,there is a lot of violence and nudity in it
1,every time he 's on the screen he is able,every scene is a complete mess of the film
1,however i do n't know what the point of the film was,however the film 's main problem is the script which is so convoluted
1,this movie was a complete waste,this is a movie that i would
1,in the first movie the characters are all so stupid that,in fact the film was shot on a low level
1,the movie was shot in a small budget and the acting was so horrible that i was surprised to see that it,the film is a complete waste of time and money and money and time spent on it and i ca all
1,if you want a good laugh and enjoy a fun film then this one,if i had to watch this film i 'd be a little ashamed
1,and it is a shame because the film is so bad that it 's almost unbearable,and the ending was a bit too abrupt and the story line is n't as good
1,then the film switches gears and the,then there 's a few things
1,belle is the best actress in this movie,belle 's character is so annoying that i ca
1,there is no real reason for this movie to be released,there are some very good scenes and the film has a very
1,when i first heard about this movie i was expecting a good movie,when the movie is about to end you are not going for the same
1,for a film about the evils and tribulations of the people involved with this movie,for the first time in a long time the movie is a complete mess
1,at least it was a bit of a stretch to watch,at the end of the movie i thought the film would have
1,mask of a serial is one that is n't a complete success,mask is a film that is not only a vehicle to show a
1,the movie was a waste for me,the film is about a young woman named
1,by far one thing the movie is not about the story of a man 's struggle with his wife and his wife,by the end of the film the viewer feels that the movie is going to be a little slow but the story line
1,also the movie was a little too long,also i think that it is the most beautiful
1,instead it is a very boring and boring movie that is not even worth renting,instead of being the worst of the three films i was expecting a good movie to
1,erm i was a bit skeptical about this,erm the movie is a complete waste
1,zombi 3 was a great movie,zombi 2 is one that is n't
1,the film is a complete mess,the movie was shot in the early
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,ok so the movie is a little too long for the most part but the acting and direction are so bad it makes you wonder how much more it could have done with it,ok i know it was a low budget film but it was a good movie and i would n't recommend this movie to anybody who has n't read the novel and seen it
1,wow this movie was so bad it,wow i do n't know why
1,the film is about the same subject matter and the story,the movie was a bit slow but it was n't
1,it 's not a bad film,it is a shame because the movie
1,another thing i noticed was that the film was a bit slow,another problem is that it 's a bit of a stretch for the
1,this movie was a complete disappointment,this is a movie that is n't
1,well the movie was n't that great,well i guess i was n't expecting a
1,when the movie was over and over the years i had to watch it to see what was going on,when i first saw this movie i thought it would be good but i was wrong it was so awful i
1,goodnight and the beast was a very good film,goodnight is the worst movie ever made and i 've
1,let 's face it the movie is a complete waste,let me tell the same story about a group of people
1,the film has some good moments and some good acting,the movie is a bit slow but the acting and direction
1,you can see the director mateo and his wife and they both are very,you know that it is a good idea to have a good time
1,it is not a movie for everyone,it 's a very funny movie and i
1,i was surprised to find out that the movie is not about the same subject as the original but it 's a,i have to admit that i was very impressed with the movie and i think the movie is a little slow
1,and the movie is so bad that it 's almost laughable to watch and the acting is horrible and the plot is so stupid,and it 's a shame because it is not the best movie i 've ever watched but i have to admit i did n't like
1,now that 's a bit too much,now i know i 've seen the first
1,but it is not a movie that you can see in a theater,but the film is not as bad as it is in the movie and
1,there is a scene in which the two men are reunited in a car crash and they 're all wearing the same clothes and the camera pans down in the air,there are a few good scenes but it is not enough to make you laugh and you 'll laugh at the jokes and jokes that are supposed for the movie
1,one thing that really annoyed the movie was that the,one of my favorite films of the last decade
1,strangely the movie is a complete waste,strangely enough the movie was a complete waste
1,i'm not a fan of this movie,i'm a fan of this movie
1,a few of the actors are good but they are not very convincing,a lot of people have said this movie is so awful it 's good
1,yesterday i saw this film in a sneak preview and i thought that it would be a,yesterday the movie was made in the early seventies and the film is not as bad
1,i was surprised that the film was n't released in theaters,i have to say i did not like the movie
1,but the film is a bit too long for me to,but it is not the best of it 's genre
1,hey it was n't a good idea to make a,hey i know that the movie is n't bad
1,this is a movie that is n't,this movie was a complete disappointment
1,why is it so hard for him,why did they make this movie
1,however i was surprised to find out the film was a,however the movie is not as good as the original
1,handsome and funny the movie is a great example of how a film should be,handsome young woman who is married with a young man is a little too eager to
1,this is a very good movie and i think it,this movie was so awful it was almost painful
1,i was n't impressed with the film,i have seen this movie twice and it
1,and the movie is so bad that i ca only think of one good reason,and it 's a shame because it 's not a good film to watch
1,you know that it 's not a good idea,you can see the movie coming out of the blue
1,if you 're a diehard horror buff and have seen the first two movies this one will be a disappointment,if i were to rate this movie a 1 out 10 i 'd give it 0 out of ten
1,some of the acting was good but the story line is so weak,some people say that this movie was bad but it was not
1,ironic to see the film was released in,ironic that this film is a remake
1,please do not waste your time on this movie unless your a diehard fan,please please do n't waste time on it and you 'll regret it for yourself
1,while i was n't impressed by this movie it was still a good film,while the film was a little slow at times i found it very difficult for
1,where is the plot and story line that has to be the most complex thing about this movie and the fact,where the film is concerned is that the film is set in a very small town where it is set
1,dustin ifans plays the part with a lot more than a cameo,dustin hoffman is a great actor and i hope he does n't have
1,he 's not the best actor in,he is a very talented director
1,in fact the only thing i can say is the acting is horrible and the plot line is so bad it,in the first film he was the only one who was a good guy and the rest was pretty bad
1,the movie was a bit of an action film,the film is about the struggle between the two and
1,in the end the film has a lot of action and the ending was so bad that i could not believe it was actually made,in fact it 's a very bad movie and it is n't even worth mentioning that the film was shot in the early 1980s
1,the movie was a waste for me and my friends,the film is about a young woman who is attracted to
1,after the movie i thought that the film would have been better and it would 've,after a while the movie becomes a little too long for the first half hour
1,all the actors were great and the movie was a real treat to watch,all in the family is a very good film and i would recommend this film
1,young people who are not in the military are not in the,young man is a good film and i recommend this movie
1,it is a very funny movie and it 's not just a movie it,it 's not even a good movie but a good one to watch
1,i have to admit that the film was a bit too slow and too slow for,i was surprised to find that the movie is not as good as it was
1,time travel and time travel is one of those films that is so bad it makes you want you,time is spent on a film that has a lot to offer and the story is a bit too predictable
1,the film is about a group of young people,the movie was a waste of my time
1,evil dead ii was one that was n't really a horror film,evil is the only one who has to be the leader of a
1,it is not a movie that you,it 's a very funny film
1,they are all very good actors,they 're all in a very good
1,two men are sent into a prison where they have a very large part in their,two of them were the same people who had been in love with each other
1,anybody who thinks that this is the best of,anybody interested in this movie will be disappointed
1,so the film is not as good as it should be,so i was expecting a lot of fun and i liked it
1,i was surprised to see this movie in the us and it is a shame that it is not available in dvd,i have to admit i was very impressed by the movie and the way the characters were portrayed in this movie is a
1,i have to say that i was n't impressed by the movie but it,i was surprised that this film did not get a theatrical dvd release
1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,thumbs off the film for a few quid and a few minutes of your,thumbs up to the actors who are the only ones that are good
1,either the director is trying too hard or too,either way the movie was a complete waste
1,i have seen the movie twice,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,they are not the same as they were in this one but they are,they 're not even close enough to make the movie even remotely watchable
1,then the film is set up as a flashback of the first film,then there 's the fact that it is a movie about a man trying
1,if i were to give it a zero rating it was a waste,if you 're a fan of horror movies and you 're a fan of
1,selleck is a very good actress and is a very good actor,selleck 's performance is the only thing that makes this film watchable and
1,the movie was shot on a low budget and it 's not a good movie to watch,the film is a bit slow but the acting and the story is so bad that i ca
1,high heels are the norm 's best,high school is not a movie

1,the movie is about the power and the,the film has a very good cast
1,one of my favorites was that i was watching the movie and i was a little surprised,one thing that i did n't like about the film is the way it was filmed
1,no matter how many years ago i have seen,no one has to be a good guy
1,this is the first film i 've seen in a long long,this movie is a must for all lovers of horror movies
1,this movie is not for everyone but if your looking to see a movie,this is the worst film ever made and i 've seen it twice
1,the movie is about the same thing about a man named benjamin who is a little bit too young and has been living in a,the film has a very interesting story and a very good story line and the acting was good but the story was so weak

1,yes it 's not a bad film,yes the film is n't as good as
1,well the film is n't a bad film but the,well i do not know what the point was
1,lois lane is a good choice for the role of a young woman,lois chiles plays the part of the young woman in the movie
1,great acting and a great cast,great movie for the first half
1,incidentally it is not the same,incidentally the film is a little too
1,nelson is the best actor ever to grace the screen,nelson 's character is so unlikable that he becomes annoying
1,i'm not sure what to expect,i'm a big big admirer of the
1,i was n't expecting much of this movie to be a good film,i have seen the original version and it is very faithful to the book
1,she is a very talented woman,she 's not the best actress in
1,in the end it 's a very good movie,in fact it is not the best film of all
1,however the film is not as good as the first one,however i do not think that this movie was made in a
1,this movie is not a good one,this is the worst movie i have seen
1,since the film is a bit too long it is not as bad,since i have seen this movie many years ago and i have seen it
1,surprisingly enough it is not the same as in the original but the fact that the movie was made for a very,surprisingly the film is a bit too slow and the story is too thin and the story is n't that interesting
1,it 's a very good film and it 's a great movie,it is not a film that is not for the faint hearted or
1,sanders 's performance as a young man who has been in love with a man in a past,sanders is a great actor and i have to admit i was n't impressed by this film
1,despite the obvious plot the movie is very entertaining,despite being a fan of the genre i was very
1,since the movie was made in a time in the west it,since i was a kid this movie is not for everyone
1,the movie was shot on location and the acting was pretty good,the film is a bit of a mess but the acting and direction
1,if i were n't for the first half of this movie it would have made it a little more enjoyable to sit through and enjoy,if you 're looking for something that is a little more interesting then this is the film to see and you will enjoy it

1,donald sutherland plays a very likable and likable character who has a very difficult role to,donald pleasance is the only one who can save this movie from the other actors
1,jean gabin 's performance is the only saving graces in the movie and it,jean simmons is a very talented actress and she 's a great actress
1,for the most of the time the movie was made for tv,for a movie that was a little bit of a mess it 's
1,i have to admit i did not like the film,i was surprised to see that the film was made for

1,and it 's not even the best movie i have,and the movie was a complete waste of time
1,when the movie was over i was n't expecting anything else,when i first saw this film on tv it was a complete
1,the film is a complete mess of a film that has no plot,the movie was shot in the same way that the story was filmed
1,the movie was a waste of my time,the film is about a group of young people
1,her performance is a bit stilted but the film is a bit too much to be enjoyed,her character was so stupid and the acting was horrible and she looked like she had been reading

1,jekyll is a good guy who is n't afraid to go into a world where he can be found in a world of crime,jekyll 's story of the man is a bit too familiar with the first two movies but the film does n't seem to be the
1,so i guess it was n't the case with the movie but i was n't sure what to do with this film,so the movie is a bit of a mess but the story is so good that you can tell the director is n't
1,it 's not a movie that is so bad it 's,it is a shame that this film has been made
1,but it is a good film and a good movie,but the film 's main flaw is the fact that the
1,only the most ardent fan would be able to suspend disbelief for,only a couple who have seen this film are the same
1,basically the film was a bit too slow,basically it 's a very bad film
1,it 's not a bad movie,it is a shame because it is
1,spoofing this film and the other comments on it i thought it would be a great movie,spoofing the movie is the fact of the matter that the movie is based upon a book that
1,haruhi is the only person that is able in the film,haruhi 's character was a bit too much to bear
1,here 's the story the acting was terrible,here is a movie that i would recommend watching
1,he is the most talented character of all times and is the only reason why i love,he 's a very good actor and he 's a great actor and a great actress
1,there is no real reason for this to happen in this,there are some very good scenes and some good acting
1,seeing this film is a must see,seeing the movie was a waste
1,as a result the movie has no redeeming qualities,as for me it 's a very funny film
1,despite the obvious plot holes and the occasional lack of a plot,despite being a fan i was very disappointed with this movie
1,the film has some of the most,the movie is a complete waste
1,his character was so stupid and the acting was so bad,his performance is a little stiff and he is not a good
1,it is not a film for the,it 's a very good movie
1,the movie was shot on location and it 's a shame to see a movie that has a good story,the film is a bit of a bore but the story is so good and so funny that it 's almost
1,moreover the movie is not as bad,moreover it 's a very good movie
1,maybe the movie is a bit of an exercise on its subject matter but it 's a very enjoyable film,maybe it 's just a matter of fact that the movie was made for tv and it was n't even worth
1,there are a few moments of humor that make it hard to sit and laugh,there is a scene where the two men are walking through a forest and the camera
1,in the first movie the main characters are a group of friends and a bunch of friends,in fact the film was a bit of a letdown but it was a great film
1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i have seen this film twice
1,imagined by the film 's director and the director 's commentary on the film it 's a film about the evils of the human condition,imagined as the first movie i was surprised that the movie had a lot more to offer than the original but i think that it was
1,this is the worst movie ever,this movie is not a bad movie
1,tabloid is the best movie ever,tabloid idol is an excellent film
1,the movie was shot on a budget of 1,the film is a bit slow and boring

1,it 's a shame that this movie has n't been released on video,it is not the best movie i have seen but i 've seen better
1,this movie was so bad that it,this is a very bad movie
1,the movie was a bit slow but i did n't expect much from the film to begin with,the film is about the same subject as the book and it 's a very good one and a
1,the movie was a bit slow and the plot is too thin,the film is about the same thing as the first one
1,sylvester stallone plays the part of a very good guy who is a bit of a jerk,sylvester is a great character and the movie has some great scenes and a lot more
1,i have to admit i was very disappointed,i was surprised to see this movie
1,at least the movie was n't a good idea to make it a movie,at the same moment i thought that it would be good to watch a film
1,i was surprised to find that this movie was made in a hurry,i have to admit that the movie was very well made and the actors
1,it is a shame that the film is n't,it 's not a movie for the masses
1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,it is a very funny film and,it 's not even a movie
1,saw this movie at the toronto film festival,saw it in the theatre and it 's a
1,its a very funny film and i would love it to have been released on,its not a bad movie but the fact that it 's a good movie
1,the movie was a waste of my life,the film is about a group of people and
1,to me it 's the best movie i have seen,to be fair the movie is a bit of a mess
1,this is the first film i have seen in a long time,this movie is a must for anyone interested in a film
1,as a result the movie is a complete mess of the original,as for me it 's not that i have to say that this
1,whatever the case is the fact that it is,whatever it is that is n't the case
1,bingley 's performance in this film was so good that it was hard for him to,bingley is a great actor but he is not the only one to be able
1,the movie was shot on location in the early seventies and was shot in a very small budget,the film is a bit of an exercise into a very dark atmosphere and a bit of an allout
1,i was surprised to find out the film was made in a very low budget and the actors were n't really good,i have to admit that i have seen a few movies that are so good that i have seen them all and this
1,i was n't impressed with this movie,i have seen this movie several years and
1,uncomfortable and funny is the fact that it is a movie that has,uncomfortable to see the movie was a complete mess of the original
1,are they trying too hard to make it a success,are we supposed to be rooting for him to be the
1,mary is a great character and she is a very talented actor,mary pickford plays a woman who has to be a woman to get
1,none of these characters have any depth and the film does n't seem very,none the less the movie was shot on location in the middle east
1,we are supposed to believe the story is a little too,we have a lot more to say about this film
1,some people have commented on the acting but i do not care for the actors and,some of them were very good but the movie was n't even that bad either
1,in the end it 's not even a good film,in fact it is not a movie to be taken lightly
1,studio executives are n't going to get the money they have to work with but the,studio ghibli has a great cast and is a great director and a good actor
1,but it 's not a bad movie it is n't bad,but the movie was n't bad enough to be funny
1,if you want a movie to be a good one with a few laughs then this,if i had to give it a chance it would have made a good movie
1,this movie is a must for all fans,this is the first film i 've ever seen
1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i have seen this film twice
1,as a matter of view the movie is very good and,as for the acting it 's not a bad movie
1,as a matter of fact i was not surprised to find out the whole thing was a total,as for the acting i would have given it zero stars but it is a little generous
1,nothing really happens in the film,nothing is explained and the film does
1,there is no reason to watch this film unless you 're looking for a good movie to,there are some good scenes and some good acting but it 's just a poor movie
1,chris kattan is the perfect choice for the part of a young woman,chris farley plays the part with the character of a young boy who is
1,so the film has its moments,so i was n't expecting a lot
1,this movie was so awful it was funny,this is a very good movie and it is
1,there is no real reason for the existence to come,there are some very good scenes in this movie
1,he is a great director and a,he 's not a bad actor
1,by the time i saw it i was a bit skeptical about it but it was a good movie and,by far the worst movie i 've seen in a while and it 's not a good movie either
1,dan aykroyd plays the role as a cocky and cynical character who is a very likable character and a good actor,dan is a very good actor and i think that he is the only actor who has a role in the film
1,whoever thought this was a good idea to make it a good idea to make it a good movie to,whoever wrote the screenplay and the script is the same as this one and that 's saying a little
1,of all of the films i have seen i have seen,of course the movie is a bit of a bore
1,screenwriters have a great deal of talent,screenwriters and director should have had the opportunity
1,tears are the only thing i have ever seen in my life,tears and ears is one of the best films of all times and
1,naturally the movie has some good points and some good acting but the story line,naturally it 's a very bad film and it is not even worth renting
1,this is a very good film,this movie was so awful that it
1,this is the worst movie ever made and,this movie is not a bad film
1,hardly a good movie but a good one to see,hardly any other movie that i 've ever seen
1,i have seen the original version and it 's,i was n't expecting much of this movie
1,actually the film was shot on a,actually it 's a good movie
1,somerset is a very good actor and he is a very talented director,somerset sinatra plays the part with the best performance in the film
1,it is not the best movie ever made,it 's a shame that this film is not
1,good acting and a great cast,good luck to see the movie and
1,if you want to see the movie you will probably like this,if i had n't been a little bit prejudiced i 'd have to
1,most of them are not even close to being a great movie but they are good,most people have seen the movie but i think that the film is a little slow and
1,his performance is a bit stilted but he is a great actor,his character was so annoying that it was impossible for me
1,bill paxton plays a very likable character,bill nighy is the perfect choice to play
1,the movie was a waste for me and my gf and my sister,the film is about a young woman who is a woman and her mother
1,i have to admit that i was very disappointed,i was surprised to find out that the film is
1,it is a shame because the movie,it 's not a bad film
1,a lot more of a movie,a few years later the movie is
1,i have seen the movie and it is a very good film,i was n't expecting a movie to be a horror film but it
1,in fact it 's not even a good film it is a waste,in the end the movie is not as good as the original
1,we have to be careful of the fact that it is not the,we are not supposed to be a bit harsh about this movie
1,instead of a good movie this one is just a waste,instead it 's a movie that is not worth watching for the
1,did i forget that the film is a little,did n't you know it was a comedy
1,she 's a little too old to play the role,she is the only person that has a chance for her
1,the movie was shot on location in the middle east and the story is about a young woman who is in love,the film is a bit of an exercise in the plot and it 's a little too long for a movie that is
1,however the movie was a little too long,however i was n't impressed by this film and
1,the movie is about a group that has a lot of fun to be,the film has a lot of action and a few moments of suspense
1,well i guess it 's a bit too,well the movie is n't that bad
1,the movie is a complete mess of a movie that has been released on dvd,the film has some of its moments that make it a little more interesting
1,another problem with the film is the lack of a story and it 's not even a,another thing that i found was the fact it had a lot of potential to work
1,ten minutes into this movie i was n't sure what,ten years ago i was able into the film
1,the film is a complete mess of the original,the movie was shot in the same location as a
1,the movie is about a young woman who is attracted by her father to a young woman who is in the middle and a woman,the film has a lot to offer but the story is n't too good and it is not a good movie to watch and it is
1,his character is so unlikable and so annoying that it 's impossible not only,his performance in the film is very well made and is very convincing
1,the film is a bit of an action movie,the movie was shot on location in a small town
1,every scene is shot with the same music and the same is used to be used,every time he appears in the film he is not only a very talented actor
1,the movie is a bit of an action movie,the film has some good points but the rest of
1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,you can tell that this is a very low budget movie,you know what to expect and it is n't a bad movie
1,did n't you know that the film was made in the early 80 's,did i forget that this is a film that has a very strong cast and
1,very good film with a great cast,very few movies are in this genre and
1,jack lemmon is a fine director and a good director,jack frost 2 was a great show for me
1,as for the acting it 's a little bit of a shame,as a matter of view the film is a complete failure
1,as a result of this movie it 's not even a movie it 's just plain,as for me i have to say that i have n't seen the movie yet
1,it 's a shame because it 's not a,it is not the worst movie ever made
1,bradford dillman is the only one who is able in a way to get the girl to do the right thing and he,bradford is the only person that is able in the film to make a good film and he is a good actor
1,so the movie is a bit of an insult,so i guess it was n't the first movie i
1,the film is about a young man named krishna who has a crush on his wife and,the movie was a waste for the whole movie and it 's not a total waste
1,so the film has a lot of potential,so i was n't impressed with this movie but
1,may i say that this is a great movie,may contain a bit of a plot twist
1,that 's the way it 's supposed,that is what i think is a good
1,both the story of a young man who is in his late,both of these films are not so bad it 's good
1,i was surprised that this movie did n't have a chance for,i have to say that this is one of my favorites
1,let 's just hope that you will get a lot of fun out there,let me say that this movie was so awful it was almost painful to sit
1,still it is a great film and a,still the film has some good points
1,in fact it 's a shame that the film is n't available on dvd or dvd,in the end the film is not as bad but the story itself was so bad it
1,this movie is a complete waste of time and a waste,this is the first movie that has a good cast
1,creative and exciting the film is a mustsee,creative license to be made in a film that
1,precious little is the case with the movie,precious enough for the first two minutes of this
1,add a few extra twists and a few moments of suspense and a good story line and a great cast,add to the film the great soundtrack and the music score and the music is excellent and the music score is
1,however i do not think this is a good film,however the film is not a good one either
1,we are supposed for the most to see this movie and it is a very enjoyable movie,we have a very good film about a young man who has a very difficult time and his
1,maria 's father is a little too much for her and the story,maria is a young man who has a crush in her life
1,there are some very good scenes and some good ones,there is no real reason for this to happen
1,get to know a lot about this film and the fact it was made for television and the fact it was made for,get a copy of this movie and you will see what i mean if you 're a diehard collector of horror films
1,watered down to the end is a very satisfying film,watered up is the most boring film ever made
1,if i had n't been in the mood to see it i 'd probably have been a little more impressed by the story and the acting,if you want to see a movie about a man who has a heart of mind and is a great actor then this is a movie to
1,in the end the movie is not a good,in fact it 's not even a movie
1,after the first hour i realized that this movie would be good but it was n't,after a few years of watching the movie i was surprised to find out what was the
1,i have to admit i did n't enjoy this film but it is one of the best,i was surprised to see that this was the first movie i saw in a while and it
1,within a year of this movie i was n't expecting much,within the first ten minutes of this movie i was thinking that
1,this movie is a complete waste of time and a waste,this is the first movie that has a good cast
1,then there is a lot more,then the movie switches gears and we
1,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen in my life and i have to admit i was so,this movie is not a good movie but a good movie to watch and i recommend it to all
1,that 's the way it 's supposed to,that is what i think is a great movie
1,the movie was shot in the same way as the other films,the film is a complete mess of a movie that is n't even
1,there is a scene in the movie that i remember when the movie came out,there are a few good moments but the movie does not have a lot to offer
1,so the film is a bit slow but the,so i was expecting something more like this
1,however the movie was a little slow and boring at times,however i was n't impressed by the fact it was n't the
1,it is a shame that the film has n't received a cult following in the us and the only one who can,it 's not a movie for the faint hearted viewer but the acting is excellent and the direction is very strong
1,the movie was shot in a very,the film is a complete waste
1,we are supposed to believe that he is the only person in,we have a lot more of the characters and their relationships
1,the movie is a complete mess of the first movie,the film has some of its moments but the film does
1,in the first film he was the one to kill and the girl who had to kill her and,in fact the only thing i can think of that is that the film is a complete mess
1,a few of the scenes were shot on the screen,a lot of people are talking about the movie and it
1,though it is not a masterpiece it is still a very enjoyable film and a great one at it,though the film is not a masterpiece of the book the film is a complete mess of a film
1,first of all i have to say i,first off i was a bit disappointed
1,director michael curtiz has a great cast,director john mctiernan is the director of this
1,the film has some of its most,the movie is a complete mess
1,for a film that was a little too long for me to enjoy it i was very impressed,for the first half of this film the audience sees a lot more of the characters and their motivations
1,he 's not the only one who,he is a very good character
1,it is a very funny film,it 's not even a movie it
1,and the ending is so bad it 's almost painful,and it is not a good movie to begin with
1,after a few minutes of the film i realized that the movie was a little bit too long,after the first half hour i realized i was going for a comedy but i did not
1,we are not supposed to feel like we 're watching a movie that 's,we have to be careful to be the only one to watch it
1,it 's not a movie that you will enjoy,it is a shame that this movie is not available
1,another problem with the movie is the fact that it is a very poor movie,another thing that i did like about the film is the way the story is set
1,does n't it have to be a movie to be made,does anyone else think that this movie is a masterpiece
1,as a result of the fact it was a little too,as for me i was n't impressed by this movie
1,there are a lot more of them,there is a lot of action in the
1,if you want a movie to watch with a group of mates you 're not going to,if i had to give it an extra point for it i would have been able
1,meanwhile the two men find themselves in the same place and they are forced into a world where they are forced into the lives and circumstances of their own lives,meanwhile a group member of a group called a mysterious group of poachers who are stranded on a remote planet inhabited by a mysterious assailant who has been evacuated from a
1,at least the movie was n't a good idea,at the same moment i thought that it would have
1,hopefully it 's not the same,hopefully the director will be able to
1,the film is about a group that is,the movie was a waste of time
1,i was n't expecting much of this film to begin,i have seen the original version and i have to say
1,moonwalker is one that you will enjoy,moonwalker was a great movie and it is
1,no matter how much they do n't want,no one has ever been a fan
1,if you 're a fan like myself and you have n't seen,if i were to give this movie a 1 i would
1,location is the only reason i can think for the movie 's,location was a bit choppy but it 's a good movie
1,i have to say i was n't disappointed by the film,i was surprised that the movie was n't released theatrically
1,that 's what i thought it would have,that is the best thing about this movie
1,in the end it 's not a bad movie but it is a good movie to watch,in fact it is not a bad film but it 's not bad either as a film it
1,a few years ago the film is set up in a very short flashback sequence,a lot more than a little of a good thing it 's a good film to
1,this is a very good movie and it is,this movie was so awful it was funny
1,and the movie is so boring,and it 's a shame that the
1,i have seen this film twice,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,the movie was shot on a budget that would make the movie more interesting to watch and it was a great movie to see if it had been made in,the film is a bit slow and the ending is a little abrupt but it is a good film to watch and it 's a great movie to watch
1,the film has some of its moments but it is n't,the movie is a complete mess of the original film
1,sometimes the movie is a bit slow and the ending is too predictable,sometimes it 's not that good but it 's a great movie
1,there is a lot of action and some really good action,there are a lot more of the characters and more
1,the film is about a group that is,the movie was a waste of time
1,i have to admit i was very impressed by the movie and i was surprised to see it,i was surprised to see this movie in the us and it was n't a bad film
1,we have to be careful of this film,we are not supposed to be scared
1,incidentally it 's not the best movie i 've,incidentally the movie was made in a hurry
1,unbelievable and not funny at all,unbelievable to say this is a good
1,anyway the movie is n't bad,anyway i have seen this film several
1,that is the only thing i did n't like about the film,that 's what makes this movie so great and i think it is
1,the movie was a waste of time and money,the film is about a group that has a very
1,i have to say that i have seen a few,i was surprised that this film was released theatrically
1,of course the film has some of its most memorable moments but it is,of all of these films i 've seen this is a must have
1,a few years ago the film was made in a small budget and it was a bit of an attempt at making it into the film industry,a lot more than a little more than a few of the other characters in this movie were the ones who were n't in the movie
1,however i do n't know what to say,however the film 's main problem with this film
1,i have to admit i did n't enjoy this film but it is one of my favorites of all,i was surprised to see that this was the first movie i saw in a long long time
1,think about the movie 's plot,think of it a little bit too
1,having seen the movie i was very disappointed with the film,having said all that it was a great movie and i would
1,helping the film to be a little bit of an insult to the intelligence,helping to make the film more interesting and the story is very good

1,abel 's performance in this movie was a bit overdone but the film was so good that i could n't help thinking that the,abel is a great actor and he 's not a bad guy but he is a great actor and is a great talent

1,this movie was so awful that it,this is a very good film
1,job of the film was a great movie,job is the only thing i have to mention
1,when i saw this film on the shelf it looked interesting and i was surprised to see it,when the film is over and the acting is n't bad it is n't even that good
1,not only does it look like a cheap movie but it is n't a good film either as it is n't a good movie,not to mention that the film is a bit of an insult to anyone who has seen the original and the first film and i
1,even though it 's a bit dated and the acting is pretty bad it 's not even,even the most ardent of characters in the film have been reduced to the original story

1,why did n't he try to make a movie,why is this movie so awful that it 's so
1,visually the film has some very good moments but the story line is so weak that it,visually it is a very good film and i recommend it to all who are fans
1,that 's the only thing i have to do,that is what makes this movie so great
1,but it 's a good movie and it 's a great movie to watch,but the movie is not as good as it should be and it is a

1,sonia foch is a great actress and she is great in the role of the mother who is the only one who has to be a little too much,sonia bynes plays a woman whose only purpose was to make a decision to save the day and her husband 's death and the fact that she is a little
1,i was surprised that this movie was made,i have to say that this movie was so
1,if i were to rate it lower then i would have been a little more generous,if you 're a diehard fan of the genre and have a chance for the real reason

1,peter falk plays the role as the villain,peter o'toole is a fine actor but his performance
1,the movie is about a young man who has a crush in,the film has a lot to do but it is n't

1,dead poets is a very entertaining movie,dead bodies is one that i would n't
1,overall the film is a bit too slow for a movie,overall this is an enjoyable film and a good one
1,thank god for the first time i saw this film,thank you for allowing me a good laugh and i will
1,the movie is a bit of an action movie but it 's a good film,the film has some good points but the rest is a little too slow
1,it 's a very funny movie and i,it is not a movie for everyone
1,that 's the way i should have been,that is what i thought it would be a
1,but the film is a bit too slow and too boring to get into the story and,but it is not the best of the series but it 's still a good movie
1,the film is about the struggle between the two men and their relationship with the,the movie was a bit of an action film but the acting is good
1,who would n't want to be a part of this movie and,who is the killer in the first movie and the girl
1,using a few of his actors to make the movie a little bit of an achievement to me,using the same old formula and clichs that are in the first movie the characters and the characters were
1,that 's the only thing i have ever seen on the screen,that is what makes this movie so good and it 's a great
1,much of it is a bit of an attempt at humor,much like the first film the story is very simple
1,i have to say that i have n't read,i was surprised that this film was made
1,despite being a fan i still have to say that this movie is not for everyone,despite the obvious plot holes the movie is not as bad as it should have

1,it 's a very funny movie,it is not a movie for the
1,i was n't expecting a movie about the holocaust but i did not like the movie,i have seen the movie and i can safely tell that it is not a good film
1,what is the point of this film,what a great movie this was
1,as a result of this film the movie fails miserably at the end,as for me i have seen the movie and i have seen it
1,more importantly it is the story of a young woman named caroline who is attracted to a,more than a few of the actors are good and the story line was good enough
1,the film is about a young woman named,the movie was a waste for me
1,the movie was shot in a very,the film is a complete waste
1,happy days of a film is the best movie ever,happy gilmore is a film about a man who is a
1,the movie is about the power and soul of a young woman in the world of the late,the film has a very good cast and it is very well done and well worth watching
1,my advice to the director of the movie is that it 's a movie that,my favorite scene was the one where he is walking around in the car
1,even the most ardent of characters in the movie are the same,even though it 's a bit dated and a little too sentimental for
1,hence the film 's ending is a bit of a disappointment,hence that 's the only reason why this movie was so good
1,there is a lot of action in the,there are a lot more of them
1,the film has some good points and is a,the movie is a bit of a bore
1,when i saw the movie on tv it seemed like a bad movie,when the film was over i was n't sure what it was about but

1,there is no reason for the to be the,there are some good moments in this film
1,when the film was over i was n't expecting anything more,when i saw the movie on tv it was a waste of
1,the movie is a bit slow but the story is so good and the acting is so bad that it,the film has some good moments and some nice touches but the film does not have the same charm
1,oh yeah i know that the film is n't a bad movie but it is,oh and a lot more than that it 's not even worth the wait
1,to me this was the worst film i 've seen in years,to be honest i was surprised to find that the film was not
1,no matter what the cost of this film it,no one is going for the same reason
1,when i first saw this film on tv i thought it would get,when the movie was over i was n't sure what it was
1,this is a very bad movie and it 's a shame because,this movie was so bad that i was n't even laughing
1,though it 's not a great movie i think it 's a very good movie,though the movie was n't as bad as the original the movie is still pretty bad
1,we have to see the film to get the point of view of the story,we are not told to believe the story of a man 's struggle with his mother
1,i was surprised that this movie was n't made in the us,i have to say that this movie is a complete mess
1,with the exception of the film the film has a very interesting plot,with a few twists thrown in there are some good performances and a few
1,the film has some good moments but it 's just too much to ask,the movie is a bit slow and the story is n't that interesting
1,if i had n't been a fan i would have been able,if you want to see the worst movie i 've seen this is
1,finally i have seen this movie and it 's not a good one either but,finally the movie is a little slow and the story is n't that bad
1,the film has a very interesting plot and a good story line,the movie is about the same subject matter as a movie
1,someone else has the same thing as the first one,someone who has a crush on the subject of this film
1,however i do n't know why i was n't so impressed with the film,however the film 's main flaw was that it was not a comedy
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,he is a very talented actor,he 's not the best character in
1,it 's not even a movie it,it is a very funny film
1,the movie was a bit slow but it did n't make sense,the film is about the same subject matter as a movie about the
1,this is the worst film i have seen,this movie is not for the squeamish
1,this movie was so awful it was almost laughable to me,this is a very good movie and i recommend it to all
1,i was surprised that the movie did n't get released theatrically,i have to say i was very disappointed with this film and
1,considering the fact of this film it is not that bad,considering that this is a film i have to say that it
1,it is not a film that is not for the faint hearted,it 's a very good film and it 's a great movie to
1,i have seen this film twice,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,i have to admit i did n't enjoy the movie but it was n't that good,i was surprised to see that this was a movie that was n't even nominated for best
1,film noir is a film that will be forgotten by the public and is a,film is not about the war of the world but about the human condition
1,it 's a very good film,it is not a film that will
1,this is the worst film ever,this movie is not for everyone
1,in fact it 's not even the best movie ever,in the end the movie is a complete waste
1,with a few exceptions i would have liked it,with the exception being the first movie i have to
1,however the film is a bit too,however i do not recommend it
1,and it is a very good movie,and the ending was so stupid
1,it is not a movie for the,it 's a very funny movie
1,only a couple who have seen the movie know that,only the most ardent fan would have been able
1,uncharacteristically it is a film that will appeal to all audiences,uncharacteristically the film has a very good story line and a great
1,that 's what makes it so great and it 's a shame because it is a very enjoyable film,that is the only reason why i gave it 2 stars out of ten stars and that 's it for
1,sadako is the only one who has to deal with,sadako 's character was so stupid and so stupid
1,gypsy is a very funny film,gypsy 's performance was a bit overdone
1,these are the two adjectives i have read,these two characters have a very good story and
1,heroes are not the same as they are in,heroes and gentlemen have a lot of problems
1,first off i have no clue what this,first of all the acting is horrible
1,total waste is a waste of time,total recall the first time you see this
1,he is the most annoying person i have seen in a long long long long long time,he 's a very talented actor and he 's not just the bad guy he is
1,bill nighy is a good actor and he 's a good director,bill paxton plays the part with a smile and he 's a good
1,again the film has some of the worst dialogue ever,again i do n't think it was a good idea for
1,other than that the film is pretty good,other reviewers here have commented that this movie was
1,howard hughes 's performance as a young boy is very convincing and the film has an interesting,howard brackett is a great actor and he 's a great actor and a good actor
1,still the film is a little slow,still it is n't that bad
1,the movie was a waste for me and my friends,the film is about a young woman who is attracted to
1,i'm not a big fan of the genre,i'm a fan and have never been so disgusted
1,not to say that it was a bad movie,not only is the story a bit too weak but
1,but the movie is not as good,but it 's a good movie and a
1,star wars was a great show for the first,star trek is the worst of the series
1,behind this film i was expecting something like this to be released in the uk,behind the scenes the director and his wife have been a little more creative and the
1,perhaps the most interesting aspect is that the movie has a lot to offer,perhaps it was a mistake to make it a little bit of a mess
1,a few of them were good but the story is so bad it 's unbelievable,a lot of the film is about a young woman named caroline who has a daughter
1,it is not a film for the,it 's a very good movie
1,a lot more of the film is a bit of a mess,a few years later i saw the film and was surprised that i
1,actually it 's a good thing to watch a film with,actually the film was shot in a very tight manner
1,the film is a bit of a bore,the movie was shot on location and it was
1,even though it 's not a bad movie i think,even the most ardent fans will enjoy the film
1,the movie was shot in a small town in new,the film is a complete waste of my life
1,i have to say i was n't impressed by,i was surprised that the movie was made
1,or maybe the director 's intent is to make the film more realistic and,or the fact it 's a comedy or is it just a comedy
1,i was surprised that this movie was n't released in the uk,i have to say that this movie is one of my favorites and
1,george c bush has a very small part in this film,george clooney is a good actor and he 's not a good
1,but it is a great film and i recommend it,but the film 's biggest flaw is that the story is
1,dakota fanning is the only one who has to be a very nice actress to be a woman in this film,dakota redgrave plays a young girl in the middle east who is a bit of an insensitive and defensive woman
1,i was n't impressed by this film but i was surprised that the movie was made,i have seen this film several times and it is still a great experience to watch
1,oh and the ending was a little unsatisfying but,oh yeah and i do not know why
1,i have to say that this is one of the worst films ever,i was surprised that this movie did n't have to be seen as a
1,now i know i 've been watching a lot,now that 's a bit of a shame
1,i have to admit i did n't like the movie but it,i was surprised to see that this movie was released theatrically
1,some people say it is bad,some of the scenes are just plain
1,i was n't impressed with the film and the acting is n't bad,i have seen this movie twice and i have never seen a film with
1,mr bean is the only one who has a chance to make,mr blandings has a great deal to work as an assistant
1,code 46 was the worst film ever,code of the art is a very good
1,shot on location in the late 1800 's and early 80 'searly 90 's,shot in the late 1800 's this film has been done by the same studio
1,funny and funny but not the best,funny how i can watch this show and
1,first of all the movie is not about the evils of the world,first off i have to admit that i have seen a few of these
1,or the other two are all very funny,or maybe it 's the fact that the film
1,if you want a good laugh and a good laugh at the expense of the actors and actresses you will enjoy this movie,if i had to watch this film again it was a total disappointment to watch and i would n't have been able
1,oh yeah and the movie was n't bad but it 's just bad,oh and the music is n't bad but the acting is horrible and it
1,he is the only person that has a shred of decency,he 's a great actor and a great actress but i do
1,the film has some good moments and some nice touches,the movie is a bit slow but the story is very
1,check it out for the good of it,check out this movie and watch it
1,in the first film the main character is a very unlikable character,in fact the only reason i watched it is because it 's so
1,robbed of the fact is the director and director chose to create the,robbed to be a good movie it 's not a good movie
1,cecil b mayer 's character was a bit of an idiot,cecil is a great actor and i think that he was the
1,a lot more than a little more of a comedy it,a few years ago the film was released on video
1,and the ending was a little unsatisfying and the movie is n't even funny,and it is a shame that the film has n't been remastered in the past
1,there are some very good scenes and the movie,there is no real reason for this movie
1,i have to say that i have seen this movie several years and it is still a great,i was surprised that this film was released in theaters and released in the us in 1980
1,i have seen this movie several years and,i was n't impressed with this movie
1,so the film has its charms and,so i was n't expecting much
1,the film is about the struggle of the people in a world of the living,the movie was a bit of a mess but i did n't expect it
1,many of us who have been in the us know about this film and we are not aware,many people have commented that this movie was a complete waste of my life and my money
1,and the ending was a little too abrupt and the ending is just too predictable,and it is a shame that this film is not only a film about the holocaust
1,the film is a complete mess,the movie was shot in the early
1,with a few twists and a few scenes that are n't really worth watching,with the exception of a few other films i 've watched this one is the
1,i have to say i did n't enjoy the film,i was surprised that the film did n't get a wider
1,he 's a very good guy,he is the most talented actor of
1,my advice to anyone who is a fan and the fact that the film is so bad is it,my favorite scene is where the two guys are talking to the guy and the girl is talking to her
1,could n't have done more wrong with this film and it 's not even that bad it,could have been a better movie if the director had been given a more serious script
1,the movie is a bit slow and the story line was n't,the film has some good moments but it 's not enough
1,viewers will be delighted to see the movie as the best of the series,viewers who are not interested with the subject matter should see it and enjoy the
1,it 's a shame that this movie has not been available in the uk,it is not the best movie i have ever had the misfortune to see but
1,in the first film he was a very talented actor and he was very good in this movie,in fact the only thing i liked was the acting and directing and the directing was so good
1,worrying to the audience that he is a man of a man who is not afraid to make a,worrying about how the film was shot and the lighting was so good it was a real treat
1,not only is it not a very bad movie,not to say the movie was n't bad
1,miller is the only one who has a knack for the truth,miller 's character was so stupid and the plot is ridiculous
1,probably a lot more than the average viewer who is n't familiar to,probably the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune to see
1,a few years ago the movie is a bit slow and boring but the acting and direction is excellent,a lot more than a few of those films i have to say that i was n't impressed
1,the film is a bit of an exercise in a long time and,the movie was shot on location in the middle of the desert
1,it is not the best film i 've ever had the pleasure to see but it 's a very enjoyable film,it 's a shame that the film has been released in dvd format and it is available in dvd format as well
1,then the movie switches to the end of the movie and the end of it all,then there is a scene where a man who has a heart attack is a little too
1,as a matter the film has a very good plot,as for the rest i would say that this is a
1,the movie is a bit of a bore but it is,the film has some good points and is very good
1,it 's a shame because it is not the worst film ever,it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen but i 've
1,pair are not the only ones who have a shred for the movie and they do not seem to be in the movie at all,pair of characters and a bunch are the same as the ones who are the ones who are the ones who have to be seen to
1,there are some very funny moments in the film but,there is no real plot and no character development
1,but it 's a great movie,but the movie is a little slow
1,you know that it 's not a bad film,you can see the movie coming out in the same
1,however the film is a little slow at first but the story itself was so good that i,however i do not recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good movie with good actors
1,the film has some of the worst dialogue i 've ever heard in,the movie is a complete waste of time and money and time

1,bolo yeung is a good actor but,bolo is the best of all
1,now i have seen a lot of movies but i do n't know why i did n't like it,now that i have n't read a review of this movie and i have to admit that it is one
1,there are some good moments in this movie,there is no reason for the to go into
1,ayesha takia is the only reason to see this movie and she is,ayesha mukherjee plays the role of a young girl in the movie
1,this movie is not for the faint hearted or otherwise,this is the worst film i 've ever had to endure
1,i was surprised that this movie did n't get released on dvd,i have to say that this is one that is a waste for
1,yes the film was a bit too long,yes it 's a little slow but the story
1,there are a few moments that make you feel like you are watching the film,there is a scene where a woman 's daughter and a woman try to get a
1,however the movie is a bit slow,however i was surprised that this movie was

1,the film is about a young woman who is a woman and a young woman,the movie was a waste for me and my gf and my friends were watching it
1,the movie is a bit of a mess but it is n't,the film has some good points and some of them are good but
1,the film has some good points but it 's,the movie is a bit of an insult
1,in the first film the main character is the father of the family and he 's the one who is the father,in fact the only reason i watched it was because it had been a long time ago and it is n't even that
1,blah for the movie and the acting is n't bad but,blah blah i was a bit surprised by this film
1,the movie was shot on a budget of 1,the film is a bit slow and boring
1,well the movie was a bit too long for me but i think it 's the,well i guess i 'll have a few laughs but i ca all be that
1,but the film 's biggest flaw is the fact it 's,but it is a great film and a great one
1,for the most part the movie is a little slow,for a movie about the evils and tribulations that transpired to
1,there are a few moments of humor and some of the funny moments of a movie are the best of the film,there is a scene where the two protagonists are talking to each others and the camera moves through the camera lens
1,there are some very funny moments but it is n't,there is no real plot and the characters are all very
1,none of these things really do n't make sense and it,none the less it 's a good film to watch
1,extremely funny but it is a little,extremely well done and well acted
1,when the film was released i had a hard time believing that the film was a complete disaster of,when i saw the trailer i thought it would have a good story line and a great cast
1,are we to assume that the film,are they going to make it
1,if you 're looking for something to laugh about in the first place,if i were n't for the movie i would n't be able
1,a lot more of the same,a few years later i was a
1,but the movie is not as bad,but it 's a good movie
1,however i was n't impressed by this film,however the movie was a little too long for
1,aqua and his wife are a married couple,aqua is a great actor and he 's a
1,he is the most talented actor in the film,he 's a very good guy and a good actor

1,this is the first film i have seen in a long long time,this movie is a must for anyone interested in a film that has been
1,spoiler ahead the film is about the same subject matter,spoiler alert i was surprised to see the movie
1,on the other hand the movie was very good and,on a positive side note the acting is superb
1,there are a few moments that make me jump out of my seat,there is a scene where a woman is raped and the girl asks him
1,this is a movie for those interested with,this movie was a waste of time
1,i was n't expecting a movie about a group that was so bad and so,i have seen the movie and i have to say i was n't impressed
1,at least the film was a bit too long for the most extreme fan,at the same time the film has been a staple of the genre and it
1,i was surprised to see this film in a theatre,i have to admit i was n't impressed by the film
1,all in all a great film to watch and i recommend you watch it,all the characters were so stupid and so stupid that it was painful
1,coulda n't even heard of it,coulda been the only reason to see
1,this movie was a complete waste of my time,this is a movie that i can watch again
1,in fact the film was shot on location and the editing is so poor,in the first movie the characters are not developed in the least bit
1,verdict the film was n't bad but the acting is terrible and the script is awful,verdict i do n't know why i did not watch this movie because it 's so stupid
1,so the movie is about a young woman who is married and has a daughter,so i guess it 's not a bad film but it 's not a bad movie
1,some of them are just plain stupid and the movie,some people have said this movie was a waste
1,david lynch 's film is a masterpiece of a film that has,david cronenberg is a master in the genre of this film
1,it is a very funny film,it 's not even a movie it
1,humor is the key to the film,humor and drama are the only ones who
1,it 's a shame that this movie has n't made any money to make a movie,it is not the best movie i have seen in my life but i have seen the
1,had the director and director been able at least a few minutes to the film would 've been a bit shorter and had a little bit of nudity,had it not done a lot for the first half of it i 'd probably have been able to overlook the fact that it was a complete failure to
1,tim curry plays the part with the best of all his usual and funny lines and he 's a good actor,tim robbins is the only one that is good in this movie and he is very good as a man
1,needless up for a movie that is a little bit of a stretch for me,needless to die i was a bit surprised that the film did n't have to do
1,joe pesci is a great actor and i have seen,joe don is the best of all the cast
1,but the movie was n't bad enough to be funny,but it 's not a bad movie it is n't bad
1,all the actors were great and the movie is very,all in the family is a very good movie
1,ok i know that this is a good movie,ok so the film is n't a complete mess
1,i was n't impressed by the fact it 's a movie about the evils that the people,i have seen this film twice and i still remember the first time it was on
1,i was surprised to see that this movie is not available in dvd format,i have to admit i did n't like this movie but i was very impressed
1,almost all of the characters in this film were either,almost every character in the movie was a stereotype
1,the movie is a complete mess of the original film and the,the film has some of its moments but it is not
1,the movie was shot on location and the acting is pretty bad,the film is a bit of a mess but it 's a great
1,in the first movie he is the one that makes the film a classic and it is a great film,in fact the film is a bit slow and the story is n't very interesting and the characters do n't really
1,not to say the movie is a bit of a bore,not only is it not funny it 's just plain stupid
1,the film has some good moments but it is n't enough to make,the movie is a bit slow and the ending was too abrupt
1,considering the fact of the story it 's a great film to watch,considering that this is the first film that has been made in a long
1,you know that it 's a good thing to,you can see the movie in the theater
1,john goodman 's performance is the best of the three and he 's a great comedic performer,john wayne is a good actor but his performance is so poor that he does n't even try
1,the film has some of the most,the movie is a complete waste
1,so i was n't expecting a movie that was so good,so the film has its moments but it is n't
1,almost every scene is a joke,almost all the actors in the film
1,final thoughts are not that bad but the film is not as bad,final verdict i would recommend it to any fan who likes the genre
1,no one has ever heard about it,no matter how much you love it or
1,i have to say that this movie is a complete waste,i was surprised that this movie was n't made in theaters
1,well the film was a bit too slow for me but i think the film was a little too long for me,well i do n't think i can ever watch it again and i do n't think i 've seen anything like this before
1,i have seen this movie twice,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,arguably the most interesting thing in the movie is the ending,arguably a little more than a little bit more than a few
1,by the end i was n't expecting much,by far one of my favorite movies
1,the film has a very interesting plot but it is not,the movie is about the same subject as a book and it
1,but the movie was n't bad enough,but it 's not a bad movie
1,the movie was shot on location in a very tight and grainy way,the film is a bit of an action film but it is n't a
1,so i guess it was n't the case with this,so the movie is a bit of a mess
1,all the characters were likable and believable and,all in all a very good movie
1,is this the best way of saying that it is the,is it a comedy or a comedy or an adventure
1,that is what makes this film great,that 's the only thing that makes it
1,based on a novel of the book by the author of the novel by the same name it is a story about two young,based upon the novel by arthur conan the author of a book by the name of the same name as the title suggests
1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i have seen this film twice
1,if you 're a diehard horror buff you 'll love this movie and will love the film,if i were to rate this movie lower then i should have been generous to the point
1,but the movie was a little too long,but it 's not the worst film ever
1,watch this movie if your a diehard fan,watch it and you 'll see what i mean
1,this movie is not for the faint of stomach but if your looking to see a movie that will appeal to you and you are not a fan you will enjoy this movie,this is the worst film i 've seen in a long time and i do not recommend this movie to anybody who has n't read a good review of it and if it 's
1,this movie is not for the faint hearted,this is the worst film i 've ever seen
1,it is a very funny film,it 's not even a movie it
1,he 's a very good actor and a good actor but he is n't as bad,he is the most talented character of the movie and he 's not a bad actor
1,i was surprised that this movie was made in a hurry,i have to say that this movie was a waste of my

1,i have to admit i did n't enjoy the movie but it was a good movie and i would definitely like it,i was surprised to see that this was a movie that was n't made for the first half of the movie
1,this is a movie that is n't,this movie was a complete disappointment
1,typically the movie is not a complete disaster,typically it 's not a good movie
1,if you 're looking to see the worst film of all times this one is for you,if i were n't so engrossed in the story i would have given it an 8
1,for the first half of the film i was wondering what was going to happen next,for a film that was shot in the late seventies it is very well made
1,its not even that bad it 's not even funny it is n't funny,its a shame that this movie is not only a movie for those of you
1,i was surprised that the film did n't have a chance,i have to say i did n't enjoy this film
1,to me it 's a very bad film and it 's a shame because the film,to be fair the film was a bit too slow and too predictable for me
1,dull boring boring and boring this is a film that is not only for the sake of a good director,dull and boring the movie is n't a good one either but it 's a great film to see
1,i was surprised to find that the movie was a complete waste,i have to admit that the film was very well made
1,my advice is to avoid it,my favorite part is when the guy
1,the movie is about the same thing as the,the film has a very interesting story line
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the movie was shot in a small budget
1,minghella is a genius and the film is a perfect blend,minghella 's film is an excellent example for the genre
1,i have seen the original version and it is a very,i was n't expecting much of this movie to begin
1,i have seen the movie and it 's a great movie to see if it,i was n't expecting a movie to get the message out of the ordinary
1,salman khan plays the part of the young man who has to deal to,salman is a great character and he is very good in the movie
1,the movie was a bit slow but i was n't expecting much,the film is about the same subject as a book of a film
1,the movie was shot in the same location as the first film and it 's not a bad film,the film is a complete mess of the original film and the film is a very good one
1,as for the acting it was a little overdone but the story is so bad that it is n't even funny,as a matter of view i have to say that i was n't expecting a movie about the evils that i saw
1,the movie is about the same thing about the man who is a man and his mother and son,the film has a very interesting story and the acting was excellent and i was surprised that the movie did
1,oh and the ending was so stupid that i was n't expecting anything more than,oh yeah and i do n't know what the hell is going to happen
1,if i had n't been a little bit more closely i could have had a better movie,if you want to see the movie you should watch this movie and you 'll see what the
1,in the end it is not the worst film,in fact it is a very good film
1,technically it 's a great film,technically the movie was a waste
1,i have to say i was very impressed with the movie and the way the story unfolded was a,i was surprised that the movie did not have the potential to make a sequel to the original
1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i have seen this film twice
1,this movie is not a good one,this is the worst movie i have seen

1,the film has a very interesting plot and a great story line and,the movie is about the same subject matter as the first one
1,but the film is not as bad as the original but it is,but it is not a movie that you will never forget about
1,he 's a great actor but his character is a little too old for the part,he is the only person who has to deal with his problems with his life

1,but the film 's main problem with,but it is a good movie
1,for the first half hour or so i was bored to tears,for a film that is a bit of an exercise in the plot
1,not only is the acting terrible but the script is a joke,not to say that the movie was n't a complete waste of my
1,so i was n't expecting much from,so the film has its charms
1,i was n't expecting much from the film,i have seen the original movie and i have

1,so i guess i was wrong,so the movie was a bit of
1,and the movie was a bit of an,and it 's not even that bad
1,it is a shame that the film has been so successful,it 's not a movie for the faint of heart
1,i was surprised to see that this movie was made in the early 80 's and,i have to admit i did n't like the film but it was very entertaining
1,it 's not even a movie it,it is a very funny film
1,ok i have seen a lot of,ok so i was n't impressed
1,in fact the film is a bit slow but it is a good film to see and,in the first movie he is the one who has to deal and solve the mystery
1,an interesting film that is a must for all lovers,an excellent film with great performances from the actors and a
1,they are not even close enough,they 're not the only ones who
1,as a matter of fact i have n't seen it since,as for the acting i would say that this is the worst
1,falling asleep is a movie that is n't even funny,falling in love for the girl she is in love
1,of all the films that i 've seen i 've seen the best,of course there is a lot of the usual stuff in the movie
1,the movie is a bit slow and the ending was just,the film has some good moments but it is n't
1,there are a few good moments but it 's just too bad,there is a scene in the movie where a woman is raped and
1,our heroes are the only ones that are willing and they do n't have a clue about the world,our hero and the girl who are the only ones who are in love with him are the ones that
1,this is a movie that is n't,this movie was a complete disappointment
1,too bad the film was n't even released,too many people have been killed and the movie
1,so i was n't impressed by the movie,so the film has a very interesting story
1,what is this movie trying for a,what a waste for a movie
1,vito is the only one that has a shred to him,vito 's character was so stupid that it was impossible for him
1,bugs is a very good film and i recommend this movie,bugs bunny and the other two are all very good and the
1,the movie is about the power and the,the film has a very good cast
1,it is a very good movie,it 's not even the best movie
1,the movie was shot on a low level,the film is a bit slow but it is
1,pretty much all of them were just a bunch of random people,pretty soon the movie becomes a little too much to bear and too
1,however the film is not as good as it is in the first place,however i do not think that this movie is worth seeing for any reason or
1,perfectly directed and acted and directed by george c scott,perfectly photographed and acted by a great cast of supporting actors
1,the movie is about a young man named kenny who is a young man who is a teenager and a man in a mental hospital,the film has a lot to do with a plot and the characters and their motives are very well done and the story line is great
1,patterson 's character was so annoying that it could n't have saved the movie from the book 's own merits,patterson is the only one who is able to get the girl out and the girl who is the only person
1,whereas the film is a little bit of a bore the film is very entertaining and it 's a great film,whereas i have n't read the book it was a bit of an adaptation of the book and i think it is
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,a few of the scenes are so bad that i could n't even laugh,a lot of people are complaining about the film and it is not the worst
1,though the movie is not a good one at the box office it is not as bad,though it 's a bit dated it is a very enjoyable movie and it 's a shame that
1,there are some good scenes in the film,there is no reason to see the movie
1,you can see the movie coming out of nowhere,you know that it 's not a good movie but
1,i have seen the movie twice and it 's a great film,i was n't expecting a lot from this movie but it was n't
1,what is the point of the film that it 's not,what a great movie this is and it 's a shame that
1,freddie prinze is the best thing in this movie and he is very funny in,freddie highmore is a great actor and i think he is a great actor
1,the movie was a waste of my time,the film is about a group of young people
1,i have seen the original version of the original,i was n't expecting much of a movie to be
1,it 's not a movie that you can see in a theatre,it is a shame that this movie has n't received a cult status
1,a lot more than a little more of the action scenes the film is a bit slow,a few years ago the film was released in the uk and the first one is about the
1,robinson is the best of all the cast and he 's not,robinson 's character is a bit too old for the role
1,one thing i did like was that it had a lot of potential and it 's a very good film to see,one of the most memorable movies i have ever watched and the most memorable thing about this movie was the fact that the
1,the film is a bit slow and the story is too predictable to be believable,the movie was shot on a budget that was filmed in a studio studio
1,imagine a movie about a young man named,imagine the film as the first movie
1,and it 's not a good movie,and the movie was so bad
1,and the ending was so bad,and it is a very funny movie
1,it 's a very good movie and i,it is not a film for everyone
1,as for the rest of it it is a complete mess of,as a matter the movie is a complete waste of time
1,but it is a good film,but the film 's main flaw was
1,it 's not even the best of the series,it is a very good movie and it is not
1,as for me it 's a very good film and,as a result the movie has no real plot
1,we are not told that we are not in for the truth that,we have to see it to get the full impact of it
1,this movie is a must see for anyone who likes a movie,this is the first film that i 've ever walked across
1,if i had to watch it again it would have been a lot better if i had n't been in,if you want a good movie about a young man 's journey to stardom then you will be disappointed
1,the movie is about a young man who is a teenager and a woman,the film has a lot to do but the film does not work
1,this is the first film that i have seen that,this movie is a must see for all fans
1,everything about it was so bad it was funny,everything is so bad that i could not even get
1,and it 's not even the worst movie ever made it,and the movie was a complete mess of the original
1,the film has a lot of potential to make it a little bit too slow and the story,the movie is about a group of people who have been living together in a remote town
1,you can see that this is a movie about the hardships,you know that the movie was a bit too long
1,of all the movies i have seen i 've seen this one,of course there are a few things that are wrong but this movie
1,in the first film the main characters were the ones that had been in a coma and the two were,in fact the only reason i gave this film a 2 is that it was a bit too much
1,but the movie is a little too long,but it 's a great movie and it is
1,being the first of the three bourne movies to have the best of them,being a big fan i have to say that i was n't disappointed
1,but the film is not a complete waste of film and it 's a little too much for a movie that is n't worth watching,but it is not a good film and the acting is n't as good as it should have been but the script was n't as bad
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,one of my favorite films of the last ten or so years,one thing that really annoyed the movie was the fact it 's not
1,then there 's a scene where the hero is walking around in the car with,then the film switches to the final battle of the last remaining aztec war
1,maybe the movie is n't a good idea,maybe it 's just me but it 's not
1,perhaps it 's a good idea for the film but it,perhaps the director was n't trying to make a movie
1,the film is about a young man who is sent into prostitution and is forced by his father,the movie was a waste for the movie and it was n't even nominated to be a cult classic
1,initially the film is not a comedy,initially i do not know why i was
1,that 's the only reason i can watch it for the fact it was a complete disaster and it 's,that is what makes it a great movie and it 's a shame because the story is so good
1,the film is about a group of people who have been living in the same apartment and are forced to live in a new home in new york,the movie was a waste of my life and i would have to say that it is a very bad film and it is not even worth watching for
1,laughing at the antics and jokes of the movie and the fact it was n't a comedy,laughing and crying and laugh at how bad this movie was and how bad the movie is it
1,board of the movie is a very,board is the worst film ever
1,this movie was a complete waste of my life,this is a movie that i can watch over all
1,but it is a good movie,but the film 's main problem with
1,when i first saw this film i was a bit sceptical of the movie,when the movie was over i had a good time watching it and it 's
1,i have seen the original version of the original and it is,i was n't expecting much of a movie to watch it
1,ok i have seen a lot worse movies and i have seen this movie,ok so i was n't impressed with this movie but i did not expect it
1,the film has some of the worst dialogue ever,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,sage and a bit more than a few of the other actors in the movie are not,sage is a very good movie and i hope it gets a dvd of the movie
1,this movie is not a bad film but,this is the worst movie ever made
1,mariel hemingway plays the role as the woman who 's,mariel woodard is the perfect choice for her performance
1,the film has a very good cast,the movie is about the power and the
1,most people have commented on this film and it 's a shame that it,most of them were very funny and the movie was a great movie
1,the film has a lot to offer but it 's a good movie,the movie is about a young woman who has been kidnapped and murdered
1,after a few minutes i realized that the movie was a complete waste of my time and i would have been better off renting it,after the first half of the film the viewer gets a sense that this is the best of all the blackadder series and it is the
1,it is a shame because it is,it 's not a bad movie
1,he is a very talented actor,he 's not the best character in
1,i have seen this film twice,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,i have seen the original movie,i was n't expecting much from this
1,could n't have done a good job of the film,could have been a lot better if the film had a
1,the movie is about a group that has been kidnapped and tortured by the death of their father and the other,the film has a lot of action and the plot is a little thin but it 's a good movie
1,inspired in a very tight manner,inspired by the fact that it is
1,that is what makes it so good and it 's a shame because,that 's the only reason why this movie was made for me
1,worth seeing for a few moments of the movie and a great,worth watching if you 're a diehard collector of the genre
1,this is the worst film ever made and i 've seen it twice,this movie is not for everyone but if your looking to see a movie
1,i have seen the movie and it is one of my favorite movies,i was n't expecting a movie to be so boring but i did not
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,two men who have a different outlook of the life and the other is a very different person who has a different outlook on life,two of the most memorable scenes are the ones where the two lovers are talking to each others and the camera pans out and they 're
1,this is the first film i have ever walked across,this movie is a must for anyone who likes a movie
1,the film is about a group that is,the movie was a waste of time
1,sennett 's direction was a little too slow and the film is too slow and too dull,sennett is the only person who can be blamed on the fact that the film has a very
1,these two characters have a different feel to them,these are the two adjectives that i 've seen on
1,that is what i thought was a great idea for,that 's the way i feel about this movie
1,lombard is a very talented woman and is very convincing as the heroine who,lombard 's performance as the mother of the mother is very well done
1,as a matter the movie was a waste,as for the rest of the movie it 's
1,ms de havilland is the only reason i can watch this film,ms and the other tenants have a secret affair with a married man
1,i have to say i was n't impressed with the movie,i was surprised that the movie was made in a time where
1,hey it 's not a good film but the fact is it 's,hey i do n't think that the movie is a good movie
1,so i guess i 'll be watching the film,so the movie was made in a hurry to make
1,a lot more of a movie than a lot,a few years later the movie was made and the
1,and the movie is a complete waste,and it 's a good thing that the
1,i was surprised that the film did n't have a lot to offer the audience,i have to say i did n't enjoy this film but i did n't think it
1,yet it 's a very funny film,yet the movie is a bit too slow
1,it 's not a bad movie,it is a shame because it is
1,he is the most annoying character i 've seen,he 's a very talented director and i think he
1,an excellent film with a very strong cast,an interesting film that i would recommend for everyone
1,now that 's a bit too much,now i know i 've seen the first
1,and it is a very funny movie,and the ending was so bad
1,i was n't expecting much from this,i have seen the original movie
1,so i was n't impressed with the film and i did n't like the movie,so the film has a lot to do with the fact it is a movie that
1,and it is not a good film,and the ending is so bad that i
1,even the most ardent of characters in this film is a caricature,even though it 's a bit dated it 's still pretty funny
1,and the movie is a bit of,and it 's a good movie
1,for the first half hour or two i was bored to tears and the movie is so,for a film that is a little bit too long it 's a very enjoyable film
1,the film is a bit slow and boring but the story itself is,the movie was shot on a budget of about a million dollars
1,i was n't impressed with this movie,i have seen this movie several years and
1,but the movie was n't bad,but it 's not a bad film
1,it 's a shame that this movie is n't available in,it is not the best movie i 've ever watched
1,bitch and the beast is a movie that i would recommend watching it to see how it is going to be,bitch is the worst film ever made and i 've ever seen the original kristy swanson and ginger rogers and the other
1,it 's a very funny film,it is not a movie that you
1,i was n't expecting much of this film,i have seen the original version and i can
1,other than the aforementioned fact that the movie is a little too much to say about the plot it is,other reviewers have commented that the movie is not as bad but it 's not a good one either
1,anyone who has ever seen the movie will agree with the,anyone with an iq for this film will be disappointed
1,so the movie is about a young man who has,so i guess it 's not a good film
1,you can see the movie coming from the beginning,you know that it 's not going for the best
1,also the film is very good,also i do not think that this
1,i have to admit that i have seen this movie twice,i was surprised to find out the film is n't a comedy
1,this movie is not for everyone but if you 're a fan 's the first,this is the worst film ever made and it is not a good film
1,the film has a very interesting plot but the story itself is n't too good and it is n't,the movie is about the same subject as the first one and the first one was pretty good but the
1,just like a movie about a man trying to get his own way of getting a good idea of the future he 's trying too much,just as the movie was shot on a low level the acting was pretty good and the story line was very good and i liked the way
1,the movie was shot in a small budget and it 's not,the film is a complete waste of time and a waste
1,but it is a great movie,but the film 's biggest problem with
1,i have seen the movie twice and i can only,i was n't expecting a lot from the movie
1,out there i was a little confused at how much the film is,out of the blue the movie is a bit of a bore
1,s the best of the bunch,s character is so annoying and the
1,it 's a shame that this film is n't even available on dvd or vhs,it is not the best movie ever made but it 's not as bad
1,the film has a lot to offer but the film does n't have much of a plot and the characters do,the movie is about a young woman who is a woman who has been abused and murdered by a woman
1,also i think that the director was trying to be a bit more than just another movie,also the movie was shot in a small budget and it was n't a very good film but
1,i was n't impressed by this film but it 's a great film,i have seen this film several times and i still love it
1,i was n't expecting a movie to get the message across,i have seen the movie and it 's a great film to
1,and the ending was a little too predictable,and it is a shame that this movie has
1,do not watch this film if you 're looking for something like that,do n't waste time on this movie unless you are a fan of hers
1,those are the things i hate most about the movie,those who are n't in this movie are the same as
1,again i do not know what the point,again the film is a complete mess
1,it 's a very good movie,it is not a film for the
1,marty is the only one that is able to get a job,marty 's character was so annoying and the plot is unbelievable
1,george clooney plays a young woman who is married to a young woman,george c scott is the only actor in the film that is n't as
1,one thing i did like about the film was that it had a very,one of the most memorable films of the last decade of the year
1,after a while i was hooked,after the movie was released i had
1,i have to admit that the movie is very entertaining,i was surprised to find that this was a very good
1,and it 's not even that funny,and the movie was a bit too much
1,i have to admit that the movie is very entertaining and the acting is superb and i think the actors were very,i was surprised to find that this was a very low budget movie but it was n't a bad movie either
1,you can see that this movie was shot on the same day as the first film and the first half of it,you know that the movie is a spoof of the first film and the second half of it is pretty bad
1,the film is a complete mess of the first film and the third one,the movie was shot in the same location and it was filmed in a very
1,ricky is a great character and he is very,ricky 's father is a very funny character
1,see this film and you 'll be glad,see it if you have a choice
1,unfortunately it 's a little too late,unfortunately the movie is n't a good one
1,the film has a very good story line,the movie is about the power of the human
1,this movie is a must see,this is the first film that has
1,a few of them are not as good as the first two,a lot of the scenes are filmed with a lot of closeups of
1,we are not supposed to be scared by this,we have to be careful of this movie
1,i was n't impressed by the fact that the film was made in a very limited budget and,i have seen this film twice and it is one that is so bad it 's good
1,the film is about a young man who has,the movie was a waste for the movie
1,if i were to give it an extra point i would have given this a,if you 're a fan of the genre you will find it very entertaining
1,gay men have been in the protestant church and the people in the town are not afraid to accept their feelings,gay people are not the only ones who have a problem with this film and they are all very shallow
1,when i first saw this film on tv it was a very good movie and i was surprised that i,when the movie was over i was n't expecting anything else to happen but i did not like it
1,i have seen the original movie,i was n't expecting much from this
1,as for the acting i think the movie was very good,as a matter of fact the movie was a bit of an
1,well i guess i was wrong,well the movie was n't bad but
1,burt reynolds plays a young man who has a crush on the young man who,burt lancaster is the only actor in the film who has a good role
1,your only real complaint with the film is that it is not even a movie and it is n't even worth the time,your average movie goer is a movie about the holocaust of a man 's journey to a world where the man is not the
1,you can see that this movie is a spoof,you know that the movie is going nowhere but it
1,anyways i was a bit skeptical about this,anyways the movie is a complete waste
1,the film has some of the worst acting i have seen,the movie is a complete waste of my life and i do
1,the movie is a bit of an insult,the film has some good points but it 's
1,it is a shame because it 's a very good film and i would definitely like to know,it 's not a bad movie but the fact is that it is a very good film
1,the film has some of the worst dialogue ever,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,sadly the movie is a little slow and boring,sadly it 's a little too long for me to
1,another problem is that the film is a bit slow,another thing i noticed is the way the movie was shot
1,there are some good scenes and some very good,there is no reason to watch this movie
1,instead it 's just another mindless teen slasher flick,instead of a movie that is so boring that you
1,woman and the girl is the best movie i 've seen,woman is the best of the three films and it 's a
1,the film has a very interesting plot and a good story,the movie is about the same subject matter as a movie about

1,they are all in the movie,they 're all very funny and the
1,she is a very talented actress and i have seen a few movies that have made,she 's not the best actor ever but it 's a good movie to watch
1,matched with a great deal to the movie it 's not even that bad it 's not a good movie either,matched by the fact that the movie is a little bit of a letdown it is a very good movie
1,there are some very funny moments in this movie,there is no real plot and no real story and
1,this movie was so bad that i was laughing at it,this is a very bad movie and it is not even a
1,now that i 've seen the film and i know that i am not a big movie fan i have to admit that this movie was not a good one either,now i have to admit that i have seen this film and it is one of the most underrated movies ever made and i have seen it several many times
1,his character is so stupid and stupid that i could n't help thinking that the movie,his performance in the movie is a little too wooden and too much for him
1,shepard 's performance as a man is very good,shepard is a great actor but he is n't as
1,finally i was able into the film,finally the film 's plot and the acting
1,the movie is a bit of a bore but the acting is good and it 's not,the film has some good points and is very well acted and the acting is excellent
1,first off the acting is horrible and the story is,first of the film 's title is the same
1,but the movie is not a complete,but it 's a good thing
1,this movie is a must for anyone interested in a film,this is the first film i have seen in a long time
1,in fact the only thing i liked about the movie is,in the first film he was a little more interesting
1,i was surprised that this film was made,i have to say that i have n't read
1,it 's not even a movie,it is a very funny film and
1,society is not a bad movie,society has a very small part
1,this is a very good film and it 's a great movie,this movie was so awful that i could not believe it
1,the film is a bit slow and the ending was too predictable and predictable to be a satisfying movie,the movie was shot on a budget that would have made the movie a little better but it 's just
1,anyway the film has a lot of good things going for them but the film,anyway i was n't impressed with this movie but i did n't expect much
1,he 's not the best character in,he is a very talented actor
1,one of the most memorable movies i have seen,one thing i did like was that it was a
1,not only is it not funny but the acting is pretty,not to say the movie is n't a total mess
1,the film is about a young woman named,the movie was a waste for me
1,i was n't impressed by this movie but i,i have seen this film several years ago
1,i have seen the original movie,i was n't expecting much from this
1,i was surprised to find out the movie was made in a hurry,i have to admit that i have n't read a lot of other comments
1,the film has some of its moments but it is not,the movie is a complete mess of the original film and the
1,the movie is about a group that has been sent into the world to get a,the film has a lot of action and the story is a little too thin
1,oh yeah and the ending is so stupid that i ca n't believe,oh and the music was a bit too cheesy to be funny
1,the film is a complete mess of a movie,the movie was shot in the same way as a
1,but it is a good movie and a good movie,but the film 's main problem is the script
1,suicide is the best thing about this movie and it is the most entertaining movie ever made,suicide and the city is one that will appeal for fans of the genre and the series of
1,the movie was a waste for the whole movie and i would recommend it,the film is about a young man named krishna who is a young woman who
1,have the producers of this film have a good time making it to their own,have you ever heard that you have seen the same thing over and over again and
1,this is the worst film ever made and i 've seen it twice and it is a very poor attempt at making a film,this movie is not for everyone but if your looking to see a good movie about a bunch of friends and a bunch of people
1,for the first half of this movie the viewer gets to know the characters,for a film that was a bit of an action film it 's a bit
1,there are a few moments that are n't funny,there is a scene where a man who has a
1,haunted by a few of the most memorable scenes of all the,haunted house is one that is n't even a good one
1,why did n't he try to make the movie,why is this movie so awful that i have n't
1,the film has some good moments but it 's just too much to ask,the movie is a bit slow and the story is n't that interesting
1,an excellent cast and an engaging story that will make,an interesting premise for a movie is the acting
1,but the film is not a good movie it 's just a waste of your,but it is not a good movie and it 's not a bad film
1,he 's not the best actor in,he is a very talented director
1,it is a very good film,it 's not even the worst of
1,it 's a very good film and a great movie,it is not a film that is n't a complete waste
1,the movie is a bit slow but it 's a great film to see,the film has some good moments and the story line is very good
1,generally the film has some good moments but it is n't enough to,generally i do n't think that the film is a good example
1,but the movie is a little slow,but it 's a great movie
1,in the end the movie is not as bad but,in fact it 's not even a good movie
1,tv is a very bad movie,tv shows like this are the only
1,it is a very good film and i recommend,it 's not even the worst movie ever
1,i was surprised that the movie was made,i have to say i was n't impressed by
1,for the most of us who have n't read a lot about this movie i,for a movie that is n't a good one it 's a good movie
1,his performance in the movie was so good,his character is so stupid that i could n't
1,the film is about the same subject as a book of a film,the movie was a bit slow but i was n't expecting much
1,this movie is a must see,this is the first film that has
1,acting was bad and i was n't sure if it would be good or bad but i did n't expect it,acting is ok but the story is so bad that it makes you laugh and cry at the screen and you 'll
1,is this a good thing to do with,is it the best of the bunch
1,as for me i have to say that this is a very bad movie,as a result of this movie it 's a shame because the movie was n't
1,you know what i mean but it is a great movie and i hope it gets a wider release from,you can tell the director was trying to make a good movie but it was n't that bad either
1,this is the first film i 've seen in my life that is not,this movie is a must for all lovers of the classic horror genre
1,the movie is a bit of a mess,the film has some good points and some good
1,one of the most interesting things about the film was that the characters are so real and so realistic,one thing i did n't know is that it was a movie about a man who is a loner
1,like the first film the characters were so stupid that,like i said it was n't a good film
1,the movie is about a group that is attacked by,the film has a lot of action in it
1,running the gamut of emotions that are being made to be a part of a series that has,running away the movie is a complete mess of a film that is n't even remotely entertaining
1,even the most ardent of characters in this movie is a bit of an annoying jerk who 's not a bad actor but he is n't bad either as,even though it 's a bit dated it is still very good and it 's not a bad film it 's just a waste of time and time
1,this movie is a must for all fans of the genre,this is the first film i 've ever walked across and it
1,donna is the only one who is able in her life,donna 's character was so unlikable that it was hard for her
1,sean connery is a fine actor and he is very good in his part as a man,sean penn plays a young woman who has to be the best character in the world and she
1,but it is not the best movie ever,but the film is a bit slow
1,i was surprised to find out that this was a movie that i,i have to admit that i was n't disappointed by the film
1,marcus 's character was a little too unlikable and i was not impressed,marcus is the only person who is a real person and is the only
1,as a result of this film 's popularity i was able into,as for me i have seen a lot of bad movies
1,in fact it is a great movie to see,in the end it is a great movie
1,i was n't expecting a lot of,i have seen the movie twice
1,in fact it 's not a bad film,in the end the movie has no redeeming features
1,even the most diehard of them is the same,even though it is a little bit of an attempt
1,we are supposed to be rooting for him and,we have a lot of fun to watch
1,his performance is so good and the story is a bit of an,his character was a bit too unlikable and i was n't impressed
1,even the actors who were n't in this movie were very good at the end,even though the film is not as bad it is a good movie to watch for
1,it is a very good movie and i recommend,it 's not even the best of all
1,and it 's not a bad movie,and the movie was so boring
1,anyways the movie is a complete mess,anyways i was a bit skeptical when the
1,uncle john is the perfect choice to be the hero,uncle sam 's character is a bit too much
1,i was surprised to find that the film was a complete failure,i have to admit that the film is very well done
1,more importantly the movie is not as good as it,more than anything else it 's a good film
1,credit must go to the writers for creating the film with,credit is to go for the good acting and directing
1,an excellent cast and an excellent soundtrack,an interesting premise for a film
1,like i said it was n't the best film i have ever seen but i was n't expecting much from this movie,like the first film the characters are so stupid and the plot just seems like a bad idea to make a good film
1,the movie was shot on a low budget,the film is a bit slow but the story
1,i have to say i did not enjoy the film,i was surprised that the film was made in the early
1,i'm not sure what to expect from this film but it is not,i'm a big big admirer of horror films and i have seen a lot
1,this movie was a waste for me,this is a movie for everyone
1,i have seen this film twice and it 's still a good movie to,i was n't impressed by the fact that it is n't a comedy
1,cinema is not the only one that has a good story and a good story line,cinema has a lot of potential to be made but it 's a good film
1,shia palminteri plays a very good guy who has a lot of fun to be a good guy,shia labeouf is a great director and i hope that he can make a good film like that one
1,the film has a lot to do with the plot and it is very well done,the movie is about a young man named benjamin and the girl who are married and are
1,the film has some good moments but it is n't,the movie is a bit slow and the ending was just
1,hsiaohsien 's direction was a little overdone and the story is n't that good but it is a good film to,hsiaohsien is the only person who has ever seen a movie that has a good cast and is very good
1,santoshi 's direction is a bit slow but it is,santoshi is the master and director of this film
1,a few years ago i was able to see this movie and was amazed by how much i enjoyed it and i was impressed by it,a lot more than the usual suspects that have been done in the film industry and other films of this ilk have been done in a very
1,this movie is a must see for anyone who loves a good film,this is the first film that i 've ever seen that has a good
1,if you want to see the movie i suggest you watch it,if i had n't been a little more careful to have seen it
1,this movie was so bad it was funny,this is a very bad film and i would
1,you can see the director 's intentions for this,you know that it is n't a movie
1,i have seen this movie twice and it,i was n't impressed with the film
1,injun ventura is the best thing in this film and he is the only actor that has ever played,injun of a poet who is a little more than he bargained for is a very good film
1,8 the acting is horrible and the plot line is so stupid and so predictable that it 's,8 out 10 out 10 stars for a few minutes of the movie and a few scenes
1,to be honest i did n't think that the movie was a good movie,to me this was a great movie and it 's not just the story that
1,i was surprised that this film did n't get released on dvd,i have to say that i was very disappointed with this film and
1,it 's a shame that this film is n't available in dvd,it is not the best movie ever made but the acting and writing
1,the film has a very good story line,the movie is about the power of the human
1,his performance is a bit stiff but the movie is a bit too long for me,his character was so annoying and the acting was horrible and i could not help thinking of
1,shortly thereafter he 's not a bad actor but he is n't bad,shortly after the movie 's opening scene we see a couple of scenes of
1,however the movie was n't so much of an improvement as,however i was n't expecting a lot of the film
1,of course the film is a bit too long,of all of these movies this is the one that
1,at least the movie was n't so good it 's not even worth the wait for the rental rental,at the same moment i thought the movie was a little slow but i was n't expecting much
1,ok so i do n't think that this is a good movie,ok i have to admit that the movie is very bad but i
1,in the end the film is a very good film,in fact it 's a shame because it is a little
1,i have seen this film several years and,i was n't impressed by this movie
1,the movie was shot in a very,the film is a complete waste
1,in fact the film was a bit of an accident but,in the first movie the main characters are the same
1,this is the worst film i 've ever had the misfortune to see,this movie is not for the faint hearted or for the masses
1,the movie was a waste of my time,the film is about a group of young people
1,i'm a fan and have never seen such a bad film in a long while,i'm not a big fan of movies but i do n't think that the movie was
1,well the film was n't so much a little,well i do n't know what to do
1,but it is not the worst movie i,but the film is a little slow
1,for the first half of this film i thought it would have been better to make it a little bit better,for a film that was a little bit of an exercise in a film it was a very enjoyable film
1,if you 're a fan of the genre and have seen the original you,if i were to give it an extra star i 'd be able
1,the film has a very good cast,the movie is about the power and the
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,it 's a shame because it 's not the best of all time,it is not the worst movie ever made but it 's not bad either
1,his performance is so bad that it,his character was a little annoying
1,this is the worst movie ever,this movie is not a bad movie
1,it 's a very good film and it 's not just,it is not a film that is not for everyone
1,even the most diehard of them are the ones who have to be the most ardent and mean to the end of,even though it is a little dated and a little dated at first i thought it would be an interesting movie
1,copy of the movie the movie is a complete mess of a movie,copy the dvd release of the film and you 'll see the difference
1,anyway i have seen this movie and it is a very enjoyable film,anyway the movie is n't a complete waste of film and time
1,her performance is so good that it 's almost,her character was a bit of an idiot
1,moments of dialogue and dialog were not funny and the acting is n't as good as it should be but it 's a bit,moments are not as bad as the ones in this film but it 's not that bad either it 's just not funny
1,in the first movie the characters are all very believable,in fact the film was shot on a budget of about
1,the movie was a bit slow and boring,the film is about the same thing about a
1,holly is the best character in this film,holly 's character is a little too unlikable and
1,all in all a great movie to watch and i would definitely recommend it,all the characters were so bad they could n't even make it through their own
1,i have to admit that the movie is very entertaining and i think that it was the,i was surprised to find that this was a very low production and not a movie
1,but it is not the worst film ever made,but the film is a little too long for the
1,but the film is a little too long for the,but it is not the worst film ever made
1,nancy 's character was so annoying and the story was just plain stupid and the ending is so predictable,nancy michelle geller is a good actress but she does n't have a lot of screen time and is n't
1,he is a very talented actor and a good actor,he 's not the best character he 's ever seen but
1,we are not supposed to feel like we are in the,we have to be careful to be the same person
1,it is not the worst movie ever but i have to admit,it 's a shame because it 's a very good film
1,ballad of a serial killer was a good idea,ballad is a very funny movie that i can recommend
1,director michael winner has done a good,director john woo is a genius
1,but it is not a movie that you will never forget about,but the film is not as bad as the original but it is
1,i was n't expecting much of this movie,i have seen the original version and it 's
1,the movie was a bit slow but it was n't too bad,the film is about the same subject matter and the same themes that
1,basically the movie was shot in the same way that it did n't have,basically it is a movie about a young woman who is a teenager
1,the film has some good points but the rest is just plain bad and it,the movie is a bit of an action movie but the acting is good
1,also i think the director should have been,also the movie is not as bad
1,overall this movie is not a good movie but it 's not bad either,overall the movie was a bit too slow and the ending is too abrupt and
1,i have seen the movie and i can safely say it is a great movie to see if it is a comedy or a,i was n't expecting a movie about the holocaust or the history but it is a very good movie and i recommend it
1,it 's not even a good film,it is a very funny movie
1,perhaps the most interesting thing is the fact that the movie is a bit too slow,perhaps it was a good idea to show a little more than the average person who was
1,apparently the movie is a bit too long,apparently this is the first time that the director
1,but it is not the best of it,but the film is a bit too long
1,and the movie is a complete mess,and it 's a good thing
1,so i guess i 'll just have a few laughs and laugh at the stupidity of the film,so the movie was made for the sake that the movie was made for tv and the director was
1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,and the movie was so boring that it,and it 's not a bad thing
1,which i thought it was a very good film and it 's a shame that it was released theatrically in theaters,which is a shame since this movie was made in the early 90 years of the 80 's and early 90 years
1,from a very young man who has been in a mental illness for a long time and has a child who is in the same predicament as his wife,from the opening sequence to a final shot of the movie the viewer feels like we are going to see the end of the film and it 's not even
1,those who are not familiar to the original series will,those are the only things that made me laugh
1,this is the worst movie ever,this movie is not a bad movie
1,there is no reason to watch it and if you 're looking to be scared by,there are some good scenes and the movie is very funny but it 's not
1,the film is about a young woman named,the movie was a waste for me
1,the film has a lot of potential and it is not only the best movie ever,the movie is about a group of young men who are married to each other
1,i was n't expecting much from this,i have seen the original movie
1,then the film is set up for the final showdown and the end is pretty good,then there 's the fact that the movie is not a complete waste of time
1,revert in the end of the movie the,revert to a film of a movie
1,there are some very good moments in this film,there is no real reason to watch this movie unless
1,the film is about a group that has been sent into a prison to assassinate,the movie was a waste of time and i would n't recommend this movie
1,cat is the only thing that makes it worth seeing,cat 's experiment is a film about a man who has
1,i was n't impressed with the film and the acting was so bad it was,i have seen this movie twice and i have never been a big fan
1,the film is a bit slow and boring but the story is so,the movie was shot on a budget of about a million times
1,the film has a very interesting plot and the characters are all likable and likable,the movie is about the same subject matter and the story of the same name as
1,but the film is not as bad as the first,but it is not a movie that you will enjoy
1,and it 's not a good film either,and the movie was so bad that it made
1,perhaps the director was n't trying too much to be objective,perhaps it 's a good idea to make an interesting film but
1,i was surprised to see that this movie was made in the first place,i have to admit i did n't like the film but it is very good
1,i have to admit that the film was a bit slow at times but it was n't,i was surprised to find that the movie is not a comedy but a comedy that is not
1,therefore it is not the worst movie i 've seen,therefore the film is a bit slow at first but it
1,hence that 's the only thing i have ever seen in my life that i have ever seen,hence the film 's ending was a bit abrupt and i did not care about any character
1,i was n't impressed with this film but it is not a bad movie,i have seen this movie several times and i still love the film and it
1,my favorite scene was when he is talking about the phone and then the scene where the,my advice to the filmmakers of this film are to see the film and the movie
1,the movie was shot on location in the middle east,the film is a bit of an exercise in the genre
1,it is not a film that will,it 's a very good film
1,i have seen the original movie and it 's,i was n't expecting much from the movie
1,i was n't expecting much of this film to begin with but it was n't,i have seen the original version and i have to admit that i was n't impressed
1,i was surprised to see that this movie is not a,i have to admit i did n't like this movie
1,so the film is a little slow and boring but the story itself,so i was expecting something like the original but i was wrong
1,and the ending is a little too long for the,and it is not the best movie ever made
1,there is a lot to be said but i think that 's the only way to make it worthwhile,there are a lot of things to criticize here but the movie does n't have the same plot
1,the film has a lot to offer and the film has some nice twists but it is n't,the movie is about a young woman named seita who is a teenager and a young woman
1,and it is not the worst movie i have,and the ending is a bit too abrupt
1,as a result of this movie it is a little bit too much for me to enjoy,as for me i have to say i did n't think that this was the worst movie ever
1,to be honest i was surprised to find that this movie was made in the first ten min of it and i was n't sure,to me this was the worst film i 've ever had to endure and it was n't even worth the time to view this
1,the movie is a bit slow but it 's a good movie,the film has some good moments and the story line was very interesting
1,other than that the movie is pretty bad and it is,other reviewers here have said this is a great movie
1,which i thought it was a very enjoyable film,which is a shame since this movie is a remake
1,there are a lot of good things to be said but the movie is just plain bad and the ending was just,there is a lot to like in the movie but the movie does not have the feel of the first one
1,i was n't impressed by the fact that it is a film that,i have seen this film twice and it 's still very good
1,the film has a very interesting story and a good story,the movie is about the same thing about a woman who has
1,they 're not the only ones who,they are not even close enough
1,i was n't impressed by this film,i have seen this film several times
1,maybe it was the director who was trying too hard to make it a success,maybe the director should have been a bigger star but this movie is n't
1,i have to admit i was n't impressed with this film,i was surprised to see this film in the theater
1,and it is a very good movie,and the ending was so stupid
1,pino donaggio is a genius and he is a great actor and a great director,pino oberoi is the only one in this film who has a very small role
1,it is not the best movie ever made,it 's a shame that this film is not
1,decadence is a very important topic in this movie,decadence and love is a very good film
1,the movie is about a young man who is sent to prison to assassinate,the film has a lot to do but the story does not work
1,the movie is a bit slow and boring but it is a good film,the film has some good moments but the rest is just plain awful
1,the movie was a waste of time and money and time and money,the film is about a group that has a lot to live together
1,i have to admit i did n't like the film but it was a good movie,i was surprised to see that this movie was made in the early 1980s and the fact
1,i have seen this film twice,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,apparently the film was shot in the same,apparently this movie is a complete waste
1,for a movie that is a bit too much for the genre,for the most of us this is a very bad film and it
1,it is not a film that will,it 's a very good film
1,if i had n't seen the movie it would have made a good,if you want to watch something like this i recommend this film
1,he is the most talented actor in this film and it 's a pity that he did n't have a,he 's a very good guy and he 's a good guy but he is n't really the best
1,she is the one to blame for,she 's a very good actor
1,if you 're looking for a good horror movie this is the movie to watch and you will see what the hell is this,if i were n't for a few laughs and i 'd like to see this movie again it would be a good one
1,the movie was shot on a budget of 1,the film is a bit slow and boring
1,the movie is a bit of a mess but it is n't,the film has some good points and some of them are good but
1,maureen knightley is the best actress of all times and the film is a perfect blend,maureen o'hara plays a woman whose husband is a woman and is determined for her
1,i'm not sure why this movie was made,i'm a big fan of horror movies but i
1,i was n't impressed with the film,i have seen this movie twice and it
1,gray and his friends have a lot to say,gray is a great movie and i recommend it to
1,a few of the actors are very well chosen and i think that they,a lot of people have said that this is a very good film
1,when i saw the trailer for the movie and i was shocked at how bad it was,when the film was released the film screened on a doublebill with a similar story of a young

1,typically it is a film about a man who is a man who is a loner and is,typically the film has a lot to do but the film is not a good one either

1,i have seen this movie twice,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,one thing that i found most irritating was the lack of any shred of character development and character development that the film is not even worth watching,one of my favorites is the scene where a man who is supposed and says a word of advice is a little too hard to handle

1,these two characters have their own distinct personalities,these are the two things i do not like
1,this is the worst movie ever made,this movie is not a bad film but
1,the film has some of its most,the movie is a complete mess
1,to me this was a very good movie,to be honest i did not see this film
1,right now i have to admit that i have n't seen the original,right away i had a good idea about this film and it 's not
1,as a result of the fact that it was a movie about a man,as for me i was n't sure what to expect from the film
1,but the movie is a little slow,but it 's a great movie
1,the movie was shot on a low level of 35mm camera,the film is a bit slow but it 's a great film
1,this movie was so bad that i was n't laughing at the tv or even the other characters,this is a very bad movie and it 's not worth renting for anyone who has ever seen the
1,the film is a bit of an exercise into the culture of war,the movie was shot on location in the early 1800 's and early 80
1,to me this is a great film,to be honest the film is a little
1,in the first film he was the only one to be killed by the villain,in fact the only thing i can say is that it is not the worst film
1,george clooney is a great director and a great,george c bush has done a great work
1,the movie was shot in a small budget,the film is a complete waste of time
1,of course the movie is n't a complete mess but it 's a good movie to watch,of all of the films that i have seen this one has the feeling of a true love
1,the film has a lot of action in it,the movie is about a group that is attacked by
1,with a supposed budget the only saving grace was that it was n't even,with the help from the police the film is a very interesting one
1,nothing is explained and it 's not even a movie that 's a good one,nothing really happens in this film and the whole thing is just a mess
1,this movie is a must see,this is the first film that has
1,this is a movie that is n't,this movie was a complete disappointment
1,it 's not even the best movie,it is a very good movie
1,anyway i have to say that this movie was a waste,anyway the movie was n't so bad it was funny but it
1,the film is a bit of an exercise in the genre,the movie was shot on location in the middle east
1,and it 's a shame because it 's not even worth mentioning that it 's a movie that,and the movie is so bad that i ca n't even remember the last scene i laughed
1,it 's not even the worst of,it is a very good film
1,sure it 's a little bit too slow but it 's a great movie,sure the film was a little too long for the first two thirds but the
1,the film is about a group that is,the movie was a waste of time
1,the film is a bit slow and the ending was a little abrupt,the movie was shot on a budget that would have been better spent in
1,the film has some of the worst acting i 've,the movie is a complete waste of my life
1,to be fair i was n't expecting much from it but i did n't like,to me it was a great film and it was a very good film
1,overall the movie is very good and the,overall this movie was a complete waste
1,as a matter the movie is not as bad,as for the rest of it i would have given
1,i have seen the movie twice and i have never seen it,i was n't expecting a lot from the film but it was n't
1,i have seen the movie twice,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,and it 's a good movie,and the movie is a bit of
1,but the film is a bit slow and boring,but it is not the best movie i have seen
1,the film has a lot to do but the story is n't that good,the movie is about a young man who is sent into a world of crimes
1,they 're not even close enough to be funny and they are just stupid and stupid and not worth watching,they are not the same as they are in the book but the fact that the movie was made for a
1,an excellent cast of characters that are not afraid of being a good,an interesting premise and an interesting premise but it 's not enough
1,think about the film and the plot,think of it as a movie
1,the movie is about a group of people who are trying to get their hands on a bunch,the film has a lot of potential to make a movie that has a lot to do
1,wanting the money back to the future,wanting to see a good film about a
1,i have seen this movie several years and,i was n't impressed with this movie
1,first of the film is about the,first off the acting was horrible
1,it 's a shame that this film is n't available on video,it is not the best movie ever made but the fact that the
1,of all of the movies i 've seen this is the one,of course the movie has some of its most memorable parts
1,when i first saw the trailer i was very excited,when the movie was released i thought it was going to
1,yes it 's a little slow but the movie does have some good moments and some really great acting by the whole cast,yes the film was a bit too long but it was a bit too long and it was n't even worth it to watch
1,which i thought was the worst movie i 've ever seen,which is a pity because the film was so good that i
1,i have seen this movie twice and it,i was n't impressed with the film
1,he 's a very talented actor,he is the most annoying person in
1,that is what i think of this film,that 's the way it is portrayed
1,i have seen this film twice,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,ivanhoe was a great movie for the time and it is very rare,ivanhoe is one that is not only a very good film but it is
1,even though the film was made in the us it 's still a great movie,even the actors who are so good in this film are the ones who made it
1,in the end it 's a good movie to watch and you 'll enjoy the movie,in fact it is not the worst film ever but it is a good movie to see
1,but the movie is a bit too slow and too slow,but it 's a great film and it is not
1,william wyler 's the film is an excellent film,william shatner plays the part with the best performance of
1,imperium is the best of all the best and the movie is very well done and is very,imperium 's character was so stupid and the acting was so wooden that i was laughing hysterically
1,now that i have seen it i have a fondness for it and i have to say i am not,now i have seen the original and i have to admit that i was very disappointed with the movie
1,exciting and funny this movie is just a bad bad movie that,exciting to watch and a good movie for the whole family
1,it is not a film for everyone who wants to be a little sceptical and not to watch it but it 's,it 's a very good movie and it is not a movie to be missed by a wider fan of it
1,too bad the movie is so boring,too many people who are n't familiar to
1,although i do not know why i did not watch this film i did n't like the film at all,although the movie is a bit long and the story line is very interesting the characters are very believable
1,it 's a very funny film and a great one,it is not a movie that is n't a good one
1,unfortunately it is n't the same as the first one,unfortunately the film is not a complete disaster it is not
1,it is a very funny movie,it 's not even a good film
1,matlin 's character is a little bit too unlikable and too much to be believable but,matlin is the best thing about this film and she is a very talented actress
1,considering that this is a film that has a lot of potential to do it 's not,considering the fact of this film the film is very good and the acting was good
1,folks do not waste time on this one,folks i do n't know why this movie was
1,i was surprised that the film did n't have to be seen by all,i have to say i did n't enjoy this movie but i did not expect
1,this is a movie that is n't,this movie was a complete disappointment
1,our heroes were the same people who were in the same room and the same person,our hero is a man with no control and a good sense to the contrary
1,whenever the movie is about the characters they are all so real and believable,whenever i first heard about this movie the other day i was a little confused
1,a lot more of a good movie,a few years later the film has a
1,as for me i have seen a few of his movies and this is the worst one,as a result of this film 's success i was surprised to find that the film was a
1,good luck to see this film in,good acting and a good script
1,if i were to give this a zero i would,if you 're a fan like me and have seen the
1,i have seen the original movie and i have,i was n't expecting much from the film
1,the movie was shot in the same location and the actors,the film is a complete mess of the first movie
1,shot in a very small budget and the film is a bit too long for a low brow production values and the production values are pretty good but it 's a,shot on a small budget it is a film about the life and death of a man who is a man who is not afraid to live in a society
1,ah the movie is a bit of a bore but it 's not,ah i do not think this movie was made for tv but i think
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and a waste,the film has some of the worst dialogue i have seen in

1,all in the family and the film is a great example of how to play the,all the actors were excellent and the movie is very entertaining and entertaining to watch
1,her character was a bit of an idiot,her performance is so good that it 's almost
1,in the first movie the characters are not developed as they are in this movie,in fact the film was shot on location and it 's a shame that it is
1,they are not even close enough to make the film even remotely entertaining and it 's a shame because it 's not a,they 're not the only ones that have a shred of decency and they are not even able to get the chance
1,but the movie was n't bad enough,but it 's not a bad movie
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,but it 's not a bad movie,but the movie was n't bad enough
1,the movie was shot in the same location as the first movie and the second was a bit too slow but it was n't that,the film is a complete mess of the original film and it 's a shame that it is n't available on dvd or dvd
1,the movie is about the same subject as the book and it 's not a bad thing that the movie is n't as,the film has a very interesting plot but the acting is so poor it is almost painful to sit at night with
1,robertson is a great actor but the movie does n't work,robertson 's performance was the only reason i gave it a 3
1,it 's a very good film,it is not a film that will
1,you can tell the story is n't a bad,you know what i was going to do
1,bakshi 's film has a lot of action sequences but it is not,bakshi is a master in the industry and the film is a very interesting
1,as for me it 's a shame because it is not,as a result the movie has a lot of potential
1,in fact the film is not a total disaster but it is still a great movie and a good movie to see if you can find it anywhere else and it 's a great film,in the first movie he was the one who was in love with his wife and he was a little more than a child but was still a very good character and he had a lot
1,this is the first movie that has a very,this movie is a complete waste of time

1,it 's a very funny movie,it is not a movie for the
1,thanks to the fact the movie was made in the early 80,thanks for a good performance from the cast and the story
1,this is the first movie that i,this movie is a complete waste
1,and it is a shame because the film is so good that it 's not funny,and the ending was a bit too abrupt and the ending was just plain awful
1,some people say that the film was a,some of the acting is pretty good
1,i was surprised to find out the film is n't a comedy,i have to admit that i have seen this movie twice
1,mathieu is the only person who is able to find the,mathieu 's father and his son are both very good
1,actually the movie is a little slow and the story is n't very good,actually it is n't that bad but the movie is a little too long for
1,i was surprised to find that the movie was not a complete disaster but it was n't,i have to admit that the film was very good and the acting was superb and the acting
1,but the film is not as bad as the original but it 's still a good movie,but it is not a movie that you will never forget about it 's own and it is
1,it is a shame that this movie has n't been,it 's not a movie that you can see
1,but it is a great movie,but the film 's biggest problem with
1,he is a very good actor,he 's not the only actor in
1,also the movie is a bit too long,also i think the movie was a little bit
1,i was surprised to see that the movie was a little,i have to admit i did not enjoy the movie
1,lee is the best of all,lee 's character is the only one
1,what a waste of time and money,what is this film trying to do with
1,the film has a very good cast and the story is a bit of,the movie is about the power and soul that is in the book
1,such as a movie that was so bad that i could n't even sit back and enjoy the movie and i was n't impressed by,such a film as a film is not to be taken lightly by the director and the actors in the movie and the director
1,this movie was a waste for the whole movie,this is a movie for everyone who loves the book
1,the movie is a complete mess of a film,the film has some of its moments that are n't
1,well the film is a bit of a mess,well i do not think this is the worst movie
1,he 's a very good actor,he is the most talented character in
1,perhaps it was the fact i did n't like the movie but it did n't have a good story,perhaps the most memorable scene is when a man is killed by a woman in a car accident and then
1,now that 's a bit too long,now i know i 've seen a few
1,it 's a shame because the film is so boring and the acting is so poor that it 's almost laughable to watch and the actors are all pretty bad and the story is so predictable that i,it is not the worst film i have ever seen but it is definitely one of my favorite films of all time and i hope that the next generation will be a better movie than this one
1,the film is a complete waste of time and a waste,the movie was shot in a small budget and it 's not
1,sure it 's a bit of an action film,sure the film was shot on location but the acting
1,the film has a lot of action and a few moments of humor but it is n't,the movie is about a group that has a lot of fun and the movie is about the
1,the movie was shot in a very,the film is a complete waste
1,i have seen this movie several times and i have to say that i have seen it twice and i can only say that i was very disappointed,i was n't impressed with this film but it was very entertaining and very funny and it was a pleasure to watch and it was a great movie to
1,though it is not a great film i do n't think that it was a good idea,though the film is not as good as the original the acting is pretty bad and the story
1,a lot more than the usual hollywood movie it is,a few years ago i was a little disappointed
1,whatever the reason it is the best movie ever,whatever it was i would have to say that i
1,but it is a good movie,but the film 's main problem with
1,the film is about the same subject as the first film,the movie was a bit slow but i did not expect it
1,it is a shame because the movie,it 's not a bad film
1,i have to admit i did not like the film but it was a great movie and i would recommend this film,i was surprised to see that the film was made in the us and the film was shot on a shoestring budget
1,how could you possibly get a movie that is so awful,how can a film like that be released on video
1,otherwise it is a very good film,otherwise the film was n't bad
1,sean connery plays a young man who,sean penn is the perfect actor
1,i have to say that i was very disappointed with the movie and the,i was surprised that this film did n't get released theatrically in theaters
1,i was surprised that the film was made in a hurry,i have to say i did not enjoy the movie but it
1,of course there is a lot of action in this film,of all the films that i 've watched this is the first
1,the film is a bit of an exercise in the plot and it is not a good movie,the movie was shot on location in the middle east and the story was a little confusing but the
1,raul browning is the master and the film is a great example of what is wrong with the film industry,raul julia is a good actor but he does not have the chops to pull the film together and he is
1,this is a very bad movie and it is not even a,this movie was so bad that i was laughing at it
1,try and find a better movie,try to get a copy of the
1,but it is a good film and it 's a shame because it 's not the,but the film 's main flaw is that the story is not a good one
1,here 's a list of reasons why i gave it a 3,here is the plot the acting and directing is horrible and the acting
1,it 's not a bad movie,it is a shame because it is
1,but the movie is a bit slow,but it 's a great film
1,instead it is a very poor film,instead of being the worst movie i have
1,i was n't expecting much of this movie,i have seen the original version and it 's
1,for a movie about the evils of the human condition it 's,for the most part the movie was a little too slow
1,in the first movie he was the one who was the first to die and,in fact the film is not a total disaster but a very entertaining film
1,for the most part the acting was pretty bad and the plot was just too stupid to be funny but i did n't think it would,for a movie about the holocaust of a man who has a very difficult time dealing with a man who is a very human person
1,i was surprised to see that this was the only movie that i would have walked away,i have to admit i did n't enjoy this movie but it is a great movie
1,joel mccrea plays a very good role in this film,joel schumacher 's direction is a bit too high for the
1,bernard 's character is so stupid that,bernard is the best of all
1,neither the acting or acting is good,neither of them is a real good person
1,but it 's a great movie,but the movie is a little slow
1,central characters are introduced to the audience,central park has been released on dvd and
1,the movie was shot on a low level of 35mm cameras,the film is a bit slow but it 's a good film
1,barbara carrera is the only reason i can watch this movie,barbara stanwyck plays a young woman in the middle east and is
1,however i was n't impressed with the film,however the movie was a bit slow
1,nurse betty is a very beautiful and very sexy movie,nurse snowblood was the most popular movie of all time and
1,for the most of us this is the first time i 've ever been a big fat fan,for a movie that is a bit of a thriller i think that the movie is a little too
1,do n't waste your time on this one unless you 're looking to see the real thing,do not watch it for yourself and if you are looking for a movie that is not funny
1,but the film 's biggest problem is that it 's not even a comedy,but it is a great movie and it is a joy to see
1,ugh i was so disappointed that the,ugh this is a good movie
1,not to mention the acting was horrible,not only does he have a lot more
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,because of this i have to say that i was very impressed by this film and i was surprised that,because the movie is a little too much to ask for and it 's not a bad film either
1,and it is a very funny film that is not just about a young man 's struggle with the man he is a,and the ending was so bad that i was left wondering if the director was trying to get the audience to sympathize
1,we are not supposed to feel like a movie about the characters and their relationships and their,we have to be careful to be a little bit of an observer of the film
1,i have to say i was very disappointed,i was surprised that the movie did n't have
1,nothing is explained in this film,nothing really happens and the film does
1,rob lowe plays a young woman who is a little more sophisticated,rob roy is the most famous actor of the 20th century
1,i was surprised that the film did not get released theatrically in theaters,i have to say i did n't like the film but i did not
1,an excellent film with a very strong cast,an interesting film that i would recommend for everyone
1,one of the best films of all time and i hope it will be a success for all,one thing i liked about this movie is that the characters are all so real and believable
1,and it is not a movie,and the ending is so stupid that
1,i was surprised that this movie was n't made available in theaters,i have to say that this movie is a waste of time and
1,i have to admit i did n't enjoy this film but i was n't expecting a lot of the film,i was surprised to see that this was the first movie that i have seen in the past year

1,this movie is a must for anyone who wants a,this is the first film i have ever seen
1,info on the dvd box cover,info is the worst movie i have
1,it is not the worst film ever made,it 's a shame because the movie was so
1,a lot of the film is about the characters and the characters are so real,a few of them were good but they did not make the movie any more
1,it is a shame because it 's a very good movie,it 's not a bad movie but the fact is it 's
1,but the movie is a bit slow,but it 's a great film
1,it is a very funny film and,it 's not even a movie
1,and it 's not a good film either,and the movie was so bad that it made
1,dylan mcdermott is the only actor who has a role as a,dylan is the only person who is able in his life
1,norma desmond is the only one that is a good actress and she 's a,norma shearer plays a young girl who has a onenight stand with a woman
1,what a great film this is,what is the deal of this movie
1,a lot of the scenes are shot and edited and edited,a few of them are not so bad they are good but
1,most people are n't interested with this film,most of the time i was n't sure whether
1,this is a movie for those interested in a film,this movie was a waste of time and money and time
1,we are not supposed to feel like a movie like this,we have to be careful to be a little more forgiving about
1,so i guess i 'll be watching this film,so the movie was made in a very short time
1,wow this movie is so bad it,wow i do not know why
1,good acting great plot and good music,good luck for the first time
1,maybe the movie is n't a good idea,maybe it 's just me but it 's not
1,there is no real plot and the acting was terrible,there are some very funny moments but the movie does not
1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,but the movie was n't bad enough,but it 's not a bad movie
1,paul rudd plays the part with the character and he,paul lukas is the perfect choice for the role
1,not to say the movie was n't bad but it 's not that bad either it was,not only is it not a very bad film but it 's a very good movie
1,however the film is a little slow at times,however i do not recommend this movie to any other
1,this movie was so bad it 's,this is a very bad film
1,this movie is a must for anyone who wants a,this is the first film i have ever seen
1,this movie is not for everyone but it,this is the worst film ever made
1,the film has a lot to offer but it 's a good film,the movie is about a young woman who has been kidnapped and abused
1,this is the first film that i have seen that,this movie is a must see for all fans
1,i have seen this movie twice,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,but the film 's main flaw is the lack that it 's not,but it is a good film and a great one at it
1,this movie is a complete waste of my time,this is the first movie that has been released theatrically
1,it 's not even the worst of,it is a very good film
1,vinson 's performance as the lead is a little stiff but he does a great job as a,vinson is a great character actor and a great actor but he is not a great actor
1,as a result the movie is not a complete waste of time,as for me it 's not a good film but the fact is
1,the film is a complete waste of my time and money,the movie was shot in a small town and the locations are
1,the film is about the struggle between a group of people who have a relationship and a,the movie was a bit of an attempt to capitalize upon a book by a writer
1,dvd purchase of this movie was a waste,dvd extras are not the best part
1,90 years ago i saw the film and i was surprised that it had,90 minutes of pure torture and torture and a few minutes of torture
1,i was n't impressed by this film,i have seen this film several times
1,kline 's character is so unlikable that it 's impossible,kline is the best actor ever in a film
1,another problem is that it is n't even the same as a movie that 's not worth watching for,another thing i noticed was the fact that the film was shot on location in a small budget
1,he 's not a bad actor,he is a great director and a
1,there are some good moments but it 's just,there is no reason for this to happen
1,still the movie is a little slow,still it 's not that bad
1,one thing that really annoyed the film was the music,one of my favorite films of all times and i have
1,in the end it 's a very good film,in fact it is not the best film ever
1,he is a very talented director,he 's not the best actor in
1,frankenstein is the most interesting and interesting character of all,frankenstein 's character is a bit of an idiot
1,an excellent cast and a great story,an interesting premise for the movie is that
1,as for the acting i think that the actors are all good,as a matter of fact the film has no redeeming features
1,sean penn is a good actor,sean connery plays the role as a
1,in the first film the main characters were the ones who were supposed to have been in the movie,in fact the only reason i gave this film a 1 instead of 1 is that it is not for
1,and it 's a shame because the movie is so boring,and the movie is so bad it makes it impossible to watch
1,let 's just hope that the future is n't the same,let me say that this is a very bad movie
1,then there is the scene in which the girl 's daughter and the girl go,then the movie starts to drag and it 's not really a good thing
1,my favorite scene is where a man walks around a desk and kills people with a knife,my advice to anyone who has ever seen a film that has a shred of humor and intelligence
1,i was n't expecting much from this,i have seen the original movie
1,i'm not sure why i was n't watching the movie but it,i'm a big fan and i do not like this movie
1,a lot more of the film is the way it is presented,a few years later i saw the movie and i thought that the
1,growing up with a bunch of people who have a heart of gold and are willing to live in a small village in,growing to death is one that i have seen in a long long long time and it 's a joy for me
1,so i was n't expecting a movie that was so bad that it,so the film has its moments but it is n't a movie
1,there is a scene in which a man with a,there are a few good scenes in the movie
1,to me it was a very good film,to be fair i was not disappointed
1,i was n't expecting a lot from the film but i was n't expecting,i have seen the movie twice and i have never been so impressed
1,this is a very bad movie,this movie was so bad that it
1,as a matter of fact i have to say that i was n't impressed with the film,as for the acting i would say it was n't bad but i was n't impressed
1,the movie was a waste of my life,the film is about a group of people and
1,but it 's a good thing,but the movie is not a complete
1,at least the film was n't so bad,at the same time the movie is about a
1,15yearold and his friends are the only,15yearold is a very funny film
1,played by a young man who has been in the business for,played with a lot more depth by the actors and actresses
1,it is not a film for everyone,it 's a very good movie and i
1,my advice to the director of this movie is to make sure you,my favorite scene was the one with a woman in the bar
1,i was surprised that this movie did not have a theatrical release in the uk and it is not,i have to say that this is a very bad movie and i would n't recommend this movie
1,since the movie is a little too much of an achievement it is not a good,since i was in a small town i was n't really impressed by the film
1,one of the best films i 've ever watched,one thing i liked about the movie is that the
1,its a very funny film and i think that the movie is a great movie to,its not a bad movie but the acting is good and it is very good
1,specially when you 're watching a film with the same name as the one that 's the first one i think it 's the worst movie i 've seen,specially the scene in which he is in the hospital is the best part of the film and the scene where he 's walking around the table in a bar
1,i have seen the original version and it is very faithful,i was n't expecting much of this movie to be a horror
1,i was n't expecting a lot from the film,i have seen the movie twice and i have to
1,timothy dalton is the perfect choice for this,timothy spall plays a very likable character
1,consolation that the film has no real connection with it,consolation is the fact that the film is a complete waste
1,that 's the way it 's presented,that is what i think is the worst
1,the film is about the struggle between the two men,the movie was a bit of an action film but it
1,ok i have seen this film and it 's not a good film,ok so i was expecting a good movie but i did n't expect it
1,the film has a very good story and a great story line and a good story line,the movie is about the power of a man who is a man and his wife
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,any movie with the director 's commentary on a movie that is n't a good idea to,any of the characters in the movie were so bad that they were n't even funny
1,while the film was a bit long it still managed very very well to be,while i was n't impressed with the story it 's still a good movie
1,this movie is a must for all fans of a good horror,this is the first film i 've ever walked out on
1,amy adams was the only one that seemed like she had been a little too much for her role,amy is a very beautiful actress and she is very good in the role of a young girl
1,instead it is an insult for the viewer to be able to identify between,instead of being a little bit more trustworthy it 's not that bad
1,as for me i was impressed by the fact the movie is set,as a result of the film it 's not a good movie
1,not only does he not have a good time he 's still a good guy,not to mention the fact of this movie is that it 's not even a movie
1,why is it so hard for him,why did they make this movie
1,i have seen the original version and it is a great film,i was n't expecting much of this movie to begin with
1,i have to admit that i was n't disappointed,i was surprised to find out that this was the
1,but it is a good film and a good one,but the film 's main flaw is the fact it 's
1,i have seen this film twice,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,roger corman 's the thing that 's a,roger ebert is a very talented actor
1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i have seen this film twice
1,but the film is a bit slow,but it is not the best movie ever
1,i have to admit that the movie is a little slow but i really enjoyed it,i was surprised to find that this was the first movie that i saw that was actually
1,from the opening scene of the film to a final shot in which a woman 's character goes on a journey through a tunnel and a scene where she is,from a very good opening sequence of events to the final scene of the movie the viewer is left with the feeling that the director is trying too much
1,first of all the acting was horrible and the plot was so bad that it could,first off i have no idea what the point was to be the first movie
1,nothing is ever explained and it 's a pity to hear that it is n't a movie that,nothing really happened and it was a shame that the movie did n't have a good ending
1,but it is a great film and i think it 's a good film,but the film 's biggest flaw is that it 's not even a good film
1,if i had n't seen it in the first 30 minutes it would have been a total disaster but i do n't know what it was,if you want to watch a movie about a bunch that is going through a series of events then you will find this film entertaining
1,hmm i do not think this is the worst film ever,hmm it 's a good movie but it is n't
1,it 's a very good film and a great one,it is not a film that is n't a comedy
1,not only is the story a bit too predictable but,not to say that it was a bad film
1,i have to admit that i have n't seen this movie since it,i was surprised to find out the movie is a complete mess
1,the movie was a bit slow but it did not make me laugh at the same,the film is about the same subject matter as the original and the movie is a very
1,it is a very funny film and,it 's not even a movie
1,however the film is a little slow and,however i do not recommend this movie
1,the movie was a bit slow but i was n't expecting it,the film is about the same subject as a book of the same
1,i was surprised that this movie did n't get a theatrical dvd,i have to say that this is one that i would recommend to
1,had the film done the same thing as the first film it was a little bit more,had it been a comedy i 'd say that the movie was a little too long
1,the movie was a bit of a letdown,the film is about the struggle of a man
1,i have seen this film twice and it 's not a great film,i was n't impressed by the fact that it was a movie about the
1,the film has some of its most,the movie is a complete mess
1,his performance is so bad it 's laughable,his character was a little too cocky to play
1,he 's a very talented director,he is the most annoying character in
1,it is not the best movie i have ever had the misfortune of watching but,it 's a shame that this movie has not been available in dvd format
1,as for the acting i would have given it a zero but i would have given it 0,as a matter of fact i was not surprised by this film but i did not like it
1,i have seen this movie twice and i have to say it was a very,i was n't impressed with the film and the plot is n't very good
1,what is this film trying to do with,what a waste of time and money
1,we have to see it for yourself,we are not told that the movie has
1,i was surprised that the film was made,i have to say i did not enjoy this
1,henry fonda is the perfect choice to be the villain,henry winkler plays a very good guy who is a little
1,i have seen this film several years ago and it 's a great film,i was n't impressed by this movie but it 's a good film
1,painful and the film 's climax is a little too long,painful to watch but the movie has some good moments and the
1,this is the worst movie ever,this movie is not a bad movie
1,in the first movie the characters were very different from their own counterparts,in fact the film was shot in a very grainy manner and it 's
1,less than the usual suspects are there is,less of a drama and a drama
1,prayers are the best part of this film,prayers to go out and get a copy
1,and it is a very good film and it is a great film,and the ending was so stupid that i could n't even get to see
1,the movie was shot on a budget that was shot on location in a warehouse,the film is a bit slow and the story line is n't that bad
1,and the ending was so stupid that it,and it is a very good film
1,the film is about a group of people who have a relationship together,the movie was a waste of my life and i could not help but
1,i was n't impressed by the fact that it is n't a comedy,i have seen this film twice and it 's still a good movie to
1,if you want to watch a film that is a little too slow and not too graphic then you will probably like this,if i had n't seen it i 'd probably be able to erase my own mind and make me feel a bit uneasy about
1,the film has a lot to do with a plot that is n't really a thriller but it 's still pretty good,the movie is about a young man named kenny who has been sent into the prison to assassinate a man who has a
1,then there is a lot more to the story than this,then the movie switches gears and the story becomes a bit more
1,this movie was a waste of my time and money to,this is a movie for those who love the book
1,lots of action and suspense and the film has,lots and a lot of the same thing
1,really it 's not a movie that you will see in a theater,really the only thing i liked was the fact that it 's not even
1,apparently this is the first film that has been,apparently the movie is a little too long
1,at the end the movie is about a young man who is trying his best to,at least it 's a bit of an insult to anyone involved in the making
1,i have to admit i was n't impressed by the film,i was surprised to see this film in a theatre
1,good acting and a good story,good luck to see this movie in
1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,of course the film has some of the most,of all of these films i 've watched
1,when i saw this film i was a little sceptical,when the film is over the end of a movie is
1,sure it is a bit dated and the acting was pretty good but it 's not a good movie either,sure the movie was a bit slow and it was n't really the story of a young woman in the woods
1,so i guess i was wrong but this movie was so bad it was good,so the movie was a bit too long for me but it was n't
1,if i had to give this a 0 i 'd be a bit more forgiving of the film 's existence and i have,if you want a movie that is a bit of a parody of the original then this is the one for you
1,i have seen the movie and it is one that i,i was n't expecting a movie to be so bad
1,i have to say that i was very impressed by this movie and it 's,i was surprised that this film did n't have a chance for the sequel
1,being a big fan of this series it 's a shame that the film has not got a wider release in my collection,being the first of a series of films i 've watched in my lifetime and i have to admit i was n't impressed
1,i'm a big fan and i have to say that i was n't impressed by this movie,i'm not sure why i was so disappointed with the film but it 's a good film to
1,moreover it is a very good film,moreover the film has some very good actors
1,in fact the film is a little slow but it 's a good film,in the first movie he is a very good guy who is n't a bad
1,although i have n't read a book that is so bad i ca all agree,although the film is a bit dated it 's not as good or original
1,our hero is a very human and he is not only,our heroes were the only ones that could be killed
1,having said that i have to say that i have seen the movie and it 's a great movie to,having seen this film several years later it was a pleasure to see the first film in the theater
1,so the movie is about a young man named kenny and the other two,so i guess it 's not a good movie but it 's not
1,even the most ardent of characters are n't the least bit believable,even though it 's a bit of an action movie the film does
1,this movie was so awful it 's,this is a very good movie
1,it 's not even a good movie but a very funny movie,it is a very funny movie and it 's a shame that it
1,some people have said that this is a good film,some of them are not as bad but the movie does
1,deranged and dumber is a film that has,deranged to a certain degree of humor
1,after a while i was hooked and i had to stop,after the movie was released i was n't sure if it was
1,half of this movie was shot in a very cheap way and,half the time i was a bit skeptical about this movie
1,i have seen this film twice,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,i have to say that i was very disappointed,i was surprised that this film did n't get a
1,hell it is n't that bad but it is n't,hell i have to say i was very impressed by this
1,there are some very good scenes and the film is very well made,there is no real reason for this movie to have been released

1,i was surprised that this movie did not have the chance of,i have to say that this is a very good movie
1,did n't they have a chance,did i mention the ending was a
1,plot holes were not the main focus,plot is a bit too long
1,palance is a good actor and is a good actor,palance 's performance is the only reason to watch the movie
1,is the only thing i have to do with this movie and it 's a,s character is a bit of an idiot who is n't a good actor _EOS
1,i'm a fan of this film and i do not know why i did n't watch,i'm not a fan of the original series but this one is a complete mess
1,or maybe the director was n't going to,or the fact it was a remake
1,some people say that the movie is so bad that i actually laughed at,some of the acting is good and the plot is a little weak
1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,it is not the best movie i have seen in my life,it 's a shame that this movie has n't made any money
1,the movie was a waste of my life and my life and i would n't be surprised to see it again in,the film is about a group of people who are trapped in a remote island in the middle of a forest
1,in fact the only thing i liked about this film is the fact it,in the first film he was a little too old for his role
1,some people say it 's a good movie,some of the scenes were just too much to
1,seeing the movie is a great experience and,seeing this film was a great experience
1,i was surprised to find out the movie is n't a horror film,i have to admit that i have n't seen the movie yet
1,the film has a very interesting story line,the movie is about the same thing as the
1,the movie was shot in a very,the film is a complete waste
1,charles grodin plays the role as a cocky and manipulative character,charles durning is the perfect choice to play a character who has
1,when i first heard about it i was n't expecting much,when the movie is about a woman named caroline she 's not
1,henry fonda plays the role of a man who has to be the best person in the business,henry winkler is a good choice to play a character who has a very difficult role to play in
1,is this the best way to describe it in a movie,is it a comedy or is he just a joke
1,the film has some good points but the story line was so weak and so predictable it was unbelievable to watch,the movie is a bit of an action film but it is a good film to watch and it 's a good
1,and it is not a good film,and the ending is so bad that i
1,he 's not the best character in,he is a very talented actor
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the movie was shot in a small budget
1,i was surprised that the movie was made in a hurry,i have to say i was n't impressed with the film but
1,it is not the worst film ever made but it is still good and it,it 's a shame because the movie was n't so bad it 's good
1,eric bana is the only actor in this movie who is very funny and has,eric stoltz plays the part with a lot more than a hint of humor
1,the film has a lot of action in the movie,the movie is about a group that is trying to get
1,like i mentioned earlier the film was shot on a low,like the other reviewer i did n't like the movie
1,snoopy is the only one that has a shred of respect for the young woman who has to be the only one to be saved,snoopy 's father and son are the ones that have been kidnapped by a man who is a little more than a little too young to
1,it 's a very funny movie,it is not a movie for the

1,at least it was a bit of a letdown,at the end of the movie i thought that it
1,buckle up to the other actors,buckle is the story of a man
1,the film has a very interesting plot but it is n't,the movie is about the same subject as a book
1,i have seen the original version of the original,i was n't expecting much of a movie to be
1,given the fact that the film is a little bit of a mess the film is very entertaining and the acting is excellent,given that the movie was a complete mess of the original film i was surprised that it was n't available in theaters
1,but the movie was a little slow and the ending is so bad it 's almost unbelievable to me,but it 's not the worst movie ever made but it 's not bad either as manos the hands
1,despite being a bit preachy it 's not a good film,despite the obvious lack of any real plot it 's a pretty
1,the film is about a group that is,the movie was a waste of time
1,geez i have to say that i have n't read a book that has,geez it 's not that good but it 's not a good movie
1,there is no real plot and the acting was terrible,there are some very funny moments but the movie does not
1,unfortunately it is n't the same as the first,unfortunately the film is not a complete disaster it 's
1,unfortunately the movie is n't a good one,unfortunately it 's a little too late
1,and the ending is a bit abrupt and i do n't know why i was n't gripped,and it is not the worst film ever made but the fact that it is a film that
1,his performance in the movie is a little stiff,his character is so stupid and stupid that it makes
1,while the movie is not as bad it 's just plain awful and the acting,while i do not think the movie is worth seeing it is a waste
1,people who have seen this film have a,people are n't going for the movie
1,not to mention the acting was terrible and i did n't even care for any,not only does he have a good time but he is a good actor
1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,robert downey jr is a good actor but his performance here was so bad he could have,robert englund was the perfect choice to make a movie about a man and his wife

1,i was surprised that this film did n't get a,i have to say that i was very disappointed
1,light and shadow are all the rage of this film and,light hearted and very funny and the acting is superb
1,i have seen the original movie and i can tell that the movie is not a masterpiece,i was n't expecting much from the film but i was n't disappointed with the film
1,by far one thing the movie has to offer is a,by the end of the film i had a headache
1,it 's not even a movie it,it is a very funny film
1,the movie was a bit of a letdown but i found the story very interesting,the film is about the struggle of a young man who is in love and his
1,maybe the movie was made in the us,maybe it 's because the movie was so bad
1,okay so i was n't expecting much,okay i have seen a few movies that
1,i have to admit i was n't disappointed,i was surprised to see this film
1,why is this film so bad,why did n't they make it to
1,i was n't impressed with the movie,i have seen this movie twice
1,when i saw this film i thought that it would be a good,when the film is over the top and a bit too much
1,what a great film this is and it is one of my favorites of all times and i have,what is the deal of this film that is so bad it 's good it 's not bad
1,it 's not a movie for everyone,it is a shame that the movie has
1,the movie was a waste for the movie and i think it was the worst film ever made and it 's a waste,the film is about a young man who is a struggling woman who is married to a man who has been cheating on her
1,this movie is not for the squeamish,this is the worst film i have seen
1,liev howard is a good director,liev schreiber 's character is a caricature
1,olivier is a good actor but he does not have the,olivier 's performance is the best i 've ever heard
1,perhaps the director was n't going to be able to get a lot more attention from his audience but he,perhaps it 's a good thing that this film has a lot to do with it 's original release
1,hell i have n't read the novel,hell it is a movie about a man
1,if i were to give it a zero rating i 'd be able,if you 're a fan of horror movies and have seen the original you
1,and it is not the best film ever,and the ending is a little unsatisfying and the
1,in the first film he is the only one who has a crush in his face,in fact the only thing that makes this film watchable are its characters and the acting is
1,steinbeck 's direction is a little too restrained and too bright for,steinbeck is the only person who has ever seen a movie
1,irene dunne plays the part with the same charm as she did with the rest,irene cara is a great actress and she 's very good as the mother
1,first off the acting is terrible and the plot is so bad it 's laughable and it is not funny,first of the film 's plot is about the man 's struggle to get the girl to the death of her
1,in fact the only thing i can think about is the way the movie is,in the first film he was the one who had to be a hero
1,nicole kidman plays a woman whose husband is,nicole eggert is a very talented actor
1,she is a very good actor,she 's not the only one who
1,not only does it look like it was shot on a camcorder,not to mention that the film was made for the romanians
1,yes it 's not that great,yes the film is a bit slow
1,it is a very good movie and it 's not,it 's not even the best of the genre

1,the movie was shot on a low level of the budget,the film is a bit slow but it 's not as bad
1,three years later i saw this movie and it was,three of them are a group and a bunch
1,ben stiller plays the role of the main character,ben affleck is the only actor who can save the
1,a few years later i saw this film on tv,a lot more of the film 's plot and the acting
1,you know what i was talking about but i do n't know what it was,you can tell the story of a man 's life in the past and the end
1,but it 's not the best of the bunch and the,but the movie was a bit too slow for me
1,the movie was a waste for the movie and it was n't even nominated for the oscar nominated performance,the film is about a young man who is sent into prostitution and is killed by a group of thugs
1,crocodile master was a very funny film,crocodile dundee is the best of the three
1,but the movie is not a good one either as it is not a movie,but it 's a good thing to see a movie with such a great cast and
1,apparently the movie is a bit too slow and the story is,apparently this is the first time that i saw the film
1,but it is a great film,but the film 's biggest flaw was
1,i have to say that this is a great movie and i recommend you,i was surprised that this movie did not get a wider audience award
1,of all the films i have ever watched this one has to,of course there is no real reason to watch this movie
1,for a movie that is a bit too long it 's not that good,for the most of us this is a great movie for the whole family to
1,first of all i was a little disappointed by the movie,first off i was n't expecting a lot of this film but
1,i have seen the original movie and i can safely say that i have seen,i was n't expecting much from the film but it 's a little slow
1,it is a very funny movie,it 's not even a good film
1,as a result of the film it 's not a good movie,as for me i was impressed by the fact the movie is set
1,looking for a good movie and the acting is good but the script is so poor that you can almost feel bad,looking at it and see what it is about the film 's story and its characters and the way it unfolds
1,it 's not even the worst of,it is a very good film
1,it 's a shame that this movie has not been available in dvd,it is not the best movie i have ever had the misfortune of seeing
1,one of my favorites was the first one and i was really looking forward to seeing the sequel to this movie,one thing that i did like about the movie was that it was made for the sake that it was n't
1,while i was n't expecting much from the film i did n't really expect it to be a comedy or a drama,while the film was shot in a very tight budget it is still a very beautiful movie and it 's not even the
1,now i know i have n't read,now that 's a good thing
1,the film is a complete waste of my time and money,the movie was shot in a small town and the locations are
1,clint eastwood is the only one who can be forgiven for the role of the president,clint howard 's character was so unlikable that i could not help thinking he had a good
1,it 's not even the worst movie i 've seen,it is a very good film and it is a great
1,the movie is a bit slow and boring,the film has some good moments but the story
1,i was surprised that this film was released in theaters and it is a shame because the film is not a complete disaster,i have to say that i have seen this movie several times and i have to say i am a huge believer in a
1,the movie was a bit slow and boring,the film is about the same thing about a
1,first of all i have no problem,first off i was a little disappointed
1,pairing the cast of unknowns and the cast is excellent,pairing of the two leads are a bunch that is not
1,the movie is about a young woman named seita who has a daughter who has,the film has a lot to offer and the film is very well made
1,it is a shame because it is,it 's not a bad movie
1,thats what i thought it was,thats not the case with this film
1,i have seen the movie twice and i have to,i was n't expecting a lot from the film
1,there are some very funny moments but it is n't,there is no real plot and the characters are all very
1,i was surprised that this movie was made in a hurry,i have to say that this movie was a waste of my
1,and it 's not a bad movie,and the movie was so boring
1,biographical film noir in the early 1950 's,biographical is a very interesting film and it 's
1,this is the first movie i 've,this movie is a complete mess
1,this is the worst movie i have seen,this movie is not a good one
1,only a couple of people have seen this film and i do not understand why they would n't be able to make it a movie to watch and it is not a movie for anyone,only the most discerning fans of the original series will find this movie to have been a bit disappointing for me because of the fact that the film is not as good as the original
1,you know that the movie is going to end,you can see that this movie is not a good
1,even though the film is a bit long and the story line is not as bad,even the actors who were in the movie were so good that they were good
1,you can see that this movie is a complete,you know that the movie is going nowhere
1,one thing i liked about this film was that the,one of the best films of the last decade
1,he is a very good character,he 's not the only one who
1,rockets and automobiles are not always the best,rockets are the best thing about the movie
1,some of the scenes are just plain,some people say it is bad

1,anyway i was n't impressed with this movie,anyway the film has a lot of good points
1,with the help from the police and his cronies he 's arrested and the police are killed,with a supposed budget the only redeeming feature is the fact that the film has some good points

1,from a very good script to the acting to a very funny scene,from the opening scene to the end of this movie you 'll see what

1,every scene is a joke and a lot of the jokes were just plain stupid,every time he 's in the movie you know he 's going to be the one
1,so i was n't impressed by the movie and the acting was horrible,so the film has a very interesting story and a very good cast and
1,we are not told to believe that he 's the one who 's been in,we have to see the film for the first time and the next day

1,the movie is about a young man who has been kidnapped and abused by a man who is a man who is a woman and,the film has a lot to do but it 's not a good film and the actors do not seem very convincing to me
1,okay i have to admit i did not like this movie,okay so i do n't know why i was n't expecting this
1,the film is about the struggle of the people who have to be a part,the movie was a bit of a mess but it was n't that bad
1,although the movie was n't as bad it 's still pretty good and it 's a shame that it was n't released theatrically in theaters,although i do n't think it is a good thing to watch this movie it 's not even worth mentioning that the movie is so boring
1,sadly the movie has no real plot and the characters are so unlikable that it makes,sadly it 's not a bad film but it 's a great movie to see
1,andersson 's direction was a bit too long and too loud,andersson is the only person in this film who is not a
1,a lot of the film is shot,a few of them were good
1,then there 's the fact that it 's not a comedy it is a drama,then the film is set up as the story of a young woman named sosuke and
1,the movie is about the power of the human,the film has a very good story line
1,though the movie is a little bit slow moving and the plot,though it 's a little dated it 's still very funny
1,but the film 's biggest flaw is the lack that it 's a good movie to watch and it is a good movie,but it is a great film and a good one at it 's finest and it is a shame that it is n't

1,my advice is to watch this film,my favorite part is the one where he
1,absolutely nothing is said about the movie and the acting is n't as good as it should have,absolutely no one has any redeeming qualities whatsoever and i think the director should be ashamed to be a
1,only a couple of people who have been in a theater can relate to the fact they 're not even close,only the most discerning fans will find this film to be a bit disappointing and not worth watching for any reason

1,but the movie is not as good,but it 's a good movie and a
1,in fact the film was shot in the early 1980s and was shot on location,in the first movie the characters were not developed in a way they were all
1,but it 's not the best movie i have seen,but the movie was a bit of a mess
1,some of them were very good,some people have commented on the similarity

1,shakespeare is the only person in the film that has been given a good chance to make the movie,shakespeare 's direction was a bit slow but the film was a little too slow and the story was n't
1,mendes 's character was a little too unlikable to be a sympathetic,mendes is the only actor who has ever played the role

1,i was surprised that the movie was made,i have to say i was n't impressed by
1,then the film switches gears and we get a glimpse into the lives of the two main characters,then there 's a few things that are n't really explained in this film and it is not even
1,you can see that this movie was shot on the cheap,you know that the movie is a spoof of the original
1,maggie gyllenhaal plays the role of a young girl in,maggie cheung is the perfect actress for her role
1,so i was expecting something like the original but it,so the film is a little slow and boring
1,the film is a bit slow and the story line is n't that bad but it 's not,the movie was shot on a budget that was shot on location in a small budget and the acting
1,never mind the fact it 's a film about a man who is a man who is a man and his,never before have we seen such an awful film in my entire lifetime as i was watching the first one
1,it 's not a bad movie but it 's a great film,it is a shame because it 's not the best movie ever
1,and it is a shame because the film is a bit too long for the most part and it 's,and the ending was a bit too abrupt and too abrupt to make me feel like a little bit
1,of all of these movies this is a very good movie and i recommend,of course the film is a bit of an exercise on the genre
1,roberto benigni and his wife are the best of all the cast and the supporting characters are all excellent and the film,roberto moreland is the perfect actor for the role of a man who has to be the best actor in history
1,also i do n't think that it is the,also the film has some very funny moments
1,lord of a trusted group of people are,lord and jury is a great movie
1,del jovi is the perfect actor,del toro 's character is a caricature
1,my advice is that you do not want to see it,my favorite part of the movie is when a woman is stabbed
1,it is not a movie for the,it 's a very funny movie
1,i have to admit that i was very impressed by this movie,i was surprised to find out that the movie was a little bit
1,in fact it 's not a good film but the acting is good,in the end the movie has a lot of potential and the movie has
1,a few years later i was a,a lot more of the same
1,i have to admit i did not like this film,i was surprised to see that the film is a little
1,the film has some good points but the rest is just a mess of the first two minutes,the movie is a bit of an action movie but the action scenes are very well choreographed and executed
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,something that i have n't seen in a long time,something like that of the old lady in a wig and
1,nonetheless it is not a bad movie but the,nonetheless the film is not a bad movie
1,it 's not a bad movie,it is a shame because it is
1,i have to say i did n't enjoy the film,i was surprised that the film did n't get a wider
1,more than anything else it 's not even a movie,more importantly the movie is not a complete disaster
1,you can see the director mateo and his crew of the people involved,you know that it is a good idea for the film to be a
1,a lot more of the film is a little too long,a few years later i saw the film on the shelf
1,as for the rest of it i was very disappointed,as a matter the movie is not a complete waste
1,it 's a very funny film and it 's a shame because the film is so good,it is not a movie that is so boring that you ca n't help thinking that it 's
1,that 's what makes this movie great,that is the only thing i can think
1,the film is a complete waste of my time and money to watch it again and i would have been surprised,the movie was shot in a small town and the locations were so beautiful that it was a real shame
1,and the ending was so bad that i was left wondering if the director was going to be a little too much,and it is a very funny film that is not just about a young man who has been abused by his wife
1,this movie was a waste for the first two minutes,this is a movie for everyone who wants to see it
1,as a result of the fact it is,as for me i was n't impressed
1,i was n't impressed by this movie,i have seen this film several years and
1,e the first movie was a great idea for a movie,e is a very good film and i recommend this film
1,also the movie is not as bad as it is in the,also i think the director should have had a bigger budget
1,even though the movie was a bit slow at,even the actors are n't very convincing either
1,not to mention the acting was terrible and i did n't even know that it would,not only does he have a good time but he is a very good actor
1,asoka is a great character actor,asoka 's father is a man who
1,it 's a shame because the film was shot on a cheap budget,it is not the worst film i 've ever seen but it is definitely
1,the film has some of the worst dialogue ever,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,i have seen the original movie,i was n't expecting much from this
1,alan arkin is a great director,alan rickman plays a very likable character
1,how can a film be so bad that it is n't even worth renting for a few bucks,how could you possibly have to be a kid to enjoy it and i do n't think that the
1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,perhaps it 's a bit of a stretch for the director to make it to the big screen,perhaps the director was trying to get the audience into the film but it failed to deliver any real
1,yeah it was n't a good idea,yeah i know that 's a good thing
1,the movie was a bit slow and boring but it 's a great movie,the film is about the same thing about the man who is a man and
1,she is a very good actor and i have seen her on,she 's not the only one to be seduced by her
1,lance is a very good movie and i think it,lance henriksen plays a very likable and likable man
1,for the first time in the film the viewer was left with a sense that this is a comedy and a,for a film about the holocaust of a man who has been born to be a woman in the past
1,after the first half hour of this movie the viewer gets to see the end,after a few minutes of watching the film i realized that it was n't a bad
1,a lot more of the film 's plot is that the film has no plot,a few years later i saw this film and i thought that it was a great
1,because of the lack of originality and a lack of originality this is the most entertaining movie i have ever watched,because the film is so bad that it 's hard to believe that the director andor director could actually act
1,i have to admit i was n't disappointed,i was surprised to see this film
1,as for me it was n't a good movie,as a result the film is not a bad film
1,this movie was a waste of my life,this is a movie for those who like the
1,the film is about a young woman who has a crush on her and her mother,the movie was a waste for me and i was n't expecting a lot of the film
1,those who are n't in this film should see it,those are the things i hate about this movie
1,by far the best thing about the film is that the story line was very interesting and the acting,by the time the film reaches the climax the viewer is left wondering why they are so stupid
1,i have seen this movie twice and i have to say it was a great movie,i was n't impressed with the film and the plot is n't very good and i did
1,there is no reason to watch it,there are some good scenes and the film
1,if i had n't seen the movie i would have given the movie a higher rating but i would have to,if you want to watch something like that i suggest you watch this film and do n't waste your time
1,the movie is a complete mess of the original,the film has some of its moments but it 's
1,gosh this movie was so bad that it made it hard for anyone,gosh i do n't know why i did n't like this movie
1,of all the films that have been made in the last decade or two decades this is a must,of course there is a scene where a woman 's daughter is killed by a car accident and she is
1,also the film has a lot to offer and is a bit of a stretch for the audience,also i do n't know what to say about this film except for a couple of scenes that i
1,if you want a good laugh and a laugh track this movie will be a winner,if i had to watch this film again i would n't have been surprised by the fact
1,just like the first movie i was expecting a good movie but this,just as a movie is a bad movie and it is n't
1,once again the film 's biggest problem is that the story has a lot of holes in,once the film is over the top and a bit of a joke it is n't
1,so the film has a very good story,so i was n't impressed by this movie
1,at least the movie is a little bit too long,at the same moment the movie is about a man named
1,i'm not a fan but this movie is a real treat,i'm a fan of the original and this movie was so good
1,it 's not a bad film but the acting is pretty,it is a shame because the film is so good
1,it is a very funny movie and it 's not just a movie,it 's not even a good movie but a good one to watch and
1,then there is the fact it is not,then the movie starts with a bang
1,music is the only thing i can think of that 's a bit of a mess,music was a little choppy but i was surprised to see that it is not a movie
1,i was surprised that this movie did not have a theatrical dvd,i have to say that this is a very bad movie
1,a few of them are very good,a lot of the scenes were shot on
1,in fact the only thing that kept me watching is the fact that it was a movie,in the first film he is a young woman who has been kidnapped by the devil
1,and it is not a movie,and the ending is so stupid that
1,certainly a movie for the whole fan of the original,certainly the best of all of the martino movies
1,i have seen the movie and it 's not even that good,i was n't expecting a movie to get a good laugh
1,apart from that the movie was pretty bad,apart the movie is not a complete waste
1,davis 's performance is very good,davis is a very good actor
1,it is not a movie for the,it 's a very funny movie

1,not to mention the fact of the story is that the film has a very good story,not only does he not have the chops of a movie he 's also the one who is
1,dear readers who are not in the military and are willing for the truth of the film will be able,dear god i do not know why i do not like this movie but i think that it was a good
1,well the film is n't a complete waste,well i do not know what to do with

1,rpgs is the story that is n't,rpgs are the best of all
1,meanwhile a group of people find a way out of their lives and they decide that,meanwhile the two of them are killed and the men are forced into the woods

1,i have seen this movie several years ago,i was n't impressed with this movie but i
1,dorothy lamour is a very good actress,dorothy malone plays a woman who has a
1,when the film is released i found it hard not only to lose interest in the story,when i saw this movie i thought it was a great film and i would like to see

1,farley 's character was so stupid and the acting was horrible,farley lundgren 's character is so bad that you wonder if the
1,the movie is a bit of a bore,the film has some good points and is a
1,they are all very funny and the movie has some funny parts,they 're all in the middle of a desert island and the movie
1,kids are n't the best part,kids and adults will enjoy this movie

1,first of the film 's title character,first off the acting is horrible
1,well i do not know what the director was,well the film is n't a bad movie
1,as a result of this film the film has a very good story,as for me i have seen the film and it is one of the
1,i have seen the movie twice and i can only,i was n't expecting a lot from the movie
1,i'm a big fan and i do not like this film,i'm not sure why i was n't watching the movie
1,i have seen the movie and i can safely say that i was n't impressed by this movie but i was surprised to see,i was n't expecting a movie about the holocaust or that the characters are not the same as the one that i saw
1,never mind that this movie was a total flop,never before has i seen such a bad movie in
1,in the end it 's not even a good film,in fact it is not a movie to be taken lightly

1,the film has a very good cast,the movie is about the power and the
1,this is a very good movie and it is,this movie was so awful it was funny
1,it 's not a bad movie,it is a shame because it is
1,wyman 's character is so unlikable that it 's hard not only to cheer for her,wyman is the best actress of all times and the film is very good and very wellacted

1,this movie was so awful that i could n't even laugh,this is a very good film and it is not a movie
1,hint at a young man who is in,hint of the same as a movie
1,from a very good script to the very end of the movie i,from the opening scene to the end i felt like a movie
1,wow i do not know what the hell was wrong,wow this movie is so awful it is funny
1,trying hard and the movie is a complete waste,trying to get a few chuckles from the audience is
1,the film has a lot to offer and the film has a lot of action and some of it is very well executed but it 's a little too slow and boring,the movie is about a young woman named seita who is sent into a world where she meets a beautiful young woman named sosuke who has been living with his father
1,only the first time i watched it i was n't impressed by it,only a few of them are good and i do not think that this
1,not to say that it 's not that good but it 's not,not only is the story interesting and the acting is superb but it is
1,his performance is a bit stiff but the film is very,his character was so annoying and the acting is horrible
1,the film has a lot to offer and the film has a very nice feel,the movie is about a young woman named seita who is sent to prison for a
1,as a matter the movie was made for tv and i do n't know why,as for the rest of the cast it 's a bit of an insult for anyone
1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,i'm not sure what the director is thinking but,i'm a big big fan of the original
1,some people say that this is a good movie,some of the acting was ok and i was impressed
1,i have seen this movie twice and it,i was n't impressed with the film
1,they 're all in the middle of the night,they are all very funny and the story is very
1,while i do n't think that this movie was intended to appeal to me it is not the worst movie i have seen in a long time but i have to admit,while the movie was n't a complete waste of my life i ca n't help but feel that it 's not a good film to me it 's a good thing
1,directed with a lot of money and skill,directed by a man with the gift of a
1,this movie is a complete mess of the first film,this is the first movie i have ever walked out on
1,i have to say that i was very disappointed with this movie and,i was surprised that this film did n't get released on video
1,for a movie about the holocaust it 's a good movie,for the most part the acting is superb and the script and
1,blade is a great movie and it 's,blade runner was a very good movie
1,he is the most annoying person in,he 's a very talented actor
1,by the end i could n't help thinking of the movie,by far one of the worst films i have seen
1,imagine a movie that is so good that,imagine the film is not as good
1,kiera knightly plays the mother of a,kiera knightley is a great actor
1,jones 's performance was the only thing that could save the movie from getting shorty,jones is a great actor but the movie is so bad it 's funny to see

1,a few of the actors are very good,a lot of people have said that the film
1,he is the only person who can be identified by the fact that the only way he can be is to get the job of the,he 's a great actor but he is n't a bad guy he 's just a good guy who can act like a bad guy
1,timon and clyde are the two heroes who are in the middle and end of the world and the story is told by the same old man who has,timon is a great character and he 's not just the typical villain he is in this movie and he 's a great villain and a great villain
1,strangely enough the movie was a complete mess,strangely the movie is a complete waste of my
1,the movie was shot on a budget that was shot on location in the desert,the film is a bit slow and the story line is n't that good
1,if i had n't been in the theater i 'd have been a bit more confused and had more of a sense of the story and characters that were involved in the story but i do,if you want to see a movie that is a good example for a good film then you should check it up for the fact that it is not a movie that you can see
1,the film has some good points but it 's,the movie is a bit of an insult
1,the film has some good points but it 's,the movie is a bit of an insult
1,very few movies are made in this country,very good film with great acting and a great
1,but it 's a good movie,but the movie is not as bad
1,cary elwes plays a young man who has a heart of mind and is a man who is a man who has been a very,cary grant is the perfect actor to play a character who is not only the most beautiful character but he 's a good actor

1,i have seen the movie twice and i can tell that it was a good idea to get,i was n't expecting a lot from the movie but i did n't expect it to happen
1,finally i have seen the original version and i can safely say it 's one that is a,finally the movie is about a man who has a wife who is not a good person

1,the movie is a complete mess of the original,the film has some of its moments but it 's
1,for a movie about a man who has been a woman he is a man who is not a very good man,for the most part it 's not a bad movie but it is a good film to watch and it is worth a
1,for the most part it 's not a good movie,for a movie about a man who has a wife who
1,i was surprised that this movie did not get a theatrical,i have to say that this is a great movie
1,too bad the film was n't even nominated for the best actor award for,too many people have been killed and killed by a bunch of people
1,it is not a film that is n't even worth a,it 's a very good film and a good one
1,with a few twists thrown in there is a bit of a plot twist,with the exception of the film the acting was pretty bad and i did n't
1,the film has a lot of action and a few scenes that make it worth watching,the movie is about a group that has a lot to do with the fact they have
1,ariel is a very beautiful woman who has a very difficult time,ariel 's father and his son 's daughter and her mother have a
1,like the first film the characters were very good and the story line is great,like i said it was n't a bad film but the actors were good
1,there is a scene in which a woman is stabbed,there are a few good scenes in this film
1,you can tell the story is n't a bad,you know what i was going to do

1,of course there are some good things about this movie,of all the movies that have made the first two movies
1,and it 's a good movie to see if,and the movie is a bit too long
1,at least the film was a bit too long,at the same time the film has been a long
1,it is not the best film i 've ever had the misfortune of watching but it 's not,it 's a shame that the film has been released in the us for years to end
1,i have to say i did n't enjoy the film,i was surprised that the film did n't get a wider
1,it 's a shame because the movie was so,it is not the worst film ever made
1,and it is not a good film to be a fan of the,and the ending is so bad that it 's hard to watch
1,cheap and dull but it is still a good movie,cheap action sequences are used to make a point and it
1,i have to say i did n't enjoy this movie but i was n't disappointed,i was surprised that the film did n't have to be seen as an exercise on
1,i have to admit i was n't impressed by the movie but i did not like the film,i was surprised to see this film in a theatre and it is a very good film
1,now i know i have n't seen it yet,now that 's a good thing to say
1,all the characters were so stupid that,all in all a great film
1,if you 're looking to see a movie with a good story line then go see,if i were n't so engrossed i would have to say i was n't impressed
1,curly is the best actor ever to play a villain,curly 's character is so annoying that i could n't even
1,robinson is a great character actor,robinson 's performance as the lead character
1,we have to see the film to get the point of the story and the story,we are not told to believe the story of a man who has been abused and murdered
1,the movie is about a young man who is a teenager and a man in the middle east,the film has a lot to do but the film does not work as a comedy or a comedy
1,in the end it is not a movie that will be forgotten by the critics,in fact it is a very poor movie with a lot more to offer
1,he is a very good character,he 's not the only one who
1,you know that the movie was a bit too much for me,you can see that this is a movie about a man trying desperately
1,set on the cheap side of the film it is the fact of a story of the same woman who has a daughter and son who,set in the present day the story of the young girl who is a little more than a little boy who is married to her
1,i was surprised that the film was made in the early,i have to say i did not enjoy the film
1,as a result the film has no redeeming features,as for me it was a very enjoyable movie
1,the movie is a complete mess of a film that has been made to entertain people who have n't read any of them,the film has some of its moments that are not only highlighted but the story is a bit of a mess and the story
1,view it for yourself and you 'll be rewarded by the fact,view the movie as a whole is the best of all
1,then there is the scene in the,then the movie starts to drag
1,i have to say that i was n't impressed by this movie but,i was surprised that this film did not get a wider audience
1,and the movie is a complete waste of your money,and it 's a good thing that this movie is n't
1,the movie is about the power and soul that is in our world,the film has a very good cast and the story is very good and
1,eventually the movie starts out with the main characters and the story of,eventually he is able to find a new job in his life
1,i have seen this movie twice,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,not to mention that the movie was a bit of an attempt at,not only does it look cheap but the acting is pretty bad
1,a few years ago i was able into the film,a lot more than the usual suspects of this movie are
1,the movie is about a young woman who has a boyfriend who is a little too infatuated,the film has a lot to offer but it is not a good film and it 's not
1,also the movie was shot in the us and the us was trying too hard to make,also i think that the director should have had the same director and director and director
1,champlain 's character is the only person,champlain is the best actor ever
1,the film is about the same thing as the first movie and it was,the movie was a bit slow and the plot is n't that bad
1,it is not a film for everyone who wants a good laugh,it 's a very good movie and it is a shame because the
1,i was surprised that the film did n't have to be made in a hurry,i have to say i did n't enjoy this movie but it was a great film
1,you know what i mean but it 's a great movie,you can tell the director was trying too hard to make it
1,he 's not a good guy,he is a great actor and a
1,while i do n't know what to say i was n't disappointed,while the movie was a little bit slow it did n't really matter
1,faced by the film 's end of a film i was surprised that it was not released theatrically,faced with a very simple and intriguing story it is not a film that will appeal for children and
1,i have seen the movie twice and it is a,i was n't expecting a lot from this film
1,this is the first movie i 've,this movie is a complete mess
1,in the end it is a very good movie and it is a great,in fact it is a great film and i recommend it to all
1,we are not told to care for him,we have to see the movie to get the
1,the movie is about a group that is trying too much to be taken care of and the story of a young man named seita is a little bit of an idiot,the film has a lot of action in the background and it is a bit slow moving but it 's not a good movie and it 's a bit too long for me
1,evan almighty is the only thing that makes it worthwhile,evan is the only one who is a good actor and
1,moments of the movie are just as bad as the rest of the film,moments are very good but the story is not very good and it 's just
1,but it 's a great film and it 's a great movie to watch,but the movie is a bit too slow for the most of us
1,he is a great director and a,he 's not a bad actor
1,the movie was shot on a low level,the film is a bit slow but it is
1,it is a shame because the film was so bad that it could,it 's not a bad film but it is n't bad either
1,but it 's not a bad movie,but the movie was n't bad enough
1,the film has a very interesting plot and a good cast,the movie is about the same subject matter as a child and
1,if you 're a fan like myself and have a sense of humour you,if i were to give this movie a rating i 'd be generous
1,hey i know that the film was shot,hey it was n't a bad movie
1,and the movie is so boring that it is almost impossible for anyone who has ever been in love,and it 's a shame that this film has n't made it to the bottom of the list
1,it is not a film that will,it 's a very good film
1,the movie was a bit slow but it was a good film,the film is about the same subject matter and it is a story
1,here 's a list of the first three movies i 've,here is the plot the characters are all very likable
1,the film has some good points but the rest of,the movie is a bit of an action movie
1,anne heche plays a young girl who,anne reid is a great actress
1,he is the most talented actor of,he 's a very good guy
1,it 's not a bad film,it is a shame because the movie
1,matthew modine plays a very good guy,matthew mcconaughey is a great choice to play
1,it is not a film that is not for everyone but it is a good film,it 's a very good film and it 's not a good film to watch
1,well the film is a little slow but the acting is so bad,well i do not think that the film is a good example

1,there is a lot to be said about this,there are a lot of things to say
1,i was n't impressed by this film but it was very good and it was a good film to watch and,i have seen this film several times and i have to admit that i am a fan of the genre
1,i have to say that this movie is one that i have seen over the past 15 years and it is a very enjoyable film to,i was surprised that this movie was n't released theatrically in theaters and released in the us in the us and released in the us
1,job of the movie is a very funny film,job is the best thing in this movie
1,the movie was a waste of my time,the film is about a group of young people
1,after the first half of the movie i thought it was going to end up,after a few minutes i realized i had to watch it to the end
1,the film is about a group of young people,the movie was a waste of my time
1,ever the movie 's main character is the most likable person i 've seen in years,ever since i saw this movie it was a very good movie and i loved it so
1,what a great film this was,what is the deal of the story
1,now that i have n't seen the original version of the original i was n't expecting much from this movie,now i have seen a few of the films that are made to entertain and this one was a complete disappointment
1,for the most of the time i was n't impressed,for a movie that was a bit too much of a
1,risking this film for a long long long time and you have a recipe for a film that,risking the movie and you will be rewarded by the end of the movie and the ending
1,it is not a movie that is so bad that you ca only laugh at the bad things,it 's a very funny film and it is a shame to see such an excellent film
1,not only does he have a lot more,not to mention the acting was horrible
1,one of my favorites is the scene in the bar when the two guys go on a road,one thing that i found most irritating about this film was that it was a complete ripoff
1,a few of the scenes were shot on the screen,a lot of people are talking about the movie and it
1,a lot more of the same,a few years later i was a
1,philippe is the best of the three,philippe 's character is so annoying that i
1,that is the only thing that i can think,that 's what makes this film so great
1,then there 's the fact that the film is a complete waste,then the film is set up for a few seconds and then the

1,worst movie i have ever had the pleasure to see,worst of the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,the film is a bit slow and the ending is predictable,the movie was shot on a budget that would make a good
1,when the film is over and the acting and the dialogue are the worst i have seen i have seen it,when i saw this film on the shelf i thought that the movie would have been a lot more interesting
1,of course there are some good things to say about the movie,of all the movies that have made this movie the best one i
1,i have to say i did not like the film but,i was surprised that the film was n't released theatrically
1,a lot more of a movie,a few years later the movie is
1,also i think that the director was trying to make,also the movie was shot in a small budget
1,there are some good moments in this film but the film does not work,there is no reason for the to be made in the first place

1,but it 's not a bad movie,but the movie was n't bad enough
1,with a supposed beard in his mouth the movie is a complete mess,with the help of a young woman she is forced into prostitution

1,the movie is about the power and soul that the characters are trying to make,the film has a very good cast and the actors and the director are able
1,as a result the film has no real plot,as for me it was a very good film and
1,and it 's a shame because it is not the best movie i 've seen in a while but i do,and the movie is so bad that it 's almost laughable to watch and it is not even worth mentioning
1,it 's a very funny movie and it 's not a good film to watch,it is not a movie for everyone but if you are a fan of hers you
1,there are a few good moments but it is n't enough to make you care about any of them and the characters do,there is a scene in the movie where the two men meet the same man who is supposed to be the killer
1,the film is about a young woman who is a woman and a woman,the movie was a waste for me and my gf and my friends

1,the film is a bit of a bore,the movie was shot on location and it was
1,the movie was shot in a very,the film is a complete waste

1,it is a very funny film and,it 's not even a movie
1,but it is a good film and a great one at it 's best and a great movie,but the film 's main flaw is the lack that it 's a bit of a stretch for a

1,no matter how many times i 've seen it you 'll have a good laugh,no one has to endure this film as it is the only one that is a
1,we have a lot of people who have been in love with the same person who is not a good guy but a very bad guy who is n't a bad,we are supposed to be a little more forgiving about the story and characters but it 's a little bit of a shame that the film is not so bad
1,but the movie is a bit slow,but it 's a great film

1,even though it 's a little bit of a parody of a movie i would n't recommend it,even the most ardent of the actors and the actors were n't very good either as the film was
1,the film has a lot to do with the plot and it is very well done,the movie is about a young man named benjamin and the girl who are married and are

1,this is a movie for those interested with,this movie was a waste of time
1,they 're not even close enough to make the film a good,they are not the same as they were in the original
1,preferably in a small town in the middle,preferably as a comedy it is not
1,it is not the worst movie ever but i 've seen it,it 's a shame because it 's a very bad film and it
1,among the most memorable scenes of all the movie is a scene,among other things the film is a bit of an oddity
1,the movie is a complete mess of a movie that has no plot,the film has some of its moments that make it a classic
1,not to mention that the movie was made in the 80 's and early 80 's,not only does it look cheap but it is also a good movie to see if it
1,i have seen the original version of this film and i have seen the original version,i was n't expecting much of a film to watch it but i was pleasantly surprised by
1,cause it 's a movie that is n't even remotely entertaining it 's not a good film,cause the film was a little bit too slow and the story line is not very interesting it
1,to me it 's the worst movie ever made and it is,to be fair the movie was a bit of a disappointment

1,it is a shame because it 's not the best movie ever made,it 's not a bad movie but it 's a great film and i
1,finally i was able into the movie,finally the film 's plot and characters are
1,i was n't impressed with this movie,i have seen this movie several years and
1,but the movie is a little slow,but it 's a great movie
1,and the ending is a bit abrupt,and it is not the worst film i
1,there is a scene where the hero 's daughter is walking around the table talking about how she is supposed to look and acts as though it,there are a few moments of brilliance and the movie is a bit too long for the audience to follow but it is a good movie
1,the movie is about the same thing about the same old people who have been living in the past and the lives that are now,the film has a very interesting story and the characters and the characters are very believable and believable and it is very difficult for them
1,the movie was a waste of time,the film is about a group that is
1,we are supposed to believe that the film is not only the most expensive film ever made,we have a lot more of a story about a young woman who is trying to find her
1,i have to say i did not like the film,i was surprised that the film was n't released theatrically in
1,did n't you know that this was a good movie and i,did i forget that this was the worst movie ever made

1,the movie is about the power and the,the film has a very good cast
1,i have seen this movie several years and,i was n't impressed with this movie
1,like i mentioned above i have a feeling of disgust for the actors,like the other reviewers i have seen the movie and i think it 's

1,quaid 's character is a bit of an,quaid is the best in this film
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,so the film is a bit of,so i was expecting something more

1,the film is about the same subject as a book,the movie was a bit slow but i was n't sure
1,the movie is about the power of the human,the film has a very good story line
1,well the film was n't so much of an issue as the,well i do n't know what to say about this film
1,a lot of people are talking to the movie,a few of the scenes were filmed on the same
1,neither of these actors ever did anything like that,neither the characters nor any of them were any better
1,the film has some of the worst acting ever assembled,the movie is a complete waste of my time
1,and it 's a good movie to watch and,and the movie is a bit too slow
1,but it 's not a good movie and it 's not even worth the time,but the movie was n't so much a lot of it was just plain boring and
1,filmed in a very limited budget it 's a very low production and a very good one at that it,filmed on location in the late 18th century and the film is a bit too long for the story
1,since the film is about a young woman named seita who is a teenager and is the only,since i have seen the original version i have seen the movie version of the scarlet pimpernel
1,the film is a bit slow and boring but it 's a bit too long and it 's not even that,the movie was shot on a budget of about 50 minutes and it was n't even that good to watch

1,has the film makers been trying too hard,has a lot of problems with the film
1,it is not a film that is n't a comedy,it 's a very good film and a great one
1,that 's what makes this movie so good and so,that is the only thing i did not like about the
1,nobody seems interested in the plot,nobody is a big part in this
1,another problem is that it 's not even the same,another thing i noticed was that it was a little too
1,i have to admit that i was n't impressed by the film but it,i was surprised to find out that this movie is not a comedy
1,they 're not the only ones who,they are not even close enough
1,but it 's not the best of the bunch and it is n't,but the movie was a bit too slow for me and i did not

1,okay i have seen this movie and it 's not,okay so i was expecting something more like this
1,with the help from his friend he 's a bit too much for the part,with a supposed budget of about the movie it 's a little too low budget
1,i have to say i did not enjoy this,i was surprised that the film was made
1,big brother is the perfect guy for a movie,big fat greek people are not the only people in
1,it is not a movie for the,it 's a very funny movie

1,the film has a very good cast,the movie is about the power and the
1,in the first film the main characters were a bit different than they did in this one but it 's,in fact the only reason i gave this movie a 2 is because it is a very good movie
1,penn is the best actor ever,penn 's character is so unlikable and
1,others are the same as this,others have commented that this is a
1,spoiler ahead i have seen a lot of movies and i have to say that this is a very good film,spoiler alert the movie is a little bit slow and slow paced but the ending is so predictable and the ending that
1,the film has a lot to offer and the story line is very good,the movie is about a young woman named seita played by the great actor
1,if i were n't for the movie i would have been able to suspend disbelief and not just to watch the film again,if you 're looking for something to laugh about and enjoy watching the film then you will be disappointed by the fact that the
1,some people have commented that this is the worst movie i 've,some of them were so stupid they were just so stupid
1,my favorite part is when the girl gets a little girl to get a little bit of her head,my advice is to avoid it like the plague and you will not be able to watch it
1,as a result of the film it is not a film that is n't,as for me i was impressed by this movie and i think the director should
1,do not waste my time on it,do n't worry about the movie
1,with the exception of a couple of minor flaws the film is a complete mess of the original film,with a few twists and turns that are n't even remotely interesting i do not think that the director intended
1,in fact the film was a bit too long for me,in the first movie the main characters were a bit different than
1,the movie was a bit of a letdown,the film is about the struggle of a man
1,and it 's not a bad movie,and the movie was so boring

1,it 's not a movie that you will enjoy but it 's worth a watch,it is a shame that this movie is not only available in the us
1,even the most diehard fans of the genre should be advised that this is a film for,even though it is not the best movie ever it 's a great film to watch
1,how can a film like that be released on dvd,how could you possibly get a movie that is a complete
1,by far the best of the three is the one where a woman,by the time the movie ended it 's not even a movie

1,some of them were very funny and the movie is very funny and funny,some people have commented on this movie and the fact that they are all so
1,well the movie is a bit of an insult,well i guess it was a good idea
1,besides that it 's a very bad film and it 's not worth the time to watch,besides the fact the film was shot in the same year the film was made for a very
1,it is not a movie for everyone,it 's a very funny movie and i
1,if i had n't seen the original version i 'd probably have seen it in the theatre,if you want to watch something that is a little bit more interesting then you will probably enjoy
1,tina turner is a great actress,tina is the one that makes the
1,the film is about a group that has been kidnapped by the devil and is killed by,the movie was a waste of time and i do not recommend this film to any
1,this is a movie that is not a comedy,this movie was a complete disappointment to me
1,unfortunately the film 's biggest problem is,unfortunately it is not a movie
1,john wayne 's character was so unlikable and so annoying,john goodman is the only actor in the film who is
1,i was n't impressed by the fact that the film is so bad it 's good but it 's just not that bad,i have seen this film twice and it is one of the most beautiful movies ever made and it is a must see for
1,i was n't impressed by the fact it was n't the first movie to be released in the us,i have seen this film twice and i have to say that it was one of my favorite films of
1,walter brennan plays the role of a,walter matthau is the perfect actor
1,my advice to anyone interested in the movie 's success is the fact that it is a movie,my favorite scene is when a woman is stabbed in a car and the camera is shot
1,seeing this movie is like watching a movie with a bunch and lots of people getting together and then,seeing the film was like a real life story and i think it 's the best movie ever
1,one of the most interesting things in the movie was that the characters were not believable and,one thing i did n't know was the fact that the movie was a complete mess
1,i was surprised that this film did not get released theatrically,i have to say that i was n't impressed with this film
1,its not even that good and it is not even that good to,its a shame that the movie has n't been released on dvd

1,i was surprised to find out the film is n't a comedy,i have to admit that i have seen this movie twice
1,problematic and interesting but the movie is a bit too long,problematic to see the movie is about the evils and how the
1,there is a lot of violence in this movie,there are a lot more to the film
1,any movie with the director 's name is not a complete mess,any of the characters in the film were a little bit of an
1,if i were to give it a zero rating it would be a zero,if you 're a fan of horror movies and you want to watch a good
1,kelly is the only one to get the chance of being able to get the money to make the movie,kelly 's character was so annoying that it could have easily been played out like a little bit of an hour
1,when the movie was over and the ending i was n't expecting much from the film,when i first saw this movie on the shelf it looked like a bad movie
1,sadly the film 's only redeeming quality,sadly it is not the same
1,her character is so annoying and so stupid that it makes you feel sorry about,her performance in this film is very good and she is a great actress
1,mike binder is the best of the,mike myers was a great actor
1,groucho 's character is the only one that has a shred,groucho is the best actor ever to grace the silver
1,okay so i do n't think that this is a good movie,okay i have to admit that the movie is very bad but i
1,plot is n't bad but it is not a good one,plot holes are the only redeeming qualities of this film
1,there are a few good scenes in this movie,there is a scene in which a woman 's character
1,and it is not the best movie i have,and the ending is a little too abrupt
1,this is a very good movie,this movie was so awful it 's
1,if you 're looking for a movie to watch and enjoy the first,if i were n't for a good movie it was a waste
1,like the other reviewers here i was n't expecting much from this film,like i mentioned above the film is a bit slow and boring
1,you can see that this movie was made in a very low class,you know that the movie is a little bit too long for the story
1,why did n't he just go to the police station to retrieve the bank,why is this movie rated r for the graphic nudity and profanity and profanity and
1,this movie was a waste for the first two hours and it,this is a movie for everyone who wants to be entertained
1,it 's a shame that this movie is not only a movie for those,it is not the best movie i 've seen in my entire career
1,imagine a film that is not only a visual masterpiece,imagine the movie is about a young man who has a
1,there are a few moments of brilliance in this film,there is a scene where the hero is trying his hand
1,amid a few scenes that are n't even remotely funny or,amid the first two thirds the movie is pretty good
1,with a supposed budget the best thing about it is the fact that it 's not a bad movie but it 's not bad,with the help from the local sheriff who is a little more of an obstacle than a lot more than the sum it 's the
1,when i saw the movie on the shelf i was excited,when the film was over i had a good laugh
1,it is a very good movie and i think that it,it 's not even the best of all the movies
1,i was n't impressed by this movie,i have seen this film several years and
1,the film is a complete waste of my life and i do n't know what,the movie was shot in a small town in the middle of the night
1,one of the best movies i have seen,one thing i liked was that it was a
1,she is the only person who has to be a woman,she 's a little too much of a whore but the movie
1,nothing really happened and it was a very good movie,nothing is ever explained and it 's not a good movie
1,despite the obvious plot holes the movie is not a complete waste of film,despite being a fan i still have to say this movie was very good and
1,a lot more of a movie than a lot of other films,a few years later the movie was made and it was a little
1,anyway the film is not as bad but the story is n't that good either,anyway i was surprised to find that the movie was not as good as the original
1,the film has a very interesting plot but the story is so weak that it becomes almost impossible for,the movie is about the same subject as the first movie and it was a bit too much
1,also the film is very good and the story line is very good,also i do not think that the movie is a masterpiece of art and
1,joseph gordonlevitt plays a very likable character,joseph cotten is a fine actor and he
1,but it 's not the worst film ever,but the movie was a little too long
1,he is a very good actor and he 's a great actor,he 's not the only actor who is n't the only one to
1,this is the worst film ever,this movie is not for everyone
1,well the movie is n't bad but it 's not that bad,well i guess it 's not a good film but it is not
1,not only does it have to have been made to make,not to mention that it 's a very good movie
1,while the movie was n't as bad as i expected it was a very good film,while i do n't think the movie was intended as an adaptation it was very good and
1,it is a very funny movie,it 's not even a good film
1,reduces the viewer to a very good movie and the film 's message of life is to make a good film and the film is not for,reduces to the other comments i have read about the movie and i have to agree with the other comment that the film was very good
1,definitely not a movie for kids but for those of you who are,definitely a must for anyone who likes to laugh at the tv
1,as a result of this film the film is,as for me i have seen the film
1,and the movie is a bit of,and it 's a good movie
1,thank you for letting the movie down,thank god for this movie and the movie
1,well i do not think this movie was made for tv but i,well the film is a bit slow but the acting is superb
1,i have to admit that i was very disappointed with the movie and i did n't,i was surprised to find out that the film was made for the sole purpose
1,so i guess it 's not that i do n't know the exact story of the film but i do n't think it is,so the movie is about a group of young men who have been living on the island for a night and their parents
1,i have seen this film twice and it 's not even worth the time to watch it,i was n't impressed by the fact that it was made for television and it 's a little
1,one of my favorites was that the movie was made for tv,one thing that i did n't really understand is how the movie is
1,maybe the movie was n't a complete waste of money,maybe it 's because i do n't think it 's the
1,not only does it have to have been a little over,not to mention that it 's a very bad film
1,men and women are the only ones who are willing to be able,men are n't always the best of them but the film is not a
1,little did they get the chance to see it in the,little britain is a film that will appeal to everyone
1,when i first saw the trailer for the movie i was expecting a good film,when the movie was released i was expecting a good film but it did n't work
1,otherwise the film was a bit slow,otherwise it is a good movie
1,the film has some good points and is very well acted and well acted,the movie is a bit of a bore but the acting is so good it
1,for the first half of this movie i was n't expecting much from it,for a film that was a bit too much of an oddity it was very
1,since the film was made for tv i was surprised that the film was made in the first place,since i have n't read the book it was the first movie that was based upon a book
1,this is a very bad film and it 's a shame that it is not available,this movie was so bad it was good to watch and it was a waste
1,the movie was a waste for me and i was n't expecting much from this film,the film is about a young woman who has a crush on a woman who is in
1,i have seen this movie several years and,i was n't impressed with this movie
1,too bad the film is so poorly done,too many people have to be killed
1,the movie was shot on location in a small town,the film is a bit of an action movie
1,this is a very good film and it 's a shame that the movie is n't as,this movie was so awful that i could not believe that it would be so awful
1,i was surprised that the film did n't have to rely,i have to say i did n't enjoy this movie
1,only the first half of the movie is a bit slow,only a few minutes of this movie would be a waste of
1,it is not a movie for everyone but it 's a good film to see,it 's a very funny movie and it is n't a total waste of time and
1,as a matter the film is not a complete failure,as for the rest i was surprised that this movie is
1,they 's character is the only reason to see the,they is the best of all the columbo movies
1,out of all the movies i have ever watched this one was a waste of time and,out there the film is not a bad movie but a good movie to be avoided
1,synopsis of the film is a very,synopsis is the best movie ever
1,soon after the first five years i saw the movie i was looking forward at my own eyes,soon the movie begins and ends with the final confrontation between a man and a woman in the woods
1,lane 's character is so stupid that i could n't even care less,lane is the best actor in this movie and it 's not that he
1,ted is a good guy who is a bit too much of an,ted danson plays the part with the best performance in the movie
1,he 's not the only one who,he is a very good character
1,nikki 's performance in this film was so good that i could not believe it,nikki is a very good character and she is very likable in her portrayal of the
1,there are some very funny scenes in this film,there is no real plot to be found in the
1,equally good are the scenes with the two men,equally the film 's plot is very simple
1,if you 're a diehard fan of horror movies you will love this movie,if i were to rate it lower than it deserves it would have been better
1,i was n't impressed by the fact it 's not the worst film i 've seen in a while but,i have seen this film twice and i still have to say it was one of my favorite movies
1,sometimes it 's not a good movie,sometimes the movie is n't as good as
1,it 's not even a movie,it is a very funny film and
1,how could it be that the movie is a bit of a mess,how can you go to the cinema to see this film and if it
1,based upon the book the film was written by the same author and the same director who made a film about a serial killer who,based on a true story of the famous author of the famous novel the film follows a group of people in a remote village
1,the film has some good moments but the story,the movie is a bit slow and boring
1,you can see the director mateo and his wife and they are all very good,you know that it is a good idea to have a movie that 's not so
1,however i was surprised to find out the film was made for tv,however the movie is not as good as the original but it is a
1,the movie was a bit of an attempt to capitalize upon the book,the film is about the struggle between a group of people and their own
1,the movie was a bit slow but i did not think it would have made much of an impact,the film is about the same subject as the first one and the first one is a bit too long
1,however the movie is not a good movie and it 's not even that bad it is just bad,however i was surprised to see that this was the first movie that i saw in the theater
1,vh1 is a very good movie and it 's not just that it is n't,vh1 has done a good job of making a movie that is n't a complete waste
1,i was surprised that the movie did n't have,i have to say i was very disappointed
1,when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be a good movie,when the movie is about to end you can tell that it 's not a bad
1,it is not the worst movie i have seen but it is,it 's a shame because it is a very good film
1,and it is not a good movie to watch but,and the ending is so bad it 's good
1,by far the best of the three is the one where a woman,by the time the movie ended it 's not even a movie
1,american graffiti was a great film for the time,american pie is one that i would recommend for anybody
1,let 's face it the movie has,let me tell the same story
1,if i were n't for the movie i 'd have been a bit more surprised,if you 're looking for something to laugh at in a theater then this is a
1,the movie was a bit of an action movie but the story was so,the film is about the struggle between the characters of the two protagonists
1,if you 're a diehard horror fan you will love it and,if i were to rate this film higher than i would
1,alison 's father is the only one who has a crush in the end and he 's not even the most likable character,alison is a great actress and i think that the actress playing her character was very good and the acting is good
1,even the actors who are n't good actors were good and the movie was a bit slow at first,even though the film was a bit slow it did n't have to do much to irritate the viewer
1,arriving at a local bar and the two of the girls go to the police,arriving in the middle east and a few other things are happening to them
1,i have to say i was n't impressed by,i was surprised that the movie was made

1,but it is not the worst movie ever,but the film is a little slow and the
1,the movie is about a young man named benjamin and the woman in a mental institution,the film has a lot to do with the plot and the acting is pretty bad but
1,the movie was shot in a very,the film is a complete waste
1,there are a few moments that are funny but the movie is just,there is a scene where a man is stabbed by the car
1,i was n't expecting a lot of,i have seen the movie twice
1,in fact it 's a shame that the film is not available in dvd format or dvd,in the end the film is not as bad but it is n't as bad as the original
1,although the film is not as bad it is still a very good movie,although i have n't seen it in a long time it 's not a great
1,those who are n't familiar with the genre will probably find this movie lacking,those are the things that made me mad and the movie is a bit of
1,some of the acting is good and the story is a bit too predictable for,some people say that the movie is so good that it 's not funny
1,one of my favorite films of the last ten or so years,one thing that really annoyed the movie was the fact it 's not

1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i have seen this film twice
1,she 's not a bad guy but she 's not a bad actress and it 's just,she is a great actress and i have to say i was impressed by her acting

1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,the movie was shot on a budget that was filmed on location in a,the film is a bit slow and the story is n't that interesting
1,those who are n't familiar with this movie will probably find this film,those are the things that made this film a little too long

1,the film has some of its most,the movie is a complete mess
1,i was surprised that this movie did not get a wider release,i have to say that this is a great movie and it 's
1,and the ending is so stupid and so lame that it is hard for anyone,and it is not a movie that you will never see again and again
1,in fact the only reason i watched this film is that the director and writer have a very small screen time and the actors were so bad,in the first film the main character 's character is a little bit of an idiot who has a crush on his own and his family
1,over the course the film has a very interesting and very very interesting story and some,over all i would say that the film was a bit too long for me
1,the film has some of its most,the movie is a complete mess
1,the movie was a waste of time and money,the film is about a group that has a very
1,you know that it 's a good thing to,you can see the movie in the theater
1,he is a great director and he is very talented,he 's not a bad actor but he is n't as
1,if i were n't so irritated i 'd have to be the only person who could have done a better film,if you 're looking to be a fan and you have a yen for a movie that 's a bit too much

1,fight club is a very good film,fight scenes were the only thing i could
1,but it 's a great film and it 's a great film to,but the movie is a bit too slow for the most part
1,mexican horror films are not the best but they are all very entertaining and entertaining,mexican cinema has been done by a director who is a master of the genre
1,my favorite part is when a man is stabbed in the,my advice is to avoid this movie at all cost
1,story line is about the only way to,story is a bit of a mess
1,originally the movie was released on dvd and was made in the uk,originally i was n't expecting a movie that was so bad it was funny
1,watching this movie is like watching an old tv,watching the film is like a bad movie
1,since the film is about a young woman named seita who is a teenager she is attracted,since i have seen the original version i have seen the movie version of this film

1,you can see the director mateo 's character in a way,you know that it is a bad film but it 's not

1,the film is about the same thing about a,the movie was a bit slow and boring
1,his performance in this film was so bad i could n't believe that he was actually a part of this film,his character is a little too unlikable to be a sympathetic character but the film does n't seem very interesting
1,i was n't expecting much of this movie to be so bad,i have seen the original version and it is very good and i
1,well the movie is a little slow but it is a great movie to watch,well i guess it was n't the best of the series but i was expecting something

1,marlene dietrich is the only reason i can,marlene rhames plays a very good character
1,this is the worst film i 've ever seen,this movie is not for the faint hearted
1,after a while the film becomes a little too much to bear and it,after the movie i was n't sure if i was watching the movie
1,it 's not a movie for everyone,it is a shame that the movie has
1,at the same time the movie is about a,at least the film was n't so bad
1,che 's character was so stupid that it,che is the only one to die
1,it is not the best film ever but it is a great movie that,it 's a shame that the movie is so much better than this
1,women in tights are the only reason,women are not always the best
1,the movie was shot on location and it 's not a good movie to watch but,the film is a bit of a bore but it is a very good film

1,it 's not even a good movie,it is a very funny movie and i
1,throughout the movie i was a little skeptical of,throughout this film i felt like a movie
1,i was surprised that this movie did not have the chance of,i have to say that this is a very good movie
1,that is the only reason why this film,that 's what makes it so good
1,it is a very good film and i would recommend this film to anyone,it 's not even the worst movie ever made but it 's still pretty good

1,i have to say that this is a great movie and it is a must see for everyone who loves movies,i was surprised that this movie did not get a wider release in my book and i would n't be surprised that
1,it 's a very funny movie and it 's a great film to watch,it is not a movie for everyone but if it is a comedy you 'll
1,it 's not even the worst movie ever,it is a very good film and i recommend
1,it is not the best film ever but it is still very entertaining,it 's a shame that the movie is so much more than a comedy
1,as for the acting it was n't bad but the story was pretty bad and the actors did a good,as a matter of view i was surprised to find that this film was made for the sole purpose
1,the film has a very good story and the acting is excellent and it,the movie is about the power of a young woman and her life
1,i was surprised to see that the movie was a little,i have to admit i did not enjoy the movie
1,they 're all very funny and funny and the movie has a great cast and it is very,they are all in the movie and they 're not even close to being a good one

1,campy horror film about the evils and the consequences,campy and not funny at the same time
1,superman 's character was so bad it 's almost impossible for,superman is the most interesting and most of his films
1,this is a movie for those who like to see a good film with a good story and,this movie was a waste of my life and i ca all about it being so awful
1,idle to say the least the film was made for the sake that it was made for the screen and the director 's cut,idle and the movie has a lot of good moments and a good cast but it 's a bit too much to be expected
1,in fact the only reason i gave it 2 out of ten is the score by john frankenheimer and the music by ennio morricone,in the first film the main characters are the same people who have been killed by the devil and they have a very different story
1,we have to be a little bit of an observer to the story of,we are not supposed for a movie that is so boring and boring
1,so the film is not as good and as the,so i was expecting a lot of the same
1,take the time and money to watch this movie and you will see,take a few seconds of the movie you will get the idea
1,the movie was shot on a budget of 1,the film is a bit slow and boring
1,i was n't impressed with the movie,i have seen this movie twice
1,all the actors were great and i was surprised to find out that the film was made in a time where it is,all in the family is a great show and it 's a great family movie that will keep you watching and enjoy
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,as for me i have seen a few movies that have made a lot more sense,as a result of this film 's success it 's a very difficult task to see this
1,with a supposed budget the only saving grace is that it is not a movie,with the help from the police the film has a lot more to do
1,the movie is about the same subject matter as the first movie,the film has a very interesting plot and a great story
1,this is the worst film i 've ever had the misfortune of watching,this movie is not for the faint hearted or for the diehard diehard fans
1,the movie is about a young man who has a crush in,the film has a lot to do but it is n't
1,i have seen this movie several years ago,i was n't impressed with this movie but i
1,as for me it was a great movie and it 's,as a result the film has a lot of potential
1,starts off with a bang and a few minutes later a few of,starts with a bang and then the movie turns into a nightmare
1,oh and the music was a bit cheesy,oh yeah and the ending is so bad
1,so the movie was a waste,so i guess i was n't expecting
1,the movie was shot on location in the early seventies and the film is,the film is a bit of an exercise into a very bad film
1,this is the first movie that i,this movie is a complete waste
1,the film has some of the worst dialogue ever,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,then there 's a scene where a guy gets shot in a lake,then the film switches to the end of the movie and we are left
1,this movie is not a bad movie,this is the worst movie ever
1,the movie was a waste of time and i do not know how it got a dvd copy of the,the film is about a group that has been kidnapped by a group that is a little too much
1,there is no real reason to see this movie,there are some very good moments and some good ones
1,this is a movie for everyone who loves the genre and the movie,this movie was a waste for the whole movie and i think that the
1,i was surprised that this film was made in the first ten min,i have to say that i have n't seen this film in years and
1,the film has a lot of action in the background,the movie is about a group that is trying too hard
1,whether it is the fact of it 's a good or bad movie or not,whether or not you can find a movie about a movie that is so bad it
1,so i guess it was n't the first movie i,so the movie is a bit of an insult
1,i was n't expecting a lot of,i have seen the movie twice
1,remember that the film was shot on a low,remember the first time you see the movie
1,first of all i was a bit skeptical about this film,first off i was n't expecting much of this film
1,this movie was so awful it was funny,this is a very good movie and it is
1,rosanna clarkson is the only reason i have to give this film any higher stars,rosanna arquette plays a young woman in the film who has a crush on her and
1,most of them were not even funny,most people have commented that this is the
1,i was surprised to find out the film was made for the sole reason that it was a little too much,i have to admit that i have seen a few of the movies that are made to be good and i have
1,picard 's character was a little bit of an idiot but the,picard is the only person who has a shred to him
1,nothing is explained in this film that is n't even remotely,nothing really happens and the film is not as good
1,the film has a very good cast and the story line was good,the movie is about the power and soul that is being made in a
1,documentary has been released in a very,documentary is a very interesting film
1,johnny depp plays the part with the best performance of the film and he 's not only the best of the bunch,johnny knoxville is a good actor but he is not convincing as the villain he is in the movie and the movie is
1,richie 's character is so annoying and so annoying that i could n't even,richie is the one who is the most beautiful woman in this film
1,but the film is a bit slow,but it is not the best movie ever
1,secondly it is a very bad movie and it 's a shame that it is not available in the uk,secondly the film 's main character 's character was the most irritating and annoying character i have ever seen
1,like i said the acting is horrible the plot was awful the characters are stupid the story was boring,like the first movie i thought the movie had a good story and some great actors but it was n't
1,during a time of crisis the film settles into a very ordinary and very interesting film,during the movie you see the same thing as a lot of people have said
1,ultimately the movie has some of its moments,ultimately it 's a very good movie and it
1,i have seen this movie several times,i was n't impressed with this film
1,i was n't expecting much of this movie to be a good movie,i have seen the original version and it is very faithful to this
1,the film has some good moments and some good performances,the movie is a bit slow but the acting is good
1,that 's what i got from the movie,that is the best part in this film and
1,technically the movie was n't as bad as the original but it was still a good one,technically it 's a good movie to see if you 're looking to see a movie that will
1,johnny depp plays the role of the father who has,johnny knoxville is a great choice for this movie
1,this is a very good film and it is a great movie,this movie was so awful that i could n't help but feel embarrassed
1,i was n't impressed with the film,i have seen this movie twice and it
1,there are some good scenes and some good acting but the movie is just too boring,there is no reason to watch this film unless you are an avid jew fan
1,and the movie is so bad that i ca n't believe that this is,and it 's a shame because it 's not even a good film
1,boot of a nation is a film about the power of war and the struggle between two men and the one that,boot is a very interesting movie that is a must for anyone interested with a good story and a good story
1,i have seen the movie and i have seen it several times and it is still very funny,i was n't expecting a movie about a man and his son but the story was so bad it
1,seidl 's film has been released on video and is now released on video for sale,seidl is a master of his craft and his work is a very good one and a
1,really the only reason why i gave it a 1 is because it was a bit of an hour long,really it 's a movie about the evils and the consequences that the characters are so common to the characters and
1,in fact the only reason i gave this film a 1 is because of its lack,in the first film the main characters were the ones who had the same problem
1,charlie is the one that makes the film a little more interesting than,charlie 's angels are the only reason why the film was made
1,in fact the film is a bit slow and the story line was,in the first movie he is the one that makes the movie
1,i have to admit i was very disappointed,i was surprised to see this movie
1,they are not the same as they are,they 're not even close enough to be a
1,codirector john carpenter 's film has a lot of fun,codirector and director of the film are the same people who
1,actually it is n't that good but the acting was good,actually the movie is a bit slow but the story line was
1,the movie is about the same subject matter and it is about the,the film has a very interesting plot and the acting is superb

1,mainly because the movie is so bad it 's funny,mainly the film is not a comedy it is a drama
1,i have to admit i did n't enjoy the film,i was surprised to see that this was a very good
1,this movie was so bad that i could not believe that i had wasted my,this is a very bad movie and i do n't know what to do

1,his performance is a little stiff and he is not convincing as,his character was so stupid and the acting was so wooden
1,if you want to watch a film about a group that has a lot to say,if i had n't seen it i would 've had a refund for the movie
1,or the fact it was a remake,or maybe the director was n't going to
1,and it is not the best movie ever,and the ending is a little too long
1,sure it is not a movie,sure the movie is n't as good
1,the film is a complete mess,the movie was shot in the early
1,one of the most interesting films of all times and the best one,one thing i did n't like about this movie was the fact that it

1,bulworth 's story of the man who is a little too old to be a good guy and his wife who is a bit,bulworth is a very funny movie that i can recommend to everyone who loves the book and the book is a great book
1,although the movie is a little bit slow moving the plot was n't too bad,although i do not know what to say about this film it 's not that good

1,i was surprised that the movie was n't so,i have to say i was n't disappointed
1,with a few twists and turns and a few moments that are n't really worth watching,with the exception of a couple who are not the only one to get the money they
1,it 's not even a good movie but a very funny movie and a great movie to watch,it is a very funny movie and it 's a shame that the film has been released in dvd
1,signe is a very talented actress and i think that the movie is very well made,signe 's performance was a little overdone but the story was so bad that it was hard
1,although the film is a little slow at times it is a bit slow moving,although i have n't read the novel i have read a few of his other comments
1,in the first film the main characters were a bit of a clich,in fact the only reason i gave this movie a 1 instead of 1
1,the film is about a group of young people,the movie was a waste of my time
1,it is a very funny movie and i,it 's not even a good movie
1,this movie was so awful that i could n't even laugh,this is a very good film and it is not a movie
1,we have a very good movie about a man who is,we are supposed for the characters to develop their characters
1,well the movie was n't that bad,well i guess i was n't going for
1,follow the fleet of a new england city and the us government and the us government and their families,follow a group that is supposed to have been the one to kill a man in a small village in
1,naturally the film has no redeeming qualities,naturally it is a very poor film
1,there is a lot of violence and nudity,there are a lot more to be made than

1,the movie is a bit slow but the story is very,the film has some good moments and some nice touches
1,from the beginning i was surprised that this movie was made in a time when,from a technical standpoint it 's not a good film but it is not
1,take a few seconds to get it on the,take the time and place of the movie
1,i was surprised to find that the movie was not a complete disaster,i have to admit that the film was very good and the acting is
1,heck i have to admit i was n't disappointed by this film but it was n't,heck it 's not a bad film but it 's not a bad movie either
1,the movie is about the power of a man who has been a loner and is,the film has a very good story and a great cast and a good cast
1,so the movie is about the same guy that was killed in the beginning,so i guess it 's a movie that is n't even remotely entertaining
1,this movie was so bad it 's,this is a very bad film
1,they are all very good and the movie is very entertaining,they 're all in a bad movie and it 's not a
1,that 's the only reason why i gave it a 2 instead of a 0,that is what makes it so great and it is the most important thing in history
1,despite being the most controversial film i 've seen this is one of the most beautiful films i 've seen,despite the fact that the movie was made in the us it 's still a good movie to watch
1,the film has a very good cast,the movie is about the power and the
1,the film is a complete mess of the first film and it 's not a bad movie,the movie was shot in the same location and it was shot on a budget that looks so
1,cut to a few scenes where a man is killed by the police officer,cut off the film is a very funny film that is n't even worth renting
1,it 's a very good film and it is a shame to watch it again and again,it is not a film that is not a complete waste of time and a waste
1,the film has some good points but the rest is just plain bad,the movie is a bit of an action movie but the acting is pretty
1,i was n't impressed with the film and the acting was so poor,i have seen this movie twice and i have never been a fan of
1,it 's not a bad film but it 's not bad,it is a shame because the film was shot on location
1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,but it 's a good movie,but the movie is not as bad
1,people who have seen this film know that they,people are n't going for the same thing
1,at the same moment the movie is a bit slow,at least the movie is a little too much
1,to be honest i was n't expecting much of this movie to,to me this was the best of all the blackadder movies
1,yes the film was a bit too long but the story was very good,yes it 's a little slow but the movie is n't as bad
1,the movie was shot on location in the middle of the night and the,the film is a bit of an exercise in a long lost city
1,i was surprised to find out the film is a remake of,i have to admit that i have seen this film twice
1,the movie is a bit slow and boring but the acting and the acting is so bad that it makes you wonder,the film has some good moments but the rest of the movie just does not make up a good story line
1,the film is a bit slow and the story is n't that bad,the movie was shot on a budget that was filmed on location
1,there is a lot to be said but the film is a bit slow,there are a lot of things to criticize about the film but the film is
1,if i were n't so irritated i 'd be able to suspend disbelief,if you 're looking to be a fan of this movie you will love
1,but it 's a good thing to see this,but the movie is not a good one
1,it 's not a movie that you can see in a theater,it is a shame that this movie has n't received a wide audience
1,nothing is ever explained in this movie,nothing really happened and i did not even
1,the movie is a complete mess of the first film and it 's not a bad movie but the acting was,the film has some of its moments but the story is so predictable and so predictable it 's almost unbelievable
1,older viewers might find this movie boring and boring and not funny,older than the original film the film was made in a hurry
1,they are not even close to the original,they 're not the only one to be killed
1,also i think that the movie is a little too long for the story,also the movie was shot on a low budget and the actors were n't really
1,but the film 's main problem is the lack of a coherent story,but it is a good movie and a great movie to see
1,i was surprised that the film was n't so much more than a comedy but the fact that the movie was made,i have to say i did not like this movie but it is one of the best movies i have seen
1,due to a lack in a movie i was expecting a good movie,due for the first time in a while the movie was made and it
1,i'm not a big fan but i have to say that i was very disappointed,i'm a fan and have seen a few movies in the last couple years
1,jeff bridges is the perfect choice to be the hero,jeff goldblum plays the role as a cocky and cynical character
1,ther is a very good performance by the young actress,ther 's the fact of this film is the acting
1,arriving in a car accident and a mysterious old man 's life is revealed to have been a big hit in a small colorado village,arriving at the end the film is about as good as it is in the first film and the third is a very good one but
1,talk of a woman who has been,talk about the movie 's shortcomings
1,besides the fact the movie is set up in a very short time the,besides that it 's not even a movie it is just plain stupid
1,not only is it not a good movie,not to say the movie was bad
1,at least the movie is a little bit too long,at the same moment the movie is about a man named
1,sorry to say that i was n't impressed by this movie,sorry but this movie is a complete mess of a film that
1,it is a very funny film and,it 's not even a movie
1,a few of them are not so much a little bit more,a lot of the scenes are shot in the wrong way
1,my advice is that if your a fan and you 're a diehard fan of the original you will love this movie and you will enjoy it,my favorite part of this movie is when the guy is trying to kill her and she says that she is the only one that knows how she
1,see it for the first time,see this movie if it is available
1,spoiler alert the film has some nice twists and,spoiler ahead i was n't expecting a lot
1,the movie is about a group of young men in the same neighborhood who have a reunion with their friends,the film has a lot of potential and it 's a shame that it is n't available on dvd
1,this is a movie for everyone,this movie was a waste for me
1,well the movie is n't that bad but it is n't,well i guess it 's a bit of an insult
1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,my favorite scene was the one where he is walking through a window and the camera cuts to,my advice to the director of the movie is that the movie has a lot to do
1,the film is about a young man who is sent into a world of,the movie was a waste for the movie and it was a waste
1,however i do not recommend this movie,however the film is a little slow and
1,the film is a bit of a mess,the movie was shot on location and the camera
1,i'm not sure what the point of this film was but i was,i'm a big big fan and this movie is a perfect example
1,while i was n't impressed by this movie it 's a great film,while the film was a little slow at times it seemed to drag the
1,as a matter the movie was made in a hurry to be released in the us,as for the rest of the cast i think the script is a little weak but it
1,ulysses is the best actor ever to grace a camera,ulysses 's character is the only one that is able
1,why is it so bad that it is,why did they make such a movie
1,but it is a good movie and a great movie,but the film 's main problem is the lack of any
1,having said all that it was n't a bad film but,having seen the movie i was impressed with this film
1,the film is a complete waste of my time and i do not know if it was the same thing as the first one,the movie was shot in a small town and the actors were all very well done and the actors did an amazing performance in their
1,i have seen the movie twice,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,this is a very good film and it 's a shame because the movie was a,this movie was so awful that i could not believe that i wasted watching it
1,also the movie was shot on location in the early seventies,also i think that the movie was made in a hurry to
1,maybe the movie was n't that bad,maybe it 's because i have seen it
1,even the actors who are n't good are good and i think that the director was,even though the film was a bit long it was still a very enjoyable movie
1,with the exception of a couple who have a very good time and the fact of that it is not a good idea to be a movie,with a few twists and turns and some of the best scenes of the movie i found the story to have a lot to offer and the characters
1,they are all in the movie and the,they 're all very funny and funny
1,but the film 's main problem with,but it is a good movie
1,no one is a fan of the original,no matter what you do n't want you
1,but it is a good film,but the film 's main flaw was
1,i'm not sure what the point was,i'm a big big fan and i have
1,through a few years i 've seen the movie and i have,through the whole movie i was wondering what the point was
1,this movie was a waste for the whole movie,this is a movie for everyone who loves the book
1,a few years later i saw this film on tv and i,a lot more of the film 's plot and the characters
1,but it is a good film,but the film 's main flaw was
1,i was n't impressed by this movie,i have seen this film several years and
1,i have to say that i have n't read,i was surprised that this film was made
1,it is a shame because the film is so bad that it is n't even worth,it 's not a bad film but the acting and the direction are all good
1,its a shame because the film was,its not even a good movie
1,however the movie is not a good one either as a film it is a very good film and a very enjoyable film,however i was surprised to see that the film was made in the us and it 's a shame because it is a film
1,oh yeah and the movie is n't bad,oh and the music is a bit cheesy but
1,this is the first film i have ever walked across and i 've,this movie is a must for anyone who likes a good film

1,there is a lot of violence and violence in this movie but it is n't,there are a lot more to be said than the movie itself but it is not
1,the film is a bit slow and boring,the movie was shot on a budget of 1
1,back in those years of this film i had a hard day believing it was a comedy and it was n't even funny to me,back then i was a little skeptical when i saw this movie and i thought i 'd give a good review of the movie and the
1,i was surprised to see that this was a very low budget movie but it 's a,i have to admit i did n't enjoy the film but it was a great movie
1,this movie is a complete mess of a film that has been released in the uk,this is the first movie i have seen that i have seen in a long time and
1,the movie is a bit slow but it is n't,the film has some good moments and the acting is good
1,then the film is over and you get the idea,then there 's the scene where the killer is killed by
1,usually i do n't like this movie,usually the movie has a lot to offer
1,the movie was a bit slow and boring but i was n't bored,the film is about the same thing about the same subject as the other
1,when i first heard of it on the big screen it was a very interesting movie,when the movie is over and over the top and the actors seem to be having a
1,it 's not a movie for everyone,it is a shame that the movie has
1,it 's a shame because it 's a great film,it is not the worst movie ever but it 's not
1,i have to admit i did n't like this movie but it is a great movie,i was surprised to see that this movie is not available on dvd or dvd release of
1,many of us have been in a coma,many people have said this is a great movie
1,i have seen this movie twice and it,i was n't impressed with the film
1,i'm not a fan but i have a feeling that the film was made for tv,i'm a fan of the genre but this one was just plain bad and i was bored
1,quite frankly i would n't recommend it,quite possibly one thing that i would like
1,a few of them were very funny,a lot of the film 's humor and
1,i was n't expecting a movie to be a horror movie but i was expecting a good horror movie,i have seen the movie and it is a very accurate experience to be made in the first few years
1,in fact the film was shot in a very cheap manner,in the first movie the characters were very different and they had
1,rififi is a very good film and it is one that you should watch,rififi was the first film i saw and it was a great movie to see
1,he 's a very good actor and he 's a great director and a good director,he is the most talented character of all times and is a very good character
1,the film is a bit of a mess but it 's a good movie to watch and enjoy and,the movie was shot on location and the acting is pretty bad but it 's a good film
1,this movie is not a good movie but a good one to watch and,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen in a movie theater
1,but the movie was n't so bad it 's funny it 's just bad and,but it 's not a good film and it is not a bad film
1,and the ending was a little unsatisfying and i was n't expecting much,and it is a shame that the film is n't as bad
1,most people have seen the film and i think that it is the worst film i have seen,most of them are not funny and the story is not as good as the original but it 's
1,character development is the key to the film,character actor john goodman is a good choice to
1,outsiders are the only people who can act and,outsiders have a good time making the film
1,if you 're looking for something that 's not funny or even remotely funny then you 're not missing something but,if i were n't for the first time id would have been a bit confused and annoyed by this film
1,i'm not a big big horror fan but i have,i'm a fan and i have seen the original
1,i was n't impressed with this film but it is a good film to watch and enjoy,i have seen this movie several times and i still have to say it is a great film
1,a few years later i saw this film on tv,a lot more of the film 's plot and the acting
1,finally i have seen the movie and i can safely recommend,finally the movie is about the man and his son
1,also i do n't know what the point of this movie was to be a spoiler but it was a very enjoyable movie,also the film has a lot of good moments and it 's a shame to watch it again and still enjoy it for what
1,well the film is a little slow but it is a good film,well i do not think that the film was made for tv
1,in fact it is not a bad movie but a,in the end it 's not a good movie
1,this movie is not for the squeamish,this is the worst film i have seen
1,there is no real plot to be found in the,there are some very funny scenes in this film
1,yeah it 's a good movie but it 's just not a good movie and it is n't,yeah i do concede the film was a little too much for the kids but the film was n't
1,even the actors who are so bad they 're good and i have seen them all the time,even though the film was made for the sake it was a little too long for me to really
1,in fact the only reason why i gave it a,in the first film the characters were very believable
1,spoiler alert i was n't expecting a lot of the film but it 's a good film,spoiler ahead the film has some good moments and the acting was good but the script was n't
1,lucy 's character was a little bit of an actress but she was very good,lucy is the only person who has a crush on him and she is not the
1,it 's not even the best movie,it is a very good movie
1,for a film about a young man who has a heart,for the first time i saw this film on tv
1,power rangers are a bunch and they,power is a very good film
1,rent it if it is on the tube or,rent this film and you will be hooked
1,i have to say i was very impressed by this movie,i was surprised that the movie did not get released in theaters
1,i was n't expecting much from this,i have seen the original movie
1,while the film is a little bit of an action film it is a very,while i was not impressed by the story it 's a bit too slow
1,it is not the best movie i have ever seen,it 's a shame that this movie has not received any
1,another thing i noticed is the way that the movie was shot,another problem is that the film is not as bad as it should
1,terrible movie that was made in a hurry,terrible acting and a plot line that makes no
1,on the plus side it 's not even that bad it is a very good movie and,on a technical note the acting is pretty good and the story is a little weak
1,either the director is trying to be a little more serious or just not a comedy,either way the movie was so bad it 's good i just could n't believe it was
1,the movie was a waste for me,the film is about a young woman named
1,why did they make such a bad film,why is it so bad that the movie has
1,soft porn is the best thing in,soft core porn is a rarity
1,is it a comedy or is he a murderer or,is this the best way to describe this film
1,ben stiller plays the part with a lot of charisma,ben affleck is the perfect choice to play a role in
1,how can a film like that be made in the first ten years or a film,how could you possibly get a movie with a budget that was so bad that it would
1,the movie was a bit of a letdown,the film is about the struggle of a man
1,for a film about the evils of war the movie focuses on a young man named,for the first time in a while the film is a bit of a letdown
1,this movie was so bad that i was n't laughing,this is a very bad movie and it 's not even
1,when i saw the movie i thought that the movie would have been a lot,when the film was over and over the top i was n't expecting anything
1,it 's a very funny film and a good,it is not a movie that is n't
1,this movie is not a bad film but,this is the worst movie ever made
1,how could you have to be a movie,how can a movie be so good
1,we have a very good movie,we are supposed for the characters and
1,all the actors are excellent and i think the director was a great actor,all in the name of the movie is a great example of what a good
1,this is the first movie i have ever walked across and,this movie is a complete mess of the first movie
1,the movie is about the power of the characters and the story,the film has a very good story line and a great story line
1,this is the first film that i 've ever walked across,this movie is a must see for anyone who likes a movie
1,this is the worst film i 've seen,this movie is not for the faint of heart
1,amazingly the film is not as bad as it,amazingly enough it is a very good film
1,his character is a little bit too old for his own,his performance in this film is very good and the story is
1,powerless and confused the film is a complete mess of,powerless to get a few laughs and a chuckle
1,like i mentioned earlier that the film is not as bad,like the other reviewer said this is the worst movie i have
1,his character was a bit too unlikable and i could not care less about the characters,his performance is so good and the story is so believable that i ca n't believe it
1,imagine the movie is about a young man named angus,imagine a film that is not only a comedy but a
1,i was surprised to see that the film was released theatrically,i have to admit i did not like the movie
1,this movie was so bad that i was laughing hysterically at,this is a very bad movie and it is n't
1,for a movie that was a little too long and the story was n't very interesting it,for the most of the time the film was shot on a cheap and grainy video
1,the movie was shot on location in a small budget and it 's not even the,the film is a bit of an action movie but the action is very good
1,at the end the movie ends abruptly and the end,at least it 's a little bit too slow
1,my advice to anyone interested in this movie is the fact that it 's not,my favorite scene is when a man walks into a room with his wife
1,i have seen the original movie and i have,i was n't expecting much from the film
1,the movie is about a group of young men who have a party together and are married,the film has a lot of potential and it is a great movie to see if you can
1,more importantly it is a very funny movie that is n't just a bad movie but it is n't bad either,more than a few times it 's not a good film but the acting and the direction are very well done and
1,while i was n't impressed with the story the characters and their performances are all,while the film was a bit long it was still a very good movie
1,i have to say that i have seen a lot of movies and this one is a must for,i was surprised that this film was released theatrically in theaters and it is a very poor movie
1,the film is about a young man named kenny played,the movie was a waste for the whole family
1,but it is a good movie,but the film 's main problem with
1,there is a lot of violence in the film but it is,there are a lot more to the movie than this movie
1,the film has a lot to offer and the film is very good and it is a great movie,the movie is about a young woman named seita who has a crush on her son who has a crush
1,when i saw the movie on the shelf it looked,when the film was over i had a headache
1,the movie was shot on location in the middle of the night,the film is a bit of an exercise in a long lost marriage
1,the film is a complete mess of a movie,the movie was shot in the same way as a
1,for a movie that is n't even a good one,for the most of us who are n't the same person
1,it 's not a bad movie but the acting is good and the script is very good and the actors are good and it 's a good movie,it is a shame because it 's a great film and it is a must watch for anyone interested in a film that is a true story of the
1,if i had n't seen it in a theatre it was a total waste of my life and money,if you want to watch a movie that is a waste for a few minutes then watch this
1,but the film 's biggest flaw was,but it is a great film
1,i'm a big fan of the original,i'm not sure why this film was made
1,this movie was so bad it 's,this is a very bad film
1,while i do n't think the movie was a good one it is still very entertaining,while the movie was n't as bad as the original it 's still a good movie to
1,a lot of people are complaining about the film and it is not a good movie but the story is very interesting,a few of the scenes are so bad that i could n't even sit there and watch the whole movie and i could
1,some of the scenes were just too long,some people say it 's a good film
1,featuring a cast of actors who are n't in this movie they,featuring the usual hollywood formula the movie has no redeeming features
1,but it 's not a good film,but the movie was n't so bad that
1,it is a very funny movie and i,it 's not even a good movie
1,it is a very funny film and,it 's not even a movie
1,i have to admit i did n't like the film,i was surprised to see that this movie was made for
1,the film is about a young man who has,the movie was a waste for the movie
1,at the same moment the movie is about a man named,at least the movie is a little bit too long
1,i have seen this film several years ago,i was n't impressed by this movie but i
1,i have to say that this movie was so,i was surprised that this movie was made
1,the movie was shot on a low budget,the film is a bit slow but the story
1,but the film 's biggest flaw was,but it is a great film
1,i was surprised that this film did n't have to rely more on the fact it was a little bit of a,i have to say that i was very impressed with the movie and i think it 's the best of all
1,wow this movie was a total disappointment and i was n't even going for a movie,wow i do n't think that the movie was a total waste of time and i would
1,that is what i think of this film,that 's the way it is portrayed
1,the film is a bit of an action movie,the movie was shot on location in a small town
1,reign of terror was one that i 'd seen in the theater and was a bit of a letdown to watch,reign over the stars of the movie is the first of three films that the first three movies were based upon and
1,as a result the movie has a very bad script,as for me it 's a shame that the film is
1,heaven 's angels are the only thing that makes the film so memorable,heaven is a great film that is a mustsee for anyone interested with a
1,the film is about the struggle between a group of people and their own,the movie was a bit of an attempt to capitalize upon the book
1,by the end of this movie you 'll be left wondering if the director was trying to make the movie a little too hard,by far one thing i found most interesting about this film is the way it is shot and the lighting and editing are so good
1,by the end of the movie you 'll have a great time watching the,by far one thing the film is a bit too long for me
1,beware of the movie is a great movie,beware the film is a bit of an exercise

1,the film has a very interesting plot and the acting was good,the movie is about the same subject matter and it 's not the
1,nevertheless it 's not that bad,nevertheless the movie is a little slow
1,yeah it was a little bit of a stretch but it,yeah i know it 's not going for the best
1,madison 's performance was the best of all the best parts of this film,madison is a great actor and he is very good in his role
1,by far the best of the three films,by the time the movie ended it was just
1,this is the first film i have seen in my life,this movie is a must for anyone interested in the subject of
1,it is not a film for everyone,it 's a very good movie and i
1,how can a movie like that be released on dvd,how could you have a movie that is a complete mess
1,i have seen this movie twice,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,i was surprised that this film did not have the,i have to say that i was n't disappointed
1,consolation that the movie has a very low rating,consolation is the director 's intent to make a film
1,this is the worst film ever made and i 've ever been a fan of the genre,this movie is not for everyone but if your looking for a movie about the life you should
1,oh and a lot of people have to say that this movie was bad,oh yeah i know it 's a bad thing but it 's not

1,i was surprised that the film did n't have a lot of plot twists,i have to say i did n't enjoy this film but it was a great
1,if i had n't been a fan i would have been able,if you want to see the worst movie i 've seen this is
1,the film has a very interesting story line and the characters and the characters,the movie is about the same thing as a child 's play and a very
1,after a while the film becomes a little more interesting and the story is a little more,after the movie i was n't sure if it would be a bad idea or not
1,her character is so stupid that it makes you wonder if she is just trying too,her performance in this movie was very good and i was impressed by her performance
1,a few of them were very funny,a lot of the film 's humor and
1,snoop dogg plays the part of the movie with a very nice touch and,snoop is a great character and he is very believable in the movie
1,worth seeing if only to find out,worth watching for the acting and direction
1,true it is a movie that is not a comedy,true the film has some good moments and the acting was
1,halfway into the movie i found myself wondering how much more of a story it was,halfway through this film i was a bit skeptical about it but it was n't that good
1,this movie is not for the faint of heart,this is the worst film i 've seen
1,the film is about the struggle between a man who has been a child in a life,the movie was a bit of an attempt at a slasher film but it was not
1,you know that it 's not going for the most to be made but,you can see the movie coming from the beginning of a second season
1,dad is the best of the bunch,dad 's father and his son have a
1,while the film was a bit long and the story was n't as bad as it could 've,while i was n't impressed with the film i did not expect a lot from the movie

1,this movie is a complete mess of the first movie,this is the first movie i have ever walked across and
1,solid acting by the cast and the,solid performances by all the actors
1,but it is a good film and it 's not the worst movie i have ever seen but i 've,but the film 's main flaw is that the film is not as good as it should have been
1,this movie was so awful that it,this is a very good film
1,and the ending was so stupid that i was n't even thinking,and it is a very good film and a great movie
1,the movie is about the same subject as the book,the film has a very interesting plot but the acting and
1,i was n't expecting much from this,i have seen the original movie
1,but it 's a good thing,but the movie is not a complete
1,i have seen this film several years ago and i still remember the first time i saw the film i thought it was a great movie and i would love,i was n't impressed by this movie but it was n't a bad movie either it 's just a waste of my life and time and money to waste
1,the film has a lot of potential to make a good film but the acting is,the movie is about a group of people who are trapped in a small island
1,it is a very good movie,it 's not even the best movie
1,demille is a genius in this film,demille 's film is a masterpiece
1,other than the aforementioned fact that this is the best of the three films,other reviewers have commented that the film was shot in the early seventies
1,nevertheless the film has some good points,nevertheless it is a very enjoyable film and
1,the film has some of its moments but it 's,the movie is a complete mess of the original

1,the film is about a group that has been kidnapped and killed by a mysterious killer who is a vampire,the movie was a waste of time and i do n't think it was a good movie to begin with but
1,this movie is a complete waste,this is the first movie that i
1,alice 's father is a little too much to ask for,alice is a young man who has a onenight life with her
1,good acting great plot great acting,good luck for the good guy who
1,if i had to give this a 0 out 10 stars i 'd say it 's not worth it,if you want a movie that is a little bit of an action movie with some good action scenes then
1,nonetheless the film is a little too long,nonetheless it is not the worst movie ever made
1,i have seen this movie several times,i was n't impressed with this film

1,then there is the fact that it is a movie about a young man named sasha,then the movie starts with the two leads and the two main characters are the same
1,my advice to the director of this movie is that it 's a good thing,my favorite scene was the one with a woman who is supposed to be a witch
1,maybe it was the fact that it was made in the early 80 's but the story was so bad that i was surprised,maybe the director should be able to get a few chuckles out there but it 's just not enough to save this movie

1,joan crawford is the only one that is able to make her look like she,joan blondell plays a young girl who has to deal to find her husband
1,these two characters have their moments in the movie,these are the two things that i do not understand
1,each character has a different personality and is more believable than,each of the three characters is a little too much
1,but the movie is a little too slow for the whole,but it 's a great movie and i recommend it
1,the film is about a group that is,the movie was a waste of time
1,only the most discerning fans of the original film have,only a couple of people have seen this movie
1,this movie is a must see,this is the first film that has

1,at least the film was a little too much for me,at the same time the film is a bit slow but the
1,and it 's a shame because it is not a movie that is a complete waste of your time,and the movie is so bad that it 's hard not only for the sake to be entertained
1,you know that it 's not going for a very good movie but it is,you can see the movie coming from the same perspective as the first film
1,the film is a bit of a bore but the acting is so bad that i ca n't believe that it was made in,the movie was shot on location and it 's a very good movie to look at and it is a very nice film
1,costumes and costumes are all very nice,costumes are very bad and they are not
1,some of them are not as good or bad,some people have said that this movie is a masterpiece
1,just like the first movie the acting is pretty good,just as a movie is about a young woman named seita
1,well i guess it 's not a good film,well the movie is n't bad but it 's just
1,also the movie is a bit slow and boring,also i think the movie was very well made and
1,he 's a very good actor,he is the most talented character in
1,there are a lot more to the movie,there is a lot of violence in the movie
1,there are a few good moments in this film,there is a scene in the film that is very
1,the movie is about the same subject matter as a child 's play and the film itself,the film has a very interesting plot and a good cast but the story is so bad that

1,i have to admit i did not enjoy this movie but i was n't disappointed by it,i was surprised to see that the movie is not a remake of a classic book
1,now that i have n't read the novel,now i have seen a lot worse
1,in the first film the characters are not very interesting and they 're not even funny,in fact the only reason why this movie is so bad is because of the fact it
1,i was surprised to find out the film is n't going to get better,i have to admit that i have seen this movie several years ago
1,the movie was a bit of a mess but i found the ending to the movie somewhat satisfying and i,the film is about the struggle of the people in the world and how they are in the world
1,sedated little kids are all the rage and they,sedated and the movie is a great movie
1,the film is a bit slow and boring but the acting and direction is so good it is almost painful,the movie was shot on a budget of about a dozen hundred million dollars and the camera work was so bad
1,if you want a movie that does not need a good plot and good acting then,if i had to give this movie a 0 i 'd give this a 0
1,eddie murphy plays the part of a young woman in a,eddie izzard is a good choice to play the role

1,personally i think that the film was,personally the movie was n't bad
1,women are n't the only ones who are n't the only one who,women in the film were a little more believable and more believable
1,all the actors were excellent and i was impressed to find that the film is a little too much to be enjoyed,all in the family and the movie 's plot is a bit of a stretch to watch but it 's still a great
1,as a matter the movie was a waste of my life and i would n't recommend it,as for the rest of the movie it is a very good film and i recommend this movie
1,most of the film is spent in the movie,most people are not aware of the film 's existence
1,how can a film like that get a rating,how could you possibly get a better idea
1,i'm not sure why i was so disappointed with this film but i was wrong,i'm a big fan and i have to say i was n't disappointed by the film
1,note that it is not a movie about the holocaust or its story,note the fact of the story of the film is that the director is
1,pedro is a very good character,pedro 's performance is the only reason
1,why is it that the movie is n't so bad,why did they have such a good cast and crew that
1,save your money and rent this movie,save yourself a favor do n't waste time
1,they are all in a different place,they 're all very good and have some
1,but it 's not the best movie ever made but the fact is it 's a good film,but the movie was a bit of an insult to the intelligence of the viewer and it was not
1,how can a movie be so good,how could you have to be a movie
1,but the film 's biggest flaw was,but it is a great film
1,under a rock soundtrack the film is a bit slow but it is still very,under the guidance of the great john cassavetes the film has an interesting premise

1,the movie was shot in a very,the film is a complete waste

1,it 's a very good movie,it is not a film for the
1,jodie tilly is a delight to look at,jodie foster 's performance is very good and she
1,for a film that is not only a visual masterpiece it 's a film about a young woman named,for the first half hour i was n't bored and the movie is n't even that good either
1,anyone with a modicum memories and a brain will be rewarded by the film,anyone who thinks that the movie has a good story is not the easiest way
1,it is not the best film ever but the fact that it is a film that,it 's a shame that the movie is n't so bad as it 's not
1,rhames 's performance was a little too wooden and the plot was too predictable,rhames is a great character actor and i have seen him play the role in
1,the film is a complete mess,the movie was shot in the early
1,in fact it 's not even the worst of the series but the fact that,in the end the movie is a very good movie and i recommend it

1,unfortunately the movie is not as bad,unfortunately it 's a bit too long
1,there are a lot of things to say about the film,there is a lot to be said about the film
1,i'm not a fan of the genre,i'm a fan of this film
1,one of my favorites was that the film was shot on location in the early 1800 'searly 1950,one thing that i did n't really like about the movie is the music and the music
1,this is the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune of sitting down,this movie is not a good one but it 's a great movie

1,it 's a very funny film,it is not a movie that you
1,all in all this is one of my favorites,all the characters are all very good and the characters
1,i was n't expecting a movie to get a grip on me,i have seen the movie and it 's not a good one

1,the movie was shot in a small budget and it was a very,the film is a complete waste of time and a complete insult
1,my advice to the filmmakers of the movie are the fact they 're all,my favorite scene was when he was talking about his dad 's death
1,repetitive plot and characters that are n't even remotely funny,repetitive and predictable and the movie has no plot at least
1,the movie was shot on a low budget,the film is a bit slow but the story
1,her character was a little too much for her and she was not believable,her performance is so bad it makes you wonder if the actors were actually reading
1,i have to admit that the film is a bit too slow for,i was surprised to find that the film is a bit slow
1,that is what makes it a classic film and a great,that 's the only reason i gave it a 2
1,the movie was shot in a small budget,the film is a complete waste of time
1,in the first film he is a very talented actor and a good guy,in fact the only thing that kept the movie going was the way it ended
1,it 's a very funny movie,it is not a movie for the
1,joe don baker was the only actor who could have played the role of a lifetime,joe pesci plays the part with the best performance of his life and is the best of
1,the movie is a bit of an action movie but the action scenes were,the film has some good points but the rest is just a mess
1,art is the only reason to watch it and it,art carney is the only one to be able
1,then the film switches gears from a very interesting premise,then there 's a few scenes that make it hard to
1,george clooney is the perfect actor for this,george c bush is a great director
1,the movie is about a group of people who are trying to get married,the film has a lot of potential to make a movie that has been made
1,there is no real reason for this to be made in a hurry,there are some very good scenes and some of them are very good but
1,and the movie was so boring,and it 's not a bad movie
1,reiner is the only actor who has a chance for the role,reiner 's character was a little too much to be considered as a
1,there are a lot more of the same actors and actresses in this film,there is a lot of action and the story is a little confusing
1,of all the movies i 've seen this one is a must,of course there are a lot more ways to get out
1,you know that it is a good movie,you can see the director mateo and the writer
1,if i were to rate it lower than it deserves it 's lowest ranking,if you 're a diehard fan of horror movies you will probably like it but
1,pros are a very few of the actors in,pros of the film are not that good
1,so the movie is a bit slow and the ending was too predictable,so i guess it was n't a good movie but it is n't that
1,i have seen the movie and i can safely say that i have n't read the novel,i was n't expecting a movie about the holocaust or that the movie was based upon the story
1,in fact it is a great movie,in the end it is a great film
1,in the end it 's not even worth mentioning,in fact it is not a movie that you will
1,the movie is about a young woman who has been living in a house for,the film has a lot to offer but it 's not a bad movie
1,in fact it is a very good film,in the end it is not the worst film

1,barbara carrera is a great actor,barbara stanwyck plays the mother of a
1,fished in the middle and the movie was a bit too long for me to enjoy it,fished away with a few seconds of the movie and then the next minute of the film is
1,mama 's father is a very interesting and interesting film about the struggle of a young man to,mama is a great film that is worth seeing for the acting and the direction and editing
1,in fact it is a great film and i recommend it to all,in the end it is a very good movie and it is a great
1,due to a lack of talent and the talent of the actors the film fails to make any sense whatsoever and it is,due for the first half hour i thought that the film would be good but the acting and the direction was terrible
1,lame and dumber the acting was horrible and,lame acting bad script and bad acting
1,and it 's not a bad thing that the film was shot on a low level,and the movie was so boring that i was laughing hysterically at the stupidity of the film
1,kathy bates is the only one to get a chance on this movie,kathy ireland 's character was so annoying that i was n't sure what was
1,but it is not the worst film ever,but the film is a little too long

1,the movie was a bit of an action film,the film is about the struggle between the two and

1,said the film was a bit slow and the plot is a bit confusing but the story is very good,said that the movie was made in the us and the us army is not a good one but it 's
1,the movie is about the same subject matter and it 's not a good movie,the film has a very interesting plot and the acting was good but it is not
1,no matter how many years later i 've been watching a film for the,no one has to be said to be a fan of the original
1,i have to admit that i was very disappointed,i was surprised to find out that the film is
1,we have a lot more of a movie about a man trying his luck in life and his,we are supposed to believe that the people who made this movie were n't trying too hard
1,this movie was a complete waste,this is a movie that i would
1,no matter how many years ago he was a big star,no one has to be a fan to see this film and

1,this movie is a complete waste,this is the first movie that i
1,i have seen the movie twice and it 's a great movie,i was n't expecting a lot from this movie but it 's not
1,one thing that really annoyed the film was that,one of my favorite films of all times

1,it is not the best movie ever made but the acting is superb and,it 's a shame that this film is n't available in the uk
1,while the movie was a bit slow it did n't have to do with a lot of action,while i do n't know how i can get the dvd of this film i can safely say it
1,master of a film that has a lot more of the,master and the rest of the cast are all excellent
1,not to mention the acting is terrible,not only does he have to be the
1,all in all a great movie to watch and i recommend it to all,all the characters were so bad they could n't even be called the bad guys
1,he is a great actor and he 's not just a bad actor,he 's not a good guy but he 's a bad actor and a
1,it is not a movie for the,it 's a very funny movie
1,the movie is a bit of a mess,the film has some good points and some good
1,to me this is the best movie ever made,to be honest the movie is n't bad but the
1,i have to say that this movie is one that i have seen in my entire life and it is a must watch,i was surprised that this movie was n't released theatrically in theaters and it is not even worth renting for a few bucks and
1,it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen but i have to say i was very impressed,it 's a shame because it is not the worst film ever made but the fact it is so awful
1,but the movie is a bit slow,but it 's a great film
1,the movie was a waste of time and i do not recommend it to,the film is about a group that has been kidnapped by the government
1,s the only reason why this movie was made is because it,s character development is a bit of a stretch for me
1,a few years ago the film was made and the story was about the same,a lot more than a little more than the usual suspects the film is very well
1,he 's a very talented director,he is the most annoying character in
1,imagine a film about a young woman who has been,imagine the movie as the first movie i saw
1,so i was n't impressed with the film,so the film has a lot to do
1,luckily the movie has no real plot and,luckily it 's not a bad film
1,the film is a complete mess of the original,the movie was shot in the same location as a
1,at least the film is n't as bad as it should,at the same time it 's a very funny movie
1,obviously this movie was a waste for a bunch of dollars and a few people,obviously the film is a bit too long for its own good but it is a
1,and the movie was so bad that i,and it 's not a good film
1,watched it on tv and it 's still a good movie to watch and i would definitely like to see it again,watched this film and it was a very pleasant experience to watch and i would recommend it to any one of the above

1,this movie was so bad that i was n't laughing,this is a very bad movie and it 's not even
1,the film has some good points but the story line is so bad that it becomes a bore,the movie is a bit of an action film but the action scenes were so bad it 's hard
1,wells 's direction is a little too slow,wells is the only person who can make a
1,why did they make such a bad movie,why is it so bad that the film has
1,i have seen the movie and i can safely tell that it was n't the worst film ever,i was n't expecting a movie about the holocaust but i did n't like it so i did n't
1,nothing really happened in this film,nothing is ever done in this film
1,derek jacobi plays a young man whose wife is a young woman,derek is a great character and he is very believable in the role
1,when i saw this film i thought it would have a chance to be a good movie,when the film is over the top is a bit of an achievement to sit through and it
1,3 out 10 out of 10 stars for this movie,3 the acting is terrible and the plot is just a
1,john goodman is a good choice to be the villain,john wayne 's performance is a bit stiff but he 's
1,to me it was a very poor film and i would n't have to say that it is a good movie but it 's not,to be fair i was not impressed by the movie but it 's a good film to watch and i would recommend this movie
1,the movie was a bit slow but i did n't expect much from it,the film is about the same subject as the book and it 's not even
1,this movie was so bad it was good to see the acting was horrible the plot was bad the acting is,this is a very bad film and it 's not even worth mentioning that it 's not even a movie
1,i have seen the movie twice and i have never been a big big fan,i was n't expecting a lot from the film but i did n't think that it
1,what a great movie this was and i have to say i love it,what is the point of this movie that is the only thing that is n't
1,the film has a very interesting story line and the acting,the movie is about the same thing as a child
1,the movie was a waste for me,the film is about a young woman named
1,the movie is a bit of an insult,the film has some good points but it 's
1,credits were not the same as this movie,credits are not as good as the first film
1,this is a very bad movie and i would have to say it,this movie was so bad that i could n't even finish it
1,the film has some of its moments but it 's,the movie is a complete mess of the original
1,talking about the movie and the plot is a little confusing,talking to a man who has a heart attack and is n't
1,it 's not even the best movie,it is a very good movie
1,the movie is about the same thing as a typical hollywood film with,the film has a very interesting story line and a great cast
1,just as the movie was shot on a budget of about a million dollars and a few shots of the camera and some,just like a movie about a man trying desperately hard and fails to make it to the big city of new york
1,dad 's wife is the daughter,dad is a good guy and he
1,if i were n't so irritated i would n't have been a little surprised by the film,if you 're looking to be a good movie and do n't have a good laugh at all
1,i was surprised that the film was made,i have to say i did not enjoy this
1,how can you make such an impact,how could it have been a good movie
1,actually it is n't that bad but the movie does have a lot to do,actually the movie is a little slow and the ending is just too predictable and too
1,by the time i saw it i had a headache and i was n't impressed by it,by far the worst movie i 've ever seen in my entire entire movie is a waste
1,the film is about the same thing about a,the movie was a bit slow and boring
1,it 's not a bad film but the performances by all the actors are excellent,it is a shame because the film is a bit too long for me
1,it 's not even the best movie,it is a very good movie
1,so i was expecting a good film but i,so the film is not a complete waste
1,everybody is entitled to the fact that they are all in the same predicament as the first movie,everybody else is a little too young to have a good time and the movie just drags along at
1,of course the movie has some good moments and the acting is pretty good,of all of the movies i have seen this is one that is n't even
1,certainly a film for the ages and a must for any,certainly the film is n't as good as it is
1,i was surprised to find that the film is not as good as the first one,i have to admit that the film is a little too slow and the ending was just
1,this is the worst movie ever,this movie is not a bad movie
1,for the most part the acting is superb,for a movie about the holocaust it 's not
1,most of the time i have n't laughed so much in my entire lives,most people are n't interested in this movie but i do n't think that the
1,hillarious movie that is a great deal to the book,hillarious and funny and a bit of a chuckle
1,one of my favorites is the fact that the movie is so much more interesting than it is in this film and that it is a very difficult,one thing that i found most interesting about the movie is the fact it was a movie about a young man who is trying his best friend
1,or maybe it was the fact that it was made in the,or the other one who has the ability of the character
1,fortunately the film 's only saving graces,fortunately it is not the case
1,how can a movie be so bad that,how could you have to be kidding
1,beasts are not always the best of the bunch but they,beasts and demons are not the same as they were
1,the film has a lot to offer but it 's a bit too long and it is n't,the movie is about a young woman who has been kidnapped by her mother and her mother and the
1,get a few chuckles out there,get to see this movie and it
1,like the other reviewer i have seen the movie,like i mentioned earlier the movie is a little slow
1,now that i 've read about it i can tell that it is a good film but i think that,now i have to say that i was n't impressed by this film but it was a great movie
1,anyway the movie was a bit of a mess but i was n't sure if it was a good idea,anyway i have to admit i was very disappointed with this movie and i was n't expecting a lot
1,however i was surprised to see that the film was a little bit too short for me to,however the movie is not a good one either as it is a bit of a bore
1,none the less it is an excellent movie and,none of these things are explained or explained
1,the movie was a waste of time,the film is about a group that is
1,sly 's performance is the best of all the supporting cast,sly is a great actor and i have seen him play the
1,he is the most talented character of all time and is the only one who has a role in this movie that makes,he 's a very good actor and he is a great actor and he 's great in the movie as the villain
1,but the film 's biggest problem with,but it is a great movie
1,however i do n't know why i was n't impressed by the film 's lack of plot,however the film 's main flaw was that it had to have a lot more plot and more
1,but the movie is a little too slow for the whole,but it 's a great movie and i recommend it
1,one thing i did n't like about this movie was that it had a,one of the most interesting films of all times and a must see
1,a few years later i saw the film on the shelf and it was a very good film,a lot more of the film is a little too long and the ending was too abrupt
1,why is it so bad that the film has,why did they make such a bad movie
1,stewart is a great actress and i hope that the director will continue to get the credit he deserved,stewart 's performance as the lead character is also very good and he does a good job of portraying a
1,question the movie is a complete waste of time,question is that it is a film about the life
1,the film is a complete waste of my life,the movie was shot in a small town in new
1,which i thought it would be,which is a shame because it is
1,greetings is the best movie i 've ever watched and it is a great,greetings from the train station and the two rekindle the same old formula
1,the film is a bit of a bore,the movie was shot on location and it was
1,the film has a very good cast and it 's not a good,the movie is about the power and soul of the human race
1,the film is a complete mess of a film,the movie was shot in the same way that it
1,given the fact of the matter i do not know why i was so disappointed,given that the film was shot on location in the early 1800 's the film was
1,a few of them are very funny and the story is very interesting and interesting and i think that the actors are very,a lot of the scenes were filmed in the same location and the same actors were used to play in the movie
1,i have seen the original version of the scarlet marple and it is one that is very,i was n't expecting much of a movie but i did n't expect much from it
1,that is the only reason i can think of for a movie like this,that 's what makes it a great film and it 's a shame because the
1,the movie was shot in a small town in new,the film is a complete waste of my life
1,it 's a shame that this movie has not been released theatrically on dvd or dvd,it is not the best movie i have ever had to sit through but it 's still
1,george clooney is a great director,george c bush has done a good
1,careers are the only reason i can think of why the movie is so bad,careers like this should have been given the chance to make a sequel to this movie
1,but it is a good film,but the film 's main flaw was
1,one of my favorites was that i had a crush in,one thing that i did n't like was the ending
1,the movie was shot in a small town and it,the film is a complete waste of my time
1,in the first film he was the one who had the most difficult time to be in the movie,in fact the only thing i can think about is that the movie is so boring and boring
1,beyond that it 's a very bad movie and i do n't think that it was made in a hurry,beyond the fact the film was made for the first half hour of the movie i was n't sure whether the
1,this is the first movie i have ever seen in,this movie is a complete mess of the original
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,i have to say that i have n't seen the original,i was surprised that this film was made in a hurry to
1,the movie is about the power and the,the film has a very good cast
1,instead of a movie about a man trying,instead it 's just a boring movie
1,the film has some of its most,the movie is a complete mess
1,rather it is the fact that it is a film that has been done by the same person as the other two,rather than a movie about the evils and tribulations that the characters have to endure the story is not so much as to
1,from a very good script by robert wise,from the opening scene to a very end of
1,plus the acting was good and the story was very interesting and interesting to watch,plus it is a great film and i hope it will be released soon soon soon
1,the film has a lot of action in the movie and the ending was very,the movie is about a group that is trying to find the missing girl
1,this movie is not a bad film,this is the worst movie ever made and
1,in fact it 's a very bad movie,in the end the film has a lot to
1,it 's not a bad movie,it is a shame because it is
1,sally kellerman was a great choice for the role,sally hawkins is the perfect choice to play a character
1,and it 's a shame that the,and the movie is so boring
1,like i mentioned above the film was a bit slow and boring but i was surprised that the movie did not end up as an action movie or a thriller,like the other reviewers here i have to admit that i have seen this movie several years and i still have to say that i was very impressed with the film
1,if you 're looking to be scared by the movie 's title this movie is for the birds,if i were n't so irritated by the movie i 'd have to say i was n't disappointed by
1,the film is a bit of a bore but it is a very good movie,the movie was shot on location and it 's not a good movie to begin to
1,however i do not recommend this movie,however the film is a little slow and
1,the film is about the struggle of a young man to be the one that is in his life and,the movie was a bit of a letdown but i was surprised that the movie did not get released
1,after the first hour of this movie the viewer was left wondering what happened next,after a few years i have been looking forward to this film for years
1,unfortunately it 's not a bad movie it is n't,unfortunately the movie does not work as a comedy or drama
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,go see this film if you want to see a good film,go ahead and watch it and you will see it again
1,i was surprised that the film was n't released theatrically,i have to say i did not like the film but

1,they 're not the same as they are in the book but,they are not even funny and they 're all pretty funny
1,now that i have n't seen the movie it 's,now i have seen a few of these movies
1,well the film was n't bad,well i do n't know why
1,this movie was so bad that it,this is a very bad movie
1,for a film about the evils of war the film is about,for the first time in a while the film was made
1,i have seen this movie twice and i have never seen it,i was n't impressed with the film and the acting is so poor
1,this movie is a must for all fans of a good horror,this is the first film i 've ever walked out on
1,and it is a very good film,and the ending was so stupid that it
1,it 's a shame that this movie is not only a film for those of us that like to see a lot more of the original film,it is not the best movie i 've seen in my life but it is one of the most memorable movies i have seen in a long long
1,the film is about the same thing about the man who is trying to get the girl to the right man,the movie was a bit slow and boring but it 's a good film to watch and it is worth watching for
1,unfortunately the movie does n't seem like,unfortunately it 's not the same
1,a few years ago the movie is a little slow but it 's not a good movie and it is not a movie,a lot more than a few of those movies i have watched in the theater and it 's not even that bad
1,i have seen the original movie and it is very much like a remake of the original,i was n't expecting much from the movie but i was n't expecting a good film to watch
1,as for me i have to say i did not enjoy the movie and the movie was so bad,as a result of this movie it is a very good film and a good one at it
1,i was n't impressed with this movie,i have seen this movie several years and
1,never before has a movie preached to such an iconic topic that it 's hard not to feel,never mind that the film was made in the us and the us government was in it
1,the film has a very interesting plot and a good story line,the movie is about the same subject matter as a movie
1,in fact it is a great film,in the end it is a very enjoyable
1,i was surprised that the film was made in a hurry to be released in the us and,i have to say i did not enjoy the movie but i was n't disappointed by it
1,for the most of the movie the acting was pretty bad,for a movie that was supposed to have a plot and was
1,interesting to see the movie is about the,interesting and funny but not the best
1,but it 's not the worst film ever,but the movie was a little too long
1,to be fair i did n't know that this movie,to me it was the best of the series
1,save your money rent this film and you 'll have to watch it,save yourself a time do n't watch it if you want a laugh
1,some of them are not as good or as bad,some people have said that this movie is so bad it
1,this is the first film i have seen that made it to be so darned,this movie is a must for anyone interested with the genre of the genre
1,one thing i liked about the film was that the characters were so realistic,one of the best films i have seen in a long long long long time
1,there are a few good scenes but the film does n't really work out as the story of a young woman who has to be a little too infatuated to be,there is a scene in which the girl is walking through the woods and the camera pans off the screen and she is standing on the floor laughing crying crying
1,now i have to admit that the film was very well made and the acting was good,now that i 've seen the movie i have to say that it was n't the worst film
1,for the most part the acting was ok,for a movie about the holocaust of the west
1,i have seen this movie several years and,i was n't impressed with this movie
1,then there is a scene where the hero is trying his hand to get his hands on a wall and then the scene where he is trying his,then the movie switches to the characters and it is a bit of an adventure to be a good movie but the story is n't too good
1,the film is a bit of a mess but it is a good,the movie was shot on location and the acting is so poor
1,so i was n't impressed with this film,so the film has a lot of action
1,ok i have to say i was impressed with this film,ok so i do concede that this is a very good film
1,she 's not a bad guy but a good actress and she is a good actor,she is a great actress and i hope that her next film will make her more believable
1,but the movie was n't so much a lot of it was just plain boring,but it 's not a good movie and it 's not even worth the time to
1,the film is about a young woman named,the movie was a waste for me
1,i have seen this film twice and it is a great film to see,i was n't impressed by the fact that the movie was made in the first
1,at the end the movie is a little slow and the end result,at least it 's a bit too long for the first half
1,instead it is a very boring movie,instead of being the worst of all this
1,joe pesci plays a young man whose,joe don baker is a genius
1,her performance is a bit too stiff,her character was so stupid that i could
1,normally the film is not a complete disaster but the acting is pretty good and,normally i think the movie was made for the sake of being a movie
1,his character was a little too cocky and the plot was so predictable that i was n't expecting much from,his performance is so bad it 's almost painful to sit through and i think that 's the point
1,it is not the worst movie ever made but it 's not a good one,it 's a shame because it 's not the best of all the movies
1,russell 's character was a little too cocky and the plot was too predictable to be believable but,russell crowe and his crew are the best in this movie and they are all excellent actors
1,the film has a very good story line,the movie is about the power of the human
1,i have seen this movie twice,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,she 's not a bad guy,she is a great actress and she
1,the movie is about a young man named kenny played with his son by the great actor,the film has a lot to do with a lot of the scenes in the film
1,so the movie is a complete waste,so i guess it was a good idea
1,i was surprised that the movie was made,i have to say i was n't impressed by
1,a few years ago i saw the movie,a lot more than the sum of its parts
1,but it is not a movie that is,but the film is not as bad
1,it is a shame because the film is a little too much to,it 's not a bad film but the performances are pretty good
1,some people have said that the film,some of them are not funny
1,peter falk is a good choice to play a character,peter o'toole plays the role of a lifetime who has a
1,it is a very good movie and i think that the actors were great,it 's not even the best of all the movies that are made
1,this movie was so bad it was good,this is a very bad film and it is
1,unfortunately the film is not as good as it should be and it is n't even close,unfortunately it is n't the worst film ever made but it 's still a good film
1,it is a very good movie,it 's not even the best movie
1,it 's a shame because the film is so boring and the plot that you ca only,it is not the worst film i have ever seen but it 's a good movie
1,i was n't impressed by this film but i did n't expect much from it but i was n't disappointed with the movie and i,i have seen this film several times and it 's one that is so bad it is n't funny it 's not even funny
1,see this film and you 'll see what it 's all,see it if you have a chance to watch it
1,indeed the movie has some very funny moments and the movie is a good one to see but it 's not,indeed it 's a very good film and it is a shame to see such a great film in its day
1,the film has a lot of potential and the acting was pretty good but the script is so poor it,the movie is about a group of young people trying to get married and together with a married couple
1,for the first time in a while i was a little skeptical about the film,for a film about the evils of the human condition the movie has been made
1,in the end it is a great film,in fact it is a great movie
1,released on dvd in the uk and the only thing that was released in britain was the original theatrical trailer,released in a very small town of the year 2004 the movie is about a group that has been living on
1,we have to be a bit more forgiving of the characters,we are not supposed for the same thing as we do n't
1,but it 's not a good movie and the acting is terrible and the story line was n't even good,but the movie was n't so much a movie about the evils of war as it was about a war
1,yes it 's not that great but the acting is great and the,yes the film is a bit of a stretch for the viewer
1,quote of a movie is the worst of the worst,quote is a film that is not only about a group
1,by far the worst thing about this film was that it had been released theatrically,by the time i was a little girl i was a little confused about it and
1,and the ending is so stupid and stupid,and it is not a movie that is n't
1,there are some good scenes and the film,there is no reason to watch it
1,the movie was shot on a low level,the film is a bit slow but it is
1,it 's not a movie for the faint hearted but the film is very,it is a shame that the film has n't been released in dvd
1,i have seen this movie several times,i was n't impressed with this film
1,the film has a very good cast,the movie is about the power and the
1,as a matter the movie is not as good as it should be but the acting and direction is very good,as for the rest of it i would n't be surprised if the director had n't been in the movie business and
1,but it is not a good film and it,but the film is not a complete waste
1,it 's a shame because the film was so good,it is not the worst film i 've seen in a
1,the movie was shot on a budget that would have been a lot better,the film is a bit slow and the ending was a bit too predictable but
1,the film has some good moments and some nice touches,the movie is a bit slow but the story is very
1,my favorite part is when a woman is raped and she is confronted by a man who is supposed and is,my advice is to avoid this one at all costs unless your a fan of the genre or the tv
1,the movie was a waste of time,the film is about a group that is
1,he 's not a bad actor but he is a good,he is a great director and he is very good
1,after a while i had to see it again,after the movie was over the top was a little
1,anyhoo i was a bit surprised by this movie,anyhoo the film is a bit of a bore but
1,it 's not even a movie,it is a very funny film and
1,like the other reviewers here said that the film is a,like i mentioned above the movie is very well made
1,i have to say that this is a very good film and it 's a great,i was surprised that this movie did not have the same plot as the original
1,then the movie starts with a bunch of people who are trying to make the same,then there is the fact it 's not the worst film i have ever seen
1,on the other side of the coin is the worst movie ever,on a positive note the film has a very good soundtrack and the
1,shot in a small budget and a very tight budget,shot on a budget of 1 and a quarter
1,it 's not even a good film,it is a very funny movie
1,it 's not even a good film,it is a very funny movie

1,the movie is about a young woman who is a teenager and is now married,the film has a lot to offer but the film is n't as good as the
1,next time i see the movie and the fact i am a fan of the original series i was surprised to find that it had a very low rating,next to a scene where a woman is raped by a woman in the middle and a woman 's head and a couple of seconds later she 's wearing the
1,i have seen the original version and i can,i was n't expecting much of this film

1,a few years ago i saw this film and it was a great film for me to see,a lot more than the sum it is a great film and a great movie to watch
1,whereas the movie is not a comedy it 's a comedy and it is n't funny it,whereas i do not think the movie was intended as a comedy it was very funny
1,so i guess i was n't going to get into the movie,so the movie was a waste of my time and i would have
1,the film has a very good story and the actors and actresses are great,the movie is about the power of a young man who has been a struggling
1,i have to admit that the film is very well done and i would recommend this film,i was surprised to find that the film was a complete waste of time and money

1,i have to say that i have n't read,i was surprised that this film was made
1,then there is the fact that the movie has a lot more to it than the sum,then the movie starts with the same guy who 's been a cop in a long life
1,anyway i was surprised that the film was n't released theatrically in the uk,anyway the film is a bit slow and boring but it 's not a bad
1,giving a good performance in the movie and the acting was pretty good,giving the film an added boost of the title and the fact it 's
1,they 're not even funny and the movie is not funny,they are not the only ones who have a shred for the
1,perhaps the director should be ashamed to be able for a wider,perhaps it 's because the movie is a little too long
1,so i was n't expecting a movie to get the point of view,so the film has its moments but the story is n't that bad
1,with a supposed beard in his head he 's not even the most likable character in this film,with the help of a young man he 's a little too reluctant for his own life

1,just like the other reviewer i 've seen this movie,just as a film about a young woman 's struggle to
1,there is no real reason for this to happen,there are some very good scenes and some good ones

1,was this supposed for a movie that is supposed for,was it a good movie or a good one
1,there is no reason for this to be made in,there are some good moments but it is n't
1,soon after a long shot of a man 's body and the camera pans out the window and the camera pans out the window and then the scene cuts to the scene of a man walking around the table,soon the film begins to unravel the mystery and tension that is the main theme of this film and it is very well done and the performances are all excellent and the film is very entertaining and very entertaining
1,it is a shame that the film is not as good,it 's not a movie for the masses or for the faint
1,ben affleck is a great actor,ben stiller plays a very likable character

1,some of them are not as good or as bad as they are,some people have said that this movie is so bad that it is n't
1,and the ending was a little too abrupt,and it is a shame that this film has
1,if i had n't been in the theater for the past i would have had a better choice,if you want to see a movie that has a lot more action than you might want to watch
1,i was surprised to see that the movie was a bit too long,i have to admit i did not enjoy the movie but it is not

1,still the film has a lot to,still it is a good film
1,i have to say that i have seen this film twice,i was surprised that this film was released in the us
1,instead it is a film about a young man who has a son and a daughter who is a bit too much,instead of being the most annoying person in the movie i could n't help thinking of the film as a comedy
1,i was surprised that the film did not get released theatrically in theaters,i have to say i did n't like the film but i did not
1,essentially it is a film about the life of a young man who has a heart attack and a love affair with a woman who is married,essentially the movie was a complete waste of my life and it was n't even nominated to the academy awards of the best actor award for best picture
1,second the film is a bit slow but the story itself is so good and so well constructed,second of all i would have to agree that this is the worst film i have seen in a
1,it 's a shame that the film has been released on video and vhs,it is not the best film i 've ever had to sit through
1,these two characters are very believable,these are the only reasons why i
1,at the end of the film the audience was,at least it was a little too much
1,oh and a lot of people who have seen the film know,oh yeah i know it 's not going for a lot
1,there is no real reason for this to be a movie that is not,there are some very good scenes and some of the scenes are funny

1,it 's not even the best movie,it is a very good movie
1,in the first film the characters are all so stupid that they are just plain stupid and not funny,in fact the only reason why this film is a classic is the presence of a young man
1,i have to admit i did n't like the movie,i was surprised to see that this movie was released in
1,not to say that the film is a little slow but it is a very good film,not only is the acting atrocious the story line is awful and the script is just awful and

1,and it is not the worst movie ever made but the,and the ending is a bit too long for me
1,the film has a lot to do with a lot more of the story,the movie is about a young man named kenny played by a man who is

1,because the movie was a complete mess of the first film and the first half,because of this movie i have to say that the movie is very good
1,this movie was so awful that i could n't help but feel embarrassed,this is a very good film and it is a great movie

1,the movie is about the power of a young man and the woman,the film has a very good story and the actors are all good
1,because the film is so good it is not only the story itself but it 's not a bad movie,because of the lack of a plot it is a very good movie and a good one at that it is

1,now that i 've seen the film and the other comments on it it 's a shame that the film is not available in dvd format,now i have to admit that i have n't read a book so i do not know how this film is going for a film
1,the film has a very interesting story line,the movie is about the same thing as the
1,it is not a movie for the,it 's a very funny movie
1,as a matter the film has been done in a very good manner and i think that,as for the rest i would have liked it if it was n't for the acting
1,watch this film and enjoy it,watch it if it 's on cable
1,in the end the film has no redeeming features,in fact it 's a very good movie
1,i was n't expecting a movie to be so bad,i have seen the movie and it is one that i
1,i was surprised to see this movie in a theatre and i,i have to admit i was very impressed with the movie
1,do n't worry that i did n't like,do not waste your time on it
1,i'm a big fan and have never seen a movie like,i'm not sure why i did n't see the film
1,as for the acting i think that 's the point of this film,as a matter of fact the film is not as good as the original
1,le boucher was one that i could watch over,le cercle rouge is a very good film
1,she 's a little more convincing than she was,she is the only one who is able to get
1,in the first film he was the one who was the one to kill the president and,in fact the only thing i can think about was the way the characters are portrayed
1,and it is not the best film of,and the ending is a little unsatisfying
1,it 's a very good film,it is not a film that will
1,he is a very talented director,he 's not the best actor in

1,it is not the worst movie i have ever seen,it 's a shame because it is a movie about a
1,there is a lot of action and the movie has some nice moments,there are a lot more of the same characters in the movie
1,if i had n't been a little more closely into this film,if you want to see the movie i recommend the movie
1,the movie was a bit of an attempt to capitalize on the success of the original,the film is about the struggle between a group of men who have a very deep love
1,reminds us of a movie that was made in a small town,reminds me a lot of a lot more than a dozen
1,even though the film is not a complete disaster the film is a complete mess,even the actors who were n't the main actors were n't bad either as well as
1,but it is a good film and a great movie to see if you are a fan of hers,but the film 's main flaw is the lack of a coherent plot and the acting was terrible
1,this movie was a waste of my life and i ca all be counted by it,this is a movie for those who like to see a good movie with a good cast
1,there are a few good scenes but it is not enough to make you care,there is a scene in which the two men are reunited in a car accident
1,let me say this movie is a great movie,let 's just say that i have n't seen this
1,having seen the first film i was expecting something like the original but i was n't expecting a lot of the same thing i,having said all the things i 've seen in the movie this is the best of all the blackadder movies i have seen
1,lately the movie has a lot to offer and,lately i was n't impressed with the movie
1,the film is a complete waste of time and a complete insult to the intelligence,the movie was shot in a small budget and it was a bit too much to
1,perhaps the director was n't trying too hard,perhaps it 's a good idea to have a
1,daphne zuniga is the only reason i have n't watched her in,daphne is the only person who is able in the film
1,those who are not in love with this movie will be disappointed by the film,those are the only reasons i gave this movie 2 stars out of 5
1,i have to say that this movie was so,i was surprised that this movie was made
1,i have seen the movie twice,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,i have to say i did not enjoy this,i was surprised that the film was made
1,it is not the worst film ever but it is still good and,it 's a shame because the movie is a bit too long
1,i have to say that i was n't impressed with the film,i was surprised that this film did not get released on dvd or
1,all in the family is a very good movie and i recommend this movie to anyone,all the actors were great and the movie is a perfect blend of drama romance romance and
1,be prepared for a few chuckles and some laughs but it 's not,be warned that this is a film that will appeal to all
1,i have to say that this is one that is a waste for,i was surprised that this movie did n't get released on dvd
1,my favorite part of the movie is when a woman is stabbed,my advice is that you do not want to see it

1,i have seen this film twice and i still have nightmares,i was n't impressed by the fact it 's not a comedy
1,she 's a little more than a little stiff but her character was so annoying that i could n't care less,she is the only one to get her to make a good movie and she does n't even have a good reason
1,it is not a movie for the,it 's a very funny movie
1,it 's a very good film,it is not a film that will
1,she is the one to blame,she 's a very good actor and
1,clearly the movie was shot on a low budget but it,clearly this is a film that will appeal for everyone
1,also the film is very good,also i do not think that this
1,most of them are not even funny,most people have seen the movie and it
1,basically the movie is a mess of the original and the acting,basically it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,but the film is not a good movie it 's just not a good one,but it is not a good movie and it 's not even worth renting
1,the film is about the struggle of the two,the movie was a bit of a mess
1,this is the first film i have ever walked across,this movie is a must for anyone who likes a movie
1,this is a very good movie,this movie was so awful it 's
1,maybe it was the director 's intention to make a movie about a man who,maybe the director should have had a better script and more of the director
1,as for the rest of it i was very impressed with,as a matter the movie is not a complete disaster
1,and the movie is so boring,and it 's a shame that the
1,let 's just hope that the next day is still a good one,let me say that this is one of the worst films ever
1,my advice to anyone interested with the film 's message of this movie,my favorite scene is when the girl says she 's a virgin
1,core and a lot of the same actors,core is a film about the life of a
1,for the first half hour or so i was bored,for a film that is a bit of an exercise on
1,you know that it 's a bad thing but the,you can see the movie in a different way
1,jordan is the best of all,jordan 's character is a bit of

1,the film is a complete waste of time,the movie was shot in a small budget
1,the film is a bit of a bore,the movie was shot on location and it was
1,offside was one of those films where,offside is a very good film

1,i was n't impressed with this movie but i,i have seen this movie several years ago
1,thankfully the film is a bit too long,thankfully it is a little bit too much to
1,feel free to be a little too harsh and too,feel like it was filmed on a cheap camcorder
1,whoever wrote this script is the most ignorant of this film,whoever thought that this was a good idea to make it into
1,gabriel 's character was so annoying that i could n't even care about the,gabriel is the only one that has to deal to save his life
1,the movie is about a group that has a different outlook on the,the film has a lot of action and a lot of fun
1,this is a movie that i would,this movie was a complete waste
1,it 's not even a movie it,it is a very funny film
1,there are a few moments of humor that make this film watchable,there is a scene where the two men are talking about the death
1,because the film is so bad it is n't funny it is just plain bad and the actors are all very good and it is a,because of the lack of originality in the script the acting and the plot is just plain awful and the movie does n't even try
1,special effects were pretty good but the story was n't bad enough to make me laugh out of the whole thing,special mention must be given to him for the fact that he is not only the most talented character but also the
1,still the movie was a bit slow,still it 's a great film
1,knowing that the movie was a complete waste for the money it was n't,knowing the story of the movie is about a group that has a different orientation
1,flynn is the best actor in this film,flynn 's character is the most interesting character of
1,i was surprised that this film did not have the,i have to say that i was n't disappointed
1,this movie is a complete waste,this is the first movie that i
1,but the movie is not a complete,but it 's a good thing
1,i was n't expecting much from the film but i was n't expecting much from it but it was n't as,i have seen the original movie and i can tell that the film was a little too long for me
1,it 's not a movie that you will enjoy but it is a great movie,it is a shame that this movie is not only available on video but for sale
1,and the ending was a little too abrupt,and it is a shame that this film has
1,luckily it is not the same as a film that has a few faults in it that are,luckily the film 's biggest success was the fact that it was made in the late seventies
1,however i was n't expecting a good film,however the movie was n't so bad it 's
1,samuel fuller is the master of this film and,samuel l west is the best actor ever
1,troma 's film is a great film that,troma is a master in the genre

1,the unguarded is a very entertaining film that will appeal to anyone with an open mind,the merry man' has been a favorite of mine and the film is a must for anyone
1,everything is illuminated is a great movie,everything about this movie was bad and i
1,the movie is a bit slow and boring,the film has some good moments but the story
1,but it is not the worst movie i,but the film is a little slow

1,an excellent film that i recommend to anyone who enjoys a great film,an interesting film about a man 's struggle with the woman who is the
1,however i do not recommend it,however the film is a bit too
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,nonetheless the film is a little too slow and the ending too,nonetheless it is not the worst movie i have ever seen
1,if i were to give this movie an extra star rating i 'd be generous,if you 're a fan like myself you will be disappointed by the film 's shortcomings

1,spoiler alert the movie was shot on a cheap budget,spoiler ahead i have to say that the movie was very
1,akshay kumar was a great actor and,akshay khanna is the perfect actor
1,dassin 's film has a very strong and,dassin is a master in this film
1,detectives are the only people who can survive the whole thing and the,detectives and dolls and the film 's main protagonist is a caricature
1,despite being the most controversial of the two movies i 've seen the first one and i was impressed with the acting,despite the fact that the film was made in a hurry the film was very good and the actors were very good and
1,there is no reason to see this movie unless,there are some good scenes in this film
1,the movie was shot in a small budget,the film is a complete waste of time
1,i have seen this movie twice,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,i have to say i did n't enjoy this movie,i was surprised that the film did n't have to rely
1,sadly the film is not a complete disaster but the,sadly it is n't the worst film ever made
1,i have seen this movie several years and,i was n't impressed with this movie
1,the film has a lot of action and a few moments of humor but it is n't,the movie is about a group that has a lot of fun and the movie is about the

1,i was n't expecting a lot of,i have seen the movie twice
1,i have to say i did n't enjoy the film but i was n't disappointed,i was surprised that the film did n't get a theatrical dvd release but i do
1,worse yet the film 's only redeeming feature is that the film has a lot to offer and the film is very well made and the,worse than that of the original the film 's plot is very good and the acting was good but the script was n't as good
1,no one has ever heard about it,no matter how much you love it or
1,though it is not as bad as the original it is still pretty bad and it is not even worth renting,though the film is a bit dated at times i found myself wondering why the director chose to use his own imagination
1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,and the ending is a bit abrupt and i was,and it is not the worst film ever made
1,the film is about the struggle of the people in a different world,the movie was a bit of a mess but i did not expect it

1,the movie was shot in the same way that the story of the book is a,the film is a complete mess of a film that has been released on dvd
1,as a result of the film it 's not even that good and the acting was terrible and the plot is just awful and the characters were,as for me i was impressed by the fact that the film was shot on location in the same way as it was in a movie
1,it is a very funny movie,it 's not even a good film
1,why is it that i ca only say the movie was n't that,why did they have to make a movie that was so bad
1,i was surprised to find out the film is n't going for a,i have to admit that i have seen this movie several times
1,but it 's not the best of it 's kind,but the movie was a bit too long for the most
1,the movie was a waste of my time,the film is about a group of young people
1,this movie is a must for all lovers,this is the first film i 've seen that
1,for a film that was a little bit of a letdown i could n't believe how many of these scenes are,for the first half of this film i thought that the film was going to be a little too long
1,the movie was shot on a low level,the film is a bit slow but it is
1,the movie was shot on location in a small town,the film is a bit of an action movie
1,nothing is explained in the film that the film has a lot to,nothing really happens and it is n't a good movie to watch
1,and the ending is so bad that i,and it is not a good film
1,this movie is not for the squeamish but it 's worth watching for the music,this is the worst film i have ever had to sit down and enjoy
1,but it is not a movie,but the film is not as good
1,start off as an interesting premise and a good idea,start with the fact of the matter that is the case
1,in the first movie he was a little too old to play a character who,in fact the film is not as good as it is in the book
1,the movie is about the power of a young man and the consequences that,the film has a very good story and the actors are all excellent
1,this movie was so awful that i was laughing hysterically at the tv,this is a very good film and i would definitely like it
1,did n't you think the movie would have made a good,did i forget the fact i was watching this film
1,at the end the film ends with a bang,at least it 's not a bad film but the
1,to me this was the best movie i have seen,to be honest i was n't impressed with this movie
1,i have to admit i did not enjoy the film,i was surprised to see that the movie was made for
1,i was n't expecting much of a film,i have seen the original version of this movie
1,she 's not the best actress but she 's not the only,she is a very talented woman and a very good actress
1,somerset sinatra is the perfect actor for the part,somerset is the only one who is a good actor
1,betrayal is not a common theme,betrayal and love is not a movie
1,the film has a lot of action and the plot twists and turns of the movie are interesting and the characters,the movie is about a group that has been kidnapped by a bunch of men and a group of men
1,it 's a shame because it 's a great film,it is not the worst movie ever but it 's not
1,a lot of the scenes are filmed in the same way that they are used to create the atmosphere,a few of them are not as bad as they were but i think the film was a bit too
1,i have seen this film several years and,i was n't impressed by this movie
1,i was surprised that this film was made in the first ten minutes,i have to say that i have n't seen this film in a while
1,sorry but this is the worst movie,sorry to say i was disappointed
1,also the movie is not as good,also i think the director should be ashamed
1,this movie is a complete waste of time and money and time and money,this is the first movie that has a good plot and is a great film
1,can you say the movie is n't bad it 's just,can i say that the film is a complete waste
1,the film has some good points but the story is,the movie is a bit of an action film
1,as a result of the film it is not a film to watch and it is a very difficult task to watch it to the end and,as for me i was impressed by this movie and i was surprised to see it in the theater and it is a very enjoyable film
1,the movie was shot in a small budget,the film is a complete waste of time
1,but it is a good movie and i recommend it to all who like to watch it and watch it,but the film 's main problem is that the story does n't make sense and is n't even remotely entertaining and
1,my advice is to avoid this movie at all costs unless your a,my favorite part is when a man is stabbed by a car
1,but the film is not as good,but it is not a movie
1,but it is a good film and a good one,but the film 's main flaw is the fact it 's
1,she is the one who has the best lines in the movie,she 's a very talented actress and she 's not just the kind
1,does anyone else think that the film was made for tv and the director and producers were not interested in the production,does n't it have to have a lot to do with the plot and it 's a bit of an insult
1,lastly the movie has some very funny moments,lastly it 's a very good film and a
1,this movie was a waste of my life and my money,this is a movie for those who like to watch a good
1,another problem is that the film is not as good and as a whole it is n't a good film,another thing i noticed is the way that the characters are portrayed as the characters and the story is so real
1,the film is a bit of an exercise in the plot but it is a very good film,the movie was shot on location in the middle east and was filmed in a very small budget and
1,just as a film is about the life of the,just like the other two movies i have watched
1,3 out of 5 stars for this,3 the movie is about a group of
1,this is a movie for everyone who wants a good,this movie was a waste for the first time
1,he 's a great director and a good,he is the only one to die
1,with a few twists and turns and a few twists to keep the viewer entertained throughout this movie it is hard for,with the exception of a couple who are not in the film the film is a complete mess of a film
1,john wayne is the perfect choice to play the role,john goodman 's character is so annoying and the plot is
1,it is not the worst movie ever but i have to admit,it 's a shame because it 's a very good film
1,final thoughts i have to admit i was n't disappointed by the movie,final verdict the film was a bit too slow for me but it 's
1,the film is a bit slow and boring,the movie was shot on a budget of 1
1,even though the film is a bit slow at times i think it is,even the actors who were in the film were n't very good either
1,there is no real reason to watch it,there are some very good moments in the film
1,this is the worst movie i 've seen,this movie is not a good movie
1,in the end the film is not as bad but the acting and the,in fact it 's a shame that the film is n't as good
1,it is not the best movie i have ever had to sit down,it 's a shame that this movie has not been released theatrically
1,this is the first film that has,this movie is a must see
1,the film is about a group of young people,the movie was a waste of my time
1,i'm a fan of the genre but this is the worst movie i 've seen,i'm not a fan but i have a lot of respect to this movie
1,the film has some of its most,the movie is a complete mess
1,i'm not a big fan of movies like this one but i,i'm a fan and have never seen a film like this
1,okay so i was expecting a lot more from the movie,okay i have seen this film several years and i have to
1,he 's not a bad actor but a very bad one,he is a great director and he 's a great director and
1,if you want a movie that does not need to be made in a theater then you will probably,if i had to give this movie a 0 out 10 it is a good movie to watch
1,this is the worst movie ever,this movie is not a bad movie
1,not only does it look like it was filmed in the same year but it 's still,not to mention that the film was made in a very short period of the time
1,i was surprised that this movie did not get a wider audience award nomination,i have to say that this is a great movie and i recommend it
1,well the movie is n't bad but it 's just,well i guess it 's not a good film
1,the movie was shot on a budget of about a dozen hundred dollars,the film is a bit slow and boring but the acting and the acting
1,his performance in this movie was so bad that i,his character is a caricature of a young woman
1,the movie was a bit of a letdown but i was n't expecting it,the film is about the struggle of a young man to his life and his
1,there is no real reason for this movie to have any real plot,there are some very good scenes and the film is a bit too slow
1,it 's not a bad movie,it is a shame because it is
1,tarnished the first time of the film 's release,tarnished is the best of all of them and the
1,scoffs to the camera and the actors,scoffs at a young man 's body
1,charm and a lot more than a few words are delivered in the movie,charm is a little too long for me but i do n't know what the
1,the film has some of its moments but the story is so predictable and the acting that it,the movie is a complete mess of the first film and it 's not even the first
1,they are all very good actors and actresses,they 're all in a very bad situation and
1,the movie was shot in the same way as a,the film is a complete mess of a movie
1,overall the film was very good and i,overall this is a very bad movie
1,the film has some good points and some good,the movie is a bit of a mess
1,as a matter the movie was a complete waste,as for the rest of the movie i have to
1,save yourself a favor do not see it,save your money and rent a copy of the
1,all in the family is a very funny movie and a great movie,all the actors were great and the story line was great and i loved
1,am i the one that i would have,am a huge fan of this film
1,only a couple who have seen the original version are the ones that are n't the best,only the most ardent fan would have to have been able to see the movie as a child
1,frank morgan plays a very likable character,frank sinatra is a great actor
1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,if i were n't so engrossed in the story and the acting it would have been a little more enjoyable,if you 're looking to see the worst film ever put on the dvd i would advise anyone to watch it
1,he 's a great director and a good,he is the only one to die
1,if you 're looking for a movie that is so good you can see,if i were n't for a good time this would be the one
1,this is the first film that i 've ever seen,this movie is a must see for anyone who loves action
1,got a lot of money from the cast,got the best actor oscar for this movie
1,wow this is a good movie,wow i was so excited that this
1,this movie was a waste for me,this is a movie for everyone
1,it is not the best movie i have ever had to watch,it 's a shame that this movie has not been released on video
1,of all of the films i 've seen this is one,of course the movie is a little slow and boring
1,but the film 's main problem with,but it is a good movie
1,alex 's father and son are a bit,alex is a very good character actor
1,again the movie is not a complete disaster,again i have n't seen this film in years
1,the movie is about a group of young people trying their best,the film has a lot of potential and the acting is good
1,tierney 's performance is a little too wooden and too overthetop for her,tierney is a great actor and i have seen her in several movies
1,this is the worst movie ever made and,this movie is not a bad film
1,in fact it 's not even the worst of it 's,in the end the movie is a very good one
1,i was n't expecting much from the movie,i have seen the original movie and it 's
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,from the opening scene of a man masturbating with a man in,from a very good opening scene to a very good ending
1,the film has some good moments but it is n't,the movie is a bit slow and the ending was just
1,he is a very good character actor,he 's not the only one to blame
1,nevermind the fact that the movie is not about a man,nevermind that it 's not a movie that is n't
1,it 's a shame that the movie is so much better than this movie,it is not the best film ever but it is a great movie

1,despite being the most controversial of the two movies i 've always been the judge of the movie and the fact that it was made for tv and i,despite the fact that the film was made in a hurry to be a good film the acting was pretty bad and the plot is just too weak
1,unfortunately the movie is not a complete disaster,unfortunately it 's a bit of a stretch for
1,one of the best films i have ever seen and the most memorable part of this movie,one thing i liked about the film is the fact that it was made for tv and it
1,the movie was shot in the same location and the same actors in the movie,the film is a complete mess of the first movie and the second is the most
1,worse than that of the other movies,worse yet the film 's plot is so

1,it is a very good movie,it 's not even the best movie
1,overall this is a great movie,overall the film was a bit slow
1,ca all about this movie and the acting is,ca n't wait to get a good laugh
1,perhaps it was the fact that it was a little bit too long for the first two minutes,perhaps the most memorable scene in the movie was the scene where she was in a car accident and
1,that 's what makes this film great,that is the only thing that makes it
1,unfortunately it is n't a good film and the acting is n't as good as it should be and,unfortunately the film is a bit too long for its time and it is n't even that good
1,if you want a movie to watch with a bunch of mates and you have a chance to see this movie you will be right off your list,if i had to give it an extra point i 'd give this a 0 out of ten i give this movie a 1 out of 10
1,given the choice to be the most recognizable of the two leads i,given that this is a movie that is not a complete waste
1,over the course of a long long long long long time we see a woman strangling her and she is forced to,over all i think this is a very good movie and it 's a shame that it is not a remake
1,my favorite scene was the one where he was talking to his friend and said that he had a gun,my advice to the director of the movie was to see the film and the film was a waste
1,a few of them are not so much a bit more than that but they are very good,a lot of the scenes are shot in the same way as if they were filmed on the set
1,the movie is a complete mess of a film that has been made to entertain the audience and it 's not even worth the time to view this movie it 's a waste your money and your time,the film has some of its moments that are not only highlighted but the story of a young woman who has been in a relationship for a long while and is very very very very very very beautiful and

1,the film has some good points and is a,the movie is a bit of a bore
1,practically every character in this movie is so stupid that you wonder,practically all of the actors were good and i liked it
1,for a movie about a man 's journey to the world,for the most part it 's a little too slow
1,some of them are not funny and the acting was horrible but i,some people have said that the movie is a bit too long

1,he is a great actor and a,he 's not a good guy
1,in the first film he was a little more than a year old and the movie was n't even a good movie,in fact the only thing i liked about the film is the fact that it was filmed in a very tight location and
1,robin williams is a good choice for this role but the film does n't have much of a point to him and the film does not have a particularly interesting ending,robin hood 's performance is a little stiff and the film is a little slow but it is a bit of a mess and a bit of an action movie

1,the movie is about the same subject as the first movie and the second half of it was pretty good,the film has a very interesting plot but the story is so predictable that i ca n't even think about the
1,lame acting bad script bad acting,lame and dumber the movie has a
1,like the first film the characters were very believable and believable,like i said it was n't a bad movie but it 's
1,the film has some good moments but the rest of it is just plain awful,the movie is a bit slow and boring but the story line was very interesting and
1,to me it was the worst movie ever,to be fair i did not see the movie
1,dennis quaid is a good actor,dennis hopper plays a very likable character
1,a lot of people are talking to this film and i think it is the best film,a few of the scenes were filmed in the same location as in the first one
1,this is a very good movie and it is,this movie was so awful it was funny

1,eleanor is the one who is the only,eleanor parker is a very good actor
1,errol is a great character actor,errol flynn plays a young woman in
1,mandy moore is the perfect choice to be a woman in this film and,mandy lane plays a woman whose husband is killed by a mysterious woman
1,however the film is a little too slow for me and i was n't impressed with it at all and i was n't,however i do not recommend this film to anyone who enjoys the genre and wants to see a lot of good movies
1,we are supposed to believe the director and the director of,we have a lot more to do with the plot
1,at least it was a little bit of a letdown,at the end of the film i felt like i had
1,eric stoltz is the only one that is good,eric bana plays the part with a smile and a
1,the movie is about the same subject as the book and it 's not a bad movie but,the film has a very interesting plot but the acting is so poor it is almost embarrassing
1,three of them were the best in the movie and they did a great job,three years later the two men are married and the men are reunited with each others
1,it is a very funny film and,it 's not even a movie
1,the movie was a bit of an attempt at a horror film,the film is about the struggle between a man who is in the
1,so the movie is a bit of a bore,so i guess it was n't the case
1,and it is a shame because it is not the worst film ever made but,and the ending was a bit abrupt and the ending was just plain awful

1,it 's a very funny film,it is not a movie that you
1,eventually the film begins with a bang of the eye and then the film ends,eventually he meets a young man who is a bit of a geena davis type and
1,not only is it a complete waste of money but the film itself,not to say the film is a complete mess but it 's a good
1,this is a very bad film and it is,this movie was so bad it was good
1,the film has some of the most,the movie is a complete waste
1,why is it that the only reason i gave it a,why did they have such an awful idea of this

1,the movie was shot on location and the acting is pretty good,the film is a bit of a mess but it 's not as
1,my advice is that if your a true horror movie fan this movie is for you,my favorite part of this movie is the scene where she 's talking to the girl and
1,amber 's character was a bit of a jerk but i was n't really sure what,amber is the only person that has to deal with the situation of the two
1,in the first movie he is a good guy but the one that he,in fact the film is a little too much for the younger generation
1,ok so the film is n't a bad movie,ok i know that this is a movie for kids
1,oh yeah and the movie was a little too much,oh and the music is n't that bad either

1,it is a shame because it is,it 's not a bad movie
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,if you want to see the movie i suggest that you do not have,if i had n't been a little more careful i 'd be able
1,more importantly it 's a film about a young,more than a little of a good idea
1,in fact the only thing i can think of that was the acting,in the first film he was the one to kill the girl
1,like the first film the acting was pretty good,like i said it was a great movie and it
1,add to the film the fact that the film is set up,add a few extra twists to make it all the better
1,it 's not even the worst of,it is a very good film
1,there is a scene where a man is walking through a,there are a few moments that are funny and funny

1,this movie was so awful that i was compelled to watch it,this is a very good film and i recommend this film
1,a few years ago the movie is a little slow and boring,a lot more than a few of those movies i 've seen
1,no one is going for a moment,no matter what the cost is the director
1,i was n't impressed with the movie,i have seen this movie twice
1,cheap and dull but it is a good film,cheap action sequences are used to create the atmosphere and
1,this is a movie for everyone,this movie was a waste for me
1,maybe the director was trying to make,maybe it was a good thing
1,if you 're looking to see the movie you 'll find yourself asking for more,if i were n't so engrossed in this film i would n't have been surprised by
1,the film has a lot to do with the plot and it 's,the movie is about a young man named benjamin and the girl
1,for the most of us who are n't familiar with,for a movie that is n't even a comedy
1,both the actors are very good and,both of them are very funny
1,i have seen this movie twice and i have to say that it is one of my favorite films,i was n't impressed with the film and the plot is so bad it 's hard to follow

1,unfortunately it 's a little too long for me,unfortunately the movie is n't a complete waste
1,anne heche plays the part with a smile,anne reid is the only one that has a
1,otherwise it 's not a bad film,otherwise the movie is not as good and

1,the movie was a bit slow but i was surprised to see the,the film is about the same subject as a typical hollywood film
1,in fact the only thing that kept the movie from getting,in the first film he is a very talented character
1,can i say that this is a very bad,can you say the same thing about it

1,the film has a very good cast,the movie is about the power and the
1,i have seen this film several years and,i was n't impressed by this movie
1,well i guess i was n't expecting a,well the movie was n't that great
1,as a matter the film has been made in a few weeks,as for the rest i would have given it a zero
1,the film is a complete waste of time and a waste,the movie was shot in a small budget and it 's not
1,you can see that the actors are all in love with,you know that the film is going to be bad
1,disappointed me that this film was made for the first time in a long time,disappointed is the fact that the movie is so bad it 's good it is not
1,naming a movie is the first one i 've,naming the film is a very good film
1,in fact it 's a shame because the film was shot on a budget that would,in the end the film is a bit too long for the viewer to follow
1,yet the movie is not as good as the first one but it is n't,yet it 's a great movie to see and it is a must see

1,and it 's not a bad movie,and the movie was so boring
1,as for me i was n't impressed by this film and it 's not a good film either but i do not think it 's the best movie ever made,as a result of the fact it was a movie about a young woman who is a little more than a little girl she is a very good person who has
1,while the film was shot in the seventies it 's not a movie to watch,while i was n't expecting much of a film i was n't expecting much from this
1,but the film is a little slow,but it is not the worst movie i
1,in the end it is not the worst movie i 've ever seen but i 've been watching,in fact it is a very good film and i would definitely like to see a sequel
1,the movie is about a group of young men in a remote cabin who lives in a small town in the middle east and have been evacuated from their past,the film has a lot of potential and it 's not a good movie but the performances by all the cast members are very good and it 's a shame to
1,this is the first film i have seen in a while,this movie is a must for anyone interested in a movie
1,less of the plot of a movie that is n't a complete mess,less than a few of the actors are good and it 's a good
1,after the movie was over i was n't expecting much,after a while i had a feeling that the movie would
1,i was n't expecting much of this film,i have seen the original version and i can
1,angelina and ashley are the only two people who can find their love to love,angelina jolie plays the part with the character and she 's a bit too old for
1,do not watch it if your looking to see,do n't waste your money on this movie
1,immediately the movie is set up as the first of the,immediately he is forced to confront his wife and son
1,one of my favorites was that the movie is not a complete disaster but it 's not a bad film it is just plain awful,one thing that i did n't really understand was the scene where the two guys were sitting on a table and talking about the same time
1,the movie is a bit of an insult,the film has some good points but it 's
1,for the first time i saw the movie in the theater,for a film about a young woman she is attracted by her
1,the movie was a bit of an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the first two,the film is about the struggle between a group and the two of them and their relationship
1,but the film is not as good,but it is not a movie
1,no one is a good guy but he,no matter what you 're talking about
1,she 's not a bad guy,she is a great actress and she
1,this is the first movie that i,this movie is a complete waste
1,christine 's character was so annoying that i could n't help thinking,christine is the only one that has to deal to survive
1,whether or not the movie was actually made by the same director as a director or a writer 's work,whether it is a comedy or a drama it 's a comedy and a comedy that 's not funny and not
1,while i was n't expecting much from the film i was expecting something like this,while the film was shot in a very tight budget the costumes and costumes were pretty
1,the movie is about the power of a young man who has a,the film has a very good story and the actors and actresses
1,the film is a bit slow but it is,the movie was shot on a low level
1,i have seen this movie twice,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,timon is the only person who has to deal to find out who he is,timon and pumbaa is a very funny movie that is worth watching for all
1,that 's what makes this movie so great,that is the only thing i did n't get
1,while the film was a bit long it still managed to keep my attention,while i was n't impressed with the story it 's a very good movie and
1,she is the one who has the best lines in this film,she 's a very talented actress and she 's not a bad actor
1,why is this movie rated r,why did n't he just go back
1,and it is a very funny movie,and the ending was so bad
1,just as a film about a man 's life and his,just like the other reviewer i have seen the film
1,falon 's father is a very good guy,falon is a great character and the supporting cast
1,lee 's direction is the best thing in this movie,lee is a good actor and he is a good choice
1,michael dudikoff is the only actor who can save the movie,michael caine plays a young man whose wife is a lawyer
1,in the first film the characters are all very likable and the story line,in fact the only reason why this film was made was the acting
1,after the movie was released the film became an instant success,after a while i was n't sure what to do
1,if you 're a fan like myself and you have a strong stomach for,if i were to give this movie a 1 i 'd be generous
1,i was surprised that the film was n't so much more of a thriller,i have to say i did not like this movie but i was very impressed
1,if you want a movie that is a little bit too long for you to enjoy this movie then you will like it,if i had to give this a 0 out 10 i 'd say that i have n't read the novel and i do not
1,this movie was so awful that i could n't help thinking that it was a joke,this is a very good film and it is a shame because the film has a very
1,robin hood 's character is a little bit of a,robin williams is the perfect actor for the role
1,my advice is that you do not want a good laugh,my favorite part of the movie is when the girl is trying
1,regardless of the fact the movie was shot on a budget of about,regardless the film was a waste of time and money and money
1,out of all of them the film is a bit too slow,out there the movie is a complete mess of the original
1,she is a great actress and she,she 's not a bad guy
1,maybe it was a good idea to show the movie,maybe the director was trying too much to be too hard
1,the film is a bit slow but it is,the movie was shot on a low level
1,be prepared for the best of all the bad guys,be warned that the film was made for tv and the
1,the film is about a group of young people,the movie was a waste of my time
1,it is not a film that will,it 's a very good film
1,the movie was a waste for the movie,the film is about a young man who has
1,it is not the worst movie ever made,it 's a shame because it 's not a
1,i have to admit i did n't like the movie,i was surprised to see that this movie was released in
1,the film is about a group that is,the movie was a waste of time
1,in fact the only reason i gave this film 2 out,in the first film the main characters were the same
1,the film is about the struggle between the two men,the movie was a bit of an action film but it
1,this is a movie that is n't,this movie was a complete disappointment
1,being a fan i was very impressed by this film,being the only person in the world i was able for
1,on a technical level the acting is superb,on the plus the movie has some good moments
1,many of us have seen this movie and it is a great movie,many people have said that this movie was so bad that i could not
1,sometimes it is n't that bad but it is not,sometimes the film is a little too slow and too predictable
1,fortunately it is not the case with the film,fortunately the film 's only saving grace was that the
1,then the movie switches to the characters and the plot,then there is a scene where the hero 's character is
1,supposedly it 's not the best movie i 've seen but it is a good movie to,supposedly the movie is a bit of a bore but it is a very enjoyable movie
1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i have seen this film twice
1,if you want to see a good film about the evils and war of war this is a film to see and enjoy,if i had n't been in a coma for a few years i 'd have to have a little more respect for this film
1,i was n't impressed with the movie,i have seen this movie twice
1,but it is a good film,but the film 's main flaw was
1,at least the movie was a bit of a letdown,at the same moment i was surprised to see the film
1,i have seen this movie several years and,i was n't impressed with this movie
1,because the movie was so bad it was good,because of this movie it is not that bad but
1,sounds good and i do n't think it 's the best movie,sounds like a good idea to have a good time travel
1,it is a shame that this movie is n't even available on video,it 's not a movie that you will see in your lifetime
1,personally the film is not a comedy,personally i would n't have to say this
1,more importantly the film 's plot is a little,more than anything i would have liked it
1,sadly it is n't a good movie,sadly the film is a bit slow
1,chow yunfat plays a character that is n't funny,chow yun fat was a great choice for this film
1,it 's a shame because the film is so bad it 's almost laughable,it is not the worst film i have ever had the displeasure of watching but
1,the movie is a bit of an action movie,the film has some good points but the rest of
1,in the end it is a great movie to watch and enjoy,in fact it is a great movie to watch and enjoy and enjoy
1,it is not a movie that is n't,it 's a very funny film and a good
1,he is a great actor and he is a good actor but i do not think he is a good director,he 's not a good guy but a bad guy who is n't even remotely funny at the same level
1,here 's a movie that i would recommend watching this movie,here is the story the story is about a young man named
1,the movie was a waste of time and money and time,the film is about a group that has a lot to do
1,during the course of this movie the viewer is left wondering why the characters were so stupid and the whole thing was,during a brief shootout with the girl she is rescued and killed by a werewolf and then later she is killed
1,his character was a bit too unlikable and i could n't help,his performance is so good and the story is so good
1,never before have we seen a film that is as bad and worse as the first one and that 's a good thing because the movie is a complete waste,never mind the fact it is a film about a man who has been a homosexual for a while and has a wife who is not only a very young woman
1,both of these films are the most important and most of the time and the film is not a good movie but,both the story of a man and his wife are a very interesting one and the film is very well done
1,their performances are very good and i think that the actors were very,their relationship with each of them is so much better than that
1,i have to admit that i have n't read a lot about the book but i have to admit i was very impressed with the film and the way it was made,i was surprised to find out the movie was made in the early 80 'searly 80 minutes and it was n't even that bad it was just plain awful and it was just
1,i have seen the original version and it 's,i was n't expecting much of this movie
1,detective and wife is a very funny movie,detective is the only thing he does
1,at least it 's not a good film,at the end the film ends abruptly and we
1,enjoyed the film and i was impressed by the acting and direction,enjoyed it and it 's a shame because the movie is so good
1,plus it 's a shame that the,plus the movie was so good
1,this movie was so bad it was good,this is a very bad film and it is
1,this is the worst movie ever made,this movie is not a bad film but
1,it 's a very funny movie and i,it is not a movie for everyone
1,in fact it 's a shame that this movie is n't,in the end the film is not a bad movie
1,it is not the best film i have seen in a long time,it 's a shame that the film is n't so bad it is n't
1,to me this is a very bad movie,to be honest the film was a little slow
1,really it is n't a movie that you can watch and,really the movie is n't bad but it is not
1,the film is about the struggle of a man,the movie was a bit of a letdown
1,for the most of us this is a very bad film,for a movie that is a bit too much for the first
1,when the movie was released it was released in theaters and it was released in theaters,when i first saw the movie in the theatre i thought i 'd be very impressed by
1,it is not the worst film i have seen but it is a good movie to watch,it 's a shame because the film is a bit slow and boring but it 's not as
1,there are some good scenes and some good ones,there is no reason to watch this film
1,director michael winner is the master and director,director john woo has a very good eye for
1,i'm a big big fan of the original,i'm not sure what the director is thinking but
1,promising movie about the evils and the consequences of the people involved in their own,promising to say the best of the best but it 's a great movie
1,and it is not a good film,and the ending is so bad that i
1,but it is a great movie,but the film 's biggest problem with
1,the film has a very good story line,the movie is about the power of the human
1,when i first saw the movie in the theatre it looked interesting,when the movie was released it was released in the us
1,things get worse when the girl gets her head blown up and the girl gets her head chopped,things are n't really going easy to follow and the plot is a little too predictable for a movie
1,he 's a very talented actor and a good guy but,he is the most annoying person i 've ever seen
1,then there 's a few scenes that are n't even funny and the,then the film switches gears from a few seconds to a shot
1,and it 's a good movie to see,and the movie is a bit too long for
1,upon the arrival of the young girl he befriends her husband,upon arrival the film begins to drag and it 's a bit
1,actually it is a good movie to watch and i think that it is worth watching,actually the movie was a little too slow and the ending was just plain stupid and the
1,sarah silverman was a great actress and she was very convincing,sarah michelle gellar plays the mother who is the only one who
1,that 's the way it 's presented in this film,that is what i think is the best of the movie
1,you know what to do with the story and you 'll find it interesting,you can tell that the film was made in the us and the studio has
1,yes it 's a bit slow but it is n't a good film and the acting was n't bad,yes the film was shot in a small town but it 's not a movie that is a little too
1,i have to say i was very impressed by the movie,i was surprised that the movie did not get a wider audience
1,one thing that really annoyed the movie for my,one of my favorite films of the year
1,the movie is a bit of a mess but it is n't a,the film has some good points and some of them are good
1,the movie was a waste of time and money,the film is about a group that has a very
1,it 's a very good movie,it is not a film for the
1,most of the time i was n't impressed with the movie and the movie did,most people are n't interested with this movie but it 's a good movie
1,best of all the film was a great success to me and i was very impressed with the story,best line is the scene where he is talking about the death penalty and the fact he 's a man
1,it 's a very funny movie and i,it is not a movie for everyone
1,they 're not even funny and the film does n't even try,they are not the only ones who are n't in this film
1,angels are the most interesting characters in this film and the movie is very well made and well acted and the,angels and demons is a movie about a young woman who is attracted to a woman who is in love
1,not to say the movie was bad,not only is it not a good movie
1,this movie was so awful it was funny,this is a very good movie and it is
1,if you want to see the worst film of all time this is the one,if i had n't been a fan of the original series it might 've had a
1,but it is not the worst movie ever made but,but the film is a little slow and boring
1,similar to this one is a bit of a,similar in the us and the film industry
1,there are a few moments that make me laugh,there is a scene where a woman is stabbed in
1,with the exception being the first movie the acting was good but the story was n't that good,with a few exceptions i would have given this movie a zero but i do n't think that the
1,if you 're a diehard horror buff and want a good laugh out of the movie you,if i were to rate this movie a zero i 'd rate this film a 10
1,xxx is the most popular movie i have ever watched and i have,xxx 's story is a bit of an insult to the original
1,but the movie is a bit too slow for me,but it 's a great film and it 's not just
1,the film is about a young man named kenny played,the movie was a waste for the whole family
1,this is the first movie i have seen that i have seen so many,this movie is a complete mess of a film that has been made
1,often the film 's plot has a lot of holes and the ending feels like a rushed,often i do n't think that the director was aiming to be a little too clever
1,the film has a very good story and the acting was good,the movie is about the power of a young woman who has been
1,now that i have n't read the novel,now i have seen a lot worse
1,particularly when you consider that the film was shot in a very small town,particularly the scene in the middle where the girl 's character was a little too
1,the film has a very good story and the acting is superb,the movie is about the power of a young woman and the consequences
1,in the end it is not the best movie i have seen in,in fact it is a very good movie and i recommend it
1,example that it is not a film that is not,example the fact of the film is the acting
1,this movie was so bad that i could n't even finish it i was n't bored,this is a very bad movie and i would have to say that it is a very
1,action is the best part of the movie and it is n't,action packed and the film has some great moments in it
1,i was n't impressed with this movie but it was n't,i have seen this movie several years ago and it is still
1,to be honest the film is not as,to me this is a great movie
1,when the film was released the movie was released in a very cheap way,when i saw the trailer for this film on tv i thought it would get
1,the movie was shot on location in the early 1800 'searly 1950 and the early 80 'searly 80 minutes of the film and the director 's vision of the camera is very,the film is a bit of an exercise into the genre of the genre but it 's still a great film to watch and enjoy and it is definitely worth seeing
1,naturally the movie has some of its moments but it is n't a good film,naturally it 's a very good movie and i think it 's a good movie to
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,in fact the only reason i watched this movie is because i have n't,in the first film the main character 's father is killed and killed
1,he 's a great actor and a good actor,he is the only person that has to deal to
1,boring plot twists that make no sense at all and the ending is just plain stupid,boring and boring and not worth the time to watch it again and i do not think
1,our hero and his friends are the same,our heroes are not as bad and they 're
1,there is no real reason for this to be a good film but it 's not,there are some very good scenes and some of the best scenes are when the kids are
1,and it 's not even the best movie i have,and the movie was a complete waste of time
1,being a big budget fan i have to admit that this is a very good film and i would recommend this movie for anyone interested with,being the first movie to be a classic i have to admit i did not like it but i was n't expecting much from it
1,in fact it is not the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune of seeing but,in the end it 's a good film to watch and it is a must see
1,i was n't impressed with the film and the acting was n't bad but it was not,i have seen this movie twice and i have never been so impressed by the movie
1,the movie was a bit of an attempt at a horror movie,the film is about the struggle between a man who is a man
1,and the movie was so boring,and it 's not a bad movie
1,the film has some of the worst dialogue ever,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,the film has some good moments and the story is very interesting and the characters,the movie is a bit slow but it 's not a bad movie either
1,or the fact it 's not a movie that 's not even worth a look,or maybe the director 's intention was that the director had no intention to do it
1,there are some good moments in this movie but it 's just,there is no reason for the to go to the movies
1,on the plus side it is a very good film,on a technical note the film has some nice photography
1,when i saw the movie on tv i thought it would get better,when the film was over i was so bored i was laughing hysterically at
1,alice is the only person who has to deal with the situation,alice 's character was a little bit too much for me
1,for the first half hour or two of the film it becomes apparent why they 're so much more than the sum,for a film that is a little too much for a thriller it is a very good movie and one of my favorite
1,i was n't impressed with the movie,i have seen this movie twice
1,the movie was a bit of an action movie but the story was so,the film is about the struggle between the characters of the two protagonists
1,while i do not think that the film is worth watching it is not a movie for anyone who wants to see a movie that 's,while the movie is not a comedy i do n't know why the director was so pleased with this film and it was n't funny
1,to me this is a very bad film and i do n't think that it is the worst film i,to be honest the film was a bit too slow and too slow for me to really enjoy it
1,richard gere is the only one who can act and is the only one that is good,richard widmark plays a very likable character who has a very difficult role to play and is very
1,steiger 's performance as a character in the film was so bad it,steiger is a great actor and he 's not a bad guy
1,this movie was so awful that i could n't even finish it,this is a very good film and it is not for everyone who
1,there are some good moments in the movie but the film does n't have the same plot,there is no reason for the existence to come to the fore and the film does n't even
1,could have done a better job of making a film,could n't they have done it better with a lot more
1,the movie is about the power and soul that the characters have to overcome and the characters and,the film has a very good cast and the actors and actresses deliver a great supporting performance
1,dr hackenstein has a small role as a doctor,dr jacques coulardeau is a film about the life of
1,by far one of my favorites of the genre,by the end i was a little confused but the
1,i was surprised to see this film,i have to admit i was n't disappointed
1,my favorite scene is where a man is talking to his wife and,my advice to anyone who has ever been a fan of hers
1,the movie was shot on a budget of 1,the film is a bit slow and boring
1,before i wrap it off the acting is horrible and the story line is just awful,before the film 's release i found it a bit more enjoyable than i expected
1,this is a movie that is not only a very good film,this movie was a complete disappointment to watch and i did not even
1,c thomas is the only person who is a real jerk and he is not a good actor,c aubrey smith is the only reason i can think of why this film is not a classic in
1,either the acting or directing is horrible and,either way it is a great film
1,90 minutes into this movie you get a sense of what 's happening and how the characters are going to be so,90 percent of the film is a complete mess of the first film and the second one was a little disappointing
1,the film is about the struggle between a man and a,the movie was a bit of an attempt at humor
1,when the film is released it 's a very good film and it is not,when i saw this movie on tv it seemed to have been made by a bunch
1,even the actors are n't very good either,even though the movie was a little bit too
1,and it is a shame because the movie is a bit slow and the story,and the ending was a bit too predictable and the story was too predictable
1,it 's not even a good movie but a good movie to watch,it is a very funny movie and it 's not a bad film it
1,but the movie is a bit too slow for the most part and,but it 's a great film and it 's a great film
1,my favorite part is the one with a,my advice is to watch this movie
1,anyway the movie is n't bad but the acting and direction are horrible,anyway i have seen this film and i can only say it 's not
1,in the end it is a very good film and i hope,in fact it is a great film and a great movie
1,finally the movie has the feel that the director had done with the director 's cut and it 's a bit too long,finally i have to say that i was very impressed with the film and the way it was shot was very good and i
1,to be fair i was n't expecting much from this film but it was a great film and i was impressed,to me it was a great film and it 's a shame that it was n't released theatrically in theaters
1,there is no reason for this movie,there are some good moments but the movie
1,flavia 's father and his wife 's daughter are both in the same predicament,flavia is the only person that has to deal with the task that he has
1,of course there is a scene in the film where the camera is in,of all the films that have made this one the most overrated one
1,the movie is about the power of the human,the film has a very good story line
1,laura dern is a great actor and i think she is the best actress in the film,laura linney plays a young woman in a small rural town in london who has a crush in
1,buttermaker is the best actor ever,buttermaker 's character is so stupid and
1,so i guess it was a mistake,so the movie is a complete mess of
1,because the movie is so good it 's not even funny,because of this i was n't sure if the film would have
1,this movie is a must for anyone who likes to watch a movie with a message,this is the first film i have ever walked out of on a rainy night
1,the film has some good points and is a,the movie is a bit of a bore
1,however i do not recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the first movie and the second one is better than the first,however the film is a little slow at first but the film does n't have a lot to do with it 's characters and
1,i have to say i was n't impressed by,i was surprised that the movie was made
1,jimmy durante plays a very likable and likable character,jimmy stewart is the only one in the film that
1,the movie is about the same subject matter and the same story as the first one,the film has a very interesting plot and the characters were very believable and the plot is
1,pick up the dvd of this film,pick it out and you will be hooked
1,john wayne is a great director,john goodman 's performance as the lead
1,it is not a film for the,it 's a very good movie
1,he is the most annoying person i 've ever seen and,he 's a very talented actor and a good guy
1,five stars out there so that you could have done better with,five years later the film is a bit of a mess
1,this movie is not for the faint hearted or for those who like to watch movies with,this is the worst film i 've ever had the displeasure to sit down to watch
1,i'm a fan of the original series and i have to admit that i have n't read a lot of the other,i'm not a fan but this is the best movie of the decade and i have seen it many many times
1,this movie is not for the squeamish but for the,this is the worst film i have ever seen
1,this is a movie for everyone who wants to be entertained,this movie was a waste for the first two hours and it
1,most of the film 's plot is centered around a young man who is a teenager,most people are not interested in this film but it is a good film to watch
1,this is a movie that is not a comedy,this movie was a complete disappointment to me
1,the film has a lot to do but the film does not have the feel that the director had in mind,the movie is about a young man who is a teenager and is a man who is a struggling man
1,instead of being a little bit of an old fashioned and very dark film i found myself wondering how much more,instead it is an insult for a movie that has been made to entertain the audience and it is not
1,there is a lot of action and the movie is very good and the actors,there are a lot more of the same characters and situations in this film
1,and the ending is a little too abrupt,and it is not the best movie i have
1,if you want a movie that does not have the decency to make you,if i had to give this movie a 1 i 'd be generous
1,now i know i have n't seen the movie,now that 's a good thing to do
1,the movie was a bit of an attempt at a slasher film but the story was so stupid that i was left wondering,the film is about the struggle between a man who has been a woman and a man in love with a woman
1,it is not a film that will,it 's a very good film
1,even though the film is not as bad as the first two films i have seen it in,even the actors who were n't in this film are the ones who are in the film
1,shelly witherspoon is the only reason to watch it,shelly winters plays a young woman who has a boyfriend
1,the movie was a bit slow and boring,the film is about the same thing about a
1,idiocy is the main reason why this film has,idiocy and the beast are all very good
1,aside the movie was a complete waste of time and i do not know why,aside from that it is not that great but it 's a good movie to watch
1,i was surprised to find that this was a movie about,i have to admit that the movie is very good
1,lipsync is the only one who is able in the film,lipsync of the film is a very interesting and interesting account of
1,the film has a lot of action in it,the movie is about a group that is attacked by
1,this is a very bad movie,this movie was so bad that it
1,oh yeah and i did not care about any of the characters,oh and the ending is a bit of a disappointment but i think
1,i have seen this movie several years ago,i was n't impressed with this movie but i
1,it is not a film that will,it 's a very good film
1,the movie is a complete mess of the original,the film has some of its moments but it 's
1,but it is not a movie that is,but the film is not as bad
1,i was surprised to see that this movie is not a,i have to admit i did n't like this movie
1,on a positive side note i have a soft spot for the movie and i have,on the other hand the film is a bit too slow for the whole length
1,the movie was a bit of an action movie but the story was so,the film is about the struggle between the characters of the two protagonists
1,i was surprised that the film did n't get released theatrically,i have to say i did n't enjoy the movie but it
1,his performance in the film is very good,his character is so unlikable and so stupid it
1,whiz to a small part in a film is the fact that it 's not a comedy it is an insult for the audience to enjoy it,whiz is a film that is not only a vehicle to show the world of war and how it is about the bonds of the people who have
1,i was surprised that the movie did not have the same effect,i have to say i was very impressed with the acting
1,when i saw the trailer i thought it would be good,when the film was released i had a hard day believing it
1,when the movie was over i had to watch it,when i first saw this film i thought that the movie
1,i was surprised that the movie was n't so,i have to say i was n't disappointed
1,so i guess it 's not that i have n't read a lot about this film but it is not a movie,so the movie is about a group of people trying to get their hands on a bunch of people who are trying their
1,deadly and simple is the story about the power of love,deadly impact on a young woman who is in the hospital and
1,it 's not even a good film,it is a very funny movie
1,the film is a bit of an action movie,the movie was shot on location in a small town
1,unfortunately the film is a bit slow and the ending is too abrupt,unfortunately it is n't a good movie and the actors do not have the
1,this movie was so bad that it,this is a very bad movie
1,for the first time in the film i found myself wishing that i could get the chance,for a film about the holocaust of the holocaust the film focuses on the story of a young
1,yet the film has no real life,yet it is a very enjoyable movie and
1,it is a shame because it is,it 's not a bad movie
1,the movie was shot in the same way as a,the film is a complete mess of a movie
1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,the movie was a waste for the whole movie and it 's a waste of time,the film is about a young man named krishna who has a son who has a son
1,get a copy from the library and watch it,get to know the real story and the story of
1,his performance is a bit stilted but he is not as bad as he is in this movie and the acting is pretty good and he is very convincing in,his character was so annoying that it was impossible to believe that the character was supposed to represent the character of his character and the plot was very weak
1,yes it is a little bit too slow and too slow,yes the movie was n't a total waste of time
1,i was surprised to find out the film is a remake of,i have to admit that i have seen this film twice
1,after a few years i was able to see this movie and i was surprised that it had been made in a time when the film is not as,after the first hour of the movie the viewer is introduced to a group of people that are n't even close to being able to make a living
1,it is not the best film i have ever seen,it 's a shame that the film is not so bad
1,naturally it 's a very bad movie and it 's a shame that it was n't,naturally the movie has some good moments and the story is a little too thin
1,one of my favorite movies of all time and i love the way it,one thing that really bothered my appetite was the way that it ended
1,the film is about a young man who has,the movie was a waste for the movie
1,one thing i did like about the movie was that,one of the most memorable films of all times
1,and the movie was a bit too much,and it 's not even that funny
1,anyone with a modicum memories of the genre should see this film and i would highly advise you to see it,anyone who thinks that the film has been made is one of the most important and most important movies of all times
1,spoilers ahead i have to say that the film was,spoilers spoilers i was n't surprised by the ending
1,this is a very bad film,this movie was so bad it 's
1,just as a movie it 's a very good film,just like the first film i have to admit that the
1,two men who have been married to a man who has a,two of the most famous films i 've seen this year
1,count of the movie was the worst movie i have seen,count dracula 's character is a bit too long and the story
1,the film has a very good cast and it 's not just the,the movie is about the power and soul of the human spirit
1,again the movie was n't so much of a disappointment,again i have to say that i was very impressed with

1,although the film was made in a hurry the story is very weak,although i have seen the original version i have seen the movie and it
1,furthermore the film 's plot is not a very interesting idea,furthermore it is a film about a young woman who is attracted

1,it is a very good film,it 's not even the worst of
1,i have to admit i did n't enjoy the movie,i was surprised to see that this was a movie about
1,for the first time in the movie i had a feeling of deja doo and i had a good laugh,for a film about the holocaust it 's a film about the life of the young man who is a man
1,it 's not a movie for everyone but if it 's not for,it is a shame that the movie is n't available in dvd
1,i was n't expecting a lot of,i have seen the movie twice
1,this is a movie that i can recommend watching,this movie was a complete waste of time
1,does anyone know where to begin,does n't he know it 's the
1,malkovich 's character is so annoying that it is,malkovich is the best actor in this film
1,maybe the movie was made in a hurry,maybe it 's because the movie is a bit
1,despite the obvious plot the movie has some very funny moments and the movie has a good cast,despite being a fan of the original series i was very disappointed with the ending of the film and
1,the movie was a waste of time and money and time,the film is about a group that has a lot to do
1,the film has a lot to do but the film does n't,the movie is about a young man who is a teenager
1,his performance is so bad it makes me want him to go nuts and get the job,his character was a little too unlikable to be believable but he was n't the only one who
1,why is it so hard to find,why did they make this film
1,first off the movie was n't bad,first of the movie is a little bit
1,in fact it 's not a good movie but it is,in the end the movie has a very good cast

1,i was n't impressed by this film,i have seen this film several times
1,how can a movie like this be made,how could you have a film like that in
1,but it 's not a good movie and the actors are not very convincing,but the movie was n't so much a movie as it was about a man
1,however the movie is not a complete waste,however i was surprised to see the film in
1,at the same moment the movie is a little bit,at least the movie is a little too long
1,he 's a great actor but he 's not the only one,he is the only person who can identify to the end of his
1,one thing that i found most irritating was that the movie had a few good scenes,one of my favorites is the scene where the girl 's daughter and her boyfriend are sitting
1,what is the deal of the story,what a great film this was
1,but it 's a great film,but the movie is a bit slow

1,the movie was shot in the early,the film is a complete mess
1,this movie was so awful it 's,this is a very good movie
1,before the movie is about to end you know what 's going on and the story becomes a little too convoluted,before i saw this movie the film is a complete mess of a film that is not even worth a watch if
1,i was n't impressed by the fact that the movie is so boring,i have seen this film twice and it is a very good film to
1,the film has a lot to offer but the film does not work as well as the original and it is n't as bad,the movie is about a young woman who is a woman and her mother is in the process of witnessing her own family
1,worthless acting and bad direction make it hard for,worthless movie that is n't even worth renting
1,barbra is a very talented actress,barbra streisand plays a woman whose husband
1,the film is a complete mess of a movie,the movie was shot in the same way as a

1,it 's not a movie for everyone,it is a shame that the movie has
1,i have to say i did not enjoy the film,i was surprised that the film was made in the early

1,a few of them are not so much better,a lot of the scenes are shot in a very
1,and the ending was so bad that it,and it is a very funny film
1,a few years later the movie is,a lot more of a movie

1,after a few minutes of watching the movie you 'll have a good laugh and i think that the movie is,after the first half hour of this film i realized that the director was trying too much to be clever
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,anyone with an ounce of respect in the history of the world will find this film to be a total waste of your money,anyone who has seen this film will know that the movie has been made by the director and it is not the case
1,how could you possibly get the chance to see,how can a film like this be released

1,him is the best character of all,him and his wife have a very difficult
1,gene tierney plays a woman who has a onenight stand,gene hackman is the perfect actor for this role
1,utilizing a few of the actors and crew of the film is a very interesting one,utilizing the film as an example of how to use the word to describe the movie
1,just as a movie it 's a very good film,just like the first film i have to admit that the
1,the film has some of its most,the movie is a complete mess
1,the film is a bit slow and the ending was too abrupt,the movie was shot on a budget that would have made it more
1,this is the first movie i 've,this movie is a complete mess
1,this is a very good movie and i recommend it to anyone who enjoys good films and,this movie was so awful it was almost laughable to me and the acting was horrible
1,that is the only reason i gave this,that 's what makes it a classic
1,this movie is not for the faint of stomach but it 's worth watching for the acting and direction and it is,this is the worst film i 've seen in a very bad time and i do not recommend it to anyone
1,it is not the best movie ever made but the fact that the,it 's a shame that this film is n't available on video

1,there is no real reason to see this film unless it is a comedy or an attempt at a comedy or drama,there are some very good moments and some of the scenes where they 're trying to make a point to the film is
1,then there is the fact it is a movie about the evils of war,then the movie starts with a bang and a couple of minutes later when a

1,in the first movie the main character was a young man who is a little too old for his own good,in fact the film was a little too much to bear and it 's not a total waste of film
1,hope that you will never see a film like,hope lange 's performance is n't too bad
1,there is no real plot to be found in this film and the acting was terrible,there are some very funny scenes in this film and the scene with a young girl with
1,i was n't expecting much from this,i have seen the original movie
1,the movie is a complete waste,the film has some of the most
1,this is a movie that i would,this movie was a complete waste
1,she is the one who is the,she 's a very talented woman
1,every scene in the movie was a complete joke,every time i see the movie i will be happy
1,with the help from the police the film is a bit of a mess,with a supposed budget the only saving grace was that the film is not as
1,this is the first film i 've ever walked across and i 've seen a few,this movie is a must for all fans of the genre and the movie industry
1,i have seen this film twice,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,it is not the best film ever made but it is a very enjoyable movie and a good movie to see if,it 's a shame that the movie has been so bad that it 's not even funny enough to be funny
1,if you want a good movie with good acting this is the movie for me,if i had to watch it i would n't have to be a big fan
1,but the movie is a little too long for me,but it 's a great movie and it 's not just
1,so the movie was made in a very cheap way,so i guess i 'll be watching this movie
1,in the end the movie has no redeeming qualities,in fact it 's not a bad film but the
1,he 's not the only actor who is n't the only actor that has a role in this film that makes,he is a very good actor and he 's a great director and he is very talented in this movie
1,diana scarwid is the only one that is good,diana rigg plays a young girl who has a boyfriend
1,the film has some good moments and the acting is pretty decent but the script is so bad that i could not believe it was,the movie is a bit slow but it is n't a good movie and the actors do a great job of conveying their roles
1,besides that it 's a very bad film,besides the fact the film was shot in a
1,i was n't impressed with this movie but it was a great movie and i would definitely recommend this film,i have seen this movie several years ago and it 's still very good and it 's not a bad film
1,the movie was a waste of time and i would have given this a zero,the film is about a group that has been sent to a remote island to retrieve
1,i was surprised to find that the movie is not a comedy but a very funny one,i have to admit that the film was a bit slow at times but i was surprised to
1,the movie was shot in a small town in the early 80,the film is a complete waste of my life and money
1,some people have said this movie was bad,some of them are just plain stupid
1,mr blandings has the best lines and,mr bean is a great director
1,ill do not waste your time on it,ill i do not think this movie is worth
1,if you 're a fan of horror movies you 'll love it,if i were to give it a zero i 'd be generous to
1,hotel fever was one of the most underrated films of the 90 's,hotel rwanda is a film about a young woman named anna who has a
1,treasured and the film has an interesting premise but it is not a,treasured to see a movie that is so bad it 's good
1,of course the movie is n't a complete waste of film and it is n't even worth the time to watch,of all of the films that i have watched in the past decade i 've never been a big fan
1,however i do n't think that this movie is worth watching,however the film 's biggest problem is that the film does not
1,key characters are the main characters,key to that is that it 's
1,i have to admit i was n't impressed with this movie but it 's not a bad movie either,i was surprised to see this film in the theater and it was a great film for me
1,then there 's the scene where he is walking through a window and then the camera cuts down,then the film is over and it is a little too slow for a long long time
1,just like the first movie i was n't expecting a good movie,just as a movie is a bad idea to make a good film
1,if i had to give it an 8 i would have been the only person to have the chance to watch it,if you want a movie to watch and watch the first half hour you will enjoy the movie and you will enjoy the
1,i have seen the movie and it is one of the,i was n't expecting a movie to be so boring
1,i was n't impressed with the film,i have seen this movie twice and it
1,i have to say i did not enjoy the movie,i was surprised that the film was made in a time
1,but the movie was a little too much to be taken from a different movie,but it 's not the worst film i 've seen in a long time but i
1,basically it 's a very bad movie and i would n't recommend it to anyone,basically the film was a bit of a mess but the story is so bad it
1,if you 're looking for a good movie with some good action scenes and good actors you,if i were n't for a few minutes i would n't have to watch this movie
1,i was n't impressed with the movie,i have seen this movie twice
1,well the movie was n't that great but it,well i guess i was n't expecting much
1,even the actors who were n't the best actors in this film were very good and i,even though the film is not a masterpiece of the genre it is still very entertaining
1,jerry is a good actor but his character is not believable,jerry stiller plays a character that is n't really funny at least
1,at the end of the film i felt like i had,at least it was a little bit of a letdown
1,this is the worst movie ever,this movie is not a bad movie
1,and the movie was so bad that it was actually funny to watch,and it 's not a good film either it 's just a waste
1,teams are not the best but the movie does have some good points and,teams with the two leads are a bit of a stretch for me
1,we have a lot more to do with this movie than i did in the,we are supposed to believe the director and his friends are trying too hard
1,this is the first movie that i,this movie is a complete waste
1,intensely recommended to anyone who enjoys a film with an excellent cast,intensely enough the film has an excellent cast and a very interesting plot
1,the film has some of its moments but it 's,the movie is a complete mess of the original
1,this movie was so bad that i was laughing hysterically at,this is a very bad movie and it is n't
1,if i were n't for the first half hour of this movie it was n't that bad,if you 're looking for something that is n't bad then this is the movie for your collection
1,maybe it was the fact i did not like,maybe the director should be ashamed of themselves
1,good luck for the good guys,good acting great plot great characters
1,but the movie is not as bad,but it 's a good movie
1,a lot more of a good film,a few years later the film is a
1,some of the scenes were so funny and so funny,some people say it 's the worst movie ever
1,next time i saw the movie and i thought it was going to suck,next to a few scenes where the two men get killed by the killer
1,mostly the film 's main character 's daughter and the mother 's mother are not the only one who is a little too young,mostly it is a film about a young woman named seita who is sent to a mental institution to find her missing husband
1,around a campfire resort is a very good movie and the actors do their job well enough,around the same time as a young woman she is a young woman who is attracted to a
1,talented cast and crew are all wasted in a role that,talented actors who are in this movie is a joy
1,the movie was a bit of an attempt at a slasher movie but the story was so,the film is about the struggle between a man who has a wife and a woman
1,flesh and geeks is a very good movie and i recommend it for,flesh is the best movie i 've seen in my entire lifetime
1,in the first film he is a very good guy who is n't a good guy but a good actor,in fact the only thing that kept the film from being an extra was a bit of the original
1,i was surprised to find out that this movie is a remake of a classic,i have to admit that i was n't impressed by this movie but i did n't

1,i have seen this film twice,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,in the first movie the main character is a young woman who has a boyfriend who has a onenight stand and a very young woman,in fact the film was a little slow at first but the story was so interesting that it was n't a good movie to watch
1,i was surprised that this movie did n't have a chance to redeem the film 's reputation,i have to say that this is one of my favorites of all time and i think that

1,the film has a lot to offer but the film is n't a complete waste of,the movie is about a young woman who is a teenager and a young girl
1,this movie was a complete disappointment,this is a movie that is n't

1,at least it 's a little bit too slow,at the end the movie ends abruptly and the end

1,but the film is not as good,but it is not a movie

1,how can a movie like that get a 10,how could you have a movie like this
1,the film has some of its moments that are not only highlighted by a couple of the most memorable moments but also a very good performance by rickman as the conflicted and frustrated man,the movie is a complete mess of a film that has been released on dvd in the uk and is not even available in the uk it is a waste of money and time

1,he is the most annoying character in,he 's a very talented director

1,after a few years i have been looking for the dvd and i can safely tell,after the first hour of this movie the audience is asked for a good time
1,just like a lot of other films i 've watched in my life i have to say i did n't care for this movie,just as the film was made in a time of crisis and a few of those who were involved with the film industry were the
1,basil rathbone plays a very good role as a young man,basil rhames is the only one in this movie that has a
1,the movie was shot on location in a very tight and very grainy manner and it,the film is a bit of an action film but it 's a good movie
1,a lot of people have commented that the film was made for the sole reason to see it,a few of the actors were good but the script was so poor that it was hard for them

1,while the movie was n't as bad as i had hoped it would have been,while i do n't think the movie was intended to be funny i was not expecting
1,really the only reason i gave this film 2 out was,really it 's a good film and a good one
1,never before has i seen such a bad film in a long time and i do not know why,never mind that this movie was a total waste of time and i would have to say i was disappointed
1,seeing this film is a waste of time,seeing the movie was a complete disappointment to watch
1,the film has a lot of action and the plot is a little thin,the movie is about a group that has been kidnapped and tortured by the evil
1,they 're all very funny and funny,they are all in the movie and the
1,i have seen the movie and i have seen it twice and i can only conclude it is a movie,i was n't expecting a movie about a man and a woman but i was n't expecting much from this movie
1,from a technical point of fact it is not a movie that is n't a good,from the beginning of this movie you get to know what 's happening and why
1,it 's not a bad movie but it 's a great film,it is a shame because it 's not the best movie ever

1,this is a very bad film,this movie was so bad it 's
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,sophie is the best actress ever,sophie 's character is so annoying and
1,instead it is a very boring and poorly acted movie that fails to entertain and is not even worth mentioning,instead of being the worst of the bunch i was left wondering how they could possibly be so good in the
1,like i said the movie is n't a bad film,like the first movie the acting is pretty bad
1,it 's not even a movie it,it is a very funny film
1,these two characters are the same,these are the only things i liked
1,the film has some of its most,the movie is a complete mess
1,the movie is about a group that is trying too much to get a good idea of the story,the film has a lot of action in the background and it 's a bit too slow for a thriller
1,by far the best thing about the film is that it is not a movie about a young woman who is attracted by her husband to,by the time the film reaches the climax the viewer feels like a bunch of people are trapped on the screen with a severe dose
1,that 's what i thought was the best of the series and the,that is the best thing i can do to make this movie
1,another problem is the lack thereof and i think the,another thing i did not like was the ending
1,well the film is a little too long for its time and the ending was too abrupt and,well i do not think that this movie was made for the reasons it was so good
1,while the film was a little bit of an action movie i did n't think that the film was anything but the film,while i was n't impressed by the fact that i was watching the film for the first time it was still a very enjoyable
1,in fact the only thing that kept the movie going was the way the story,in the first film he is a very talented actor and a good actor
1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,i have seen this movie several times and i have never seen it in,i was n't impressed with this film but it was a great film
1,definitely not a movie for everyone who likes the genre,definitely a must for anyone interested in the subject matter of
1,after the first hour of the film i had to watch it to find the right place,after a few years i was n't sure what was going on in the first movie
1,it 's a very funny movie,it is not a movie for the
1,it 's not even a good film,it is a very funny movie
1,an excellent cast of characters that make you care about the story,an interesting premise and an interesting story but it is not
1,true the movie was n't a total disaster,true it 's not a bad film but it
1,each character is a caricature of a young woman who,each of these films is the best of them
1,none of these things really do n't make sense and it,none the less it 's a good film to watch
1,apparently this is the first time i 've seen the film and it,apparently the movie is a bit of a stretch for the viewer
1,i have seen the movie and i have seen it several many times,i was n't expecting a movie about a man and his wife who are
1,and the ending is a little unsatisfying and the,and it is not the best film ever
1,but the film is a bit slow and boring and it is,but it is not the best movie i have ever seen
1,val lewton is a genius in this film,val kilmer is the only actor in this film
1,i was n't expecting a lot of,i have seen the movie twice
1,i was n't expecting a lot of,i have seen the movie twice
1,finally the movie is a little too,finally i have seen this movie
1,oh and the ending was so bad i was n't laughing at the screen and the whole,oh yeah and i do n't think that the director should have done a better job
1,as a matter of view i have a feeling of gratitude to,as for the acting it was a bit of a mess
1,for the first time in the film the viewer is subjected to the characters,for a film about the holocaust of a man 's journey in a life of
1,also i think that it was the first time that i had seen it,also the movie was a bit too long for me to enjoy it
1,it is not the best film i have seen in a while,it 's a shame that the film is n't so bad as the
1,in fact the only reason why i gave it 2 stars is because it is a little,in the first film the characters were very believable and the characters are all very likable
1,a few years later i saw the film and i was surprised,a lot more of the film is a bit too much
1,skelton is the best in this film,skelton 's character is a caricature of a
1,the film has some of the most,the movie is a complete waste
1,naturally it is a film that will be forgotten and it 's not even,naturally the film has a very good cast and it is very entertaining
1,and the ending is so stupid that,and it is not a movie
1,i was n't impressed with this film but i was n't expecting much,i have seen this movie several times and it is one that is so
1,over the course the movie has a very interesting story,over all i would have given it an 8 out of
1,this is the worst movie ever,this movie is not a bad movie
1,examples of the film 's plot is that of the main character and the story is,examples are not as good as the original but it 's not a bad movie

1,to be fair the film is a little slow but it 's not,to me it 's a great film and i would definitely like it to
1,sad to see the movie is n't as bad,sad that the movie was n't released theatrically in the
1,it 's not even a movie it,it is a very funny film
1,i was n't impressed by this movie but i,i have seen this film several years ago
1,the film is a bit of an action film,the movie was shot on location in a very small
1,the film is a complete mess of the first film,the movie was shot in the same location and it 's
1,and it 's not even that bad,and the movie was a bit of an
1,i was n't impressed with this film,i have seen this movie several times
1,there are a lot of things to criticize about the movie but it 's not a good film and the actors,there is a lot to be said but the film does n't seem very interesting to be a good movie
1,born to the us was a very nice film and a good movie,born in a country where a group of people are trapped on a remote
1,this is a movie that i can recommend to anyone interested in a film that is,this movie was a complete waste of time and i would have given it zero
1,but it is a great film and a great movie to watch for a laugh and,but the film 's biggest flaw is the fact that it 's not a comedy
1,ok so the movie is a little slow and boring,ok i know it was a low production but i was
1,but the movie was n't so bad it was funny and i did not laugh at all,but it 's not a good film and the acting is n't as good as the original and
1,not to say the movie was bad but it was a good movie,not only is it not a good film but a good one at it
1,however the movie is not as bad as the first one but the movie is n't bad,however i was surprised to find that this film is a complete waste of my life and not
1,for the most of the time i have to admit that i was n't impressed with this film but i did n't expect much from this movie,for a movie that was a bit of a letdown i could n't believe how many times i 've watched this film i was so bored
1,it is not a movie for everyone,it 's a very funny movie and i
1,the film is about the struggle between a group and a man who is,the movie was a bit of an attempt to cash into the success
1,john goodman is a good actor but his performance is not as bad as the first,john wayne 's performance is the only reason i gave this film a 3 out there
1,i have to admit that the film was a bit too long,i was surprised to find that the movie is not as bad
1,we have to be a little more forgiving of the story,we are not supposed for a moment of relief but the movie
1,simply because it 's a good film,simply put this movie was a waste
1,i have to admit i did not enjoy the film but i did not find it very interesting and it did n't really make me laugh,i was surprised to see that the movie was made in a time when the movie is a little too long for the first two
1,only the first time he 's in the movie he is the only person who can act and the movie does not,only a few of the actors were good and the story was pretty good and the characters were believable and believable
1,anyway i was surprised that this film was made in the first place,anyway the film is a little slow but the story itself was very interesting
1,the film has a lot of potential and the cast are all fine,the movie is about a group of young people who are living in the
1,and it is not a good movie,and the ending is so bad it makes
1,not to say the movie is a complete waste but it 's worth watching,not only is it not funny it is n't funny it is n't even unintentionally
1,it is not a film that will,it 's a very good film
1,sit through the whole movie i was wondering if the movie was supposed or is it just a spoof of a movie,sit back and watch this film and you will see what the director was thinking when it came to this film and i
1,that 's what makes this film so good,that is the only thing that i did not
1,a lot more of a good film than this one,a few years later the film is set in the same
1,boy is this a bad film,boy was it bad or something like
1,perhaps the director should have had a more substantial career,perhaps it 's because of the lack of funds that the
1,streep 's character was a bit of a stretch for the role,streep is the only reason i can watch it for the fact that
1,i have to say that i have n't seen the original,i was surprised that this film was made in a hurry to
1,williams is the only actor in the movie that has,williams 's character was a bit of an idiot
1,and the ending was so stupid that it,and it is a very good film
1,watch it and you 'll be amazed at the sheer lack,watch this movie if your looking for a good laugh
1,he is a very talented actor,he 's not the best character in
1,if you 're looking for something to laugh at and enjoy watching this film,if i were n't for the movie i 'd be a bit surprised
1,jackie is a great character actor,jackie chan 's character is so stupid
1,the movie was a waste for the movie and it was n't,the film is about a young man who is sent into prostitution with
1,if i were to rate this film higher than i 'd give this,if you 're a diehard horror fan you will love this film
1,my advice is to watch it,my favorite part is the scene with

1,of all of these films this one has a lot of potential,of course the film has a very good story and a good story
1,we have to see the movie for yourself,we are not told to care about the story
1,my favorite scene is when a woman walks into the room and says that she 's a witch,my advice to anyone interested in the film is that it 's a very bad movie and not even
1,it is not a film for the,it 's a very good movie
1,and it is not a movie that you will never forget,and the ending is so stupid and so lame that i was
1,now i have seen a lot worse movies and i have to say that,now that i have n't read the book i have read the novel
1,a lot of people are complaining about this movie and i think it is the best of all,a few of the scenes are so funny and so hilarious that it 's hard to believe that the
1,another problem with the film is the lack that one character in the film is supposed to have the,another thing that i found was the fact that the film was made in the early 90 's
1,the movie was a waste for the movie and it 's a shame that it is,the film is about a young man who is sent to prison for a murder
1,so i was n't impressed by this movie,so the film has a very good story
1,the movie was shot in a small town in the early 80,the film is a complete waste of my life and money

1,only a few of them were good and the movie is n't,only the first time i saw it i was laughing hysterically
1,in fact it is a great film,in the end it is a very enjoyable
1,i was surprised to find out the movie is n't going for the most to get a good rating of the film but,i have to admit that i have n't seen the original version but i have to say i did n't like it
1,it 's a very funny movie,it is not a movie for the
1,when the film is over and the actors do n't get it it 's not a bad thing,when i saw this film on the big screen it was very good and i was impressed
1,some of them were so stupid they were funny and i was,some people have commented that this is the best movie ever
1,the movie is a bit of a mess,the film has some good points and some good
1,so i was expecting a good movie but this,so the film is not a bad movie
1,for a movie that was supposed to be a spoof of the,for the most of the movie the characters were very believable
1,i was n't expecting much of this film,i have seen the original version and i can
1,visual style is the best thing about the film,visual effects were n't very good and the story is
1,whilst i do n't know how to make this movie i think that the director should be ashamed of himself,whilst the movie was a bit long it was a very enjoyable movie and i would recommend this film
1,needless to die and the end is the best,needless up for the movie 's plot summary
1,hudson 's character is so annoying that it is,hudson is the best actor in this film
1,more importantly the movie has some good points,more than anything else i was impressed by this
1,of course there are a few moments that are not funny but the film,of all the movies i have ever seen i 've watched the original
1,see this movie if it is available,see it for the first time
1,recently i saw the movie on tv and i thought it was pretty good but,recently the film is set in the same place as a film noir film
1,but it 's a great film and it 's a shame that it,but the movie is a bit too slow for the whole movie
1,both of them have a great chemistry and they are all very likable and likable,both the actors and actresses are very good and i think the film is a good
1,till i saw the movie on tv and was impressed with it i was surprised that the movie did n't get released theatrically in the uk,till the last few seconds of the movie i thought that the film would have been a little more enjoyable but it was n't enough
1,i have to admit i did n't like this movie,i was surprised to see that this movie is not a
1,sure the film is n't as good but it 's a good one and the movie is very good and it is,sure it 's not a good film but the story is n't too bad and the story is not very interesting
1,as for me i have to admit i did n't have,as a result of this movie i was very disappointed
1,is this a good thing to say,is it the best of the three films
1,so the film has its charms,so i was n't expecting much from
1,the film has some good points and some good,the movie is a bit of a mess
1,the film is about the same subject matter and it is a story,the movie was a bit slow but it was a good film
1,here 's a movie you 'll see,here is the story of a man who
1,eleanor is a very talented woman who is a very beautiful actress,eleanor parker plays a woman who has to be the best actress ever
1,there is a scene where the two men are walking through the streets and the two lovers are in,there are a few moments of humor that make it hard for me to watch this movie again
1,luckily the film is not as bad,luckily it is a very good movie
1,david lynch is the master of the medium,david cronenberg 's the man who knew nothing about
1,if you want a movie that is a bit of a parody it 's not,if i had to give this a 0 i 'd be a little generous but it
1,this movie was so awful it 's,this is a very good movie
1,the movie is about the power of a man who has a,the film has a very good story and a great cast
1,i was surprised to find that this was a movie about,i have to admit that the movie is very good

1,this is the first movie that has been released theatrically,this movie is a complete waste of my time
1,apart the movie was n't bad,apart from that it 's not even
1,this movie is not for the squeamish,this is the worst film i have seen
1,spoilers spoilers i have to say that the ending was a bit too predictable and the story was,spoilers ahead i was surprised that this movie did not have the same plot as it did
1,when i saw the movie i was n't sure what it was about but i was expecting something like that,when the film was over and the ending was so predictable i was left speechless and i was n't sure if
1,it is not a film for everyone,it 's a very good movie and i
1,two men are killed by a group and the men are forced to go to a remote island to retrieve a house,two of them are a group and a bunch of friends who have been in the business for a long time
1,however the film is a bit slow at times,however i do not recommend it to anyone
1,turn out that he is the only one who can be blamed on the death penalty,turn it into a bad movie and the movie is a waste of your time
1,there is no real reason for this movie to be made and the film,there are some very good scenes and the film has some good moments
1,til i saw this movie i was very excited,til the movie is about a woman who is a
1,this movie is a must see for all fans,this is the first film that i have seen that
1,at the same moment the movie has a very good plot,at least the movie is a bit slow and boring
1,in the first movie he was a very talented character and i was surprised to find that the movie,in fact the film is not as bad as the first one but it 's not as good
1,you can see the director 's intent on the film as it 's,you know that it is n't going for a very long time
1,well i have to admit that i was n't expecting much,well the movie was a little slow but the story is so
1,diminishing the movie to a new low,diminishing to the top of my head i
1,it 's a shame that the movie is n't so much a remake as it is a remake of a book,it is not the best film ever but the fact remains it is a very enjoyable movie that will appeal to anyone
1,the film is a complete waste,the movie was shot in a very
1,so i guess i was wrong but i was n't expecting,so the movie was a bit too slow and boring
1,so i guess i 'll be a fan,so the movie was made in the early 80
1,its a very funny film and it 's not a bad movie it is a good film,its not a bad movie but it is a great film and a good movie to watch with
1,and it 's a good thing that this film is n't available on dvd,and the movie is a complete waste of time and money and money to make
1,the film is about a group that is,the movie was a waste of time
1,i was n't expecting a lot of,i have seen the movie twice
1,this is the worst film ever,this movie is not for everyone
1,many of us have seen this film and it 's a shame that the film is n't,many people have said that this is one movie i would love for a few laughs
1,at the same moment the film has been released on,at least the movie is n't a good movie
1,and the movie was so bad that i,and it 's not a good film
1,the film is about a group of people and,the movie was a waste of my life
1,witness the story of a young man who has a heart attack,witness a few scenes in which the film is shot and the camera
1,i'm a big big fan and this is one that i would like to see again,i'm not sure what the point of the movie is but i do not know why i
1,so the movie is a complete mess of,so i guess it was a mistake
1,i have to admit that the movie is a bit too slow and the ending was,i was surprised to find that this was the worst film i 've ever seen
1,there is no reason to watch this movie,there are some good scenes and some very good
1,hope that the next one will get a chance to see this movie,hope lange is in it for the first time in a while and i
1,fisher 's performance is the best of,fisher is a very good actor
1,if i were to give it a zero rating i would,if you 're a fan of horror movies and have a good
1,lake placid is one that i would watch over and over again and it,lake mungo was a great show and i think the show was great
1,well the movie is a little slow and boring but the acting and,well i guess it was n't the first time i saw it
1,this is a very bad film,this movie was so bad it 's
1,although i do not know what the appeal was for the actors it,although the movie is a little slow it is still very good
1,o'brian 's character is a bit dim but he is a great actor and he 's a good actor and he 's,o'brian is a great director and a great actor but this movie was so awful that it was hard to watch
1,these are two things that i do not like about,these two are the only ones that are good
1,but the film 's biggest problem with,but it is a great movie
1,or maybe it was a mistake to make it,or the other one is the fact that the movie
1,the movie was a waste of my life and i could not help it but it was n't,the film is about a group of people who have a relationship together and they are forced to go
1,you know what i was talking,you can tell the story of the
1,who would have thought that the film would be good if the,who is that knocking out of the car and the police
1,i was n't impressed by this film,i have seen this film several times
1,hard boiled to a bad movie is a good movie but it is n't a bad film,hard to believe that the director and writer have been in a relationship to the film industry and
1,timothy dalton is a good actor but his performance,timothy spall plays the role as the villain
1,while i do not think that this is the worst film i have ever had to sit through,while the movie is not a complete disaster it is a great film that is worth seeing for its
1,on the other hand i have a feeling of gratitude to this movie as a whole it is not,on a positive side the film is very well made and the acting is excellent and the characters are believable
1,none of the characters were believable and the plot is a bit confusing,none the more i think the film was a bit of an exercise on
1,tag line is the best of all,tag of all the bad guys
1,if you want a movie that does not need to be a serious one,if i had to give this movie a 0 out 10 i would have given
1,this is the worst film ever made and it is not a bad movie,this movie is not for everyone but if you 're a fan of bad films
1,but the movie was a bit too long,but it 's not the best of it
1,i have seen the original version of this movie,i was n't expecting much of a film
1,the film has a very interesting plot and a great cast,the movie is about the same subject matter as the book and
1,there is a scene in which a woman 's daughter is killed and the girl asks her to go to the house,there are a few good scenes in this movie but it is not a good movie and the acting was horrible
1,now i have seen the movie,now that i have seen this movie
1,my favorite scene was the scene where the guy was sitting in the car talking to his wife and says that she 's a witch,my advice to the director is to give this movie an undeserved boost for the fact that the director is not a director and the actors
1,although the film is a bit dated it is a very good film and a good movie to view for the,although i have n't read a book that i have seen i 've seen the original version of this film
1,all the actors were excellent and the movie was a real treat,all in the family and the film is not a total loss of
1,some people have said that the film,some of them are not funny
1,if i had n't been a fan i would 've had a refund for the movie and the movie would be,if you want to see the worst movie i have ever read this is the movie for you to see
1,i have to admit that i have n't seen this movie since it,i was surprised to find out the movie is a complete mess
1,nash 's character was so stupid and the acting is horrible and i was surprised that he did n't have,nash is the only one that is able in the movie to make the movie look like a masterpiece
1,however the film is not as bad,however i do not think that the movie
1,gasped at how much he loved the film and it 's a shame because,gasped out loud and then you 'll be able to see it coming
1,evidently this movie is a complete waste of time,evidently the film was shot on location and the actors
1,certainly the film is n't as bad,certainly a film for the ages
1,the film has a very interesting plot but it 's a,the movie is about the same subject as a movie
1,well the film was a little slow but the acting and the directing was very good and i liked it very much,well i do n't think that the film is a masterpiece but it 's a very good film and a good movie to
1,on the other hand i think that the movie,on a positive side the acting was superb
1,my favorite part is when a woman is stabbed in the stomach with a knife,my advice is to avoid this one at the costs of the rental store
1,suddenly the movie is about the same guy who is a little more than a little bit too old to be a good guy,suddenly he is forced into a world of the most famous people of all ages and the world of the film 's end is the
1,to me it was the best movie of all time,to be fair i did n't think that the film would
1,i was n't impressed by this movie,i have seen this film several years and
1,the movie is about the power and the,the film has a very good cast
1,after the movie i was a bit prejudiced,after a while the film is a bit of
1,this is the first movie i 've,this movie is a complete mess
1,we have a very young woman who is not only a little,we are supposed for a film to get a little repetitious
1,and the ending was so bad,and it is a very funny movie
1,the movie is about a group of people who have been living together in a small town in new york,the film has a lot of potential to make it a little bit too slow but the film is very entertaining
1,but the movie was n't bad,but it 's not a bad film
1,mcmahon 's performance is the best of all,mcmahon is a great actress and i hope she
1,tommy lee jones is the only one who has a chance to shine in the role,tommy stewart plays a young woman who has to be a little more sophisticated than her father
1,gaynor is the only reason to watch it,gaynor 's character was a little more than she
1,however the movie was a bit too long,however i was n't impressed with this film and
1,i was n't expecting much from the movie,i have seen the original movie and it 's
1,it 's a very funny film and it 's a great movie to watch,it is not a movie that is so boring that it is hard for anyone
1,not only is the acting terrible but it is,not to say that the movie was bad
1,it 's not a movie for everyone but if you 're looking,it is a shame that the movie is n't so bad
1,various people have to say that the,various of them are the same
1,i have to say that i have seen this film twice,i was surprised that this film was released in the us
1,robert englund was the only actor who seemed to be in,robert downey jr is the only one who can act
1,several people have been killed by a,several of them are very good
1,this is the worst film ever made,this movie is not for everyone but it
1,the film has some of the most,the movie is a complete waste
1,i have seen the original movie and it is very much a remake,i was n't expecting much from the movie but i was expecting something more
1,chances are that the film has a very low rating,chances were that they had to have a good time and
1,that is what i thought it was,that 's the way i should
1,in the first movie the characters are not believable and the story is,in fact the film was shot on location in a small budget
1,oh yeah i know it 's not a bad film but the acting is so,oh and a lot of people who are not familiar to the original series
1,i was n't expecting a movie to be so boring but i was n't expecting a good,i have seen the movie and it is one of my favorite films of the year
1,however the film 's biggest problem is the fact that the film is a complete mess of a,however i do n't think that this is a bad movie but i do not recommend it
1,i was n't impressed by this movie but i,i have seen this film several years ago
1,no one has ever heard about this movie,no matter how much you love the film it
1,i was n't expecting much of a film to be,i have seen the original version of this film
1,not to say the film is n't as bad but it 's a great,not only is it a complete mess but it 's still very good
1,definitely a movie that will be forgotten by everyone involved in the making,definitely not the worst film i 've seen but i 've been a fan
1,the movie was a bit slow but it did not make me feel like i had,the film is about the same subject matter as the original and it is n't
1,after the first hour i realized that this movie was going nowhere but i was so bored,after a few years of watching the movie i had to watch it again and again
1,rackham is a great actor and he 's a great actor,rackham 's father is the one that is a little more interesting
1,the movie is a bit slow but the story is so simple that you can,the film has some good moments and some nice touches but it is not
1,to me this was the worst film i have ever seen in a movie theater,to be honest i was surprised to find out the film was made for tv and
1,also i think the director should have been,also the movie is not as bad
1,do n't waste your money on it,do not watch it if your a diehard
1,this movie is not a good movie,this is the worst movie i 've seen
1,although i do not think the film is a masterpiece it is still,although the movie is not as good it 's still very entertaining
1,or the fact it 's a comedy,or maybe the director 's intent is that
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and money,the film has some of the worst dialogue i 've seen
1,in fact the only thing that kept me watching is that the film is so bad that it is n't even worth mentioning,in the first film he is a young woman who is married to a woman who has a onenight life and is a bit
1,of all the movies that i 've seen this is the first,of course there are some very good moments in this film
1,if i had n't seen it i 'd probably have to say it 's a good movie but,if you want to watch a film that is so good that you can watch this one
1,as a result the film is not a complete disaster,as for me it was n't a good film
1,during a brief shootout with a young man he 's forced into the world of the world of his,during the course of this film the viewer was left wondering what was the purpose behind the scenes
1,possibly a little too much of a stretch to me,possibly the most memorable thing about the movie is the music
1,valjean is the only person that is a good guy,valjean 's father and his wife are the same
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film has some of its most
1,there are some good moments but it 's not,there is no reason for this to happen in the
1,the film is about a young woman who is a teenager,the movie was a waste for me and my gf
1,oh and the ending is a bit of an anticlimax but,oh yeah and i did not care about the characters
1,it 's not a bad movie,it is a shame because it is
1,the film has some good points but the story is,the movie is a bit of an action film
1,i have seen this film several years ago,i was n't impressed by this movie but i
1,code 46 was the first of a series of movies that i have seen,code of the art was the first of a series that i saw and i
1,the film is a bit of a bore but the acting and the acting are so,the movie was shot on location and it 's a very nice film to watch
1,the movie was shot on location in the middle of the night and it 's a pretty nice film,the film is a bit of an exercise in a long lost city of the city and the film 's
1,there is no reason for this to happen,there are some good moments but it 's just
1,the movie is about a young woman named seita who has a crush in,the film has a lot to offer and the film is very good
1,from a technical standpoint this film was a complete waste,from the beginning i thought the movie would be good
1,when the movie is over you can tell you that the movie is,when i first heard of this film i was a little confused
1,it 's not a bad film,it is a shame because the movie
1,wide variety of characters are introduced to a bunch of people and their families,wide awake and a few of my friends have a copy of the movie
1,if i had to give it a zero because i could n't,if you want a movie to be entertained by a bunch that has
1,when the film is released it 's not even worth the time,when i saw this movie on tv i was very excited
1,his performance in the movie is a bit,his character is so stupid and stupid
1,it 's a very good film,it is not a film that will
1,not to say the film was n't a total waste but the fact is,not only is it a bad film it is n't even that good
1,05 out 10 for a good laugh,05 the acting is horrible the plot was
1,while i was not expecting a lot of the film it 's a good film to see,while the film is not a masterpiece of its own it is still a very enjoyable film and
1,nothing really happens and the film is a little slow,nothing is explained in this film that the film is set
1,seriously i think it was a good movie,seriously this is a very bad movie
1,in the first movie the characters are all so real and so real,in fact the film was shot on a low budget and the script was
1,a few of them are very good but the movie does n't make much sense and is not a,a lot of the scenes were shot in a studio style and the camera angles were very good
1,do n't waste your time on it,do not watch it for yourself
1,simply put the movie is n't bad but the story is n't bad either,simply because the movie was made for the sake of a decent film
1,the film has a very interesting story and a very interesting story,the movie is about the same thing about a man who has been
1,every scene is shot in a way which is a real shame,every time he appears on the screen he is able to make the
1,freddy 's character is a bit of a,freddy krueger was the best of all
1,the film has a lot of potential and the cast is very well done,the movie is about a group of young people who have been living together and
1,the movie is about the same thing as a typical slasher movie but,the film has a very interesting story line and a good story
1,the film is a bit slow and boring but the story itself is,the movie was shot on a budget of about a million dollars
1,perhaps it 's a bit of an exercise in a movie but it is not a good film,perhaps the director was trying to make a movie about a man with a heart of gold
1,it 's a very good movie,it is not a film for the
1,we are not told that the movie is about a young woman named seita who is attracted by her,we have to see it for yourself and it is a great movie to see if you can
1,for a movie that is a bit of a thriller i would say it was,for the most of us this is the first time i have seen it
1,because the movie is a complete waste of money and time,because of this i have a feeling of gratitude for this film
1,i have to admit that i was n't disappointed,i was surprised to find out that this was the
1,a lot of people have said this is a good film but i think that it,a few of the actors are good and i think the director should be commended
1,what is the point of the movie,what a great movie this is
1,it is not the worst film ever but it is a good,it 's a shame because the movie is a bit slow
1,since the movie was made for tv i was surprised that it did n't get released theatrically,since i was a kid i was a bit puzzled by this movie and it 's not a
1,that is what i think is a great film,that 's the way it 's supposed to be and
1,after the first half hour of the film i was n't bored and i was bored,after a few minutes of watching this movie you will be wondering why it 's so hard
1,a lot of the scenes are filmed in the same way that they are in the movie and the film is a bit too long,a few of them are not as bad as they were but i think they are all good and the story was pretty good and i
1,addison 's character was a little bit too unlikable to have a chance to be,addison is the only person who has to be the leader of a gang
1,it 's not even a good film,it is a very funny movie
1,yeah i know that the film was,yeah it was n't that bad
1,every scene in the movie is a complete mess of the film 's,every time i see the film it 's not even a movie
1,i have seen the movie twice,i was n't expecting a lot of
1,i have to say that i was n't impressed with the movie but,i was surprised that this film did not get released on video
1,by the time i saw it was a little bit of an,by far the worst movie i have ever had to endure
1,from the beginning of the movie i was n't expecting much,from a technical point the movie has an excellent soundtrack
1,this movie is a must for all lovers,this is the first film i 've seen that
1,its not even that good and it 's a shame because it is,its a shame that the movie has been released in the uk
1,after the first half hour i was n't sure what to do,after a few minutes of the movie i realized i had to watch
1,i was n't expecting much from the movie,i have seen the original movie and it 's
1,while i was not expecting a lot more from this film i was very,while the film is not a masterpiece it 's a very enjoyable movie
1,not only does it look like it was shot in the,not to mention that the film was made for tv
1,after a while the film is about as good as a,after the movie i was a little skeptical about it
1,the film has a very good cast and the story is a bit too predictable for a thriller,the movie is about the power and soul that is in the book and it is not a movie
