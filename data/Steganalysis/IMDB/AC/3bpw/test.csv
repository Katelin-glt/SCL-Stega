0,the soundtrack itself is what made me
0,dante also does a good job directing about how i managed to see anakin bakula in this film harriet 's life at times so bad that

0,the player is a nightmare against twist with loopy backstabbing
0,and demi moore 's hugs is that of a bombshell
0,i would really like to see more of her work including superstar brooke armstrong who is quite cute to
1,as the series continues to have a huge amount of laughs and the characters are n't all that interesting
1,15 years later the film begins to fall apart
1,though this is one of his very best i 'll give it a 1010
1,unfortunately there are a couple of things that
1,because of the lack of the cast the script and direction are so weak that it 's difficult for the audience to get to
1,here 's where you start thinking about the plot
1,do n't worry that the filmmakers do n't have a budget for
1,this was not a good film
1,if you want to watch the film i suggest you watch the dvd version
1,a movie that has a lot more laughs than it 's subject matter
1,using the words to describe what is the greatest and most experimental film i have seen this film is a
1,directed by a guy who has no talent at all
1,while the original was a little slow paced with a bit more of a few scenes of the film it is still enjoyable to watch and a great deal of action
1,personally i do n't know how much it has a cult following and i would n't have been so impressed if they had n't
1,real estate agent is an important character in the world who has no clue about his life and his own
1,saw this at the cinema in a class and it had its own faults
1,i 've been watching the show for a long time
1,why do n't you just get that in
1,lots of fun and a little romance for those who are looking for a good action flick that is n't very bad
1,he is a little too old to be too old
1,or if you 're a diehard horror buff you have n't heard of a movie that has nothing to do with poe or even
1,acting varies from a good screenplay to a great cast
1,if you like the original you might be able to see what the movie is
1,in the end it 's a bit of a bore
1,at the beginning i had to watch the movie
1,well the first thing i notice is the lack of a story
1,what a waste of time and money
1,hence it 's a bit of a parody of the first
1,anyway if you are not a fan of the book this is a must see
1,the acting ranges between a good and subpar one which is n't really bad at all
1,one of the most interesting things about this documentary is that it was made in the early 80 's
1,i have been in the military for some years now but i still have some doubts about this movie
1,his wife is an alcoholic who has no interest in a woman in
1,the movie is just a bit of a mess
1,it was a very entertaining film
1,all this film is a must have for anyone interested in the history of the world
1,i do n't think this was the first time i saw it i could not remember it
1,these two men are very good and the story is so strong that i could forgive them
1,with the exception of the director 's commentary on the film the plot is
1,the story is very weak and predictable with no depth or explanation whatsoever
1,in this movie the main character 's father was
1,reminds me of the classic hollywood film 'the thing' which i found in the cinemas
1,not to mention the acting was pretty bad especially the guy in the white suit but
1,my wife and i watched it on tv
1,the first is a great movie that is so good that you 'll laugh out loud at the
1,erik and a group of men who are in a wheelchair with their arms have a secret admirer
1,while this film is a bit slow moving to say the least i think it was one of the better ones in this series
1,the acting is superb in a lot of ways and the film is not just about the people that the film portrays
1,this show is a must for all
1,she 's got a lot of fun with her role
1,it is n't that good or the bad guys
1,in my opinion i did n't know this was a low budget movie but it was n't bad either
1,none of us have any respect for
1,robin williams is a wonderful actor and i do not have to go to the movies he has done
1,for me this is a very well written movie
1,when a movie is a bad attempt at making a statement about the evils of the holocaust it 's not so bad it just makes no sense
1,he 's an amazing talent in every episode
1,it was so bad that i wanted to watch the movie
1,how could it even have been so long that
1,this is a very good film
1,in my view it is a great example of how a movie can be so great and that the filmmakers have decided to make
1,both actors do n't make their own good
1,title spoilers spoilers ahead the movie was pretty much made for tv and
1,unfortunately it is also a film about the holocaust in which the characters are so stupid
1,then he gets to be the one to die and be the
1,i was surprised by the amount of detail and originality
1,the movie was a lot of fun and i think the film
1,i do n't think it 's a bad idea but it was a good
1,while there 's a scene in which a young guy goes on a rampage with a woman she does n't
1,narrator has been the smartest of the three
1,been a huge fan of the series and this movie does n't have a great storyline or a good cast
1,and the whole thing is just so funny
1,a good movie and a good one as well it was made for the fans of
1,a great deal of humor is needed here but that 's the only thing good enough to give the film a chance it is n't that bad it 's just awful
1,the film is a little slow paced
1,other people do n't even know about the plot and it seems to have been
1,alright so i 'll admit that this movie has a lot going for it namely the fact that the plot is
1,i have no idea how anyone would react to
1,goldsmith is a master film of the late forties and early talkie noir
1,another problem that i can say is that it 's not a very good one at the beginning but i do
1,what i really liked about was that it was actually a film about a serial killer in
1,it would be better to see it again in the future and i am
1,for example the two leads are the only one
1,read the book if you can
1,it 's not a movie to watch for those interested in
1,two of the characters in the movie are the two characters who are also in the
1,most films i have seen in a similar vein of this genre and the same
1,yes i have not seen a lot of movies but this one does
1,the first one is that good
1,it 's not that the movie makes sense but the acting
1,it would be interesting for a person to see a movie with more
1,this movie had me laughing and cry
1,if you can make a film that has a lot more than just a few words then the whole thing is pretty damn bad
1,he has the right to make a
1,ideally it is n't that much more of a thriller than anything else but it 's a little too short
1,but i guess it was a very good movie
1,allinall it was a great show
1,ca n't wait for a sequel
1,i have to say i did not think i 'd read a book that was a bit more interesting
1,i 've watched this film twice and have never seen a worse film
1,are there not some good actors
1,and that is why i was n't able to see it
1,coincidentally it was an accident of the world and the us army of the philippines
1,the movie is a bit too short but it really is n't
1,from the opening shot of the film the movie is set in the background to the point of view
1,notice a lot of the scenes are done with a couple of scenes of which were cut off
1,but this movie has the same kind of humor that it was later in the movies
1,but it 's a great little film
1,his work is a bit too dark
1,the first half of the film takes place in an abandoned house
1,if you want a movie that you can enjoy from the very beginning it
1,the acting was n't bad either
1,between these two men the movie is set in the very real west of india the film 's focus on a group of young
1,a few weeks later i was looking for my life in a way and the film was a real treat
1,i saw this movie in a small town in the us and it 's one of those
1,technical license to the movie is an example of how
1,it seems like the writers wanted to be a serious horror movie and they were n't even remotely good in a way
1,it 's not that the movie is n't bad
1,queen latifah 's performance in the film is quite good although she looks
1,and what 's with the characters that are n't developed as in real
1,i was really excited to see that this
1,as the movie unfolds we get a sense of what we have imagined
1,one of these movies that you could n't find out about
1,the movie is a great example of how a good movie could get a
1,i was hoping it would end but that 's what it was
1,perhaps it 's the best of the films
1,so why is n't this movie rated so low
1,jackie chan plays dr knox and the only other person in the
1,faith is an example of the kind of humor where a group of men are being killed off and in the middle of a forest of a few seconds
1,in fact it is a little bit too long and i ca
1,so the plot is very simple and the acting is just awful
1,cant have been done with the film by many
1,the plot has a few twists and turns
1,the film has been told to have been
1,perhaps the worst film i have seen in a long long time
1,i am a big fan of the first film
1,jennifer tilly was the only reason why she was so great in this movie
1,there are several scenes that make you
1,he was a great character in this episode and that is why he 's not just about his age but his acting
1,the acting was ok and the story line was great and it was n't too much
1,grueling but the film is a little
1,these are the only reasons you 'll want to see it
1,instead they were n't the least bit interesting in the first place
1,and the movie is so bad
1,our hero and his friends are a group of friends who are not as good as their counterparts but they are
1,i do n't know if it 's supposed to be a comedy or comedy but it just does
1,or perhaps this is the most boring film ever made
1,the film is a very moving one and the acting is very good
1,if you 're a fan of the book you will probably not have missed out on
1,grace 's performance was very good and i think the best part of the movie for me was when the girl had a boyfriend who was a lesbian and a lesbian and a woman and the girls were
1,stylish and exciting is the film of its kind in a
1,the acting and writing are horrible
1,ok maybe the film is a total waste of time
1,now i have a lot of things to say about this film but i
1,i would have liked to see more of
1,currently i am the first to have to watch it again on a whim
1,remembering that he was not so good as a child he was
1,however the movie has some of the worst dialogue you will ever hear
1,i have to say it did n't make sense to me
1,the first half of the movie is very good but the script is n't very funny and i think the actors were n't really that
1,they do n't get a chance to
1,in one scene we see him walking through the woods in front of a camera and
1,charlie wilson is one of my favorites
1,one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,what i found interesting was how they made
1,overall this movie is a great example of how
1,but i was n't sure if it is a real horror movie or a horror film
1,the movie 's plot is a bit thin but the script by david chase is n't too bad
1,perhaps the most important part of his is the casting of the three
1,the movie is not a good idea
1,there are some funny moments and a very good ending but the whole plot is so bad that it 's not even funny
1,this movie is one of the most overrated films ever made to make
1,even the music was n't as memorable as the first
1,antonio banderas as the evil cop is also quite good as his character
1,he is the one who does n't know anything
1,deniro is a great actor and the rest of the cast is good
1,i do n't know what to say
1,phillippe and his mate are both good and evil
1,my favorite part in this film is when you 're watching
1,he is not even a great actor
1,to me this movie was n't a complete disaster
1,on the other hand he is a great actor
1,tom is a good man but is n't afraid to take
1,obviously there was a lot of time spent in the movie and the actors are n't all that good
1,i 've been watching this movie on tv for years
1,burr has done a good job in
1,black robe is a very low budget movie with an interesting plot but i really liked the acting and the story it is a
1,i'm sure i 'd rather be a part of it 's life
1,it has no story and it is about a young boy who is a
1,as for the rest of the actors it 's pretty funny
1,and that 's not a very good thing
1,television has the best of the best
1,i have seen a lot of movies
1,his father 's death is n't quite as good as the
1,it 's like a bunch of people who were n't afraid
1,the plot is about a young man who is diagnosed
1,let 's start with the music and the acting
1,all in all i 'd rather watch a movie about a young girl in her life who would not have made the
1,her performance is the only good element of the whole affair
1,down to earth and the other two men in the
1,as i said this is a must see for anyone who loves horror movies
1,but it 's still a great movie to see in a theatre
1,this movie is about the same
1,i was n't impressed by the movie
1,now it does n't make sense
1,this show has a certain amount of humor and humor
1,ok this movie was a bit cheesy
1,usually they 're the only two characters that could 've played the lead
1,print is the only film that i have ever seen on the big screen
1,unfortunately it is n't a movie that 's the worst ever made
1,it 's an amazing film and a must for any fan of the genre
1,a film like that should have been given a more realistic approach to this movie
1,naturally i found the story to be very very funny with a couple of interesting twists
1,dancy 's film is a classic and i would recommend this film to anyone
1,you do n't get to see the end credits of the movie but it was
1,let me say the whole movie is just a joke
1,henry czerny 's performance is perfect and the rest of the cast is excellent as usual
1,the film has a nice touch and is quite atmospheric at times as it deals with a man who is
1,try not to get into this movie because it 's a complete mess
1,take a little too much time to make the story of the original
1,hence there are so many of them
1,it is a shame that such a
1,it 's a shame that this one was n't released in theatres
1,during that time he meets his friend and is taken prisoner and his son and sister
1,this is a film for all ages
1,i do n't think this show is supposed to be about religion
1,and i have to say it was a great
1,first of all it was a very funny movie
1,however this is not a very good movie but its a great film
1,or is he supposed to be a good man or a
1,the story of a woman named sadie
1,james bond is not a great actor but his character is so good that i
1,it is a story of two friends and one of the best love stories of
1,he was so annoying he could not get it right
1,it was a nice little movie but it 's still pretty funny and very interesting
1,i was really impressed in a very interesting story but this is n't a good movie
1,to me it 's the same kind of
1,the first is to be an example of this genre that is
1,the story is a little confusing for a horror movie and it 's a little predictable
1,i have been a fan of the likes of this film since it was made
1,stunts were used as a kind of backdrop to the film in the first one
1,baker and the gang of men have their own agenda and they 're also able to find the truth
1,maybe it was just a coincidence but it did
1,i do n't remember the last time you saw this movie i still do not believe that i can watch anything like
1,this is the best film of the year and it 's a must see for anyone interested in the history of society
1,a few days of the film is filmed as the film is shot in the head
1,now it was n't until then i saw it on the big screen but i was
1,next up the film to the end credits of the film the music
1,this film is a must see if
1,you 're not going to see any of the actors either
1,i was surprised by how it ended with me
1,the acting is terrible the story is bad and it 's just not that
1,when the first movie was finished i thought that this was going to be another bad sequel
1,after all the movie is about two women who are married
1,no doubt the film 's title was a big hit from the first film
1,throw the cast and the script together in a very believable way
1,i think that it 's a great movie to see
1,in the end the whole thing is really boring and pointless
1,the acting by the entire cast is excellent
1,i saw this movie yesterday and was surprised by the ending and i do
1,this film is a must see for anybody
1,things get together with him and the girls are
1,george sanders is perfect in this movie a great role for his performance in the first movie
1,encouraging the story of the characters the two heroes of a man in the woods with his own life
1,did n't they have a clue of why i think this is a very
1,if you 're not a big fan of the book you wo n't
1,unlike most films of the same genre this one has some very funny moments in
1,i do n't think i have a movie with such a great cast
1,still there is a bit of a story
1,just to make you think about how a man can get a
1,it 's all very obvious that the film 's only purpose is a little rushed
1,irene dunne is a revelation as the woman she loves and
1,of course it is a movie and
1,it 's just not enough for me
1,atrocious acting terrible direction bad editing and a complete lack of any real substance
1,we have the usual old hero
1,a lot of the film seems to have been filmed by the director and the director is
1,not to mention the fact that they 're supposed to be the
1,this movie is about a young man
1,the script is a bit thin and the
1,lori 's character in the book was also a nice girl but
1,but i ca n't imagine the people
1,labute 's first movie to be released is a complete failure
1,if you like the first movie you have to be a fan
1,unless you are a big fan of the series i will say that this is a pretty good movie
1,i think the only thing i did not think was that the movie was a
1,the story is not so bad it 's good
1,in a way it was the most boring movie i 've seen in an extremely long time and i do n't care
1,they 're also a couple of nice losers
1,chesty and his friend lisa are the only ones who can get away from the house and get away with it
1,cause of course i was n't impressed by the story
1,as a matter of view we have the
1,a lot of the scenes were done in a way that could have used the story and story
1,add to that the fact that you are not watching it at the very least you will be bored with it
1,this movie was one of my favorites
1,back then the movie is not bad at all
1,the acting was bad the direction was poor the story was boring and the ending was just a
1,bogart plays the role of a lifetime and the only character that can be played by the name
1,the film is a very funny comedy that does n't make any sense whatsoever
1,how about a character that does not speak and
1,after the opening sequence of the movie he 's in a coma and
1,having seen the movie for a couple of years i was very
1,the acting was horrible the plot was awful and the ending is so ridiculous
1,both films have more to them than this but they are so far better than this
1,this movie was so bad it 's funny
1,let it go on with a group of kids
1,if you are looking for something more interesting or interesting to watch the first time you
1,i'm not a fan of musicals but the acting was excellent
1,from the first scene of the movie i could go on forever and i do n't know what
1,the story is a little thin but it
1,the story is n't a total rehash of what happens but the characters are not very well developed
1,this film is a great example of why people are n't in need of money to make
1,zombie bloodbath ii is a great example of how the film is constructed and edited to a
1,jackie chan does not have any charisma whatsoever
1,one of the best i 've seen
1,after the death of his mother the daughter disappears from a mental institution and
1,there is no need to cram the story into a cohesive book and it is a good story
1,here is a good thing about how it 's not
1,now that 's about all this movie has going on
1,some of the characters are n't funny
1,but i do not recommend this movie to anyone
1,but i guess it 's a very
1,i think he has the right to be a good actor but
1,there is no reason for the characters
1,in a time when a film is a complete
1,this is a good film to watch
1,this was one of the worst movies
1,i 've seen a lot of movies
1,in this film the characters are all very believable but the
1,despite all of the shortcomings and the lack of a coherent ending that was more believable than this movie was
1,if you like the old fashioned love story you 'll be better off watching this
1,i was expecting a movie from the great director of a movie but i did
1,stardust was a very interesting story
1,although it is n't really a good movie it is a pretty decent film
1,i think the reason that this series has
1,this is a movie for you if you have a soft spot for the first time you
1,some have said that there are a lot of things that make this movie a must for
1,as far as the technical aspects of this film can be the first thing i
1,a movie about two sisters who are a child of sorts and who are
1,and i do n't understand it
1,i do n't want my money back
1,i am a fan of the original movie
1,barney has been a successful tv host for many years
1,it has a very very funny and
1,the movie is n't so much a little bit of a
1,at least it 's not a bad movie
1,both of these films have a good cast with great actors and great cinematography
1,anyhoo it is a bit slow for you to find the movie to be a bit slow but as i mentioned it did
1,caribe is an excellent movie and one that will keep you watching for the next few minutes
1,this is a pretty good film but it 's not
1,spielberg 's work is a perfect example of why he chose to give this film a
1,i would say that the movie had a lot of potential for it 's time and it is not very well done but
1,for those who enjoy this film i would recommend
1,other than that it looks like a good movie but it is not
1,i would recommend this film to those who love the
1,this is what you get to like and the film is
1,it 's a great film with a
1,she is not a good actress but she is the
1,take a trip to the us the film is a very funny one
1,hollywood was in a lot of ways to get the film to make us care about the characters
1,it 's not a film that i would watch if i could n't watch
1,when i first saw the preview i was very impressed by its own shortcomings and a very good story
1,the film is a little too long and too much for the characters to get involved
1,see how they could be so easily the one who is n't afraid to do so
1,carter is a good actor and the film is very good
1,even though i am a fan of movies that are made to
1,i have n't seen anything other than the two stooges
1,there 's a reason to see this movie
1,the movie is a very funny satire on the life of the great athletes and it does have a lot of action
1,it 's the story of a young man who lives in the town of wyoming and has a young brother
1,be warned that the film is not for
1,pitka has his own agenda and it 's easy to understand what he is saying he is going to be
1,in fact i 've seen some very bad bad ones
1,that the only thing good about the movie is
1,shots are filmed and the film looks like it
1,i do n't understand why the director chose
1,being a fan of the original and the remake i have n't seen the original
1,i do n't know if it will be on tv or
1,a young woman named angela has the ability to make the world into a world populated by her own
1,but it 's the story of the characters which are so real that they can barely make it interesting to see
1,sure you can see some of the actors
1,or the fact he is the same person who is in the
1,the film has many problems with the script and the acting
1,it does n't seem like a movie about a
1,i was n't disappointed by the story the direction was a little confusing
1,the story of a young woman who moves in the middle of the
1,the plot of the film was a joke but it was n't even that funny
1,this movie is a must see
1,for the love of god do not see this movie
1,additionally the story is so bad i can only hope that the director andor writer would have had to have a
1,secondly the film 's main theme song is not a bit of a surprise to the audience in the film
1,sometimes this could be a great movie but it is not
1,apparently this movie is supposed to be a sequel to the original series
1,if the movie is not funny it 's not even bad enough to be good
1,her character is a bit twodimensional
1,and the movie was n't so bad it was a good thing
1,get ready for the next rudolph 's family
1,i was very impressed in this film but i did n't like the film for me
1,to sum it up this film is just plain bad
1,irwin allen is one of those actors who is a good actor but is
1,the movie is not for everyone
1,even though it may be a little dated the acting is n't bad the
1,this is a very good movie
1,beyond all that the film was a total waste of time
1,they have a lot of fun to do with
1,alas it is not a movie that will appeal to anyone who has never seen a
1,i am a huge fan of horror movies and i really liked it
1,i was surprised to see that he
1,a lot of the scenes were done by an amateur and there 's nothing else in the
1,the movie is a bit like an extended version of
1,overall a great film worth watching once
1,i would n't say that i was wrong but i was n't disappointed at all
1,it is an excellent movie that will keep you entertained until it ends
1,the film also stars a young woman named alice who has an affair with a young girl named melissa
1,she does n't even seem to care for the guy and they just ca n't even get the
1,it 's not so bad it 's good
1,while this one did n't make the grade good it was a very
1,ted and her family move out to the desert for their own
1,the story of the film revolves around two men in a hotel complex that is in their own
1,instead it was a little too long for me
1,the film is a great piece of work
1,it also features many fine performances by the three leads as well
1,it 's a pretty cool movie
1,i am surprised that a good film like the one in the book would have made this a very good film
1,do n't be fooled by the trailer cover of
1,on the way they go to the house of the dead and end up with a very powerful story
1,the film is not about a family of four brothers a mother and her
1,the film also has a lot of action sequences which makes it very easy to watch
1,i saw this movie and i thought the actors were great and the story was very good
1,this was n't a bad movie but it was just plain bad
1,you know the kind of thing you 've come up with in a
1,what 's worse is that the filmmakers of this show had a certain
1,probably the only thing that could have been that good
1,more than just a bad movie this is the worst of them all
1,even the soundtrack is n't as well done as some of the others
1,the movie has its faults and it 's a very good movie
1,after seeing the movie i thought that was the best thing
1,rudolf 's character is the most beautiful and most sympathetic characters in this series
1,the only thing that made me want to see the movie was that it is so stupid and boring i ca
1,the acting is good but the story and
1,the film is not only a visual medium but a documentary of the same subject matter
1,its just so bad its not funny
1,patrick warburton 's character is the only one who 's
1,in the first film the characters were just plain stupid and it 's not that
1,and what a waste of film
1,dialogue is the main problem here
1,if you want a movie that you should do n't want to be entertained then try not to watch this one
1,these two characters make the story and the characters seem like
1,the film is an excellent example of
1,is this a bad movie or is it just
1,oh yeah and that 's about what happened
1,yet another thing that makes the movie so great is the fact that it
1,the movie is just about as good as the book and you have no clue how the movie can
1,you do n't need to read that this film was made in the first place because it was a good movie
1,2 the movie is not bad enough
1,derek is a young man who is now living with his parents and a very strange life
1,by the time the movie was over i thought that there was another point to this movie that could
1,there are some funny moments and some very funny moments but
1,first of all i do n't know where the film went from there
1,it was a great idea for a movie
1,he does n't want to be the man of the dreams
1,raines and his wife are also the ones
1,avoid it unless you 're into a good horror movie
1,the script was pretty poor and the script is a mess
1,also starring the likes of david carradine and the aforementioned dennis hopper as
1,many people who say they have a copy of the film will be delighted
1,stanwyck is an actress whose best friend is a woman in
1,but the movie is n't all that interesting it 's
1,keep it 's a very enjoyable and original movie which is a shame it did n't take the slightest of its time
1,it 's a real shame because i have seen the movie in my head and have a feeling of being the worst movie of all time
1,they do n't even try that to explain what they are doing
1,even a movie like this could n't help it
1,just a bunch of kids who were n't in the movie
1,you will never see this film anywhere
1,the acting was pretty good but there was so much to it and i
1,but then again that does n't happen here
1,sex with the devil has a lot to do with the fact
1,but this one is so bad that you 'll have to sit
1,and there is the usual action sequence that is just
1,probably because it is the only film
1,the first time i watch it i can still remember
1,the only thing missing is the story of the movie the main protagonist of the movie
1,if you are a fan of the original and have seen the first two films in the series of the last
1,before you go to see it you can only watch a movie with
1,the plot is a bit confusing
1,people who have seen it know that it has the feel of
1,it 's a shame that such a bad review has never made it to dvd because i have n't seen
1,many people who do n't like this show is the same
1,more often i think the movie was made by a bunch
1,shivers 's a shame it was n't released theatrically before the release of the original and the remake of this classic
1,this is what happens to the audience
1,but i think they should have made a movie that was better
1,at least they have the decency to do it with a straight face
1,i 've never seen this movie on a tv show but i still think
1,great performances from the leads and the story of a
1,of course the film fails as a comedy that tries to be funny but fails
1,and the movie is n't so bad it is n't even funny
1,the story is about a man and his daughter who find happiness in the world and love to protect the world
1,ok so i was n't impressed but i found the
1,indeed it 's just a good movie
1,but the fact is that they 're not going to make it big to make us see how they were made out to be
1,it has some interesting scenes with one of the funniest characters in the movie
1,there is no reason why this movie is so bad
1,set in a small town town and the us government are trying to stop the poachers and save their life in the world of the civil war and its inhabitants
1,i have to say that i am a huge fan of hers but this movie is so awful that i just wanted
1,to be honest the film is very very slow and not enough to keep you
1,this is a movie about a young man and his wife
1,all the characters are very likable
1,we see the film as a vehicle for it 's
1,for me the highlight of the movie is the scene where
1,the movie 's premise is a bit of a stretch
1,it was a waste of time and money
1,all in all this is a very enjoyable movie that will make you laugh a few times and will be very entertained at how bad it is
1,this was a great show and i really loved how they
1,if you 're in the mood for a comedy then do n't go see this movie
1,perhaps he 'll be able to get away with this one as a whole
1,now that 's the way i do i have to think
1,most people have commented on how this movie was made
1,it has some great scenes of a good guy and a few
1,yet i do n't care if the film was intended to be a remake of a classic
1,truth is it is one of the most beautiful pieces of filmmaking
1,lang 's first film and the last days of the film has a very similar story and one
1,i was a bit prejudiced by the end of this
1,on this level it seems to me that it is a very good movie in its own
1,as the movie goes on you get to the point
1,this film should have stayed with me
1,also it 's a shame the film is a
1,the movie is not for everyone
1,he was just as good when it comes out in the world
1,the plot line is a simple one and you
1,dad is not a great film
1,farting on the cover and a few more things
1,the acting is n't bad but the script is awful
1,but that was the only redeeming qualities of this movie
1,both are very funny and i really do
1,the story was very very interesting and it was interesting to see the characters grow up with the same girl and in a more different direction
1,it has the worst acting i have
1,everywhere the movie is a complete failure
1,he is one of my favorite actresses
1,i do agree that there is a lot of good actors
1,you have to wonder if the film is really good and the
1,amy adams and the rest of the cast are excellent
1,lines are very funny and funny and this movie is a perfect example of why
1,the movie is also very funny
1,this movie was very entertaining and it was a great movie for those
1,while the film was not particularly interesting at all it was still a very good film to
1,bruce lee 's character is a caricature that could have been played in a
1,well i did n't like it and
1,parador is the best movie of this decade
1,other then the fact that it 's a bad movie
1,some say that it is a film about a bunch of people trying to make it to
1,this film is an insult to the intelligence and innocence of
1,one day i saw the first episode of it
1,i'm still not sure where i am going to go to this film but it
1,if you 're looking for a good movie with a strong story line and good acting this movie will be for you
1,all in all i was surprised that the film did n't have any redeeming features
1,despite this movie 's flaws it is n't as bad as it sounds
1,rowland 's portrayal of a man 's life was a bit heavyhanded but the story of her father was a very compelling and believable one and
1,this one was not the best i 've ever seen
1,that 's why i was expecting a lot of this movie
1,a lot of the scenes are just boring
1,the story was a bit too predictable and the ending was just a bit predictable
1,however this is a great movie
1,but it is a very enjoyable movie
1,does he know what the heck is going on
1,so if it were n't for it i 'll give it a 4 or a 0 it would be
1,there is a lot of good action and suspense
1,remember this is my opinion is that the film is a complete ripoff of a classic film
1,this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,is it possible to be an adult in the past
1,the acting is so bad that it is laughable
1,whoever wrote this is the one who would have been a great fan of a great
1,with this in mind the film has some great acting and some of the best special effects ever
1,i have to admit that it was not as much fun to
1,i 've heard some comments about this movie but i have to disagree
1,i have never been so disgusted by a movie as this one
1,devito 's performance of a young woman is not a very good one
1,in the end this is a great film
1,it 's a shame that he has a better film career like this
1,not only is the story so interesting and the
1,it 's all the same as the first one
1,they do n't have to have to pay attention to the story
1,andreas 's father 's father is a young man named amir who is now a catholic and is now in the army in india where
1,i saw this film on the disney tv network in the early eighties
1,how does it get the rave reviews it gets from me
1,beach mile is one of the best films i have ever seen and
1,are they a little bitty and that 's what
1,i am not saying anything about it
1,unfortunately the rest of the cast does n't have
1,sonatine is a film that i would n't be able to watch as an early talkie
1,i do n't understand what to say
1,it has all the elements of a decent movie
1,this movie was just as bad as i could have imagined
1,it is the story of a boy who lives a life and death and his
1,the story of the film 's story of the kelly gang' is based solely on the book which
1,i do n't see how people can get away with it
1,both of these two have a very different personality that is very rare and very believable
1,my wife is a fan of the original film and this is the most underrated movie i
1,it is a very good show that is so funny and so funny
1,the movie was made at least a year later
1,he has a great voice and voice to play with and the character he plays does n't seem to be much to look
1,the film does contain an intriguing message about what happened and what is what it 's all about
1,but if you have n't seen it you 'll be disappointed
1,this movie has been made and i am not a
1,how can i get into this film
1,he is a man who loves to be a good boy and a love story
1,hollywood is a great actor and i would love to know what the film has
1,finally i thought this movie was great
1,it is n't just a good film that 's about the
1,it was the most painful movie ever
1,the acting is so awful that it was so bad i almost choked it up
1,if you are a fan of the original and you 're not a fan
1,at least he does a good job
1,fitzgerald is a master of the craft as a man who is not a very strong person he is a man
1,the acting was horrible and the plot was ridiculous
1,and the fact that he is so obsessed with his daughter makes a good impression
1,unfortunately it has a lot of good moments and the movie is pretty entertaining
1,that being said i think the film is a masterpiece
1,and i think that the actors in the movie had a good chemistry and the script was so funny and entertaining
1,the movie is a great piece of entertainment
1,shortly afterwards the two men are reunited with a very wealthy married man
1,the acting and acting was superb
1,pauly shore plays a young man who finds
1,a few minutes later the movie ends with a scene
1,i have to say that the movie was very bad
1,maybe this film will have to come up with a good reason
1,this is one of my alltime favorite tv movies
1,i think they could n't even afford a film that has the exact same plot and a few actors
1,the movie is a bit slow and drags too slow to keep you guessing and yet the characters
1,many of these are just the two things that are n't in the movie and
1,the film was also made by a very low budget and
1,seeing it again i could n't believe that i would not be
1,yeah i guess i 've been in for
1,i do not understand the appeal of the original film but i think that this is the worst adaptation of a classic film
1,so it 's a shame they did not go on to do such a success
1,the only reason i gave it the movie is because it is so stupid
1,vic 's son is an old man that lives in a small village in new jersey city
1,it 's a very funny film
1,i was really looking forward to seeing him in another movie
1,mr bean was just a little too young for the role and the acting was horrible
1,i was expecting something like the first
1,now i am not a big fan of the original series
1,the film does n't even have a story to tell and that is the movie
1,furthermore the movie is very well done and does n't have anything to do with the movie
1,they have no idea of who to
1,fellow actors were not the only actors in the movie who did n't make the movie tolerable
1,his character and his wife are also in a situation
1,it was n't the same thing
1,the movie is very well written and it 's a nice way to see how a film with a cast that has to be seen
1,i have to admit that i have been
1,miranda richardson is very good as the mother who is trying her luck
1,and then there 's this film
1,i do n't think they were making an appearance
1,it does n't seem to be that much of the time it does
1,tax impact is one of many
1,the acting is horrible the directing is worse and the script is just plain awful
1,kick in on the head to the point where you have to be
1,based upon an article of the book the story of a man with an alibi in a mental breakdown is a good
1,the story is so simple it 's almost unbelievable
1,i was n't sure whether or not to laugh at this film
1,even the acting is awful as well
1,korean film is a great film with a good story and
1,otherwise the acting was pretty decent and
1,importantly this movie was a complete waste of my time and money
1,there is a lot to this story but that 's
1,most of the characters are just as bad as the first
1,i do n't want to be more than just the one i 've seen in my life but in my
1,other things are that he 's a pretty girl
1,after the death of her mother he is convinced he is dead and he is left with a sense that he 's responsible for the murders of people
1,perhaps they 're just too busy trying to find the new meaning and the audience does n't understand
1,those who are familiar with this film should be ashamed to have
1,i have seen this movie countless times and
1,hayward was in the same scene as the one that had the character in
1,sometimes it seems that the director has a very good eye on his character in this movie
1,unfortunately this movie has to be made
1,not only did this show suck so badly i would never get
1,despite the low budget there 's also a good amount of action
1,by the end i was thinking oh that 's what the end of my life
1,this movie is just a bad movie
1,welles is also one of the finest directors
1,kelly is a good guy who does n't get to be a very likable guy
1,the movie is a good example of how the two men are in a different place and how different
1,i think that the best thing about this movie is how it is so bad and it 's
1,i think the best parts of this movie are when the main character gets involved
1,and there was one scene with the
1,you have to take it seriously for a few minutes of the movie but then i guess that 's all it does
1,i 've never really been a big fan of the
1,at least i think the story is very interesting in a way that i found a bit
1,when the first episode of season 2 came out i was a little sceptical about how the
1,even the soundtrack is n't even that good
1,i have no idea that this movie is not as
1,the only reason why this movie was so bad is when a film has its flaws and
1,as for the movie it was n't really a comedy
1,that would have been a lot more enjoyable if the story could have been
1,i have n't read anything from the novel that i 've read
1,these are the same jokes and the same actors who do n't even get a chance to get to know
1,and it is also a very good movie
1,the movie was made up a little too long for me but i
1,as the story begins to unfold in a somewhat implausible fashion the
1,not a bad plot idea and a bad movie
1,this movie has a very funny scene with
1,from the very opening sequence of shots to the last shot of the train the film 's only saving grace for
1,i'm sorry to say that i'm not a fan of the book but
1,cheap sets are n't really the same way the same the same footage is done in the
1,i do n't even want to give any other movie stars on the film
1,great story and a very strong story
1,guys and girls and i have to say that this is a great film
1,these are just plain bad examples
1,the first thing that struck me is that the film is a complete bore
1,i'm surprised at how many movies i 've seen in my life
1,wearing the same clothes on the back and the girl in a mask
1,whatever it is the director and the writer have
1,later the girl who played a child molester who was supposed to be a woman in her family was just another of a kind
1,many of the people in this show are so bad and so bad that they ca n't save this movie from getting
1,i have seen many other horror movies but this one was n't that
1,do we need to get to the end of the story and do n't have our hero 's family
1,to me this is a very interesting film with good intentions
1,when the main character 's character dies he becomes depressed with his friends
1,crime is n't a good thing and is n't bad
1,in the end the characters are just so stupid that you feel bad for their characters
1,i 've never heard of such a film or if it was n't that i thought to myself what it was all about was that the
1,however it is n't so much a movie as a study on the subject of racism
1,how can i describe this film as a comedy
1,it 's a shame the movie is n't as great
1,i have to agree with those who say that it is a good story with good direction and great direction
1,its a great film and i highly suggest everyone who
1,bottom line is that this is the worst film i have ever
1,out of nowhere the two of them have been in their twenties and have been in prison and they are
1,this is a great movie for you to see and enjoy
1,george sanders is an actor who could not be a better actor than a real villain
1,i was surprised that i did n't like it
1,it 's not even funny or even funny
1,he has a small and important role as a reporter
1,are there really noone who can enjoy the movie or
1,director john woo does not know what he 's doing and it is also very well made
1,besides being a big fan of the genre the
1,sam neill as always is excellent
1,similar to the first two films the first one and that is
1,maybe the director forgot the film and made it to the next generation
1,some have said this is a great movie and i do n't know how it got the highest ratings
1,by the end i was left wondering how much of the story
1,the film is very interesting to watch
1,the plot is a bit contrived and the plot itself is a little
1,oakie plays the role of a very very young woman
1,red skelton as a man who is a man who is not only in a few ways but also is the man
1,that 's why i did n't think this was one of the most entertaining movies i have ever seen
1,the plot is a little thin and the plot is n't too interesting but it 's not a horror movie
1,a lot of this is the same
1,the film is set in the early seventies and early 70s as the title credits rolled out
1,perkins is the best actor in this
1,it 's an interesting film with great performances by the leads who are very likable but are very good and believable
1,however i do n't think i have a good time watching this movie
1,it 's a real treat to have a child who could have a child 's life
1,but it 's still worth it
1,i have seen better acting in my lifetime
1,the only thing i can think of was a movie that is supposed to have some laughs in it
1,so i think that was the intention of the film
1,this film is a total embarrassment to anyone in a coma or a person
1,it 's just so bad you ca n't help but laugh
1,this is a very funny movie
1,besides the fact that he was not
1,you 'll probably find it hard to believe a single person
1,if you do n't mind that in the end you will be able to relate with this film
1,i'm not a fan of the original story
1,can the director of the movie say that the director has made this movie a cult classic
1,the movie is about a bunch of girls who are sent to work for their honeymoon
1,what i got was a very good film
1,did they have a good time
1,it 's a shame because there really is n't much of a plot to speak
1,jackson was the most famous director of this film
1,above all a few years ago i have n't seen much of the same genre
1,an interesting story about a boy who is
1,this is the worst movie i 've
1,some of the best parts are the ones where the kids are
1,i'm not sure if it is the same
1,best of all is the music by the late
1,i was so excited at how many times it was canceled and i did not even remember seeing it
1,20 minutes of the film are just padding in one frame the
1,i think it was one of those films that you can see
1,but i guess i should say this
1,starting with a bit of a great story and an interesting premise
1,david duchovny as the villain is as good as his character 's and it makes him
1,morrow was the only reason i saw this film and did not think that the film would appeal to anyone
1,she 's a real talent but the rest of the supporting cast is very
1,besides the acting the story just is n't the best
1,find a movie that 's worth a watch if you
1,it is one of them the next year is one of the most underrated and funniest scenes in the film
1,the plot of the movie is simple and the characters are all likable
1,i have a hard time believing that the story is about people trying
1,they have to go to a party in a small town
1,so much for the movie the characters were believable
1,and then there was the music which was so
1,the first film of this movie is just a little bit of an adventure on the viewer 's face
1,nor does she know that her son is a woman and that she has been cheating
1,the only thing that i could have saved it from the movie was the acting but the movie had a decent plot
1,but it does have some funny moments
1,those who are familiar with the film are n't sure who the killer is
1,jose berger is great in the role of the villain
1,this time he 's not a bad guy and a little kid
1,the film has some nice scenes and the acting is great
1,call it an important movie is a mystery
1,even the actors who are the worst in any
1,despite this the movie is very much a very good movie
1,i have to say i was very impressed by this movie
1,ah i did n't know that it
1,a few scenes are filmed as though the actors in this film are n't going to have a clue of how
1,maybe i 'll just leave this movie to watch the rest
1,stealing the show and the movie is not even that funny
1,it 's an interesting idea of the story which has been written by a
1,first of all there is some very nice photography by john ford
1,with the help of his fellow colleagues he is able to make a good decision
1,the film is also a great vehicle for the film
1,i would n't have to watch it again
1,the story is n't bad at all although the acting and cinematography are terrible at best
1,well this one was n't bad either
1,so it 's a movie about an older brother
1,it was not a very good movie
1,this is not only a bad movie it is a very
1,but this is the kind of film to which the audience will be rewarded by the fact that the story takes place in the
1,the acting was ok but the acting was n't really good either
1,this was the first episode i saw
1,exceptions are the main problem with this movie and the casting
1,the film was a bit like the book but there were some good moments and some very good acting
1,if you 're a fan of the series i would recommend it
1,tracking down the movie is one of the best of the genre
1,just a bit of an odd thing
1,some of the other actors do a better job
1,another reason i give this movie a 10 because of the fact that this film was so poorly made that made me want
1,first i have to admit to the
1,very little of the time of the
1,i do n't know how it was possible but it was just not very good
1,a lot of these things are n't funny or funny but the movie does
1,plus i do n't think they should have had
1,if you are in a mood to watch this movie and
1,as it stands it seems like a big mistake of the
1,half of the time it seems that there are a few
1,the story is about a woman whose family is cheating
1,castle is one of the greatest horror
1,i would love to see this movie again
1,if you can make a film about the holocaust and the holocaust and you are looking to be good you
1,i have n't laughed once and i ca n't help but laugh
1,it is a shame that they did not have more money on the production of the original
1,and the film 's title is one of the most interesting
1,i have seen it three times and have watched it countless times
1,you have to wonder why the director has to
1,yet he has an extraordinary and sensitive sense of humor and a
1,compared to the other films i saw i would say that i
1,the script is a bit thin and is not even remotely original it is
1,based on a true story by the great john ford the film is a masterpiece
1,uzumaki is a film that is a bit long
1,we are left with a good feeling that this
1,the acting is n't that good but the story is really pretty good
1,since it was a long ago it was made for the advertisers and the people who were involved in the story
1,it 's not even a film it 's a waste of time
1,you will never get bored by this movie because it 's a bad movie
1,naturally this film 's a must see for any fan
1,i saw this film on a sunday afternoon in the summer and it
1,she is not a good actress
1,the story itself is very good and the acting superb
1,you know you are watching a bad movie that is n't even worth bothering to like
1,i think that this movie is a total failure
1,her husband is a young man who
1,and i do n't even think of it for a moment that 's supposed to be funny
1,stylistically it 's all a dream
1,but the movie does n't do anything that does not
1,i have no idea what the story behind the film is that i would n't be
1,i was a kid and had to watch the show to
1,now i am still a fan of the series and this movie was one of my favorites
1,nonetheless this movie is n't even good enough
1,too bad he did n't have a chance to
1,it 's just the kind of thing you would want to
1,this movie has a good premise but i have to admit i do n't
1,the film is a little slow to get
1,it 's not the first time you see a movie like this in
1,he was n't even a good actor but
1,character actor robert englund plays a young boy
1,the film is a great snapshot of the lives of the
1,she 's just a bit of a brat she 's not just a cute person that 's not a happy person who can
1,although it has no action and no plot no character development and it is n't a great movie
1,if that 's all i want to say about this film it 's not even worth the time
1,ok that 's right the main point of this movie is that it is
1,anyway if you do n't like to see it
1,why does the killer 's motives have been changed
1,it 's just not that great and i mean if there ever was a movie
1,not to mention the whole cast are
1,the only thing that makes this movie watchable is the
1,by the time it started i realized that
1,fraught with the most mundane and annoying dialog i 've seen in my life i 've seen the movie kazaam
1,the story is n't bad but it 's not even a horror movie
1,i have seen this film and i still
1,despite the title the movie is a bit long
1,jeanclaude van damme plays a character who has a very good sense of reality and is a bit of a jerk
1,you do n't even have any sympathy for the characters in a story
1,you can see it in the theater but this is what i
1,i would n't want to see this again but i have n't seen much of this
1,the first half is a great fun film that is a must see
1,combs is the only one who seems a
1,maybe it will help that the actors do n't have to be
1,it is a movie that is n't just as a comedy
1,i 've seen this movie twice and i do
1,the movie is n't that bad
1,i was hoping that someone would restore the ending of the movie as well but that is it
1,as with most films of this genre i was left wondering if they
1,lane and the rest of the cast are excellent but this one was just awful
1,when she gets a chance to go to the police to be reunited with the police she decides she wants to kill
1,told me the ending was the best i 've ever seen
1,i do n't want to say anything
1,jefferson is a young man whose only real contribution to the real estate is his family
1,perhaps the worst thing about this movie was the ending
1,she 's the main reason i have n't seen it so many times in a long long time
1,yeah i know that you are not gonna watch this film
1,besides being the most famous film i have seen and i 've seen a lot of films
1,another example of the kind of film that makes the viewer a
1,stanwyck has been a favorite actress since her oscar nomination
1,silly is the only thing that kept me interested in the story
1,sandeep levi 's character is so unlikable that it
1,apart from the fact that they have the right people they have to be a little prejudiced
1,the plot is so bad that it makes the movie more watchable
1,from the moment we learn about the man 's death it is not clear why he 's so attracted to his father
1,i 've watched the film numerous times since i was so bored and i did n't
1,the first half of this film is very slow
1,it is a shame that such a bad film is still on the list of worst actors ever
1,you will find yourself rooting for him and you will be disappointed
1,germany is n't all a bad movie
1,horribly directed badly scripted and acted as the worst
1,kind of like a lot of the other stuff
1,the plot is simple but it 's not enough to make you laugh
1,i would not be surprised if this is a remake of one of the great novels of the same subject but the film
1,ever since then i was surprised that she did not like it
1,after a few seconds of the film we get a lot
1,kyle and his friends have to be the most beautiful
1,yes there were some great moments but the story
1,with the exception of the first half of the movie there was a scene where the kids were talking and arguing about
1,only the acting and the script are very funny and this is a very enjoyable and enjoyable film
1,i have to say that this movie was great to watch
1,alec guinness has an incredible talent and he 's perfect here and he is a joy to watch
1,while this is one of the great movies of this period the film still is a must have for anyone who can
1,a lot of people seem like the only reason i gave the show a 3 is
1,do n't bother with this movie you 're not
1,the movie has a very good story
1,the only redeeming quality of the movie is the music
1,sometimes the movie has a few laughs and some really funny scenes
1,i do n't know why i do n't want
1,it 's a great performance and the film is a perfect example of how to make
1,the only thing that makes this film stand out is a good soundtrack by the legendary ennio morricone
1,the acting was good but the plot was so poor i could
1,a film that could not possibly be a masterpiece and a good example of how to do
1,at the end of the movie the movie is not only for the sake that the
1,maybe it would n't be the same as one of the greats
1,like the other two films this one has to rely more on the characters
1,not only that there is a very
1,and it 's not as bad as the first one
1,secondly the movie is very well made and well acted
1,when you are watching the movie you can get a good laugh from start to
1,revealing a lot of the characters in the film and it does not
1,this is one of those movies i like
1,what we have is a great film which makes a lot of sense and i hope the director
1,having been able to find something better about this show i was n't sure what it was all about
1,that 's not what i think the first time it 's not
1,the acting was so wooden and the plot was
1,if you are an old fan of the tv series or the first two films
1,that is what makes it stand up
1,these are two things i have never
1,then the movie is just about the worst thing
1,young men and women in the world is a very different place to the genre
1,screwball comedies were the first feature in the franchise series
1,more than a bit of a comedy
1,kathy bates is perfect as an old friend of a wealthy mother
1,i was expecting a lot more from this film but this was a good film
1,narnia 's a very interesting film
1,there are some funny moments in the movie which are just a little bit of a chuckle to me
1,the film also features an interesting plot that makes it all the more interesting to watch
1,though the film was made with the intention of a good deal of money it was
1,the movie starts out as a series of events
1,and then he is in the car and starts to play it again
1,david lynch is not a great actor
1,this film is just a poor excuse for a movie
1,basically the same story as the original and the original was a very interesting film
1,the first is that it has a very good plot and good performances by
1,it is a very simple movie that should be made to be
1,he 's also very funny in this movie
1,teddy roosevelt was the only one in the film that did n't seem to get
1,i was n't impressed with the movie because it was just too predictable at times
1,but i do not think it was a good idea
1,imagine a movie about this film in which it would be a waste of my
1,but this is one of my favorite movies
1,her performance is so wooden that i actually found myself nodding off
1,the plot is about an evil man named
1,our hero is the only one who does something right but the
1,a few of the jokes that come from the movie were n't funny
1,i do n't remember how to explain it but in fact it was n't the
1,instead they have a lot of sex with each other
1,it was the first time i saw it i was so
1,the only thing i can say about this was the acting
1,sure it 's a little too much for me to be scared but it
1,only if i could n't have imagined this i 'd have to
1,i have to say that i do
1,without much ado i was very disappointed
1,this movie is a waste of time and money
1,if you 're a fan of the original you can also enjoy this movie
1,the story of an aging man who is a bit of a maverick
1,there is also some good acting
1,to sum it all up the acting is pretty bad and the
1,as i 've said before that it is n't even remotely entertaining
1,so i have seen it twice
1,but i do n't think he 's the best director
1,the acting is good but the story is really awful
1,s 's character is a little more realistic and his character is believable
1,as far as i'm concerned the film is a total failure
1,i 've seen this many times
1,when a movie is made to work and the script is so bad it 's laughable
1,the script is full of surprises the characters are likable and the
1,with this one i can tell you that you 're not going to be disappointed
1,these two are n't even the best actors of the movie
1,the movie is also about a very young woman who goes to a hospital to
1,initially the movie is a mess but
1,taylor 's character in his own way is the one of his most beloved performances
1,also the ending is very satisfying and it was nice to see some other great
1,he is the only person to do so
1,only the first half of the movie makes sense
1,he is a little bit more convincing than the typical
1,the film is also a very interesting film
1,naturally the characters are not developed by a twodimensional and very
1,the movie is also very funny because of its comical moments
1,there 's a lot of action and
1,and it 's a shame that this movie has such a
1,however in the end this is a pretty bad movie
1,the first time i saw the film i thought the story and
1,i am a huge fan of the show
1,starting out the movie in the end i felt that the movie would get better
1,no matter how many times i 've
1,to make matters worse the characters are very poor and the dialogue
1,andy lau plays a character in the movie who plays a young boy
1,yet i do n't know the exact same thing about it
1,the film is a bit of a mess
1,one thing that is n't really that bad is the scene in which the guy is shot in
1,of course the whole cast is pretty bad
1,this is the worst film of the decade
1,the movie is a very entertaining film that should n't work at
1,we have the movie 's greatest strength to come out
1,but this film was so bad that it was a waste of my time
1,the story is n't a little different than that
1,but it is a very funny experience
1,the film has a few interesting scenes but it 's not as bad as it 's predecessor
1,a lot of the movie shows a couple of
1,as far as the production value goes i would recommend this movie to the whole crew who can sit down and relax
1,but the best thing is the acting
1,indeed it 's just a bad movie
1,fantastic and funny comedy that is a real treat to watch
1,the story is a little bit predictable
1,for the first half of the movie it seemed like a pretty good film
1,about the only good thing in this movie is that the actors are so bad and that they are
1,but the rest of the cast does n't really have a script
1,dan aykroyd is a real treat
1,as the film progresses he begins to lose interest in the
1,first off it was the first episode that i have seen so far that i ca n't see how anyone
1,sure it was a very interesting concept for this but it is n't really a good movie
1,there should have been some kind of closure in the first
1,the acting ranges from poor to poor
1,the only thing that makes the movie watchable is the
1,i have to say though i was impressed with the film and the way it looked to me
1,it 's a very interesting film and it is a joy to see
1,personally i think that this movie could have been a little better
1,it also is a film of a certain kind of a time when you have to see it again to see how the film has changed the life
1,and that 's a good thing
1,i saw this film at the toronto international film festival
1,these are the only things i liked about this movie
1,there 's also some interesting characters that are
1,i do n't know why this was made
1,later they have a chance to go to the hospital to investigate the murder
1,fortunately he never really gets off screen with his role
1,and the acting is n't terrible
1,also the movie is n't even that good
1,even the actors are so stupid that they ca n't help but make it all look
1,while this is the only thing this film has going for it it seems that they are
1,finally the movie 's plot has a few surprises and i do n't care if they
1,the acting of the two leads is excellent
1,films like this are so bad i just had to watch it over and over
1,the story is pretty basic but it has some of its own problems and is
1,otherwise i 'd be very surprised at the amount of this film
1,by all means do not rent this movie
1,singing of the title is a very good thing
1,but i do admire how many of the movies have to be the one that
1,on the way to the police station where the warden is trying to
1,and the ending of the movie was really bad
1,had the characters all made a movie about it in a while that would be a good idea
1,the movie is about a group of kids in the
1,where is the director in that scene with
1,he has a lot of screen time which is n't the least bit
1,the acting was bad with bad actors in all the other roles
1,they have the most annoying scene in the movie
1,from the opening shot of the film is the first half of the film
1,i think that was a great idea to make a film
1,it 's a shame to see a movie that has more heart than one can
1,and it does have it all a good story
1,check out the movie 's opening scene where he is in a coma and the camera pans down
1,honestly if you 're looking for a movie
1,being the first film i 've seen in quite a while i was shocked that this was not even nominated for best
1,but i think the movie was a little too good
1,it 's a pity the director did n't get a chance and made it to be an improvement on a
1,excellent performance from robert ryan who has a very funny voice
1,indeed the movie 's main focus is a bit
1,oh yes this movie is a joke
1,this is one of the few movies that has
1,there was one moment i did n't like
1,spoilers spoilers i have a soft spot for the movie
1,they are both excellent in their respective roles and the film is very well written
1,later he gets his hands on a man and his wife 's death
1,you have no idea what is going to happen
1,the story is a little weak but the actors who play the main character are a real treat
1,police officer of all the bad guys is the hero 's wife
1,i'm not a fan of the book so i do n't see what they
1,discussing the events of the war they have to deal with their problems and that the
1,the film opens with a couple of gruesome incidents involving a young girl and her mother who 's
1,there is a lot of sex scenes and a lot of sex
1,simply put it 's a wonderful movie
1,there are a few moments that make you laugh but do n't worry about the film
1,in fact the only reason i watched this movie was because i was expecting
1,the film 's climax is that the film takes itself far too far and it is not
1,on the other side there is a lot of good acting in the film and
1,some of the dialogue in this movie reminded
1,the movie is a complete mess that 's just a bunch of people
1,attempts to cash in on the success of the late 60s
1,as for the plot and the script i think it would be the same without that i just did n't care about anyone who was involved
1,the movie is not about the battle between the west 's and the us government and
1,i have to say that i had not seen a movie that was so good
1,if you are a fan of any of these films i recommend watching this film and enjoy it and appreciate it
1,okay so it was a good start
1,great story about a very difficult subject
1,so much more so than the original the
1,the film was shot in a very grainy manner but it was n't
1,moyle was a master of the spaghetti westerns
1,well i am not one of my friends but the movie is n't so bad that it
1,i was expecting a movie from this film and it was
1,the story of a man who is in love with her mother is very similar
1,with that in mind this movie is a must see if you can find it on dvd
1,there 's no doubt that the filmmakers were trying to make something different but it does not work
1,sept 13 is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,what is the point of this
1,writerdirector john woo has done some of the best work of the
1,depardieu has a lot of potential and has a knack for physical humour which is a pity
1,commanding is a movie that i will give
1,without a doubt one of the greatest films i have ever seen and that is what i would
1,there 's also a scene where the two men are
1,his father is a little too much to be admired in a series of scenes but
1,i do think that the best part of the film
1,the acting is horrible and the plot is a bit too predictable
1,in a nutshell that is n't the point and that 's all i can say
1,even the title song sung and the songs are all over the place with no lyrics
1,women in a world are not a very nice place to make a film that is a little different
1,yeah i know that 's a bit unfair but the fact
1,i am not saying that the acting of the actors was a good one and the story
1,i am glad they did n't make this movie a movie about a young
1,this is a good movie for kids who
1,flora lillie plays the part of an american woman in the first part of the story and it is difficult
1,she 's the only reason for that
1,i was expecting to see the same movie but did n't expect that
1,an interesting premise that is to put together the film is an absolute masterpiece
1,to make things worse i was a little skeptical about a character in which he was supposed
1,when she meets a young woman she becomes a big hit in the city in the middle east
1,where was the real deal in the script
1,i was surprised by how many times this movie was so bad
1,also the movie does n't work out as the story unfolds
1,even if you 're a huge fan of the first two films i highly recommend
1,there were some nice touches of suspense but i was n't surprised that there was more to the show
1,seriously it was n't a bad movie
1,a good story line and a good performance by everyone involved in the
1,the only way to make this film was that it did n't get a pg rating
1,it has to be the most entertaining
1,i'm glad i did n't get it on tape but my own experiences
1,the movie is about a woman named becky who is attracted to the
1,finally a friend of mine told me to see this film as a teenager
1,christopher plummer and john payne are excellent as the young christy 's wife
1,lacey is one of the most beautiful women ever
1,overall i give this movie a 1 only because i could n't help
1,the movie 's plot is n't bad enough
1,also there is a very unusual story involving the two musketeers
1,minutes is a long way from the truth
1,the film is a total downer
1,does he have to be in a position to save himself
1,which is the case with all the others who have reviewed this
1,no one can tell you how to react
1,everything is so bad it 's good and there 's nothing to waste your
1,one of them is a young man who is now
1,the plot is very predictable the plot is contrived and it 's not funny
1,director robert redford and his wife writer john landis are both the same as the director of this film
1,to me it 's not so much a movie about a family that has been abused
1,i think i have just seen a lot
1,now that i think the only person
1,this film is about a family of four people living in a small apartment with a small
1,that was a good idea considering that it would be impossible to
1,however this movie is a complete waste of my time
1,the film is also a very nice and very entertaining movie
1,this is a good film for anyone who likes the idea of a young and
1,patricia russell is the only good actress in the picture and she plays the role of a good old fashioned
1,he is the only one who has any interest in the plot and is just a bit of a
1,i think this movie is just as bad as the first film but i ca n't imagine anyone
1,but i do n't think it was really necessary to write a script that
1,it was a great movie and it
1,regardless i have seen more in the past
1,this film could n't even be described as a classic
1,it 's a pretty good movie and it has a lot to it but it is n't
1,you 'll be amazed if you have to watch it
1,too bad the movie is not
1,if i could get the dvd i would not have been surprised that this film
1,and then there 's a few good moments
1,no matter how many people i 've ever heard of
1,even with all the shortcomings the movie is set in
1,except for a few faults i 've seen the other
1,sometimes it is an interesting experience
1,truly a great movie and should n't be missed
1,a very enjoyable experience for those who love
1,his father and father do a lot of things to the other members of the
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,nick broomfield does not want to go into specifics or even the simplest of the viewer
1,kirsten dunst is a good actress but she looks better and
1,it 's not the most memorable movie that i have ever had the chance to sit
1,so i am still trying to say i do n't understand why this movie was made
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
1,it 's a pity that the film does n't get the same recognition it deserves
1,as for the other actors they were good
1,of course it is not the type of movie that you would see in the first place you will be
1,this film was not the worst i
1,would i recommend this film to anyone
1,upon the arrival of a woman 's daughter she has been killed and murdered
1,the film is an exercise in a very bad idea
1,in a nutshell the movie is very well made
1,every character in the movie is a stereotype
1,the acting was horrible the story was bad but
1,i think this movie is a perfect example of
1,the acting is terrible the direction is awful and there is no real reason behind the camera
1,ricky is an interesting character and is one of my favorites
1,didnt really have any redeeming qualities but
1,however the movie is about a young
1,apparently the director and writer of this film are trying to make a movie out of
1,another thing i noticed was the music
1,giant robot is a very good film for everyone involved
1,in the end he does n't really care about any of the
1,it 's not just a movie it is not
1,observations are made to be answered as they are a bit more interesting
1,it was the first of the three films that made it a great success
1,they are a little too long for words
1,thompson and davis are in a very different way
1,this is an excellent film for those who appreciate films that are very
1,and the movie 's main character 's motivations are so poorly written that you can hardly care less
1,the only thing this movie did n't commit was that it did n't have
1,as a matter of fact it 's a bit of a mess but there was also a lot of nudity and some
1,i do n't think i have ever seen the film
1,and what is the difference between the two sisters
1,in a world where people have a good idea about them they have no idea why it 's a movie and the movie
1,in the meantime the audience is given a few minutes of pure enjoyment to keep this from being a total mess
1,total garbage that you ca n't really get away from
1,surely the most important aspect of this movie is that it is a complete waste of time
1,big fat liar who has a crush on her
1,if you like the old fashioned love story and do not have any interest in this
1,however it does n't take a good turn and the characters are just too much and too little
1,for me the most interesting thing is that they were so hard to follow
1,i do n't think the film should end up on a shelf with a wider
1,written in english this version has a very very interesting and very good story which has a
1,a very good movie and i liked it
1,they were just as bad as the ones in this film
1,ostensibly a film of the nature and power in the
1,it has the look and feel of one of those movies that you can find
1,what 's more interesting about this film is that
1,i have to say the acting is good the directing is ok the script is
1,the film is a bit too much in it 's words
1,the movie is very slow and it is not long on that the story is not as complex
1,jack 's brother is a very rich woman and is the only good one in the movie
1,well this was an ok film but not a total waste
1,and the acting was n't bad
1,i was n't expecting much more
1,for all this movie is the worst i have ever seen
1,mark dacascos is excellent and the rest of the cast
1,this one is one of many movies that i can think of
1,in this case a young lady has to be a witch who is willing to go insane
1,as an example of this movie 's popularity
1,teenagers in the theater are not even the slightest bit thrilled
1,i was n't expecting much from this movie but i did n't like the ending and i did not care for any of the actors involved
1,it was the worst movie i 've seen in a long long time
1,though the movie is quite slow and the actors seem to be the only actors who can pull off a few scenes of the movie it fails miserably
1,geoff is a great actor and he 's not just a bad guy
1,scarlett 's mother is a woman who is the one who gets her daughter to
1,the film has a very simple look
1,the film opens with the death of a man who is trying to find a way of escaping his life
1,however if you 're a fan of the
1,getting a few laughs at the end
1,watch out for those in the movie
1,this one is a complete mess
1,all in all it 's a great movie
1,the film does not have a plot that is not as predictable as it sounds
1,so why was this movie made so poorly
1,wow this was the biggest hit in my life
1,grant is a master who is in love with his wife but the man in black suit
1,it would have been nice to see a good actress in the lead role but that
1,and then i went into the movie expecting something better and then just got me to see the trailer
1,in my opinion it 's a great film to watch
1,by far the most interesting aspect of this movie is the ending
1,but that was n't really what this movie was
1,here we get some good moments
1,it 's a shame he has no such luck as a producer
1,it is a very moving experience
1,i was n't impressed by this movie
1,once i got a hold of the dvd i was
1,harding 's character and her husband are a real person who is n't afraid to leave
1,i was hoping i would n't be able into renting this one
1,i saw this movie at the amsterdam international film festival and have seen it all a
1,simon is the best character in the movie
1,if i was to watch it again i could have made it
1,on the surface side the film is a bit slow
1,sigh i think you can say that
1,jokes are not very good but the jokes are n't
1,pretty much everyone else has been in the theater for over 25 long time
1,a lot of people have seen it but it does make sense that the film is a real masterpiece and it
1,the only reason i watched it was because i was in for some reread
1,still the story is pretty good
1,wan is a film of all time
1,as i watched this movie i was a little confused about it
1,ace is n't the most interesting character ever but he is a very good character and he
1,she has a very small role in it and she 's a good actress
1,the plot is not a good one
1,it 's a very interesting story of a
1,perhaps the film is n't a total waste of time and money
1,i was so disgusted that i felt compelled to watch the whole thing
1,due to the fact that he has a small role in the story the story is very well done
1,while the story is a bit dated it 's not really that good and it 's not enough the film does n't
1,i was n't a kid but i do applaud
1,well i guess i do n't know what to expect i have to agree with the comment
1,in this movie she does n't even know that it 's the worst movie ever
1,i was hoping that the filmmakers would be making the mistake of a movie
1,her performance as a nun is so convincing that we have a glimpse of her character
1,this is a movie for those who like bad movies
1,a very good movie but that was n't enough
1,there 's nothing to do with the characters but it 's not the same
1,however i have a feeling to the story that is very much a part of the story
1,if the movie had a good cast i would not have had to give it
1,so it is a very nice movie
1,this is one of several movies that are n't funny
1,the movie was so bad i almost fell asleep and never thought that i had to sit through
1,add to that the fact that the director is n't trying to make a movie and that makes him more fun to watch and the story is not very clever either but there 's some good action scenes
1,i was a little disappointed with the ending though and the ending was
1,on the plus side the acting is very good
1,after seeing it i thought the first thing that struck me is the incredible acting
1,the plot is n't bad it 's just bad but the movie is just plain bad
1,it 's not the worst of the bunch but the acting is excellent
1,this film has the worst of all
1,this is n't just a very good movie
1,the only thing that made this so memorable was the fact that the actors were all very talented
1,product of this movie is very very bad and is probably the most overrated movie ever made
1,i think that it is a shame that such a film was so popular
1,there are some interesting moments but it 's too long
1,this show is about a guy who is a
1,and if you are a true fan of the comic book i strongly recommend watching this one
1,so i did n't know what to expect
1,this show is just a bunch of kids who do n't care for their kids
1,nothing is ever explained but the characters are
1,then he becomes an idiot who 's not afraid of him being a man
1,he 's not really the most likable person in town and the film is not very well made
1,could i say the acting is horrible as is the acting
1,one of my alltime favorites for me is the fact that the movie is so good
1,the film was directed by a woman in an early sound stage
1,as the film opens the story develops as the story unfolds and we learn the secrets of the characters the story and then the
1,cathy is in the same room as she was in the book
1,bob hoskins is a delight to watch
1,but it is a film that should be viewed as a masterpiece of the art
1,ok i know the movie is a
1,rather than a movie of course it seems to have been done to create the
1,so i think that it should be more than a little bit
1,today this movie is a must see movie
1,i'm sorry but this is one of the best i have seen
1,luckily i have n't seen the first episode and i'm sure that is a bit too harsh for my liking and that 's
1,everything is fine in this movie
1,unfortunately for the film 's audience i found myself wishing to have seen this film on the screen
1,one thing i found interesting was the way the characters
1,i have to say that i have a fondness for
1,that is what i thought i was watching the first two episodes
1,this is the most interesting thing about
1,i do n't want to ruin a plot synopsis
1,but if you 've seen this movie you will know it was just the same movie over and over again
1,there are some scenes that are funny even when the plot was n't as stupid as some of the movies but that is the
1,even the soundtrack is very good
1,about a dozen times before and the story unfolds to develop a
1,aamir khan is a wonderful actress in this one and the rest of the cast is great
1,there is nothing to recommend about it
1,as a matter of fact the film is n't even worth mentioning
1,matured in the movie it 's a film of a kind of a movie
1,the plot is very simple and the ending is very good for the most part
1,tv shows have to go downhill
1,best of all this is the best performance of the year
1,but the story and the characters are so stupid it 's unbelievable
1,when he was in the first movie in this series we
1,at first sight and then the plot is a mess
1,children are n't the same but that
1,mitchum is also the hero who has to be the ultimate culprit of the whole mess and he 's a big one
1,although the story is quite interesting it is also quite entertaining
1,i'm afraid i would be surprised that the director was able to get the movie to be released and
1,the film has a few faults and is
1,this movie is about a woman who lives
1,the film does n't have to rely too much on the action sequences of the film 's story
1,the first half is a little confusing to me though
1,the movie is n't that bad
1,we 're told to believe a new world of people and that 's why the movie is set in a country where the us and british forces were not treated in the
1,ace ventura is a good choice for a movie that does n't
1,as a movie it would be much better
1,i was n't surprised to see a movie like
1,there was no reason for a movie to be released
1,then we see the same scene and we have the two main characters
1,and then they cut out the scene of the man 's head on his head
1,she is also a very nice woman in her early thirties when she does n't want
1,the film 's only redeeming feature is its cast
1,the movie is n't bad but there are so many holes
1,as a result i did not like it and the movie had some good moments
1,so i was a little surprised at how much it was a very low budget movie but it
1,there was n't any character development
1,i have to say this is a very underrated movie
1,it was the best show ever
1,like i said before it 's a little dated and the fact is that it is a film that does n't
1,of course it is a film of the highest caliber of a movie
1,things like that are all there but it is hard to find a better way to waste 90 minutes of your time than your time
1,worry about this movie it is a very good movie
1,the plot is a bit thin but the story is very good and the
1,s the movie is not as good as the first film and it is one
1,amanda alba and michael madsen are the only real reasons that i can watch
1,despite the fact that it had been made in the first place it is a very enjoyable film
1,malone is also a fine villain but is very convincing in the role
1,i am not a fan of the series but the film is very good and the performances by the leads are great
1,the movie is n't bad it does n't really have any of the same
1,kareena is also the only reason why i give this movie a 2 for
1,it 's all a bit too stupid
1,yes it is not like you 're in for a good time but i do n't think that this was a good
1,of course they were all pretty but the real star
1,one thing the other reviewer says it 's a movie
1,robert montgomery is a fine actor but it was his first to make a
1,not much of a movie and a
1,well it 's a movie that is very entertaining
1,in the case he is given a short time and the story is n't very good
1,the acting is good enough but the script and acting are all very weak
1,while the story has a bit of it 's very interesting elements it is still a great
1,if you 're a diehard fan of the original you 'll be surprised by this film
1,the movie also contains some of the best performances of
1,yes this is a very bad movie
1,i would recommend this movie to anyone who has n't seen it or a
1,as for the plot it is very interesting
1,movie is a movie with a capital d a trois and a great cast
1,thomas is n't a bad guy but he 's still a good guy
1,this is n't a movie to be
1,this is what makes it stand out and i have a
1,nothing is explained and the film takes its cues
1,stella stevens 's performance in this movie is as always brilliant in the
1,at the end of the movie the audience is left to ponder about the situation or the ending
1,michael madsen is the only reason to watch this
1,acting is the worst i 've ever seen
1,it is a great movie for a lot of
1,enterprise is a movie i would watch for anyone interested in the genre of the time
1,after the first hour or so of the film the viewer is left thinking what happened to the characters but the story
1,the film is a little too much to ask for
1,there is no reason to see this film it 's the most annoying movie
1,selleck is a wonderful actor and is also a very versatile actor
1,i do n't think that a movie is going to get better
1,this is a film about a young boy who is a
1,i have a hard time believing the filmmakers of this movie
1,to me that 's how the plot is handled and i think it was n't that good
1,the story is a bit thin but the ending is very good
1,he is a master of the craft
1,the only problem with me is that i could n't take my eyes off and
1,we see it and the fact that there 's something that is n't done to a whole
1,most of all in a series that was not a good one
1,if you want to see a really good movie and you have seen this one in a long time you will love it
1,i would like to see the first movie again
1,while it does seem to be a little bit slow moving and it is n't a great movie it does not seem to be the same as it did in the original film
1,or perhaps it 's the fact that it 's not a comedy
1,jk has a good sense of humor
1,it 's all very easy to watch because it 's so hard to find something good to make it a great film
1,this is a good movie but i
1,power of war is a great movie
1,i have seen a lot of bad acting in my life
1,and that does n't mean they do n't
1,it is not only that he is a great actor but he also is a great actor
1,this movie is not about the evils
1,cooked in the form of a great director of photography and film
1,additionally it was a great movie and was a good
1,any movie that can be called a movie
1,however i was surprised to find that the film was
1,in this episode they 're the ones who
1,unfortunately this is a bad movie
1,to be fair the acting was not the least bit believable
1,i think that this show really is n't that bad
1,this film is a very interesting film
1,it has a few good moments and a decent plot line
1,she is not the best actress she 's been
1,this show was a great example of why
1,you will probably get the impression that they were n't all
1,last night i watched this movie and was impressed by how many people who liked that i
1,but this movie is n't a great movie
1,unfortunate that the movie is n't as good as this one
1,being a teenager myself i was looking forward to this film as well and have n't even seen any of the
1,it 's a shame that this was released theatrically on dvd because of the quality of
1,now i'm not a fan of the genre but it does n't make sense because they
1,brad renfro has a small role in this
1,one is the one in the bar with the two
1,it is also a very funny film in my opinion as well as the first one
1,by the end of the movie the movie has been a
1,and then there are other movies
1,this is one of my alltime favorites to see
1,in short it 's a great film
1,what 's so good about it
1,this is one of my favorite movies and i do n't know why i did n't get it but i
1,then the story of the film is
1,the movie is very funny at times
1,but if you can get past that i would advise you to get a hold of the plot for the
1,but this is a good movie
1,the film is also a very good movie
1,all in all a great show with a strong message
1,tracy is one of the greatest movies ever written and is one of those rare movies that
1,with a lot of sex and sex this movie has to be seen
1,typically this movie does not make any sense
1,the film is very entertaining and very interesting
1,i 've seen many of those movies in general that have n't been so good
1,and there were a lot of scenes which were pretty funny and it was the highlight that was so funny
1,song was a big hit in the early days of the movie
1,by the way the movie was filmed in color
1,after that he has a heart attack with the devil and he tries to
1,while this was n't a good movie i did n't have a problem with the plot and i found the story
1,1 star out of 10 i thought that this was one of
1,the plot was so ridiculous i wanted to see
1,the film is not a documentary about the life
1,vanessa redgrave is also great as a woman in the same role as the one in the movie but it 's the best performance of her career
1,stalin 's regime was not the first to make a film of it
1,i 've been trying to find out about the past but i was wrong
1,one can only hope that a lot of people
1,of course there is a lot more in this movie than the average movie that was in the first place
1,every single aspect of the film has a great atmosphere and the acting is superb in the lead role
1,the story is simple enough for you to care about
1,the movie is a bit over the top but
1,this is an absolutely horrible movie
1,i do n't think that this movie was ever released but
1,i would say this show is not the best movie i have ever had it doin'
1,extremely good for the time spent on that one
1,in this film he is the most likable person to ever grace a movie and is a very funny
1,but there is n't enough time to make such an awful movie
1,you 'll see a lot of these things and i guess
1,i am a fan of the original series
1,i think the movie is a good mix of comedy and comedy
1,but if it is a movie you can say you 've
1,some of the scenes are not really worth seeing
1,real life is not a bad movie
1,i was so disappointed that it was a waste of time and money
1,this time i am a bit of a fan of the original and the movie was pretty funny
1,i'm not sure who was the real star
1,sometimes you know the story of the movie and the
1,i would not have been a little surprised if the director and director did n't make
1,hitler is one of the best in the genre and is not only the best movie about the war and its conflict it 's also about
1,despite the fact that they do n't have a lot of talent they do n't make a movie that makes you care about them
1,it is an insult to those who are n't in the mood to
1,for those who do not like this film you will not find it to be a
1,on the other hand if they do n't make a big budget production they do n't have a lot of money spent on this one
1,perhaps i was wrong but this was n't the worst
1,i have no idea what to say about this movie
1,let 's face it a movie like this is not funny or interesting
1,max von sydow is the most underrated
1,i was surprised how this movie would
1,this is the worst movie ever
1,despite the shortcomings i would have liked to see more from the
1,is it a matter of time before the end result
1,i was very disappointed in this movie
1,this movie is about the power of life which makes the viewer feel that the movie is n't going to be a good film
1,most of the movie is about the women in the woods and it 's not
1,i would say the movie was so bad that even the stupidest film could ever be made
1,however if there were any shortcomings in the movie then this movie might have worked
1,the acting is so awful it made me cringe
1,she 's a real treat and it was n't easy
1,she does n't seem to know that she 's a werewolf so she decides to go out on
1,so what 's wrong with that
1,all in all the film was an excellent and entertaining experience to watch
1,this is a really good family film
1,well it was not as bad as i thought
1,some of the scenes in the film are particularly disturbing and the final sequence is very satisfying but not enough to keep you interested
1,the movie does n't really make sense to me and
1,i saw the first episode and it 's still very funny
1,yes the film has some very good
1,it 's a shame because the film was so bad that it would have helped
1,the film is not a comedy but it 's very good
1,i 've seen the original version
1,he also has a great body and a voice and a good voice
1,the acting in this movie is very good although it has a lot
1,she 's not a good person and a girl who is n't a bad actress
1,their relationship is the best thing in this otherwise bad film
1,but the film itself is quite good
1,i have n't read the book nor have i mentioned it
1,stalker a movie about a boy and his son 's struggle and their relationship and how he
1,to make matters worse the story is just awful and the movie does n't make a whole lot of
1,it 's not that the film is so bad it 's
1,as a longtime fan of horror film the filmmakers have a unique fondness for exploring them in
1,and i think that the movie is n't a great movie
1,i'm surprised that this film is made by someone who can make a film that has been done to death
1,the acting was pretty good but i think that 's where
1,this is the worst film i have ever seen
1,now that 's why it 's a great movie
1,we see the same old man with the same name as we are used to and the
1,damn you do n't really have the time to do the dishes
1,this is a very interesting and very moving film
1,i have never been there to read a book that has the exact same plot as the book
1,the movie has its ups and downs
1,i 've been trying to figure out what was
1,this is not a good movie
1,they are n't really all that bad
1,even with a lot of action and a few exceptions the film never stops
1,this movie is a complete waste of time
1,imagine this movie is like the most recent and
1,directed by michael j fox and directed by george romero this is one of those movies where it seems to be trying to be a parody of the original and its very original in
1,i was surprised at how bad it was
1,this is a movie for the most part
1,none of the characters in the movie are likable and are not even worth mentioning in the film
1,although the acting in this film is very poor it 's a shame that they did n't have to be more
1,as it is i do n't think that 's it
1,spoiler alert the movie is just a mess and the story is about the worst thing in the history of a horror movie
1,after all the movie had a lot more to offer
1,you could n't even make it a bad movie if you
1,eight years later the young woman is the daughter of the family and the mother
1,so it goes on and on and on and on about how it was in the first place
1,we 're all that we do n't see
1,eventually it is not a very bad film
1,and the ending is very well done
1,stop at the end of one of the most exciting scenes ever
1,james bond plays his usual role as a reporter who finds himself trapped on a deserted island with his girlfriend
1,the only thing the other reviewers have mentioned
1,this is a movie for a long time
1,it 's a pity that it has been so much more than that
1,at times this movie was so bad it 's hard to make an impression about how
1,the film is a good one with a great cast that is very funny
1,this film is a must see
1,the only redeeming factor of this film is the music
1,he 's in the movie but it was so funny and i could not stop laughing at the jokes in
1,what was the point of this
1,i would say that this is a great film but if
1,perhaps the film was shot in a time warp and in the end the story would have
1,i was surprised that he was able to get away from the movie but the film 's only redeeming qualities were the acting and editing
1,another example of this is that the characters are the same
1,the only good thing i can say about this is that the movie was so bad it
1,dull and boring it 's just a cheap movie
1,from there we have an extremely dull and uninteresting movie about the mafia
1,on top of that it is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,as far as i am concerned it 's a good movie but it does n't have
1,warning spoilers spoilers the movie does boast a few good points but it 's not
1,this movie is one that should be viewed with a friend who has been
1,times and time again and again in my own life the film
1,22 minutes of footage with an old man 's character in the background
1,i think that the movie is so bad
1,a great movie for fans of the great
1,by now the story of the movie was a little too long
1,memories of the book were not explained at all
1,the acting was good the plot was good but the acting was terrible
1,i was surprised at how bad it was and how i could not get into the movie as soon as it started
1,dracula is a very good character driven by a young actor who makes one likable character
1,bridget austen is also the only character that has a personality to her role and it was
1,though i do n't think it is a good film i did not feel the need
1,the movie starts out with some very interesting and interesting characters
1,bugs bunny 's character is a stereotype
1,the movie also suffers from a plot that is n't interesting or engaging enough to warrant the audience
1,what 's with the character development
1,no wonder they could n't afford to be in the first place
1,there are some really good scenes and they 're just plain hilarious
1,i 've read this book on the internet and have read the user
1,that is what this movie is a tribute to the
1,seriously i was expecting a lot more from the movie the cast and the script
1,i'm surprised that the writers have not given the audience a full 10 to make
1,i 've been looking for it since it was made in the late 60s and the film does a lot for me and i
1,she is a very good actor and a really good actress she is great in the title role
1,there 's also one thing that i liked in the movie
1,a few minutes later the story is not about a single girl who gets involved with her
1,lauren holly was the highlight and i was impressed with her
1,sure this movie is not that bad but it was so terrible
1,i would like to see the film to see it
1,when i was young i was very disappointed
1,generally i thought it looked good enough so i thought the film was a bit too much
1,the film does have its moments
1,the movie was made by the esteemed director of the wizard of oz starring peter cushing as the
1,he also is a good actor and
1,if this is the only thing they do n't do
1,eventually the movie is full of surprises and i really wanted to love it
1,but the movie is about the only thing worth watching
1,the movie 's biggest flaw is that the film was not a musical
1,the film is a real gem of a film but it does not
1,canadian cinema director roger corman has made a good cult film and this movie was n't the only one i 've
1,i saw it on the big screen in theaters and was blown away
1,and the film is also a very interesting one and a must see
1,teenage boys are supposed to be funny and that 's just the tip
1,the story of a woman who gets involved in a
1,the film is a bit of a bore but in a good way
1,once a woman has a secret admirer of him and the girl she
1,both the film is very funny and i think that it was a
1,hell i am a big fan of this
1,the film has been a success for all times
1,apparently it 's just too long and boring and the ending feels like a rushed soap opera and not a real movie but an insult to all
1,i do n't know why but this is a great movie
1,bobby is not the only one to be able to make a
1,it is a very interesting and entertaining thriller
1,story is about a girl who gets pregnant and then she is kidnapped by
1,i am still in my seat to it
1,william wyler 's direction of the film makes
1,for those of us who have n't seen it i recommend you for a few bucks
1,suddenly the movie is about as much a problem as the movie itself is
1,a film that was made for television and a few days ago the film was released in
1,she 's also not the only person who has a crush on her
1,for those of you that do n't like the book i would advise you to do this
1,the movie is a very bad and very amateurish attempt by a director to make a good movie
1,but i was surprised to find that
1,the film 's main drawback is that the film is not so much as a comedy that is so dull and so utterly pointless that it
1,throughout the movie it was obvious that the film was shot in the woods
1,this film is the best of the two films
1,perry is a fine actor and he is a very talented actor
1,in fact the movie was just plain boring
1,there are many movies out there that have a certain plot line to go with them
1,spend all of your money watching this film
1,it was a very funny movie that is n't afraid for me to see
1,it seems that the filmmakers decided that they were trying too hard to make it to be
1,well i do n't want to ruin the movie for anyone who is
1,but it is n't so bad it 's good it 's just too bad that you
1,this is a film that should have
1,certain scenes of the first part are the most interesting in the film
1,james garner is a very talented actor
1,although the film has a bit more to say than the usual suspects in this movie the
1,then i saw a bunch of people talking about how to do this and i really wanted
1,the film 's climax and the ending of the movie
1,do n't waste your time with this one
1,the script is a mess of a movie
1,this film is a very funny movie about the hardships of
1,i would n't say that if they were making movies i would
1,gosh that 's all there is to it
1,his character is supposed to be the villain 's sister the son 's father and the son
1,most of it 's just the same thing as the first time round
1,the film is n't really a masterpiece it 's very boring but
1,as a whole this is the most disturbing and disgusting movie ever
1,the acting in this movie is excellent
1,ten the acting was awful but the plot is n't bad
1,i have never seen such a great film
1,i do n't remember any of the other characters
1,warner brothers are n't as good
1,the story is about two men who have
1,during a few years of the film 's success the film still manages to keep us entertained by the fact that the viewer never left any of the actors in
1,it 's a pity it was made in the uk
1,besides that it was n't even a good movie
1,if you want to watch a fun film that does n't seem to be a masterpiece
1,it seems like a lot of the actors and
1,do n't expect the usual formula of the
1,much better than most bmovies i 've ever seen i think this one is not one of my favorite
1,while he does n't have the guts to pull a movie off the ground the movie has a good story line and some great
1,may contain spoilers but if you are a fan of
1,another thing that 's so bad is that it 's so
1,dave and his wife have been murdered in the middle of their remote rv
1,anyway i was a little puzzled by the time the film ended
1,and what does it say is that the movie
1,i have never seen so much of a movie and i do
1,in a way i think the movie is worth watching if
1,even the most basic movie has an interesting plot line and a good plot
1,he does n't have a lot of time to do the best in his life
1,the acting is n't very good either
1,another reason why they did n't make the mistake of watching this film was that
1,for all those that like this one and you 're not a bad fan of a great movie like this one you wo
1,he 's in it and he 's trying to kill
1,but i think that this movie is
1,there 's not one redeeming quality to this film it is a very good film
1,the film was shot at a time
1,so the movie is not only the worst acting job ever
1,i was so excited that i was n't
1,the film has a very very good cast
1,the story is pretty simple and the characters are all very likable
1,during the course of the movie i did have a sense of humor for the characters
1,i saw the movie on the video store and it sounded great
1,there are some very good scenes in this movie
1,other than a little too long
1,the film also features an excellent cast and director
1,characters are very believable and the story is very interesting
1,in a movie like this i was very excited about how much i enjoyed it
1,quite honestly this was the first time we were treated
1,the acting was so good you 'd be embarrassed to hear the name of john doe
1,it is the kind of movie that is so good that you 'll be surprised at how bad this is
1,there is a little bit to be expected to be a part of
1,carol danes is the best thing about this
1,i'm a big fan of his work but this is one of his most awful
1,the film is a complete mess
1,however the film never loses interest in the story of the characters
1,except to the very end we have all the main players who are n't going to go out with
1,but it was n't so bad it was good enough to give it
1,but then he is the only one who has a sense
1,it also is a great family movie that is n't just about them or the other way
1,i do n't think the film was meant for me
1,this movie is a must see for all
1,that makes this show more fun to watch
1,background music is a great match for a movie that is a perfect blend of comedy and drama
1,while i did n't like this movie at least i thought the acting and the direction was very good
1,the movie is also a good film
1,bogarde 's acting as a character actor is so poor that the audience is constantly rooting for him as he
1,this is the most powerful film of all time
1,because the movie is n't as bad as the first movie the acting is pretty bad
1,i saw this at the sundance international film festival and i was shocked
1,you will have a very fun time
1,it 's like watching a train wreck
1,that was the first of its kind
1,i was very excited about this film
1,finally i have n't watched the original so i wo n't give it away but it 's a
1,who 's to say the movie is n't about
1,grade c c r r r o g r r kane vs c f f f f please please please please please please please please please
1,the story is a joke to me and the actors who plays the main character are very
1,there are also some interesting moments of the film
1,i think that was enough to get me to see the film
1,cunningham 's character is not the same
1,bad acting bad plot terrible music bad music
1,if you are a fan of bad movies you 'll find yourself rooting for the hero
1,we all had to have a few lines to get this out of the movie and make it a movie to get a lot of people to see
1,the only good part of this movie
1,suddenly the movie begins with an extended prologue with a young girl who has no interest in the plot
1,but if you want a good scare watch the film
1,i am not sure how this film could have been made and to the people in the theater
1,thora birch as the heroine and the woman in love with him are not
1,it is very sad that the director of this movie did n't
1,a young boy who 's got an eye of her own in a mental institution with a very young boy
1,the script by robert deniro has a few
1,ones like the other posters seem to have been trying to find out what
1,yet it is a very entertaining movie
1,maybe it 's the fact that they do n't know how to make
1,i was surprised that this movie got a wide berth on the critics but i guess it does suck
1,and the ending is very satisfying
1,even with a few twists that i did not enjoy and i was bored as it
1,and i do n't think that the film does n't have much of a
1,even if they had to do it it did n't make it out for anyone to laugh
1,ever there is an issue that the movie makers have to deal with in the first half or a second act
1,the movie is a bit slow moving but it does n't matter
1,schreiber is in fact a good guy but he is just as bad
1,benjamin lewis is the perfect actor for the role of the movie 's title character
1,this show was so awful that it made you laugh and cry
1,the film is very well acted and
1,my only criticism about the film was that the film never really went into the theaters
1,although i did n't expect it to be a good action film it certainly is not worth seeing
1,it 's not that the story is n't a total mess
1,definitely worth a look but not for everyone
1,of course this is not a bad movie
1,film is a film about a woman who has to live a life of life and her own life to get her way
1,unfortunately i have n't seen this film
1,studs are not the most important of any character in the movie but the director 's
1,watch it for the characters and the story
1,i am not saying it because it was so bad
1,that 's not a bad thing
1,the movie is just about a guy who gets a job at a local morgue where he can be
1,i saw this movie at the 2005 sundance film festival
1,its very difficult to suspend my disbelief but
1,i was really surprised by the movie as it was n't as good as
1,the only redeeming thing about it is that it 's not a total waste of time
1,one of the few movies that i can see that
1,have they been brainwashed by a group of people who are a
1,it 's the best movie i have ever seen
1,it 's not that i think it 's a little bit of a
1,but that would make a better film
1,and then there are the actors who
1,the movie does a lot of things with no plot development no plot no acting and the story is n't even remotely entertaining
1,he 's a very good actress
1,pretty good but it is not the worst film ever
1,rarely do i feel that there are so many ways to enjoy this movie
1,ultimately this is one of the worst tv show ever made
1,this is one of the funniest horror movies i have seen in my
1,the movie was shot in the style of the film but the film is just a cheap piece of crap with lots of
1,it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to
1,the movie has a very good cast and is very well done
1,now that 's what i got from this movie
1,jeff bridges is the perfect villain and his character has a great chemistry that is very
1,tudor day and day have passed the test of time
1,it 's a good movie with excellent acting
1,what we got was a hodgepodge of old
1,yet there are some interesting moments of humor and it 's
1,only the two lovers seem to have a good sense of humor and are so out of
1,i think the best way to describe this movie is
1,he is a fine actor who has no charisma at all and does
1,you know it 's a bad movie but you can actually see it coming and it is n't bad enough
1,somebody is a fan of the series and the movie is a very good one
1,i 've seen the film twice before and after i
1,this is the story of a young woman who is attracted to an adult woman
1,from the opening shots of the movie i thought the film would have been a hit
1,there is a lot of action but that is n't the
1,again if you like the idea of the movie then this is not the
1,if you 're interested at the end of the film the only thing to come is the overuse of a camera lens
1,to the point of a very short time in the
1,i have a feeling that the film makers had made some changes on this project
1,the movie is a bit slow but that is what it was
1,one of the few movies i have seen in my entire life
1,with a little imagination thrown together the film is a complete waste
1,at times i thought this was the greatest movie of all time
1,but the movie itself is pretty much a carbon copy and it is very well done
1,i think that if a movie was shot in the future i would n't have to give this a 1 but this is the worst movie i have seen in a long time
1,the film 's premise is not that great
1,two of the men have a different personality and they 're all so much more than just a bunch of men that is a bit of their lives
1,keira knightley is excellent as always
1,wow this movie has some great acting great special effects and a good
1,the acting was pretty bad but it 's the acting that makes this work a must see
1,if you like to see a good horror movie then try to watch this movie you should n't bother
1,his performance is so overthetop it 's almost
1,first of all let 's see the film
1,when they get together they 're all together
1,the film is not a documentary about the lives of two people of the time and their interactions to survive
1,the film has the feel that the director has written for the camera and
1,anyways the movie is n't a good movie but a few good
1,he 's got a good sense that the movie has n't been done much but
1,good performances and great acting from this one
1,the movie was a little too long to make the film
1,i think the film is very good
1,these are the things he 's not in a
1,i was surprised by the fact that the film
1,i think it is a very good show for everyone who enjoys it
1,first off the film is not as bad as
1,if that 's a real movie then i guess i 'll never know what is the
1,pretty soon the story develops as if the characters are n't developed by the main actors
1,if it was n't for the poor acting and directing that was the case with
1,we get the point of view of a man who is the one who has been
1,i do n't know where to start
1,the acting is pretty poor with a bunch of unknowns
1,maybe that 's why i was n't expecting to hear something about it but i did n't want to
1,i would not want to give up the plot for what i think
1,only this time around the film is about a girl who has sex with a
1,i have never had a more fulfilling time than me
1,the plot is very good but it is n't
1,i was expecting the film to be a bit slow but it was not
1,ram gopal varma is a genius
1,this movie is a very enjoyable movie that is worth checking out
1,but the film is not a complete waste of time
1,some of the scenes of the film are quite good as are the performances but it is also a bit
1,but there is not enough evidence for the viewer to believe that it 's a comedy it 's supposed to be about a woman who has
1,what a shame that this is n't the most original and interesting
1,meeting the young woman who was murdered by the ghost of
1,oh and the last mimzy in the series is the best and funniest scene in the whole film
1,this is a great family movie for the younger generation of the adult who likes to laugh and cry
1,all in all i 'd recommend this
1,the film is not for everyone
1,id like it but i think there are some good ones about this film
1,everyone 's favorite of the four is so much fun
1,hope lange is the only reason she has
1,but i do n't think that is the case with
1,with the help of a young woman who is the daughter of a young man named lena the story of a mother and son is not a good idea
1,the story is about a young woman who is attracted to a younger woman in her younger brother 's life
1,the first thing is that the first film had a
1,i have to wonder if they would be so proud of themselves
1,then again i would have to say that i did like this film so much
1,replayable i have to say though
1,love is one of the best movies to come out of this genre i have ever
1,having been a fan of this i was very surprised
1,the movie 's story line revolves around a bunch
1,i was surprised to find out that this movie was an accident in the box office
1,rene russo is a revelation of mine
1,nevertheless the film is not a very good and entertaining movie
1,before i begin watching this movie i'm sure you 'll get a lot of laughs in the end
1,the movie 's only flaw is it 's not really a film that is the only redeeming feature in all of the movies that it
1,loy 's character is a bit of an actress but
1,apparently the story and characters were very well developed and the story kept me guessing as to why the characters
1,for all this movie it was a complete waste of my time
1,sometimes i have not heard of this movie but it 's still a fun little movie to watch
1,each episode is one of the funniest of the season
1,the film is about four hours of torture and the first 15 minutes of the movie which is about as much
1,first of all the film has the most annoying dialogue i have
1,i have a copy of this movie as well as a lot of movies
1,he 's a real cowboy actor and a real treat to watch
1,the film is a bit boring but it 's also very good to view the story is very simple and very moving
1,you will see that this is a very very bad remake of that 's why i bought the dvd for the dvd i thought that it was pretty cool and had a good story to go along with
1,i do n't see why anyone would want him to be so bad in this
1,her performance is the same but the rest is so horrible that i have to
1,steve martin was a genius and it is the funniest of the three shorts
1,quirky but ultimately a very good film with lots of
1,eventually i got the distinct impression that the filmmakers would not be a great filmmaker to get the audience out
1,steve zahn is a fine actor but he does n't
1,i was expecting this movie to be a good idea to get to the end but
1,in one case he says the f word but the only real problem was he 's a jerk who 's
1,the film is about two young women from a different culture
1,david niven as a cop who has no idea what is happening in the middle east
1,it 's a shame that the only one who can do is the film for a long time
1,when i was young and old i was just a bit more disturbed than that
1,i would have given it 9 out of 10 if there was a 0
1,the story itself is a bit confusing and predictable as the story progresses
1,it is not a movie to watch
1,and if you 're looking for a great
1,i would have been proud to have seen the movie
1,ca n't help but wonder if he 's going to
1,pilot and the beast are a lot better
1,it 's also quite interesting to have to see it
1,so why do n't you watch it
1,make no mistake that 's all there is to life
1,hushed in a way that is the best of the two shows of the past and present of the past
1,i do n't think this movie was meant to have been
1,wallace akbar is a wonderful character and he is a
1,even the most ardent of fans would probably be able to overlook this
1,god is the best man alive in the movie
1,she was also in the movie at all times
1,airwolf is a movie about the struggle between the
1,the only reason to watch this was that the acting was so good that you could almost feel the pain that it took from the characters
1,actually the movie has a very nice feel
1,so much to you the film has a lot to do
1,well that 's what makes it a good
1,phyllis 's performance is very good
1,again i think i 'll be watching this for a
1,a few scenes of the story are a little slow but it is a
1,in the beginning the story is n't that bad but the acting is n't
1,although the acting is good the story was weak the script is bad the dialog is bad and the plot is a bit thin
1,so it 's not as bad as it sounds
1,they should have been more and bigger and this had to be a little too good
1,having read the book on the imdb i read the book
