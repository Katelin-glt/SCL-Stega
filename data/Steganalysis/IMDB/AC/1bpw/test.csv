0,the soundtrack itself is what made me
0,dante also does a good job directing about how i managed to see anakin bakula in this film harriet 's life at times so bad that

1,how can you go wrong with this movie
1,the film is a bit slow but it 's a great film
1,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,first of all the acting is horrible
1,i'm not a big fan of the genre but this
1,william wyler 's direction is a little too high for this type of film
1,from the beginning of the movie the movie is a complete mess
1,another problem with the film is that it 's not even a good film
1,morris 's character is a bit of a jerk but he is a good actor
1,this is a very good movie
1,i'm not sure why i did n't see this
1,or maybe it 's just the fact that the movie was shot in a very tight
1,alongside the first film the film is a complete mess
1,if you want to see a good movie about the evils of war this movie will probably disappoint you

1,i was n't expecting a movie to be so bad
1,i was surprised to see this film in a
1,the movie is a bit of a bore
1,consequently the film has a lot of problems with the plot and the acting
1,perhaps it 's a bit too long but it 's a good film

1,some of the scenes are just plain stupid and i do n't think that the director intended to
1,erika eleniak plays the mother who is a little more than she bargained for
1,but it 's a great movie

1,indeed the movie is a bit slow but the acting is superb
1,i have to say that i was n't impressed by the movie
1,just like the other reviewer i 've read that this
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and money
1,i was n't expecting a movie to be a good movie
1,the movie was a bit of a mess but it was n't
1,it is a very good movie
1,about a year ago he was born in a small town in new jersey
1,i have seen this movie several times and it 's still very funny
1,the film is a complete waste of time
1,just as a movie it 's a good movie to watch
1,additionally it 's a very good movie
1,it 's not even the best of the genre
1,through the whole film i felt that i was going to be disappointed
1,it is a very good film
1,i was n't expecting a lot of this movie
1,it 's not even the worst movie i 've seen in my life
1,this is a movie that i can watch over and over again
1,before i wrap it up i 'd like to say that i was a little disappointed with the film
1,none of the characters are believable and the story is
1,the movie was a bit slow but i was surprised to find that it was a very poor movie
1,even the actors are not the best
1,he is the only person who can be identified with the man who is
1,my advice is to avoid this movie
1,you can see that the director was trying to make a movie that was so bad that
1,this is a very good movie
1,still it 's a good movie
1,i have seen this movie several times
1,all in all a very enjoyable movie
1,this is a very good movie
1,in the end the movie is a complete mess
1,a few years ago i saw this movie on tv
1,the movie was a waste of time and money
1,then the movie starts to drag
1,unlike the first movie this one is not a good one
1,one thing that i did n't like was the fact that it was made in a very cheap manner
1,a lot of the film is shot in the middle of nowhere and the camera pans around
1,i was n't expecting a lot of this film
1,i have to say that i have n't seen this movie in
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,lead by the director of the film is the director of the film
1,from the opening sequence to the last minute of the movie the viewer feels like a little bit of a
1,i have to admit that the film was a bit too slow for me
1,it 's a shame that this movie is n't available on dvd
1,unfortunately the movie is not a good
1,hayworth 's character is a little more than a typical hollywood heroine
1,i was surprised that this movie was made
1,i have to say that i was n't impressed by this film
1,the movie is about the same thing as the first one
1,that 's the only reason i gave it a 2
1,and it 's not a good movie
1,you can see that this is a very low budget movie
1,spoofing the movie is the story that is a little too much for me
1,while the film is not a complete waste of time it 's a very good film
1,so i was n't expecting much
1,instead of being a bit of a mess it 's a very good movie
1,if you want a good movie with a good story line good acting and a good story this is the movie for you
1,when i saw this film i thought it would be a
1,you know that the movie is a spoof of the first film and the second one was pretty good
1,after the first half of this film the viewer is left wondering what the hell is
1,starring the great edna the cutest actress ever
1,this is a movie that i would recommend to anyone who likes a good
1,it 's not even a movie
1,with the help of a young man who is in a wheelchair and a woman 's body and a woman 's face and a woman
1,i was surprised to find that this movie was made in the early 1980s
1,in the first film the characters are all very likable and believable
1,not only is it not a good film it is not a bad movie
1,first off i have to say i was
1,a lot of people have commented on this movie
1,but the film is a little too long
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,this is a movie that is n't afraid to be funny
1,it is not a movie that you
1,the movie was a bit slow but i did n't expect
1,the film is about a young man
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and money
1,lot of the movie is about a young woman who is a woman and her
1,guess what it is about the fact
1,why did n't he just kill the
1,you can tell that the film is a spoof of the original film
1,yes the film is n't as bad as the first but it is n't
1,frankly the movie is not as bad as the first
1,the movie was a waste of time and money
1,so i was expecting something more like a movie
1,i have seen this movie twice and i still remember the first time i saw
1,another thing that i did n't like was the fact that it 's not a movie
1,like the first film the characters are very good and it 's a shame that they did n't have to be a bit more believable
1,well i do n't know why i do n't think this is the worst film ever made
1,i was n't expecting a movie to be a good movie
1,the movie is about a young woman
1,i have to admit i was n't disappointed
1,getting a few laughs out of it
1,this is a very good film
1,if you 're looking for a movie to watch and enjoy the first one
1,all in all this is a great movie
1,a few years ago the film was released in the uk and was released in
1,the movie is a bit of a bore
1,i have to admit i was n't disappointed
1,as for me i was n't impressed by the movie
1,well i guess it 's not a good movie
1,but the film is a little slow
1,they 're not the same as the ones who are in
1,15 minutes into the film i realized that the film was a complete waste of time and money
1,and the ending is a bit too long
1,there are a few moments that are funny and funny
1,add to that the fact that the film was made in the us and the director was trying to make a movie about the holocaust of the holocaust
1,the film is a bit slow and boring but
1,as for the rest of the cast i think they were
1,it 's not a bad movie
1,they 're not even close to the truth
1,the movie is about a young man
1,it 's not a bad film but it 's a good movie
1,the film is about the struggle between
1,if you 're a fan of the genre you 'll find this movie to be a complete waste of time
1,everyone is entitled to the same fate
1,honestly i would have liked to have seen more of the characters and
1,for a film that is a little bit of a mess it is a very enjoyable movie
1,but it 's a great film
1,the movie is about the same thing as the first movie
1,it 's a very good movie and
1,i have to admit that i was n't impressed with the film
1,thus the film is not a complete disaster but it
1,jcvd 's performance is a bit too wooden and too
1,while the film is not a complete waste of time and money it 's a very good film
1,and it 's not even that funny
1,the film is a bit slow but the story is so complex that it 's
1,when i saw the movie i was n't expecting much
1,unfortunately the movie is not a complete disaster
1,the movie is a bit slow and the story is too
1,i have to say that i was n't impressed by this movie
1,another thing that is good about this film is that the actors are all
1,i have to say i was very impressed with the movie
1,mandy lane is a great actress and
1,how can a movie be so bad

1,anne heche is a very talented actress
1,i'm not sure why i did n't see the film

1,however the film is a little too long
1,in the first movie the characters are all so stupid
1,of course the film is a bit too long
1,another problem is the lack of a good story line
1,well i guess it 's a good thing
1,this is a very good film
1,and the ending is a bit abrupt
1,alienation and death are the only ones who can identify with the fact that they
1,in the first movie he was a very good actor
1,however i do n't think that the film is a
1,i was n't expecting much from this movie but i was n't
1,he 's a great actor and a good actor
1,given the choice of the film 's production value it is a very good film
1,i have to say that i have seen a lot of bad movies but this one
1,how can you make a movie like that
1,it is a very good movie
1,every scene in this film is a complete joke

1,this is a movie that i would
1,the film is about a young woman who has a crush on a woman who has a daughter

1,the film is a complete mess
1,you can see the director 's intent on making a film that is so good that
1,it 's not a bad film but
1,soon the film begins to unravel and the story is told
1,so the movie is a bit of a mess but it 's not a good movie
1,while the film is not a masterpiece it is a very good movie
