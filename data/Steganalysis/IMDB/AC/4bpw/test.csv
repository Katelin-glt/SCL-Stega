0,the soundtrack itself is what made me
0,dante also does a good job directing about how i managed to see anakin bakula in this film harriet 's life at times so bad that

0,i would really like to see more of her work including superstar brooke armstrong who is quite cute to
1,although the movie was not about the war and that it was the subject of the film
1,some viewers may have the audacity to view it but i do n't like
1,need more money to make a better effort than making this one and you can take it for what it is a poor production values
1,the only way i can recall was that you were watching a tv documentary
1,many people seem to be in their right place for a little while and the director and writer should
1,yet it 's hard to believe it
1,even the soundtrack does n't look real like it
1,this one takes the cake for a little more than just a simple movie you ca n't really say anything good about it
1,stuff in the first 15 min the acting is just horrible
1,the story has little to do with the plot and the action is n't as good as the first
1,it 's a great deal of laughs
1,i 've seen the first two films and i have no interest
1,monroe gives a good performance as a
1,perhaps this is how the film makers will learn to
1,neil labute has created a great movie that is very well made
1,my advice is to watch this film again
1,then i watched this movie when i was 13 years old and
1,of course we 're not talking about how he is in the business but there is an immediate problem with his other
1,an insult to director robert altman
1,i thought oh well it was a big disappointment for me
1,he 's also very good on the show though
1,meeker has not the slightest bit of charm as the young man
1,i saw one of those movies when the first time i saw it at was so darned i was in love with the
1,in fact a movie like this should be made available
1,the first one was a bit confusing
1,the only redeeming qualities was the casting of the cast who were in this
1,slapdash movie about a killer and his wife who are cheating on their son but not a family
1,ive just begun a long way into this movie i was a little
1,kathryn is a very talented actress who should 've won a golden globe award as a
1,the story line is pretty good and the acting and
1,further the director of photography is the same as the main character
1,the plot was n't so great but it was still fairly entertaining
1,most of the acting is n't the greatest thing
1,combined with the other movies this is the most realistic movie to me
1,however the movie is quite good to have the director 's
1,make it a good horror film but not
1,jessica alba is one of the best actors she has ever done
1,he is given a great deal of
1,oh and why could one have given him the benefit
1,it was great to see him being so cute on screen for an hour until the
1,do n't expect to see the sequel of this movie
1,you can really have a great family life
1,the film begins with the one where the three main characters meet in new york city in the fall of rio 's life
1,both are not bad and the worst is that the script never really explains
1,it 's not as bad as the first but not as good
1,he has the power to change and that 's not only the idea that he 's going to work
1,what i am sure is that if this was n't your own choice and not to be misled by this film you may be
1,this is just another film of a movie that is
1,two stars out of ten as a whole
1,only he can be a man at the expense of the story as
1,deciding the story of a group who are trapped in a big room where a bunch of friends are trapped with a group of young kids
1,i 've seen a lot of bad movies in my time and this one is a
1,nicholas cage as a cop is very good
1,as a matter of fact this film would not let me down
1,he did n't look at least like a
1,i do n't recall that the scene where the girl is holding my attention to the story is really bad because i do n't feel the film
1,neither the character or the story nor any other cast would have
1,did n't they really have the best part in
1,nick broomfield has done a lot of movies and the movies that are based on the same story is a very good
1,matt dillon is a fine actor and is
1,either the director or writer or producer was trying to make a statement on the action or at least they made
1,do not waste your time on this unless you like a good b western
1,the acting is good in the part
1,he has the best lines of all movies but is n't one of them that makes you
1,jenny is on a mission to get him
1,the film has all the potential of a high school musical
1,the movie begins slowly and when it hits the head with a few twists
1,anyway this is one of the best i 've ever seen
1,coarse is just one of the best examples of a classic
1,give me a break but you must take me to the same
1,his acting is very solid especially as he does not have a very bad accent
1,the acting is good and the characters in the film did
1,they should n't have even the right name
1,the story itself is a mixture of action and horror but fails
1,this film is not a bad film and in all
1,the acting was very good but the plot
1,only if you are looking for a movie
1,james cagney is great as the cop
1,need to be seen a couple of
1,at the end we are left with one of the most disturbing moments ever filmed in a movie
1,i do n't believe so much to the plot but i was n't expecting anything that was possible
1,and it 's a shame that a
1,this film is very much the best animated movie in the last
1,its not a good movie to start with it should be the fact that this is
1,it 's not even that bad to me that i was the only one who knew what to believe
1,the plot is basically a vehicle for the plot that it 's a good thing
1,here we get a good movie about a group of people and the evils of people who are n't necessarily the one that they have to be the ones they have all the time the world of people and they have to survive that they will
1,it has the same basic ingredients as any other disney 's
1,not a very bad film either
1,the acting could 've been better if the main character had a more convincing story line the film
1,being a teenager she 's been on a lot of people in this movie so i think that her father is a real life but the people who are involved is also very happy to get married
1,you 've gotta say i was a little surprised
1,you have to be kidding to see the film
1,and that 's why this movie is a bit long
1,hardly a good film for the last
1,the film is also very funny and does n't really try to hide it from the rest
1,she plays the love interest for a
1,david morse as usual is a hoot as is the film but it 's not
1,with the exception of the first movie the acting is a bit bland but that 's okay considering the plot and the way in which
1,i'm just glad that i have n't seen this movie for so long it 's not only a waste of time
1,the film is very entertaining and i thought it was quite funny
1,and i 'll just stop there
1,it has a nice mix of humor and a
1,crap like the texas chainsaw massacre
1,everybody gets to know the story and that in
1,it is not for everyone but if you 're looking for a good laugh or even
1,honestly this is a very funny movie
1,it seems as if a couple of friends have been working
1,thus it is just a little bit of
1,and then he goes to bed
1,the film is not long but not in a good way
1,i had a hard time figuring
1,he is also a good guy and it is n't the case
1,it 's hard enough to believe this was a madefortv movie
1,maybe the writers of this movie will probably want to make their own conclusions on
1,oh yeah and it was just a kid and mouse
1,i did like it but i was really wrong
1,they 're going through the motions but
1,the film is just plain boring
1,you are in for a treat
1,i would like to see one of the great ones
1,aamir khan is perfect as the young man
1,entertainment value is n't going to go anywhere
1,trials are all in order to bring life to the part and will keep the
1,this is n't the best movie you know it 's bad but it is n't even good
1,i have to agree with many of the comments on here saying here 's the worst movie i
1,instead we get a movie called the dead end with a lot of
1,we are talking about the movie about the meaning of a relationship between men and women
1,wow what a waste of time to show a few good things to do as the best of the screwball comedies are
1,do n't get me wrong i still loved this
1,the director 's vision is a bit too long
1,it 's like it was shot on that train and was shot in a room with an explosion but it is n't really that much
1,to me this movie is not that bad
1,i 've only seen worse yet
1,the story and acting of the young girl are very nice
1,their chemistry between the three leads is
1,these are all movies that have been done to try to make something unique and
1,really what i thought was the worst movie of the year was the
1,jennifer connelly also has the thankless role she could play so well
1,she is a real good person
1,the film starts off ok but not as a slasher film or a horror film
1,the script is quite well written and the actors are pretty good
1,i love this movie and i love it
1,it is very funny and i do n't mean that a film where a young woman would act as
1,that 's a very strange idea but
1,i think it would be a great film for those who have seen the first film in general because
1,it could have been a classic
1,after having watched this film and watching it the trailer said it 's going to be a masterpiece
1,first of all i have to admit that i am very disappointed because i have
1,right there you are in the background
1,the film is not bad because it 's based on an actual story by william holden and the fact that it is not very clear to the book that they were going to get killed
1,national lampoon is the best of this series
1,for fans of the book and the world of the world this one is not for you
1,it is very difficult to find a copy of this movie but i can safely say it was not a total waste of time
1,in fact the movie is about one person 's sexuality and that of them both in and of themselves that 's the way
1,ca n't wait to see it again
1,but if i had the chance to see it in my lifetime i 'll take it in
1,the acting was awful the plot is awful and
1,guy who wants to kill his family was so good so he was n't
1,watching the show is a breath
1,on the whole they are more of a threat to the plot than the characters and characters
1,an example of the film the film is that it is the
1,no more of the plot is about two or four of the characters that make you think and do
1,a young man who lives in this country and meets a beautiful
1,his character was a great actor who
1,this is a very bad movie
1,okay i 've seen a lot less of the recent episodes and i can say that i was n't impressed by the fact that
1,this is definitely a movie for kids
1,i have always been a fan of horror movies but this is one that i do n't want to miss anything
1,the whole thing is just pointless
1,he is so bad he is the most likable character in this film and all the way through to the very end of the
1,dr watson has a cameo appearance as a father who 's in the business for an accident
1,the film opens with a very good and memorable moment
1,fangoria is just the beginning of a series of events
1,amiable enough the first time she sees her father on his face and then his mother who has the mental capacity
1,on the whole i would say that this movie is a must see for people who love bad movies
1,for instance the scene in the movie when the kids are sitting up with his dad says he is lying with someone with a
1,in my opinion is one of the best movies i 've ever seen
1,the movie is just plain boring with no plot
1,all you do is boast the feeling that
1,even the title character was a little more interesting
1,the characters are very real and real and the characters are very
1,my favorite character has the most endearing character of the show and a lot
1,nevertheless i do n't really like the
1,sondra bullock does have some fine lines and she 's still the best actress
1,director william h macy was responsible for the role of dr and the film for the film the viewer is treated in
1,if you want a great show with an interesting storyline watch this one
1,after a string of killings i had to turn up a copy with subtitles
1,after this film was n't over it all the movie 's opening
1,flavia 's life of her is to reclaim his life
1,lee mitchell is one of the most memorable actors in the movie industry
1,despite the fact that the film 's premise is very similar to the original i did n't think
1,one scene has two men dancing about an old man and a group of other people
1,indeed the film is not the worst movie i have ever seen
1,with a cast and crew it is impossible to see them perform a serious role
1,dont be a bad bad movie
1,i really ca n't even remember how the movie ended up being so
1,forgiving me for my next rental is the best and funniest episode of smallville
1,for the record there was a lot of action to the film
1,as if this is n't your normal football game
1,although this film certainly lacks the original elements of the first film it was quite well done
1,it 's a shame that there are a
1,felt this was a movie that was released in the
1,i had n't seen it in the years for a week
1,to be honest i found this movie to be a waste of time
1,this movie was a big disappointment as in a few
1,you 'll be wondering why you could see all these films and the
1,well i know it was n't a comedy but i do n't know what it was all about and the fact that i thought it was going to
1,easy to believe in it was that i had to see a more entertaining movie to watch
1,my suggestion was that it will be as bad for a lot of viewers as possible and for a while even
1,this movie was a good idea not an easy
1,from a technical standpoint this movie was really bad
1,but there 's a great deal of humor that is
1,for some reason i was very surprised when it showed the spartans
1,you could easily make something that is so funny
1,i could never sit through this piece of trash again
1,gerard depardieu plays the lead role
1,i saw this movie when it won the oscar and the award i was given to
1,the script is very well done and the movie is filled with the usual clich and the requisite sex scene
1,although the film 's plot is a little farfetched at times it is a very moving film
1,so much of a true story that the film makers did n't know how to make us care about them
1,she has no chemistry with the other
1,only one of the main characters is killed by the police and when a couple of policemen start harassing
1,take the scene where the boys are walking with the
1,ulysses gives a very good performance as the young boy who finds out that the
1,do n't be fooled by the end credits the film
1,and if you are looking for something funny
1,as a movie i really hope that this is not a film
1,he just ca n't be bothered by her acting as a teenager on
1,the story is very good and i
1,consequently in the end he is able to redeem a very good story which makes
1,valentine is a great movie and one that is a lot more impressive because you do n't need
1,they all did a great job and i did n't think
1,you know who the killer is
1,bo svenson is the ultimate reason to get involved with the character and you do n't care for them
1,fortunately the film lacks the depth and originality of a disney classic but it really does n't have
1,it had the same kind of atmosphere as the other movies
1,death is in fact a bit of a
1,the film is set in a new york city of la which is
1,there 's one character in the film who makes the movie more interesting than most other reviewers who will probably see that is
1,behind this movie it 's a nice little movie
1,my favourite moment is during the final scene in a park when the dam hits the
1,the film is a perfect snapshot of
1,all in all an entertaining and touching story
1,making a film about a man who loves his family
1,who would n't want to know the story
1,one of them is played by robert culp who had nothing
1,maybe i should not compare it to anything else and i 've got it
1,no plot no story line nothing original
1,it 's really sad and so many people say that
1,mothers were supposed to be the kids and the girls
1,as far as the movie goes i did think that i was watching this movie because i was looking for a good scary film
1,the characters are also annoying and annoying it 's a shame that such a thing is in the film the entire movie
1,i am amazed that this one has the wide range of it 's votes and reviews that are more misleading to me than to
1,so the film gets a bit slow and it never lets up because of the bad editing or the editing
1,while there 's plenty of blood there is nothing but inoffensive scenes and characters in the movie
1,she 's not going to take off with her character and then
1,why would n't we know that the director had
1,unlike all the rest of the story the characters are likable the actors are so good in it
1,some of the acting was good but it was n't bad for me
1,was it the good thing he did to him
1,like i said the only time i saw it is how it was n't
1,as it happens there is nothing really exciting about the script it 's all about the characters and the acting and plot
1,unfortunately the plot and the execution was horrible
1,5 the fact that he was a major character at the time of the movie is a
1,jimmy caan was just as good here as they were
1,this movie is about the best of people in india and they do not have to
1,i would have preferred to have seen a lot more of the same story but unfortunately the rest of the actors
1,this one is about a boy named caleb is kidnapped by a very brutal virus
1,sorry for the movie because you have a good cast
1,the movie is set in england
1,sort of movie and you get that you have the
1,it 's about the family dynamics that happen to them in the first world war
1,a very simple view in this world and what it is is a series of great characters and situations involving a man
1,to sum it up a movie about a woman who gets involved with an indian
1,if you 're in the mood for a film that does n't have enough plot lines then this film is
1,the story is not a complete copy
1,it was an excellent movie in its portrayal and it is
1,i 've read a few of the comments and the
1,the director is the perfect definition of the kind of person who 's
1,this is definitely not a film for anyone interested in his work
1,they were just as great as they could get
1,there was no real way at any of these films
1,courtesy of the original characters are all very well developed by the two main characters
1,his acting here is pretty good in many ways the movie was well worth watching
1,the film is an insult to all audiences but for this it was
1,but there are also moments where a bit
1,the movie is n't that great it really is the worst of the
1,hey that 's ok i can only describe the fact that this is the worst film ever
1,the director has a talent to be funny
1,the story begins with an old boy being killed and tortured in a car accident and tries to save it
1,it 's so bad it 's bad
1,while it 's a bit dated the scenes were so
1,he is not a total hero but a hero
1,as the movie opens it 's obvious that there is a twist
1,but it was so good that the film
1,by the time he 's in his office chair i think i am going to do a documentary about the
1,these people are just the ones who have the same experience
1,this film is the most boring piece of trash i have ever seen
1,just because he had not been in any way shape is a
1,whereas i can accept the fact that the film is shot in the head of it it is the best and it is a must see film for
1,some have commented on a lack of knowledge of the characters or plot
1,the only problem is that they have n't seen them before
1,unlike the other movies this movie was made for television
1,i do n't think they 'll ever let it loose and that the film 's target audience is n't
1,here was an excellent character study
1,this may well have been my favorite cartoon
1,my advice skip this and get a copy of a cheap dvd of the book
1,then he tells himself how he is supposed to be a little more of a hero
1,the plot is a bit complicated and the actors do not have any of the other characters
1,even though she was in the first film
1,hey the script is just awful i think the acting was good
1,it is n't really a very good picture
1,show that there was a chance at the beginning as an action movie
1,taken from the film and the movie itself to the extreme screen it is a true story of an obsessive mother
1,a good movie to have you
1,for anyone else who is a fan of asian horror movies who are n't familiar
1,her father and the son was not afraid to leave
1,but what i do think is that the two leads have a very
1,later when she 's being threatened by a
1,angelo has a good friend who wants us to believe he is a great actor
1,i do n't know how that is a good movie
1,i saw this movie when it first came out in 1979 it made me want to
1,i'm not sure what is the definition of the acting
1,the film has some interesting parts of the movie which may not have a lot to do with the book
1,mom 's dad is a very very good character who can act a little more but her son who was
1,no one can tell the truth of a story
1,they should have used them like we have a story about a father that
1,well the plot is pretty basic and the acting and dialog are just plain awful
1,and then the last twenty minutes that really did n't really fit my interest
1,we have the same old person who has to be seen so much with
1,he 's also very good but i ca n't believe that anyone would ever see him
1,cowriter steve martin has a small uncredited role as a reporter who is trying to save his life but he is n't going to win the championship of his own father
1,you get this idea of the film from the opening of events but
1,it 's about a killer who kills the people in the woods
1,then a lot of the film happens
1,this could have been done with a better budget
1,you can imagine that the movie is trying to
1,what 's most unusual about this movie is that it 's an extremely bad movie and i ca
1,this is an excellent film and if you have n't seen it yet go for it
1,but in my opinion it was a bit too long
1,then it 's all that 's so real
1,for a movie i can understand a lot
1,but it was a bit of a stretch to make a film about the lives of a bunch of teenagers
1,it was like a bad tv show
1,i am a fan of horror horror flicks
1,some of it 's humor but it is still very much a good
1,changing of the story and characters that make them
1,i do n't know whether or not he
1,richard pryor 's performance in this movie is excellent
1,that is my only complaint i had with it
1,the actors were pretty good as well
1,for me this was a great film and worth it for
1,susan sarandon is not great in her
1,oh i forgot of the last line i saw the trailer
1,just as good as the old godzilla movies
1,instead it is a bit too tame for a movie that is trying to be
1,on the one hand the movie is quite enjoyable
1,it seemed like a very poor attempt at watching it
1,that said the movie was a complete waste of time
1,i do not remember the name but i had no idea what the
1,yes he was pretty much a little older than the character
1,he was so popular in the role that made
1,soon afterward the story takes to develop as the viewer does the same with the same character who killed
1,this is one of the most moving films i have seen in a while
1,the plot is very predictable and it
1,rating 4 stars out of 5
1,moreover he does n't really know what to do with his character as he tries a new life he will try
1,and when they have to face it a little and make you think the director has a knack to show you he
1,the characters are likable and the story is just a series of clichs in the
1,the film is a true classic
1,i was so moved by the film that it was hard to follow a lot more of the original film
1,now the movie is about a very long time before i 've seen some of the original ones
1,they were trying desperately to create a
1,anyway this movie was n't funny
1,the movie is a great example of an indie
1,the film also features a group of teens named john and bobby
1,and the last half hour of it was really bad and it could have been a lot better
1,having said that i did n't get to see the original series on the contrary
1,the only problem is that they were too young and they were n't quite as funny
1,the plot is interesting and the director does a
1,first the plot is predictable and there 's a lot of pointless stuff like in that
1,for those who do n't know what he really thought that
1,the story is not really original but there seems to be some real problems with the story and the way the movie
1,how does it get this thing
1,other than that the film was pretty much bad
1,with the possible exception of this film 's title the title suggests that this film is worth a watch if you want to watch a
1,in the film it 's also a very interesting movie
1,for example it was just as bad as the worst movie ever made and i do n't think that even the good ones could possibly get a better job
1,i thought that there were a few moments which
1,in this case you see the actors playing the part of the film the only
1,for those of you that are not into this sort of thing there will still be no
1,if you were in the mood for some laughs on the part i 'd be
1,all you could think about was how much the
1,yul brynner looks suitably embarrassed and frustrated
1,and the rest of you do n't have any real sense of what 's going on
1,at least a couple of movies have some
1,some of the acting is good but they all just do n't
1,but the rest is a very disappointing film
1,it is the same director he did n't seem to
1,yet they had the same cast and they
1,the actors were also very good
1,the script is just a tad too thin too convoluted it 's not even that hard to figure out how to end it
1,ally mcbeal the best film of all time was n't even a big budget
1,however there is also very little in the way
1,let me give you an important review i can
1,given the limitations of the story and characters the characters all come to life in their respective stages and it is all the more poignant than that
1,i have never seen a show that has such a good and sometimes wellpaced plot line and all the other characters are the ones that i hate the one to enjoy
1,i do n't believe in a film this is not in any
1,the acting is not good the characters are n't really believable either
1,after the first five minutes i realized of the movie i was watching a documentary about the
1,why are you afraid of making such a movie
1,after the first scene and scene in which he finally gets to his car he has the same car going back with
1,most importantly the whole thing takes place during the time
1,join a man in the middle of nowhere with a gun on a
1,i 've just seen it and i really loved it
1,so the film is about the same thing
1,i was surprised at how much time went by and i could n't even
1,he is a pretty girl who 's a bit of
1,when all you get is a bunch of young kids who get together on their
1,this is a movie that should be burned by an old flame who is just as good as the movie 's lead
1,the ending was great i did n't even think that it was funny or original
1,i was not sure i would n't have enjoyed seeing this movie as
1,the story of how these kids were affected to survive as a result of the events
1,hey the music and the soundtrack is
1,yet for some reason i ca n't understand the appeal of
1,without a doubt the best in the business of the best of the year
1,mostly as they say things go downhill at the end
1,that was what i thought of it
1,i think the director was too lazy to write the book to his
1,i could n't wait to see how it was possible that they had some of his other shows
1,while watching the film and the subsequent meeting with the characters the film also gives an insight into
1,it is about a group of teenagers whose wife who
1,i think the only real asset being that she looks so young like she did
1,the main villain who played his daughter
1,enid 's son is a complete nonentity
1,i was shocked about the amount of money spent in showing such garbage
1,the film opens with an extended closeup of a girl dumping a party from the dead but is interrupted by a man who is unable to handle an
1,it 's about the power of a woman and she just seems to have a lot of issues to live out of
1,a good film for a rainy day
1,annie is not a good girl but that does n't mean that she 's not a true actress
1,when i first heard about this movie i was expecting a good movie
1,i 've read all the reviews about this movie and i thought it might have been a little over the top
1,scarecrow the animated animated adventure has a great cast the first is the last episode which i have to admit to it
1,but the film makes no sense and it takes a
1,rather than an original film and with the same plot contrivances one would assume some other viewers would 've enjoyed but the plot is
1,and if you ca n't watch a horror film like this one is not even a very funny movie
1,however i think the film is not as bad as this one
1,the story is just stupid stupid and a bit boring
1,i'm sure that the director was actually trying to portray
1,seagal and lane are terrific in their roles
1,silly plot lines and some nice scenery but not much else
1,to my opinion this movie is worth a 10 a
1,i am a huge fan of the original film
1,the acting is so awful i was n't even embarrassed to have a headache
1,also in the other side of the coin it is the fact that it 's a little over the top but still it 's quite fun
1,the acting by all means is terrible
1,i think the movie was a huge success to me
1,if you 're a fan of the first one you 'll notice that this show was a hit
1,oh and the other half of the plot is rather stupid
1,the ending is a bit abrupt and pointless
1,the movie is a great example of how good this film is
1,instead they are left alone alone
1,but in real life the movie fails to deliver as long time
1,stay in your mind you 've no choice
1,from the moment they are on a boat it was shot on a small island in a very fast space
1,the acting is good and the story is solid even the most seasoned of a lot more than a
1,a real treat for all involved
1,either way the film was just a poor excuse to showcase the
1,this movie was a very good thing
1,they are trying to take up some time or leave that for them
1,roman polanski is a great filmmaker and should have been left on a lot in the world of his own life
1,the story itself is a lot more exciting than the previous
1,beautifully done with a great cast excellent performances a couple of fine performances and a very interesting twist ending you are left wondering
1,frankly i found it hard to understand this movie
1,shop is a beautiful movie and i hope that i did n't
1,the only thing missing is that this movie is a complete waste of time
1,sure the acting was bad as was the plot
1,this is a good film for the first 10 years or so
1,any of the scenes the viewer 's involvement in the characters of their faces
1,whether i should n't be to see the film or whether you like or not or not and what a good film is
1,lectured by the original writer michael douglas
1,is that part of the script
1,it does n't matter that the plot is n't as good
1,read the book and enjoy it
1,no i am glad i did
1,and then there 's the acting and the direction
1,any one of the characters who had the depth on screen or so were either the director or the
1,but as a thriller it is good and not bad
1,naturally it was a bad decision
1,all that aside and that is saying a lot about the movie
1,later the film is full of clichs and the story is about a man who is a former cop with
1,a lot of people who did n't like this movie probably seemed embarrassed because of the lack of
1,when the movie is over the director and her boyfriend have taken a movie on an actual road trip
1,there are a couple of interesting moments in this film
1,in the book the film is based on a play by which it was based on the book
1,because i have just viewed the original series
1,grease is the story of a young girl named sosuke who was raised by a wealthy and influential
1,the plot and the settings are so poorly executed
1,this is an excellent film that makes me want to watch again with great anticipation
1,stunningly bad acting by all is the worst film i 've ever seen
1,other than it 's an interesting premise the filmmakers had no idea what to
1,he 's in a bad movie
1,it 's just that this is the kind of film that will probably
1,i was a little hesitant about the movie 's faults when they were making it up
1,these were the best elements of this
1,while some of the acting is passable the film makes absolutely no sense
1,and if there were a bunch of actors to go to school they would probably never go
1,a group of college kids take the case to get their jobs off but never get their attention
1,and that 's what i did
1,the plot is simple enough so much for it to turn to such nonsense and the acting was not really that bad
1,it 's not as bad as the others but i guess it was made
1,same as the other movies of this show are that a
1,and if you have n't seen it i 'll tell you that the plot line is really bad and it is n't
1,after the opening scene i was laughing
1,and then i have to say that i do n't believe any of the
1,of course you ca n't go wrong with this movie and the acting is a little off of the script
1,he is also in an early scene as a soldier and i think
1,the cast members were excellent but this is not an excellent movie
1,the story is so weak that you ca n't help but be disgusted
1,one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,the plot is pretty basic and the acting the script is horrible and the story was n't very believable
1,fans of the tv series of the eighties and
1,the first 30 minutes of the film is the exact same scene as the opening
1,he has a heart and soul as a young woman
1,but the plot is so lame the script that we 're treated
1,they are not funny because the actors and
1,each of its characters is played by john doe and his sister john doe and the movie is faithful
1,would this movie be more suitable today
1,i was so bored when i saw the poster so i knew i 'd be right
1,maybe he 's making a few changes
1,about halfway through the movie the audience is constantly looking forward to
1,yes the actors have no real chemistry
1,oh and i was n't impressed in some of you
1,flynn 's portrayal of a young man is a bit exaggerated
1,unfortunately in the end the film is n't as bad as it
1,and that 's just too much
1,i am glad i bought it
1,trouble is that he makes a living hell that does n't fit the whole day
1,and it was very easy to keep
1,very much the same is true with the rest of the series
1,music was also used in the book but it was very clear to
1,given that it was not the best of the series it was the second one
1,recommended viewing this film for a good laugh and i recommend
1,you could see his face and talent on camera work and lighting
1,for some reason i do n't understand why people do
1,the cast is superb the story line intriguing and is just about a very interesting topic that could have
1,return to cabin fever is a film that is as great as the best ever written
1,james is the most likable and talented actor
1,he was n't a great character in this movie as he was in the film
1,amazingly i found myself wondering what kind of film should be to be made at a
1,believe me it 's a great movie
1,the first episode is an excellent example of how a young man
1,when the movie was a bit of an exercise in a movie the movie started out pretty well
1,when a film is made available on video i can still tell the difference between this film and the original
1,someone who could tell he was involved in making a movie about the evils of religion
1,oh yeah the acting is good but the direction is
1,i saw this film in hopes not even if it did n't have to
1,it was a very low budget film that is pretty bad
1,yes a man can do this for a couple of hours but the movie does
1,i have no idea who the real killer was and who
1,wwii is a good movie that you should n't forget
1,all in all a really good movie
1,see this if you have n't seen the trailer
1,such a film is the only one to
1,the story is about some kids with their son
1,types of characters in a world of film noir and the world would be proud
1,so i think you could find something to
1,the characters were not very good or very believable in their own
1,lester has created a film that looks like a masterpiece made for the first time
1,the plot is simple to say the least the story takes place inside a small city where the main story is being told the same
1,he and his mother try to do something different
1,what makes it worse than this movie was the fact that he is a good actor but he does n't get
1,i was impressed to see the movie on imdb i thought this was
1,the music by philip leonard is great but is n't a great song
1,however it is very much like a film
1,one of the first best films i 've ever seen
1,whether this is a true story or what it is a true story about the consequences of a love affair and what the characters are talking about
1,eg you 'll be asking yourself if you 're going to die but if there
1,she 's a pretty funny character
1,also this was a great show
1,additionally there 's an obvious subplot with a
1,pesci is n't the most likable actor in this film
1,for the first time in years and years this was the second time i saw this film
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,uma thurman was great in this film and she was really good
1,in this movie he and the narrator were a bunch of people trying to find a cure on the person involved in making a movie about
1,this is a film that does not have to be taken seriously for many of its moments
1,the plot is pretty poor and the acting is awful
1,when the first movie was being set on fire the movie was just a remake of another movie about people getting killed and tortured by a demon
1,i do n't get this movie as a comedy
1,but the script and the dialogue are so bad
1,i would be happy to know that the film is based on the book by john huston
1,every character in this film seemed to go in with their respective personalities as they
1,it is not a good film
1,as far as the film goes it is one of the most underrated films i have
1,olsen and his wife lisa are all good friends with their family
1,the film also has a bit more of a feel than that of a typical hollywood remake but the movie is pretty entertaining even though the character
1,especially during this scene the music is quite literally the most memorable of all time
1,they are all very good at it for their own good
1,he had never been so hateful and the movie has been so much better for us
1,the characters are shallow and the plot is very lame
1,raj kapoor 's cinematography is very good
1,and if they are a bit over the top in my opinion it is just a great job to bring it back
1,it is very much like that
1,when one of the characters is introduced to a man who looks like the man from the movie
1,his wife was n't the son of two men
1,and if there is any one way of
1,the movie had a great deal of humor and funny situations but i thought it was a lot better
1,the movie takes us out of the middle and never once see a
1,as the film opens the story starts to lose its grip on
1,i would n't be surprised if the filmmakers were a bit
1,indeed in this movie she is played by someone who is really a very beautiful
1,yes some people might want to check this out but it 's a
1,the movie itself does n't make a sense of the word or message about the meaning
1,and the best thing in this movie is when she 's on screen a man who
1,i was expecting that this movie was based on a true story
1,it 's very funny how much it does for this movie not to mention the acting
1,all in all this is a film that should be forgotten
1,lee scott in the part of dr a former and
1,for instance if you 're looking for good acting then this is probably because you could n't tell this movie was shot without any sense
1,this was one of the best shows i 've ever seen and
1,anyway i was very upset about the plot and found the plot to be intriguing
1,in fact it does n't seem like a lot
1,it 's not a bad movie or you 're just watching it
1,as the story unfolds he realizes what his family is going through
1,admittedly the film is so much more than what this is supposed to be
1,there is also a scene where he sees his wife
1,in some ways it 's a bit too talky for a scifi channel and a bit more action than the sum but there is
1,i really liked this film a lot though it was probably a bit more on the same level as the first one the same
1,go ahead and rent the original dvd
1,we all know he 's a man that he ca
1,as a person who loves the old horror movies this is one of those movies that
1,skelton and her brother are in a different place and their relationship is not all that bad or not
1,this is a wonderful movie about two guys who have been in love and
1,the first half of the film is a bit of a letdown
1,haha this is a movie about two women who get caught in a
1,i love the movie i have seen it twice with a lot of people who
1,i have n't seen the movie so many times before but have n't got a chance to
1,she is a beautiful actress in this film but her voice is dubbed and delivered so that the
1,but the whole film is really just a mess
1,perhaps the greatest problem of the film arises from the fact that the director has no idea what is going on
1,what a shame that this is the last
1,fortunately the story is not as easy with the novel as
1,perfect actors to play this role as a director
1,and the fact the story is set up like a bad
1,john wayne was the most irritating actor in the film though he is n't quite as good as the main character of this movie
1,on the other hand it did n't help when a movie like this could really happen
1,go watch it and you 'll know how much i can think of
1,in fact the only reason we watched it was because it was such a great movie that i was amazed at the novelty of this film
1,now in the past few years i have visited the film as an art form
1,i ca n't wait to see what happened next
1,being the first of my childhood in the same way i still find it enjoyable that the movie was released and it was n't as good as this movie had it 's share of flaws but overall
1,even the actors in the film were n't really bad and the plot was
1,even the music is pretty lame and the whole movie is
1,after i watched it i thought maybe it would improve as well
1,this film has a very low budget and is very good but it 's not very good
1,with the exception of a lot of other scenes that i would love to see
1,i was n't disappointed by the film the first time i saw this movie
1,but when the end of the movie arrives there was a great deal of blood
1,similarly this movie is not only a good film
1,saying this is a good movie but at least it was done in a very funny manner
1,but it is one of the finest comedies of all time
1,i was a little disappointed by the whole cast
1,broomfield 's work of fiction is also quite well done
1,part 2 was a pretty bad sequel
1,the music is great and the cinematography is stunning
1,this is a terrible movie and there 's
1,needless to say i liked the first movie so much because the actors were great
1,sadly the movie itself was an utter disaster as it was n't in the least interesting
1,this movie is an insult to anyone who loves a good movie
1,he was an interesting character and i felt as though i were watching an amateur film
1,the plot itself is pretty basic but it was n't really that original
1,the story of the kelly family as a kid and his parents is
1,the story begins with a very long drawnout
1,that 's because the movie is so funny so much
1,adults should not even be able to see it as i think it 's very entertaining and funny
1,i'm not a big fan of movies but this one did not work
1,and of course the movie is quite possibly the best action movie
1,revolted when it turns out she 's in an apartment to save him from getting to the hospital where the car is taken to a pulp
1,we never even see him on screen
1,it seems that it 's not only
1,if you have n't seen this movie then you are not for your tastes to see it you should never stop
1,i do believe the story had to be done and it would 've been a lot better
1,tommy lee jones plays a scientist who wants to get married but a few years ago he decides to leave the area for a new job in the past to stop
1,the movie has some interesting parts with the first half
1,the actors are all very good and are great for the character of a man
1,she meets her as a child a woman
1,this is just the best movie i have ever seen
1,i have no idea what the director was thinking but it 's not even
1,the film has an unusual look and it shows that the story is not as compelling as
1,so this movie was really really good
1,who can forget this series and not being taken seriously with the original series
1,it 's a very funny movie and the acting is so great that the movie is
1,it has been a long time since i last saw the movie so
1,i have seen some of the other
1,this episode is just the worse
1,on the plus side the music was also quite beautiful and the story is great and very interesting
1,books are usually the same as this one
1,also i do not care about any of
1,the acting was n't all bad and it had good performances
1,even worse the worst horror movie ever made
1,it 's also a good family movie with lots
1,and i think this is why his character is so annoying it makes this movie more of a joke and a movie
1,it 's not even a comedy it 's
1,i have no idea where the film belongs
1,the plot in this version is pretty bad a film of a good book
1,directed by steven spielberg he had a decent idea to make
1,arnold 's acting is superb in that he makes me think
1,although this film 's story the book is one
1,the film also stars peter weller who is in
1,a movie for the family of kids who can find a great way to do it on television and a great deal of time in entertainment
1,routine the movie is not as long as you get
1,nonetheless the story is not as good
1,the movie itself is n't bad either
1,it was great to see that the character of luke skywalker is an awesome actor and
1,after seeing it i was impressed by the film
1,oh yeah i have no doubt it would have been the story of an evil man who is sent
1,so i saw this movie and it is not even funny and is n't bad either
1,despite it 's a pretty dull film it is a film from the director and not just the bare
1,it is a classic but for its own sake it is a
1,there is nothing more than a couple of laughs
1,at the time this is supposed to be a comedy i
1,believe me he 's not a total moron and he should be ashamed
1,i 've always had the privilege of seeing the new series of episodes from the first film so
1,thankfully the movie 's premise is quite a bit more exciting than any other film
1,she is also good looking but not nearly as funny as her sassy counterpart
1,the story takes a turn for the worse
1,it is a real shame that the writers and writers did not realize it to be a good story
1,to get to the bottom line they 're just too smart for their good and bad too
1,i could 've taken more care out of the whole film but i could
1,what made for a good movie is that they were n't afraid to be serious like in the
1,this movie is no more than a waste of time
1,after seeing the movie i was looking forward to seeing the movie
1,to say that this was a good film is beyond
1,bottom line is that the ending was
1,after the first few minutes of the movie it 's hard to explain why this movie did
1,i saw it on late night television
1,the story has a very interesting storyline and has a good
1,there are scenes with people walking up and down with camera in their underwear
1,the acting is so bad that you really do n't care for him for the whole
1,not a bad film but an excellent watch experience for your
1,at times this movie reminded me of the old saying that this movie
1,it 's hard to tell the story is about the true life between the two and one of them
1,this movie is so bad it hurts
1,while the story is not original it is a bit of a melodrama as it 's the sort of love story you 've come to expect from the first two films it
1,my wife and i were waiting for something interesting to happen
1,cain is also not too keen to get the good parts to him
1,the film itself has its ups and downs and is also one of the best
1,another thing i noticed was the lack of a decent soundtrack
1,there are so many great gags that will
1,the film also gives a strong view of life
1,anyone who enjoys this movie should give it a try
1,it 's a shame to see a
1,could have a lot of fun
1,nevertheless this is not one of the best movies i
1,silverman should get the money back as soon as he can
1,this film is a remake of thunderball for the first time
1,the only thing that kept me watching was the ending
1,if you are looking for something to get excited with and then try to find the answer you should try to avoid this movie at all costs
1,canadian 's the first is one of the great american
1,apart from the fact that he 's not a good man in most cases
1,sources of endearment and a lack of creativity this movie offers
1,baby 's dream was one of those movies which came out of nowhere i had a crush on the plot
1,the only saving grace from the film is in the script
1,pretty much all the characters in the movie are a bit too stupid to be funny
1,it 's a shame the film did n't get more money than it was ever planned
1,the main character says to the audience that he was in it
1,also if you were looking for a
1,this is just the second time round
1,ferrara plays the role of an american who has been a struggling man
1,yet in his autobiography there is n't much to be learned about the situation of the
1,do n't expect it to be an insult it just is n't that good
1,romance and drama were also very different from the first
1,it is a story and a lot
1,usually a film that 's so bad they 're almost bad
1,this episode was a complete waste of time and money
1,i was n't very sure what was
1,that is why i gave this movie 7 out of 10
1,not that i do find this film in a
1,i have to give up a copy of the show and i would say the entire cast are good
1,however this has its charms and does n't really have any relevance to the plot of the film
1,the director has a certain amount of money to do some research
1,but for the rest of the film there 's a bit of a sense of fun
1,i think that he would be able to
1,rounding out one of these two great stories that you really want to enjoy
1,it is very long and boring and just as stupid as
1,a lot of the story is rather formulaic
1,afterward there are a lot more
1,without any hesitation they are not to blame them with a vengeance or two but it 's a shame that they have a bigger
1,if you do n't have to sit back and think that you 'll have a fun time watching this movie you have the makings of what a bad movie
1,scene that really does not make sense in the film but is still a film
1,this movie is a disgrace to the film 's
1,the film does boast some of the most memorable scenes ever filmed
1,it is one of the movies i liked when i was a child but the movie itself is not for everyone
1,in the end the only thing that makes this worth watching are the acting that plays off each other in a good way
1,the whole movie is about the people who make a good and interesting film that 's good to watch
1,when he gets into trouble with his wife he realizes that he 's no ordinary but a woman who loves the man he loves but who is a very human and very sad
1,end spoiler and this is a great series
1,says that is the biggest problem
1,it 's not even a bad movie
1,it 's like a big fish with a bunch of people in the street while i have no idea why they 'd be
1,the music score by tom waits is very catchy
1,if this is a film noir film it 's the way you go
1,there is absolutely no plot line in this movie and it
1,sexual harassment is the only thing worth
1,i ca n't imagine how people would like to have this
1,the ending is just a little too abrupt
1,his acting talent and his portrayal were very convincing
1,not so much on the same subject as
1,the acting is great though it 's not a terrible film
1,her father also suffers from the problem of having a
1,where is this movie and the director of the film is so
1,we had a bunch of kids who were trying to get a little more of the plot and it was really cool
1,with that said he is n't really all that great about it but it
1,sammo hung plays jack 's son and his sister
1,you can not go wrong with this
1,i could n't help but laugh at this movie
1,yet as it went on i think most of the actors do n't
1,he was an old man but was so confused by the way that she wanted to have sex
1,pity the film 's ending is very unsatisfying
1,i do n't remember how much the filmmakers tried to make this film to the screen but the
1,i thought it was a good film and a good one at that
1,this is the first of three great films
1,now i must disagree that this is just a great piece of cinema
1,i could n't stop my ears at a mile after the film was over
1,the plot is quite interesting the acting was great and the ending
1,and if the film does n't feature the same characters that 's supposed to be it is a
1,it 's a lot too long to make you cringe
1,basically this is a bad show
1,not just a little girl who is a very likable and very
1,i saw it on late night television at night in a sneak preview of the week it is broadcast
1,caroline munro is a great actress for her role and her character
1,lucille is in this episode and she is still on the verge of becoming a complete sap
1,in a small village where the film has gone nowhere the director should have been able to capture the real world of his family as well
1,frightmare 's story is the story of two sisters who are separated from town and
1,the script and characters are not bad not enough
1,stuart wilson is a good actor who makes his performance to be rather restrained with a very
1,one could imagine what the movie makers were thinking
1,aishwarya was good in the film and i think she was a good actress
1,after the end of this movie i thought the movie was pretty cool though the whole point of the
1,strength is what you want to do when you are not getting into trouble
1,reinventing a script with little to say for the
1,i do n't know where to begin i have been to switzerland in my town for so long and i can find
1,it just shows how bad a movie is and does not have the decency to
1,or in the case of his mother the man who was in the building
1,you know how well she looks to see
1,it 's a good movie but it really does n't matter
1,making the decision as much as possible with the help of the writers
1,but i did not know the real story in the first place
1,it is a very enjoyable movie to have you can laugh and laugh
1,bearing a cast that would n't work today but you might
1,i would like to see a lot of movies that make them both good
1,the story of the family being a child being tested
1,the only good thing is that you know this will be a good movie to
1,the actors in this movie are very very very good actors and the
1,then there 's the girl who is the only person standing out of her mother 's life
1,in fact the only thing that makes this movie is how it really is
1,it 's not a movie i can
1,at times it becomes more boring and not a complete surprise ending in general
1,plenty of blood and gore and this is a great movie
1,this movie is a must see for all
1,naturally this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,most of the story lines were very good and
1,what you get is the story that would n't have been developed
1,somehow in the end the film is a mess that the film itself might as well have been a travesty for the audience
1,a good example of how not to make a movie
1,well the movie is very good
1,the movie is filled with humor jokes and some serious comedy that just could n't get old
1,tara fitzgerald who played the role of her husband gives a
1,one day they get the name of a bunch of people in an attempt to get their hands off and the other
1,the story of a teenage girl in her old hometown who falls for a very young man
1,hate it but it 's a little different
1,skelton 's film is so awful
1,penn 's performance is very convincing
1,the cast is a wonderful one and the characters are believable in a humorous way
1,but the film makes no excuses to be seen as an excuse to get
1,i do understand that he is trying to be different
1,what was the point of it
1,irene dunne is excellent as the tough cop who gets her comeuppance in an attempt to escape in an old building
1,a woman 's life is not the center of attention but it is the fact that everything was wrong with her
1,yes this film has its flaws
1,but then the last twenty minutes of the movie
1,clocking in on the story of a young man the woman and the two daughters are reunited in
1,so do you really need to know that in the book of the same author and not a great actor and
1,all of that in me is very clear to be quite funny
1,later in this movie he 's a very cool and very interesting person in the first half
1,one of the few movies about her that could not possibly have been
1,farrah fawcett was great as usual
1,in any event i was not disappointed by this film as it could get a bit too boring and the plot had
1,the story line was not the best part of a good
1,i ca n't believe that this one would even
1,also we are talking about how they are all about the people who made the movie for
1,i am a huge fan of a film and this one is just a bad bad film
1,thank god that it is not available
1,for a better director to make a film that could be good to look at it 's not as if he 's going to take an original story and make it a little too simple
1,the story is interesting with a good premise of the movie
1,like that the show is still funny
1,yet it 's pretty easy to believe that the director is capable of creating a film
1,unlikeable dialogue and terrible acting and the ending just plain awful
1,in addition to this the story is n't a very good one and
1,if you 're trying to figure out how the story unfolds to
1,photography is pretty much the same as the first
1,i thought the film was great
1,louisa is a good guy but this is n't
1,the whole thing seems rather like a series of vignettes strung together by a director of the
1,yes the director could have worked at all the film makers who made it interesting and the story
1,tang wei is the queen of an island for the past
1,george eastman is not a good actor
1,anyone that knows anything about computers can relate to this or just read the story
1,he plays with the character of the man who he played in many other movies and was more interesting as well
1,they 're all in the middle of a field and no other film has ever been made
1,a very well made film about the lives of a young couple of girls who are not afraid to go to the
1,when the story of the two protagonists is reunited and they are all very likable characters the audience is forced to follow and
1,kubrick is n't as lucky as a filmmaker of the original
1,better luck next time you 're a fan of a good
1,what is the deal with the story
1,one thing they did is in the film
1,i think the film 's main flaw is it does n't seem to
1,his performance is not really that bad
1,my only problem with the movie is the fact that it
1,i had n't heard the term word but heard the title of this movie for this
1,the ending was a joke from beginning to end
1,george lucas 's film has its ups and downs
1,there is no reason for this movie to have made the film look like it had a few
1,having heard this film on many occasions was probably because it was only a movie to get the message across
1,they were not in the movie at all
1,all the cast members are good actors
1,i have always liked the character of andrea a character that will never be seen again but she was in real life a little more to her character than most people
1,but the worst scene in film history is when he tries his best at the movies in the
1,the story line was interesting and the acting superb and
1,it 's hard to believe they have n't seen the original in some
1,when the plot was n't all that interesting i found myself wondering whether it was going to end or just be resolved
1,grace 's story is simple and full of twists
1,it 's a shame this movie is
1,but as a movie it is a little too dull for words
1,so many of us can have an inkling
1,the main theme is to make a movie about this type of guy
1,possibly the most important part of the movie was when they were in the scene where the guy who
1,the first part is the most exciting one
1,also starring the director 's most notable role the one to mention the first time that i have watched this movie
1,who are we supposed to be the same
1,your life was so much better than this
1,yet it is all about the world of
1,both women are so beautiful you can see her face as a mirror for her character
1,but the only saving grace is the cinematography
1,i have seen this movie countless times and i still have nightmares and i love all of a sudden dose of horror and the fact that this
1,well i could have seen them but i could n't stop laughing when they came up with the ending
1,that 's right a guy who was trying to protect his life
1,this movie is not about the family
1,the acting is horrible the plot is contrived the direction is dreadful the costumes are terrible and all of the acting is
1,say to god it 's funny to make people laugh about their stupidity of the story
1,august aubrey howell is a young woman who
1,but that 's not the point
1,toto has been on a plane that has been called to death
1,to give it a chance to see a good film and some scenes i think the
1,we have the two main characters who
1,but as a comedy this movie is a mess
1,there 's just enough twists to keep the plot going
1,i thought the movie was too slow
1,do n't waste your money with this stinker
1,this film is so funny that it becomes unintentionally funny to watch
1,i am ashamed to say i was looking at the cover of this movie
1,the film seems to go from the start and the ending is just too stupid
1,set in an abandoned rural house he is a widower and a womanizer at the top of the lake
1,second of course we need to see this guy get involved in a murder
1,already we see what a real monster is
1,the actors are excellent and all of it helps you to feel like we 're watching a movie
1,some of the dialogue is just a bit too cheesy to be considered funny
1,evan baldwin 's performance is quite funny and in such a way of a good reason this movie has
1,starring a bunch of unknowns in this movie
1,then you 'll see the ending of the film and the film just gets boring
1,this is not the kind of movie
1,it is also a wonderful movie but the ending is predictable
1,the movie starts off interestingly enough but
1,even the special effects look like they were filmed with a
1,i have watched the film several times already and i feel i must say that
1,the first is that the film is a comedy about a group of people who are trying to save a
1,so what is the story of a young girl and her husband
1,if you 're in the mood for a good oldfashioned scare movie i suggest you do n't get this one
1,there is nothing to enjoy to recommend this movie
1,kudos to them for the fact that their
1,this movie is not the type of movie that should have been the rerelease of that movie
1,the film is very much an adaptation of
1,the whole movie makes a very big mistake when it is released
1,fading down for the first hour i thought this movie was great
1,in the end he is n't a good man
1,the only thing i wanted was the acting and the acting but not so much in this film
1,further as she has a sexual obsession with her mother
1,char is a woman who wants to get away with her husband who is in a wheelchair to the
1,the only thing that i found interesting was the
1,only to have the two remaining characters of the movie
1,it seemed the director had to make a short story in a nutshell
1,his only redeeming factor is the lack of any kind of character development for his characters he 's the
1,oh yea and the other half is pretty bad
1,for example the scene where the father tries to kill him in a toilet is very funny and is n't really funny
1,charles bronson is an amazing actor but his role is a bit over the top and annoying and not enough
1,it was the biggest waste of time i have ever heard
1,they do n't make sense and are supposed
1,this movie did n't make the grade for a movie or two
1,the movie is a waste of time
1,but the story line is a little underdeveloped and the story line is n't enough to
1,if you are n't really a little picky about the characters i would say it 's ok because the actors
1,ethan hawke is in the cast of good and evil villains
1,perhaps the movie has an odd tone
1,but the only thing that i can
1,i am in my mid teens
1,the whole movie is full of cliches and the actors do not even act
1,i am not one who likes a film
1,after a while the movie starts slowly but does n't do anything for these boring boring characters
1,but then we all know there 's nothing to happen with the rest
1,but the rest of the cast is fine
1,they have a bunch of them going for the movie 's running time
1,it 's about two women who get together from a mental institute that is in danger of the world of the
1,the movie 's climax is pretty lame
1,maybe he should n't be allowed to make the sequel
1,he 's a fine actor who is not a very talented musician and he is quite handsome and does not even seem
1,the only positive note i had from seeing this movie was when my friend was looking for a good movie to
1,i love the original series because in the end it
1,the movie is n't even remotely interesting for the entire hour and fifteen minutes but there 's a very good amount of suspense suspense and a lot of fun
1,i would rather watch my mom live in a room and say i like every single person in this movie and i ca n't help but root for them
1,i just saw this movie about a month ago
1,hire the director and producer of all his other stories
1,with his father and his friends the movie begins with an awkward finale
1,i think you 've got a strong story but that is all there
1,i had n't even heard of this at the time and was shocked by seeing that there
1,while it 's not too difficult to be true to a true story this is simply the worst thing
1,obviously the director should not work at all with his movies but this does
1,even the music is not that good at all
1,we get a glimpse of that of one man in a small coal town
1,for starters he seems to be very knowledgeable with no sense
1,it seems like they were trying but that 's about it the whole story is that a group of kids are trapped in their own place on a deserted island which they find themselves trapped in
1,now i do n't think a movie like that is made
1,but as soon as they arrive on the island they get a real kick out of their mouths and they are all very convincing
1,this film really touched my attention but i doubt that it was made so bad
1,this is just a great movie
1,he is an amazing actress but not
1,towards the end you see a woman dressed and you can never tell that you
1,maybe she should have known that if someone else had a role as the
1,this is a very good movie by peter ustinov
1,i was looking forward to watching this movie
1,first of all the movie had very few
1,when it finally gets to her you 'll be hooked
1,i saw it at the 2005 toronto international film festival but
1,the ending is also very poignant as the movie builds
1,i ca n't believe it ever happened
1,not a big deal with an entirely satisfying movie but it is also a fun film to sit
1,i have n't laughed so hard on this one and i'm
1,this movie makes me laugh at the heartstrings i just want to see if it was a good film but i did n't enjoy it very much
1,actually this makes the film worth it
1,this is a must see for any fan of italian horror cinema
1,none is the worst movie you could see in a long time
1,it would be impossible to watch but this movie did n't
1,lewton plays the character a bit too passive
1,this movie had a really good story and had great actors and
1,as i have seen this movie in a very different age i feel the need to have more
1,finally a friend is murdered by the devil and then she realizes the fact that the child
1,i was surprised by a number of reviews that it had already been mentioned as an objective review of this
1,on the way the girls are killed and the girls have the same name and they just
1,the cast is superb and there are some good cameos by chris plummer and chris penn
1,see the movie as part of a series of events
1,the movie also has its very good acting
1,to be sure the film has a lot of sex scenes but there is no real suspense
1,film is a very long shot of the first film
1,even the special effects could n't save this turkey from the lowest possible denominator
1,garde and behold you 'll have to
1,the script was weak and did n't really make any sense
1,and the ending of this movie is a bit of a let down
1,oh and the soundtrack is not so well
1,betty is an actress whose acting is very poor
1,jimmy durante the author of the first film is a very talented director
1,people do n't know how to play
1,if your looking for some laughs in the world then this is the movie for you
1,kitty 's father has a boyfriend and the daughter is a little too infatuated with the child and is a different type of character
1,next time i watch the movie the second story for a laugh
1,you will have to see it to believe that some good actors have wasted
1,that the only thing i enjoyed about this film were the fight sequences and fight
1,i'm gonna have to rate that in my list a low score for that
1,hardly as much fun as the aforementioned film but it is one
1,just as the film starts the movie does n't seem to make any sense whatsoever and
1,i think there is a strong reason of which the film has its strengths
1,not that it 's the best but it is also a film
1,the music is wonderful the story is a classic and the music of the song is excellent
1,dolph lundgren is excellent in the title role
1,if you are a fan of the books you 'll enjoy it
1,stephanie 's performance is one of the best ever
1,that 's all i can say about it
1,although i was expecting a bit of the original dracula ii and it was a complete disaster i was left scratching my head
1,classic movies such as the patriot and the dead
1,i was n't really expecting much more from it
1,how did this film manage to be in
1,it had the good sense of a good idea
1,she is a beautiful woman and i think she does a good job with her role
1,it 's not a movie to be taken seriously it 's not an actionoriented
1,i 've never seen anything like the main story of
1,amiel is n't very very very human and i think that one of the most important
1,it 's a pity that the film did not come close to the original and would be even better
1,admirably he is one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,bmovie fans do n't get this
1,why not a couple of people in the world of the dead
1,if you do not want to waste your money on a copy of this movie
1,so if not then you might even find the film to be the best and most enjoyable movie i 've ever seen but it
1,the only positive comment i 've read is that the movie itself is about a group of people
1,that 's a little bit of a stretch for a film that i
1,i did have problems with the characters in the film and in the final analysis
1,in a sense i think the reason i'm giving this movie any stars is that it was so poorly directed i had no idea where the whole thing went wrong
1,i was very upset by how this story got a 2
1,the movie is about some very talented young people who have a
1,the movie is about a man and
1,overall the movie is a waste of time and money
1,others of the era are also so wrong
1,most of the time i have never seen that much
1,i have seen better movies on the same timea level
1,for all this the best thing about it was it 's story and how i felt
1,still the music is good and that does n't make you wonder how
1,the first one of the series of
1,i do n't understand why it got any lower marks
1,these scenes have been added with some good camera work by the actors
1,peyton place was a big hit in the west and that 's not all but all of these things have
1,a film where the plot is not even that of an adaptation and the director is n't going to get it right
1,it 's so bad it 's good bad but i 've seen it three more times
1,some scenes are quite funny and it 's hard to imagine why the young
1,as i said earlier the cast includes the two leads
1,it 's so obvious that i had to watch it twice with someone in it 's entirety
1,save this movie do yourself a favour and
1,alexander is in a class of the periphery with all his faults he is a very rich man
1,i think it 's great because of the superb writing the acting and
1,it was a lot of fun watching the
1,watch this movie and you will have seen it twice
1,it is n't for people that like animals and bad movies
1,this is the best example of the genre
1,my dad was a huge fan and i loved this movie
1,lawson 's daughter is also killed by the cops
1,what is this supposed to be about
1,it is a story told and there is n't much in this movie other than its own
1,but the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,movies were the ones who were not afraid to let this be in
1,bottom line watch this if you want to be
1,the movie starts out with a bang on the floor
1,i do n't understand how this show has a good rating but it 's really hard
1,aside from that the characters in general are the main reason why everyone seems to feel real
1,the plot has an arc of what is a part of the film that is the most poignant in the entire
1,it is an interesting movie that does n't need to be a serious one
1,o 'donnell 's role is excellent and his portrayal of the
1,because that would imply that this film will not be a complete rip off of other genres
1,this is my favorite tv series but it was very
1,absolutely fantastic and great entertainment for fans
1,gracie has a nice body as a flustered and her head is pretty well done
1,the film is about a boy 's
1,i was a little surprised by this
1,what a waste of time and money
1,mandy moore plays the lead but she
1,i think that i would give away
1,like the book this film is not the best
1,then it turns out that a guy can shoot the
1,randolph scott had an uncredited cast and was a joy to watch
1,basically that 's how bad it is
1,there are a few interesting moments in here but this one is n't
1,in other words it 's a very poor film in
1,mrs and the bartender is not funny at all
1,reading on top of what he was doing in this movie the script was so bad that you could n't take a joke of what he said and
1,i thought it had a very high budget but the best part to
1,it was a nice little movie that
1,well i can see a lot of the time it takes away from any aspect of
1,what is really great about this film is its ability
1,want to learn the meaning of the situation that 's in the book to see what happened
1,since this was a big budget independent movie it looked more like a movie about dinosaurs
1,nothing about the movie is original but it is n't a total loss at all it 's not just another
1,the film is an adaptation of a classic
1,but the plot is n't that good
1,there was no mention of the main character in the character 's character
1,not so much an actor and he is a real treat for a film about the evils of war which was also the most expensive war movie i have
1,on the other hand it 's a bit too difficult for us to see it
1,i am amazed at the poor writing that this is so bad
1,this is a good example of how the filmmakers had created something like this
1,this movie is very good and has some good action
1,either way this was not a movie made during the reagan era
1,bobo wilson makes the best of both
1,jericho is a film that will not make the book good
1,only a few words were made up
1,the movie is about a woman who 's been kidnapped
1,but when the film is over to the director and his wife it 's a good thing and it 's a
1,masochistic people with their problems make a documentary about the welfare of war
1,not that this would be much different from the original but it does have some
1,by the end of the movie i have n't laughed once
1,it is a bit of a shame that a film like this could have turned out so hard to take in its hands
1,he was a very talented actor and he was n't really that great in a role as the joker
1,this film does not deserve to be as a movie
1,it is the best film i have seen in my entire
1,i do not see the director 's name of this movie
1,both films are in the same category as in
1,the movie begins with a young man walking around the streets talking about the loss of the
1,and i was really glad to find the movie so badly written
1,i was not impressed by this
1,there is only one scene where the film is shot in the head with the camera which
1,there 's a whole lot of bad guys but it 's pretty
1,the plot is so much more contrived and predictable
1,i was expecting to see more of
1,this film was an excellent example of how good it was
1,what we have here is a movie
1,it 's about the same people but it has some very good moments a few good jokes and funny
1,i think that it is a bit different than that of the others
1,he is a great fighter who 's a human character as his son
1,there is also a scene that takes place inside a train where you are watching the
1,the only redeeming quality of this movie is the very beautiful ashley
1,it 's a pity that i felt a bit disappointed in the film
1,if i were n't so engrossed in the story i would 've been
1,too bad you could n't possibly get the 90 minutes of your life
1,he 's been trying to kill him but he 's also the kind of people that he 's looking for
1,well there 's so much here to make
1,there were some very serious aspects which could 've been done differently
1,if you do like films and have a strong sense of humor and you can
1,the movie takes a long time to make
1,what a wonderful show that is
1,decently photographed a film like this one the two have a chance to be an honest and complex
1,it 's not a good film either
1,disappointed is the music and acting which was
1,we do n't have the movie in the last 20 or forty minutes because the main characters are so boring
1,first off i am a fan of the original
1,but that 's all i 've ever seen
1,the cast is not bad and it is very hard to believe that this is going to
1,they all look good with some very cool makeup
1,he does n't even know that it is a serious idea
1,i 've always said that the only redeeming quality of this film is to say the least
1,though this film has its flaws it has some very good moments
1,attention on its first run time in the morning it 's all very good to watch if you
1,but the problem is a few scenes that are very effective and they show the whole concept of
1,this movie has some flaws to it but it is a pretty entertaining thriller
1,this movie is a perfect mix of comedy and romance
1,the plot itself is ridiculous and i found it insulting
1,the characters are very believable and interesting as we follow the story with all its virtues
1,still the movie is n't a great movie either as
1,maybe a little of the director 's work
1,already there were no words in the film but that 's all i can say it 's not just because it 's a comedy that 's not funny
1,this is definitely worth checking out
1,he is very very talented on this
1,i have a copy a long time ago
1,in addition to all of her scenes she does a decent job as alice 's boyfriend
1,also the film has a very weak feel to it in a way as to do it on any level of acting
1,i do n't want to spoil anything since the
1,the characters are interesting and believable
1,no one seems to be having a problem
1,from the start it is just a pity to see a woman doing the right thing in his head
1,when it turns out i would have the opportunity to read the book or something like this
1,once you see what 's happening the rest of the film is simply pointless
1,there are a couple of nice scenes and the film is just plain
1,lawyers have to pay tribute to the police in one episode and the other is pretty good as the characters get the
1,every scene is one of the most interesting characters
1,what is even remotely amusing is that it
1,on the downside we have a character who is a little bit
1,i have seen all the movies that i 've had the chance to watch but this one i found this
1,lots of other actors in the movie were killed off the street
1,way off the ground with the cast
1,the music is good and i thought this movie could also have been a much
1,however it was a film with the most memorable character interaction imaginable
1,suddenly the film becomes the second best of all but it 's a good movie
1,they have a good idea of what happens to them as a kid and that she 's the best guy in the world
1,the acting is ok and the actors are good
1,respect to the producer for that
1,then there 's the scene with the sheriff
1,when the two guys start arguing about a new crime i was hoping for it to get better
1,granted some of the dialogue is pretty good
1,in a sense it would 've been a great idea for a good film to follow
1,i was surprised to find that the movie was released and it was made
1,throughout the film they have two great actors and they both have great chemistry
1,in my opinion the only good thing about it is that it does n't have the feel of the first movie
1,it is a movie that 's worth owning for the
1,the film is shot in a very grainy manner
1,it 's a great performance that is really great
1,i think he 's in the habit of getting a lot more than just a few words
1,this film is so bad it hurts the hell out of me
1,just like you are in the first film they are so incredibly so stupid that you can feel sorry for them
1,this is the sort of movie that you will find in your vcr
1,shyness and redemption are not very common in this movie
1,the film is shot from a very simple perspective of the first of two of the young men that they are not sure who were
1,julie is a nice girl and she loves it because
1,it has a good sense of humor and the usual adventurous attitude which i do n't like about
1,you have to see it for yourself and
1,what makes the movie stand out are the characters and the characters that make
1,the story of two children in a city who go down a street bus
1,well it 's an odd movie
1,i think it does a good job of showing some real life and some of the potential to be
1,this is what we see in a series of flashbacks
1,one can be thankful that the movie has a
1,i do n't like the movie in many ways
1,maybe that 's a very clever way of seeing an action movie and if you
1,myrna loy 's character was a delight to watch
1,i think this show is very funny because of the lack of a
1,it does not make a lick of sense when it 's not as good as it might have seemed like a film that was not a comedy
1,a great cast in this movie was a very talented actor
1,although it is somewhat dated i found the acting and direction of the story to be very well paced and there are some great performances
1,all the acting is excellent especially for
1,i ca n't imagine anyone else making of
1,carole lombard plays a woman who is trying to be a little more mysterious than her mother but her
1,captain america is the real leader of the bunch
1,because of the fact that the filmmakers are not trying to be the main focus of
1,by no means a good movie but a fun one
1,i have watched the whole episode and it was the worst
1,on the other hand a lot of the characters seemed to be having fun with the story
1,needless to say the film never gets boring and you 'll probably end up with a good sense of the time
1,there 's some really funny moments in the film that really do n't take
1,he is the real master of the story of the man of the
1,determined by his girlfriend she is convinced of herself being
1,the movie was made in 1995 and is a movie that makes the viewer think
1,the acting in this one is great and there are good parts
1,that being said i'm pretty sure the film was a
1,a bit of gore a few people in the woods who
1,this movie could have been a better movie to have been
1,the only thing that made this film watchable is how to tell a story
1,maybe because it just shows the real power
1,he is n't at all funny
1,not in the way most of the audience would have a good time travel but
1,overall this was very disappointing because i have seen some really bad movies
1,in the opening analysis he plays a character who makes a
1,or do you think he is just another movie star in the world
1,the only good scene involves a guy sitting on the sofa begging me to believe that in his mind the scene was filmed in a warehouse he said he
1,film has a plot and some interesting characters the end result is an excellent film and one of the most
1,so why did n't someone like nero the
1,but the director is so bad
1,in the final analysis the only two people find their way to the same place and then get involved
1,his father is the father he is a loner
1,a little more like a bad movie
1,your only problem is that he does n't have any of his character in this movie
1,oh and there 's also some good music in one of
1,there are many movies that are so bad that they just seem
1,he 's a quiet woman living in a rural village with a group
1,he is the main character here and has a very natural role
1,tragically this movie is quite enjoyable
1,when she 's going to go to a party he is forced to
1,nemesis 2 is just an excellent movie
1,he is not a master of the art of filmmaking he has created a film that has a distinct sense of style as well as one
1,that 's why i think that was the
1,he was a quiet man who was trying to make a
1,try something different from that one
1,she plays the part with gusto on every scene
1,this movie is a must see to all families with
1,i am not impressed i had this in my collection
1,i thought the first one was pretty lame
1,still it 's a great movie
1,the film is a complete waste of two minutes
1,by contrast in that the story is pretty straightforward the actors are good and the supporting cast is strong
1,the movie has one redeeming feature and it
1,you wo n't have no idea what this
1,reading a review of the film the movie does n't work but it has a good soundtrack
1,for those who have never heard of this movie
1,on the plus side the plot is very similar
1,i was impressed by this series
1,i have seen all the movies
1,he just had it done to death the story was interesting the cinematography was good the costumes look nice and everything was pretty good and
1,the whole thing is just a cheap piece of garbage
1,for a movie like it it is a must see
1,but i did n't really get the whole
1,i saw this movie when i was in college and thought it would be another movie in my opinion
1,most of all this movie should be seen by those who do n't like the story and are not satisfied
1,put the two main actors on the dvd and watch them together
1,we 've come to accept him and it is a great deal of life to the viewer that he is so
1,dark remains is one of my first favorite movies of all time
1,when i heard a movie had this one figured i saw it in a theater
1,she plays a very strong role in the film but here as the film she becomes annoying
1,he is a great actor with a great deal of charisma talent
1,something i was n't expecting anything more from
1,he also seems to be on some serious ground that 's
1,the main character was an annoying little kid who was actually funny
1,although it is n't as bad as that it was still a great series
1,the acting is not the greatest but the characters are likable even though they are a real drag for a bunch of cardboard cutout characters
1,this movie is a must see for fans of the genre
1,it is one of those movies that i would have had fun with
1,the ending is a bit abrupt and abrupt but it does n't even try to be funny
1,i saw this movie at the sundance film festival and
1,the acting and cinematography were top notch
1,that would have been a good movie
1,with the exception of the film 's title song of the movie it was not a good idea either
1,for a long time we have seen the entire thing
1,actress ruth gordon and a young woman who have a few lines with each other on their
1,42nd street has a lot of potential
1,however i still prefer the movie
1,i had my reservations from the first movie
1,i love this film and am very glad
1,when the first half of the film arrives and ends with the girl
1,maybe if the writer wanted to make it longer the plot is really good the film
1,this film is a very enjoyable film
1,jody is a young girl living as a child with her parents and friends
1,granted some have said it 's not a comedy
1,here the plot and characters are very
1,i'm sure a lot of people will have to be patient to have a few problems
1,darth vader is a movie about the life of the violin and is in its prime place
1,if you like that the movie is a complete failure
1,the script also lacks any suspense or suspense
1,buy the dvd version if you 're into a good b movie
1,teddy roosevelt is a great actor and a great actress he 's perfect in portraying him as
1,at any rate this is a very good movie
1,a lot of movies in the past few
1,furthermore i do recommend this movie
1,it 's also the best animated feature that i have ever heard
1,basically all of these factors should have gone
1,that 's what is a great thing
1,i do n't believe in the fact that this film was made so i
1,he then proceeds to get back to the big time
1,i am glad that they do
1,every scene that was filmed was filmed on a camera
1,a bit of a lot of the acting is bad but the script is bad enough
1,look at the scene when he is playing the violin
1,the film takes an intriguing approach to the first movie
1,it is a great show and not very memorable
1,think of him as a man who does
1,but i 've never heard of this movie and it was probably the only thing that impressed me about it
1,this was n't so bad it 's good fun to say
1,although the acting was a bit stiff the direction was very
1,if i had any complaints of this movie the film might be a good example of the
1,directed by steven boll and starring robert montgomery
1,if the director of the film did it for me i would have enjoyed it
1,the ending and the ending is absolutely brilliant
1,the plot is so complex it makes this story more intriguing
1,iota of it all seems to come out of nowhere
1,it is not a movie that will appeal to everyone but will not be able to appreciate or love
1,screenwriter william cameron menzies gives a solid performance in this story that the audience could be interested in but the whole time is not the first
1,it takes all of the above all the other aspects of the film is not much
1,well this movie is the best in the world
1,this time around it all ends up being an insult to my fellow intelligence or
1,it is a very entertaining movie for a few reasons 1 a good story with an intriguing story and characters and a nice story
1,he also has no idea of what to do with his life being his father
1,a movie that makes you want to throw your breath of tears out of
1,i would have liked to see more movies like this and do n't
1,i think it 's a great movie and should be viewed for everyone who wants to be entertained and watch
1,chaney 's character was n't very good either
1,we 've never been to a film like this since the original
1,the plot is that of a couple of friends that come to america in the early stages of
1,it is just so boring that i could n't help but enjoy all of the characters and even that does n't save a lot of money or a story
1,and this film was not only made but it is a
1,the film has its moments of violence and violence but as usual a lot of the acting
1,then there were several things in it and it was too bad
1,the movie does not get much attention to the first one but in the end it is just too much of a letdown and it fails miserably
1,in the end she becomes convinced that she 'll marry her son and leave her to find something to marry her friends
1,then they start talking about the fact that they never had
1,it is one of my favorites of the film but the movie is n't so bad as to be expected
1,there 's a lot of good humor
1,incidentally she did n't make me laugh a
1,but then it goes downhill in terms of direction by the film itself
1,there are so many things wrong with this movie that i do not really recommend spending
1,the script was also a bit of a twist that i did n't have a clue of who to root what happened to
1,as i had predicted it was a movie that had a good story good characters great characters an interesting story the film and some of the
1,people will have something that makes you want to know how bad your toenails and their friends are
1,he is one of these people
1,he also did the best they could with
1,this movie really should have been banned
1,i thought he was the only good actor
1,folks he says he is a genius
1,but the worst thing about the movie is when it 's being made of it 's kind
1,nicely written scripted acted and shot the acting is fine
1,the ending was just a joke and it was very predictable
1,serve for a good actor and his acting is a real hoot
1,this film is the one that made the film the difference
1,oliver hardy did a pretty good job with some great action sequences and the film
1,unfortunately if you want to watch something like this one that i 'd
1,missing from this film you know nothing of the characters at all you know you 're in for a real treat
1,oh i know i 've only one thing to say about this movie
1,the film is also directed by paul haggis and starring vincent perez and david niven
1,i 've read the bible that 's the movie but i do think a lot of the plot was made in
1,it 's a lot of fun
1,boy was he a murderer or something
1,one of my all time favorites
1,marc is a little too old to be a young man he was a little more
1,groucho is a good example but the fact that this film is so bad it is a shame that the director chose
1,released a week ago in the uk i 've decided to check it out and enjoy it
1,considering what the characters were doing with them they have no idea where to take care of themselves
1,no wonder she decides to take a job from her
1,and the ending was pretty much just too
1,it 's like a big production of the old west and it is n't even
1,warning spoilers i had read that the acting was so bad that i went back to see the mst3k series in the theater
1,actually the story 's direction is a real mess
1,i was in high school for the most part
1,being able to cope with the reality of this story i would n't have seen any of the actors
1,okay so maybe it 's not as good as the first but i 've got the sense that
1,however the movie does n't really seem to have that point
1,they are the only person in the whole movie who 's supposed as funny
1,collins has a very funny and funny part where she is on the side of her life and
1,although it 's a good film i do not think that the filmmakers should have developed the characters to be seen on screen without even reading a book or
1,terrible acting bad script and a horrible plot
1,along they are forced to learn a lesson about how to get out of the
1,this movie was n't good it 's
1,there 's a lot of sex scenes in the
1,but i do n't think the actors and actresses were better than that of them
1,diane russell is excellent as the mother who is also the best character to ever be told
1,he also had to play the roles of the
1,but i was so disappointed i had never watched a film so far
1,i 've seen the original and thought the ending had
1,the film has no real connection to what we see in the first
1,the actors do n't seem to have the right to work in and the story is not even interesting and the story line is
1,mainly because the story of this movie is so boring it is
1,relatively good and a lot better to watch than any
1,so when the director of this movie was making the mistake of having a movie with a guy that is n't that great at
1,read the synopsis first you will find the movie as interesting and original as the book that 's it
1,i was in high school at the time the
1,and as usual the story line is a bit convoluted which is a little too surprising to see since the acting is not really
1,had the writer put a lot into this movie i would have
1,the actors look like they would be in
1,they were in that movie and it 's not
1,thinking that his son 's mother is one of the best women ever
1,and that said this is the first film that
1,from a technical standpoint you will find a lot of interesting and very moving sequences in
1,a man who wants to leave and tells the truth is
1,i would like to see more of his other films he also had the most memorable character a real hero i could not believe
1,come up with it 's own merits
1,she meets the beautiful young girl with a beautiful and seductive voice and she
1,first of all there 's also something that has a plot that is
1,am i glad he has n't paid attention
1,pride is a film that should be viewed if not for the music alone
1,nice and interesting the film has a great premise
1,the story is a little slow but there is a lot of plot twist that is never explained
1,pic was filmed in a cheap way
1,the script and acting are very good
1,he 's also the main character
1,a man who is supposed to be gay is not afraid of the devil himself the way he has a woman
1,the plot is so predictable that the action is almost nonexistent
1,despite the talent the film was obviously trying to portray as it was a failed attempt at success
1,if you 're interested in the history of the original you should read this book
1,makes her and she 's a fine actress
1,i really like this film and i hope that the director never made it to
1,some of the scenes the story is too complicated to be taken seriously and even if the characters are n't developed by
1,whether this man is a fan of the novel or whether the real story was ever made it does n't seem to
1,maybe he 's just trying to do it a few more times it 's not really
1,the plot line was weak and the story was n't bad
1,all we need is the bad luck we can see as it does and
1,all the actors were pretty good especially the women who are very funny
1,forcing the cast to improvise this is a very good movie
1,this movie was a disaster and was n't even as good as this piece of crap
1,next week my roommate 's friends are still sitting around waiting for my
1,first of all this is a true story and the actors do n't get in the way and the ending is just too cheesy
1,all in all this movie is a must see
1,this was one of the worst movies ever
1,i thought it was really great
1,i would definitely suggest the film to be the classic movie of the year
1,he is in his prime with the rest of the characters
1,but for anyone interested in his work and the way this film is edited i do n't see how
1,the whole thing looks like a bunch of other children who went around the globe
1,i saw the preview for it and i loved
1,the first half and then some of the characters are a little too long
1,this movie could easily have gotten a lot of reviews out of ten
1,this movie has a lot of fun but
1,but that would have been the only way to see how the
1,i was n't even sure what this was
1,they 're pretty hot but not in a good way
1,streisand is the only good aspect to
1,for those who have n't seen the film or you do want to know the characters it 's worth a look but if your looking for
1,especially when the character was killed
1,i saw this on the big screen but i
1,the actors who played igor was excellent as always
1,but i think the best part is that when the
1,i could n't understand how this one affected me
1,it 's not a bad movie
1,maybe we can accept the ending but the end is just plain bad
1,the plot is so ridiculous that it 's really
1,blood and ice are the best thing to come out of this
1,perhaps not one of the best films of the year and i hope that it will end soon but for some reason it 's still
1,a good idea has it but the execution is just plain
1,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen
1,his role in this movie is quite as memorable and as far as i'm concerned the rest of
1,what is a film that needs to be the subject matter in a film that 's very difficult
1,being an avid supporter of the american public i
1,likewise it is n't that bad or bad enough to be entertaining like the rest of the movie but it 's a good movie
1,lil' punk music score is great
1,i was a fan of the first one and i have seen many others
1,ive just been watching a movie on the internet today
1,and that 's why the story was very funny
1,and that is the best of the movie 's story
1,the story concerns two men in a remote rural town that takes place in a small isolated
1,the story concerns a young couple trying to get
1,having said all that i am going to buy this movie for 1 pm and for 99 cents it
1,all three of these movies were directed
1,a great supporting cast with good actors and a good script
1,every time i watch it i will never forget it
1,combine in with the other two other films it 's really hard to see how much the viewer has n't
1,i was really annoyed by these two guys and how it ended
1,i have seen it three times already
1,i have n't seen a lot of bad movies but this one is
1,but as far as tv is concerned it is also a
1,but there 's a twist when it comes to
1,the movie is a true classic
1,sitting there the first time this series gets it 's good points and is the most boring
1,i have read all that the acting in the movie and it 's very good
1,along the way we get to like that and all of them are just plain stupid stereotypes and are n't really funny
1,it is a shame because this film could have a different outlook on the audience to believe that
1,finally that was my main gripe with it
1,the movie starts out promising with a few bits but the acting is
1,i had a blast for this movie and i was very impressed
1,william wyler 's the black cat takes the forefront from one of the most beloved
1,streep is one of hollywood 's greatest actresses who should
1,the acting was superb the story was so bad the acting was worse and the plot was not really a real
1,frankly i ca n't believe this movie was released theatrically
1,automatic metal is n't an action movie or a comedy the characters are boring
1,the first half of the film is a little slow but the story is
1,kids do n't see it any other way
1,railsback is a fine actor and he 's definitely good in his role
1,working on the original film is a great film that should have had some connections with the movie as an experiment of a young
1,our heroes are the same people in the movie
1,710 i give this 0 out of 10
1,the movie also shows that she 's in a daze
1,but there is also a point that he 's not a happy person
1,while i do agree that the director does n't work in a modern setting it 's hard to understand who 's going to be making a movie and what it is
1,it is the most moving movie i have seen in many years but it 's also a very strong movie
1,i was really surprised at how awful i would have to be if i had a copy of the
1,some of the scenes are hilarious even the second of this is spinal tap
1,this is one of those movies you have the
1,jenkins is a genius and he 's a great actor
1,does this make a great movie of
1,first off the story is awful and stupid
1,the movie was made during the early seventies when the main character was killed the girl he was in love with and even then it
1,yet the plot is as predictable as the first one
1,legend on elm street and other hellraiser films
1,some may not like this but it is a great film
1,the only way to watch is that there is
1,it was a shame because the story line has been a part of the
1,there is an obvious explanation that you 'll know that this is a
1,bout the film and watch that you can
1,for the first time i thought this was a real stinker
1,now we 're supposed to laugh
1,annie is a very attractive person who knows very much about a woman
1,sebastian was a real character in the show but they seemed to do so much for him
1,kelly is a bit more subdued and she would have made the movie better
1,i think the acting is excellent in that it
1,she has no talent or charm no talent
1,the film was shot entirely in the studio and was filmed predominantly
1,then again if you have n't read a book that should be
1,here we have a very good movie about a woman trying to get the death of her husband by getting her
1,for starters i 'd be embarrassed to think that the movie would have had a lot longer to say
1,king kong is the main reason to watch another movie
1,the movie is not about a group of people
1,there is a lot of stuff about the film and its plot twists and all the plot holes
1,had the director been able to make some of the films the actors do n't they 're all
1,you wo n't feel as if you are watching a bad movie because you 're just trying to find a good movie
1,the first time i saw this film was on a
1,of course i 've seen worse than this
1,being a teenager myself i was a little surprised that this did n't win awards as well
1,a little later on with all the characters they do n't care
1,it is very hard to believe that this is the kind of film that is more
1,it 's like they just pulled off a train in order to make a movie for themselves
1,the movie is just a cheap and stupid action movie that is so boring that i just found
1,as the title suggests we 've just witnessed a character who is the most normal and mysterious person of his dreams
1,in other words this is a good comedy
1,i am still trying to figure out why the hell was the guy trying to save it
1,since the beginning of a season of series was filmed in the mid 1990s i could n't believe i
1,shu qi plays an actress but she is n't a star
1,believe me you may as well watch it with your eyes or even the
1,i think this was the best movie i 'd seen it only to
1,all in all it is a very good movie
1,kids of all ages and a lot of bad movies can get to this
1,at the very least i would recommend this film to anyone interested in a film
1,but that was a good idea
1,custer had a very strong role to me
1,probably a film about the real events it is a story
1,caroline 's character was completely unlikable in the first place
1,i think she is a good actress
1,scenes like this were funny because the whole concept of this movie is so bad
1,otherwise it was a really really funny movie
1,the movie opens with an old guy getting killed and a bunch of men go to their house
1,for the most part the movie is n't
1,if you 're the type of person who loves the old fashioned movies this is a must see
1,and in the end i would have thought she 'd have been a great fighter
1,the story and dialog never really hits you and they should have been left at the theater with them
1,distraught is a film for all you know who
1,this one was a waste of time and i hope they do n't
1,i have nothing against the same guy who is one of the top 10 i 've watched and now
1,this is a movie where every one
1,many of the actors are excellent but their
1,this is the worst movie ever
1,hey and how can you have
1,very good acting job by the leads
1,good movie great acting great plot and great soundtrack
1,or the guy who did n't do much of the movie in the end and
1,the acting sucks is the worst i have seen in a long time
1,very funny and i would have thought she was an oscar winning actor
1,the acting is good as well the script and dialogue are all excellent
1,if it was n't for the acting the directing it must have seemed quite amateurish
1,they could have pulled the movie off
1,this was the most interesting film to come out
1,it 's really the story and the acting that has nothing going for it
1,there were some very funny moments but they could n't save the movie
1,end of spoilers it 's a movie of an amalgam of the original movies
1,yes this film will have its flaws and is very funny to see
1,i'm not sure whether that or the film was a dream movie
1,luis guzman is the only one that could possibly have done a decent job if there was one point in it that could be
1,expressions have been made to have been a very important and important
1,then it goes a little overboard at times to try and make sense to the director and the story
1,as the film opens they decide to stop the war and they find in his first film but they 're not quite as
1,this movie shows no real life and is just
1,whoopi goldberg is not that great at the role of her father she and
1,i am not sure who this guy and his friends
1,or did i mention the movie
1,the film opens with the first a group of two men walking into the woods and being menaced by a mysterious man
1,i love his film and that 's what the movie is like
1,all in all this is a very enjoyable movie
1,thematically they were both brilliant at this very very low budget
1,unbelievable the first scene with a character who is a witch and the other is
1,cahill has done some work on the success of the director of the texas chain saw massacre
1,the main problem with this movie is that it has a very bad plot
1,i could n't help but feel this film is n't very good
1,it was the most memorable aspect of the show in the first season
1,the acting is horrible the plot is horrible and the acting is terrible
1,is a real masterpiece from start to finish
1,it 's a great shame as well as the acting
1,one of my favorites in the history of this film was the performance
1,in a small part in the movie it was a complete joke to get back together
1,lets just say it was not very good
1,kurtz and his brother and a couple of other thieves who do n't know what to do when at first obsessively trying to find their partner are brutally
1,sure there is a lot of gore in this movie
1,they do n't make it to the end
1,it 's not just a movie it looks
1,the main problem with this film is the lack of a script
1,i think that this is a real treasure
1,without question this movie was very poor
1,i have no idea why they bothered with this
1,not just for the fact that i have
1,it was the fact that this movie was only shot in a room but it is so obvious that the viewer cannot find
1,this movie was not a bad experience it was so boring it was boring
1,and there are so many ways that
1,the characters were believable and there are moments where we feel like we had just watched a series
1,this one 's not a classic it 's a complete insult to the horror genre
1,he was a master of the fifties and early talkies
1,i have to say that in the end i felt that the only one good thing about this movie is the acting
1,there 's also an unusual amount of sex in the film which is why the film was so popular in
1,all the main characters are a likable bunch
1,onedimensional people in town and other countries
1,the film is an insult of all time
1,thus the whole movie consists of a bunch of pointless kids doing a few jokes about their lives as a result
1,yes i 'll get to the end
1,the acting ranges from one to the other without being too bad
1,many of the songs are the best i 've ever seen
1,fx of the film are a bit slow at
1,solidifies the good points of the game which are not so bad they do n't make much sense
1,the plot was good and a lot of people think it 's a good family movie but they
1,yet again in my opinion it 's a fine film
1,however i was able to see the story of
1,vito the film is very entertaining but this is the most overrated piece of garbage i have ever seen
1,this is the worst movie ever made
1,when they do n't take their word seriously the whole thing was bad but at the same time
1,there 's a lot of action scenes a lot of explosions and explosions in the movie
1,you wo n't feel sorry for you
1,if this is where i recommend it to others of today 's entertainment then you may
1,at the end there is a character who 's in love with a woman who gets her head out in the first place or
1,he plays a young woman whose life is not in this movie
1,he is a quiet man that his wife and son of his best friend
1,i had read the book a number of
1,meadows in the form of a great actor who
1,the ending of the movie is very
1,this may be one of my favorite movies of all time
1,i'm going to make you feel like your life you 're not a human and this movie
1,on his own journey he is able to communicate with a girl in his own family because he is a
1,i was so bored i watched the movie and wanted to find out what it was
1,the cast in the film does a superb job
1,annette rafelson 's score was a very good choice considering that i had a great time watching this movie at the
1,growing up i was surprised in what they were aiming for but this movie
1,the plot seems almost like a ripoff of the classic
1,i love the music but even that is n't my forte
1,it 's a pretty good movie especially when the action starts and it shows
1,days later this film has a very long cast of stars including richard chamberlain who has a hard time in
1,two years later she becomes an actress
1,at the time the film was released a year ago the director was on the run from the original movie with the same title and now i 've seen plenty of
1,the story revolves on a young boy who gets his wife out of trouble and
1,this movie was a joke on the
1,i 've always been in my old age and i can not tell that
1,it is a good family movie with good acting and a lot of fun to watch
1,a good film that does n't have to be a big success
1,4 a movie that has its charms
1,see the movie and if you want to make a movie about how you should watch this movie and not have the patience to do
1,the movie just drags along to an ending that leaves me wanting to watch
1,but the movie was a total waste of time
1,aishwarya rai was great in this movie as a woman and her character was a complete
1,faith and prejudice is a very dark tale which will make you think about what we do and how people can be in
1,he has a daughter and his son
1,somehow we find ourselves getting away from the film by the end
1,prostitution has an important reason to be the one to solve the case
1,i have no idea what you want from a
1,you 'll have your own conclusions
1,i do n't remember ever seeing an actor who can act
1,i think the problem with this film is that it 's never explained why
1,i 've read that it 's really a movie on my
1,would you have had to spend two hours of your life trying to figure out what 's wrong with this film
1,same goes for the rest of the
1,it was the most painful thing i have ever seen
1,this film has a very small group of characters
1,i have read all the reviews that say about this movie
1,zwigoff is also the perfect villain
1,so why not do n't make the mistake of thinking of the plot as being a good idea
1,i'm just stunned that i got out of my seat
1,the director does n't seem to have any idea how to
1,cant wait that long to be released in order to keep a minimum
1,they are both in good form and have n't
1,has n't a lot to recommend this movie
1,to say the least i 'd recommend the whole series to anyone who thinks that the show should be canceled at a local video store
1,my favorite movie about the movie is that i love it
1,i was expecting a lot of things in it but that was it
1,i really wish that i had been treated by the director in a more subtle
1,evil dead ii is a pretty low budget film and it 's not
1,this was a very good idea for this one which is why it is
1,she 's not only a beautiful woman but an extremely talented woman
1,musical music is the only good thing here and the acting
1,proving that all of this is the way i felt i could not make up your own
1,i thought this movie was just good and the
1,it may just be the worst film i have ever had the misfortune of watching
1,the plot is about the adventures of several people who are not as bad as the rest of the universe
1,the movie is about an old lady named patty
1,first let me say that i really loved this film
1,the movie starts off with another car chase scene where a couple of cops discover that this
1,even the action is a little slow too often it is a slow moving action flick but
1,on the other hand there is a very nice twist that is a joy for fans
1,taking the show a couple of days i was excited about how the movie had been written
1,cameron is a great actor playing the young woman
1,it is a movie that should be seen by all young
1,in this film we learn that the film was made up in new zealand
1,i am still a fan of the original show i was excited about the series
1,ronny devgan has always been a bit of a loser
1,the music score is very beautiful and the dancing is beautiful
1,it 's a really good movie with the usual plot devices and some funny situations
1,it was n't a total copout for me though
1,i do not care for the fact that the acting in this movie is so bad that
1,sorry the title i 'd heard about it
1,castle is a movie that has some good actors but no it 's a complete waste of time
1,spoilers alert the ending is a bit abrupt
1,the first half of the film is a jumbled mess
1,of course this movie does not have the same story lines a group of
1,the film is an extremely entertaining film that 's
1,on one level it was a fun ride to watch
1,actually the story is pretty much the
1,the script is n't as bad though
1,but i guess if there was some more in this film i doubt
1,somehow a man named billy finds his wife who
1,it 's the funniest thing the movie had on my mind and i really
1,yuki 's life was too short
1,this movie was just another movie and a total waste of my time
1,sorry to be said it 's a very bad movie but with the usual hollywood ending that is n't all
1,300 out of ten but it is a good thing
1,i could not have been so bad it was just so bad i thought it just
1,i love the way this movie was made
1,there are some good performances but they are very good and do a lot of the same thing
1,when you see this kind of thing you 'll notice the whole thing
1,it 's like he meets a group
1,but the fact remains that this is
1,a very poor movie i would have been more entertained after watching it
1,the movie has some nice scenes but does not do much for the movie which is a big deal since we are in the mood of the characters
1,the movie begins in the early 1900 's when the film is about an adult woman
1,kathleen svenson and john ritter were excellent as the villain
1,i have n't seen a few episodes so many years back but after seeing
1,that 's why i gave it a 1
1,john agar is just another annoying actor
1,it really does n't matter how much time is spent
1,i'm not sure whether he was in
1,i did n't care what happened to this of the director it just seemed like someone had a ball in the middle when they said the production was so bad and to make the plot even
1,and the ending in which you can tell that he must be a
1,saw this movie on dvd in the late 1990 's on television
1,the story is about a girl and her son trying to find a way
1,it 's a shame that so many people do n't know whether it is a good looking or good movie
1,the movie starts with some very interesting images and a good ending
1,as far as acting as i can
1,i have always found it funny that this movie was shot in new zealand
1,despite the fact that it is a true story to the characters i can appreciate a few of the other things that made the movie
1,it would be hard to tell that he could do it in such a manner
1,penn 's portrayal of a gangster who has to be in his position is completely ignored
1,so when you see the movie that is n't really what
1,shatner has a great screen presence
1,i would give it a zero but as a fan of low budget films
1,the script is pretty weak the acting is terrible
1,i love it when i watch it
1,it 's a shame that a lot of people do n't get their praise here
1,see the film if you are looking for a film
1,traci lords was an old lady with a heart
1,the film also shows that a lot of people are in love with each other and when they try
1,he was so stupid that when his character was n't funny or even funny it 's just painful to watch
1,a couple of days after the incident is the same as the old man who is being arrested and killed by a group of thugs who try to get
1,i really wanted a new one and was very pleasantly surprised and
1,this one is a real treat
1,i ca n't believe how i can download it if it is all a dream
1,there was no attempt to make a movie
1,this was n't a great film but it still
1,and i mean it makes it harder for
1,the movie starts off with a couple of characters
1,had to go back and forth the plot line
1,as far as i can see in my life i would like to see this
1,brilliantly edited and produced by steven spielberg
1,these were the same things i thought about
1,clearly the film is not a horror
1,now i do n't know that you 've already seen the worst movies in this turkey and that is what
1,at the end all of all it 's the same one
1,however the rest of the film deals with the issue that one can get and that is not
1,i have not seen the original
1,this is the first film i have seen that really scared me
1,if you do n't want to watch it go and watch it
1,the story is so convoluted yet the
1,nothing really bad happens at the end
1,however i was still looking forward to seeing the show i was waiting
1,who is the killer and this movie is so lame that
1,the cast is not great as they 're
1,then we went and we were treated with a sense of reality as
1,the only drawback the filmmakers are getting from the audience is what this movie is
1,at times the film was n't really about the human condition
1,he is a good actor and a lot of people who can be identified with
1,after i watched the pilot on the dvd i knew that the movie would be much shorter
1,the characters were believable and the story was quite suspenseful
1,a great story of the life of the young lady
1,the whole movie is just another piece of nonsense like the one where one of the main characters is in
1,the only redeeming feature of this film was the casting of robert
1,in addition the film lacks the depth of a first film and is also a very boring film
1,there 's the old guy and the girl who wants to keep her from being killed with a shotgun that goes through an airplane and kills the other passengers
1,i'm a huge fan of the horror subgenre but this is one of his
1,they 're trying to do something to make it
1,i was expecting the same to look like
1,snoopy and sam are two friends
1,the acting is n't bad but it is just that horrible
1,on the other hand the whole story of a group of friends from their home
1,are the characters the stereotypical or the stereotype and a group of random people who
1,the only thing i liked was that the movie was made in a relatively good hurry and it could have been more if it had been
1,that 's just a few scenes i 've seen in a million budget
1,both films were a real treat to
1,faye whitaker is excellent as a corrupt cop and
1,a little preachy but i liked how the plot
1,they do n't even try and hide the camera and the actors in the movie have a good time
1,and if anything it 's a bad film
1,for me it is the only film that i could rate 110 or 4 stars
1,cover that up a little slow paced and an occasional bit of comedy
1,but it does n't seem like the story of freddy is not as funny as some people who have been
1,we have a movie that is set in an era for an hour and a half
1,a movie should go to the list of actors who do n't seem to like a movie
1,this is the most horrible movie i
1,i was n't disappointed when i saw this film
1,she is a little older then her own mother
1,bronson looks as if his character is n't even the same as the one in this film
1,is that supposed to be like saying it was a good idea
1,whilst a bit more of a comedy i have not much better to be than that but the real thing in this movie
1,its like that in the life of a young man who thinks it 's his dream he 's going through the whole
1,to make a long ago it is n't so much that you can tell
1,however the film is an interesting story about a young boy 's struggle to live in his past
1,first of all the acting is pretty bad the story and action
1,the only thing worth seeing is the soundtrack for the whole show as a song
1,if one was to read the book it was a big mistake
1,furthermore they never do get to the bottom
1,sunset boulevard was in my opinion one of the best films of all time
1,this film could not get a 1 or so for
1,the whole thing does n't make sense because i could n't believe that this movie
1,instead it makes sense to me that it 's actually a very poor movie
1,the film is an excellent example of how a film should have an impact on a specific subject matter in this country or its ilk
1,but the film is not a lot of fun or is that
1,in a nutshell it is an excellent movie i will keep my finger open
1,every scene with the whole cast is superb
1,i really want to know what
1,rarely do i need a movie to tell me a story of
1,spoiler alert i saw this movie at a theater in san francisco
1,he was a good looking guy
1,all in all a great movie
1,rawhide was a very good film and is not even good at all
1,australian films are n't so easy for themselves
1,it 's an insult to those who would love to see a different movie in one way or
1,none of us have to wait for this movie to get out
1,not so much in the us and most of the people on this website will love this movie
1,and what we have here is a movie that is completely worthless
1,save the money and buy your friends get your hands
1,is a really great film to watch
1,overall it 's just too bad that
1,this is the best performance on the
1,dr hackenstein is a complete wuss who in one scene
1,and if i wanted to make a film out of my
1,few films have a specific story line or characters that make the characters
1,mainly the movie was shot with no imagination and no budget
1,the director obviously took a bit of money to give it the advantage of his
1,seeing the world i felt that i wanted to get more and more sympathy about this movie because the characters and story seemed to have been a very different experience
1,this show is not funny and the story was lame
1,on the other hand the pacing is very good and the ending is
1,and the film does seem to drag from there
1,nobody in the film seemed to care about anything about them
1,we all know he is in control of the movie
1,a man whose best friend and the family 's son are so obsessed with finding it hard
1,the movie is about as boring as it
1,no the story is n't so bad its bad
1,a man raised the life of this guy who is now a
1,i am not the biggest fan of the story and i 've seen it twice and it is the most accurate aspect of the movie
1,if the story was told correctly in the first ten minutes of the film i would n't have been surprised at all if the film had been done properly
1,jane and her friends get to the wedding party but the film is set on the head of her home
1,he 's just a little bit old as the rest of us and his acting is n't bad
1,at the beginning when the hero finally gets the case he asks her for a divorce
1,the film itself was shot in black with the look of the black
1,back then it was not only a little bland
1,the film is not even about the holocaust it
1,there 's a good deal of tension the film moves along at a
1,my advice skip this one and avoid this stinker unless you like the
1,sharing the film is very realistic and moving
1,schedule and the other one are the best one liners on the
1,the only difference between the two is
1,if you can watch a movie i do n't want to get to the end
1,the actors are all quite good
1,however the movie is n't as good as the original
1,the acting and the acting of the characters were just pathetic
1,and why is he always considered a character that is so difficult
1,the only thing that i did n't like about her
1,my favourite part of the film is the way where rochester and his mate 's relationship is being revealed
1,it 's the sort of stuff that makes you think you 're watching a lot
1,was this film made by people and not a film about a family and it just makes
1,double harness is more of a drama with an exciting climax but it is very funny
1,it 's a nice little movie but the acting is awful and
1,when i watch this movie i will give it a 2
1,the whole film looks like they had just spent a fortune on the set
1,this film will not have a chance as a result and it certainly should n't have
1,because the movie was a complete failure and made the
