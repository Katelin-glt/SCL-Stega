0,today he legally missed the leadership of the lost ego 'great
0,this is a little weird so the script
0,i loved this show and i really hope the
0,kevin spacey 's character makes something out of sense although his character played munro has hanging into the depths of the harrisburg films thinly veiled as he was the only one person who tries hard to keep on suckered from the romantic triangle

0,it 's truly excellent and a lot of people have seen it
0,the resolution of the main character was one funny scene with the thug stripping at the beginning of the movie but

0,the title 's prayer gears also modeled suggests character

0,anyway we do n't need to feel that the spawn was
0,it was great that she filmed media so that industry was not in the dark staircase of the firm
0,it 's unfortunate they neither made an good movie because they did n't care
0,this may be documentary by
0,i figured love it feels i went to this sort of movie but still believe it
0,if you 're a fan of the main character who is on a more straightforward level than what tng deserves
0,shot in california and is shot in the us
0,this movie is a stunning film that is completely out of place and set in real lifeand
0,how do you take a crap like that
0,yes the haka is a connoisseur of better known halls but you 're never really sure if one would put or put out of progress
0,there is no car chase sense building sequence at all at all to

0,malik is a pretty talented pianist but i advise rent the faces
0,sadly the female gender things were
0,loved the grudge series then
0,believe me it is available to have
0,regardless however the title is only soso
0,i liked weekly bw movie terribly loaded with 1000000 how it might be
0,it started by kidnapping from canadian communities
0,this movie is a rather lame remake of pepe clampett 's pathetic actionpacked socalled satire
0,strained to only ponder maybe what 's here is what 's wrong with this film we learn from
0,one user he should have managed to force her to wring notoriety
0,i think you can do better than this
0,but add me melville irene rampling woody
0,well tony soprano was the perfect tree for the hunter
0,wilbur gives it all as he recounts flashbacks
0,facts are bleeding along with what
0,the fact that it was made by an overzealous filmmaker should have been shot as one typical vice
0,this was bring us a stronger spectacle to see lemmon 's performance in a traveling turkey
0,it was good money kitty is equally talented and i ca n't help but root for her because i did her
0,i feel the same thing is a b ripoff film
0,it all gets old he gets back to albania and loses his son who is planning him he does n't go on to try
0,besides that alone we get young fred velma and even
0,i suspect that all people want to avoid this film because of the strong comments
0,even now cannot comment but i will say there was little connection between the two brothers
0,there is also a director craig lowe a comic book writer who is efficient setting and unleashes riddick 's signature portrayal of 1950s mannequins

0,i gave this that a 1 out of 10
0,he perfected exactly the possibilities in which
0,but it does n't work for
0,after listening closely into my state as a film maker i found myself wrapped up to regret this movie the acting of hilary duff and
0,the directer and writer are congratulated for what they were telling and doing the real pioneers behind
0,how could he let his buddy face out like a dog
0,d my final interpretation of storytelling is interesting but i tend biased because someday enough said 'the good
0,they hire an evil chick but during the film baby massacre kills his
0,they just rethink it but smart storytelling pushed together
0,dwight yoakam is quite adequate as carradine 's friend nick the girl that hides in an abortion from a mysterious mental illness
0,he looked like something difficult to place a man in
0,this is one of the better slasher movies that has horror fans run out of adventure one more time
0,nothing about these songs are horrible by the numbers only composers they
0,oh yeah time a movie
0,i will not give this the benefit of the doubt
0,she say he is albert einstein a drifter who murders him and shoots her

0,it 's about a bunch of college kids trapped
0,i think the actors jumping into a real knowing
0,tom v with dave stephens and
0,the producer ran for neve i give you the last ten or so many of the countless twists the scenes that are supposed to be tied up
0,homoerotic intelligence is far away from a cast of composed words without any proper dubbing
0,all three movies have been unraveled unless they are acting presumably
0,the ending is a real lesson
0,the final battle scene the scene with frodo in the old building where cameron confirms
0,the remaining portrayal of the monks whom is most deeper in basic
0,considering the usual nuance that prot was concerned he bettered tales well worked by hilarious events tattoo sparks
0,that 's not to say this is the fun
0,this is a must see
0,the untold ending takes after meeting in straightforward ways plays the role of a man who is absolutely laughable
0,it 's a complete ineffectual amateur cinema that comes close to
0,i noticed the reallife couple 82 timespace of them being
0,when he slowly opens the door with his old pal keri subzero runs down lily for a reason
0,alvin felix played fuller and the same woman who played carl was the best
0,this was all hastily shot overall and incredibly in the same thoughtful use of the actor over one woman was fairly wooden

0,i hoped that she was better than life
0,what fox found once a year and a few years on the street voyage to the masses store
0,this is called bette davis 's hawaiian film adaptation of a john

0,i will give credit where credit is due acting ethnic acting adds to the essential charm of this film
0,even the english language and style deserve better
0,it had the most blessed catastrophes that i could hope to be counted on and the real peace from the getgo
0,why about that crispin macdowell has
0,the story just appears to be like something much cooler characters start for laughs
0,yes there are cute evil women in this movie who served very well
0,usually they could act like presumably if they do eat out the corridor of so bad it 's good it leaves all of them wondering how old people can be
0,i only wasted a few dollars on this

0,his summer is changed more is the effects of pressing stunts
0,crazy is the one to read and many props to tell us of this kind of a family picture
0,there 's a slight amount of nudity and dubbing talent in this movie
0,he warps the passion and intensity of most of his movies leading up to the
0,achingly complicated scenes effected by nora and doris and their new goal under the dual sense of
0,i ordered the entire dvd offers 2 commitments to crocodile to
0,the resources look quite typical kungfu feature and its thrills or battle scenes
0,i give an indian list out of a few people ac andor lena in real life are
0,days ago so no longer exist
0,what else do they do obnoxious morons pop with the money
0,there was virtually no real ability going on the cinematography or work of a single movie middle aged to chronological meaning
0,this film is racist and should have
0,it 's worth seeing cause you can watch that version
0,after seeing it my name is adrien brody
0,it was said that whomever in the thought was sequel afghanistan really needed the pit to plug such an unconditional
0,this review is better paced and gripping than anything produced by screenwriters
0,i felt sorry for her and yet she listens to
0,i would n't have to be in the service if this was the worst part
0,if you want suspense on a original movie of such film may fall the limit of doomsday about it 's a bit sorry but
0,i think the best thing of this brain 's is that it could have been home for siamese twins with no one leg no less discipline
0,do n't buy the video has some 3d on it just see through the
0,from the first few minutes the sets gives you an outcome
0,they answer the story of the work
0,kudos to the writer and the director for purely explaining it sufferers with
0,despite the blandness of the film there is n't a strong focus to her performance
0,well thought about very little finds the fahrenheit
0,so in my opinion he is a week shallow comic comedy sporting a lot of tension the one where
0,read instance is the key point
0,as while that is in my opinion the best in the business crow shorts can do much worse than week
0,starring danny glover in a competitive role
0,it 's especially tough to find a detour film
0,with subversive overtones and meaningful '70s timing that should go to mainstream generations as exciting as mammoth 's considerable edge of
0,the atmosphere builds up nicely yet the momentum of the material between the more impressive
0,and there is a completely unnecessary storyline twist that ends almost as if it were directly reproduced as in a tornado act
0,eddie murphy 's character just lacks knowledge and
0,as has been mentioned then came the writing was horrendous
0,they produced having done more then a teenager 's musical
0,whilst passing to the vip before the highest picture the movie starts as rock 'n roll bart joan gets married and end it into
0,his mannerisms seemed melodramatic and he seemed fixed expand more on his own mostly cunning murder from evil ways in terms of his boring reactions
0,so it was definitely just another prosaic rts movie and if i still watch hobgoblins sure it 's not worth seeing it
0,she asks her not to take things by surprise
0,the scene where they probably probably work reluctant in the worst of them both and the loud prints of the black hick gangsters
0,the book was exceptional as is the story
0,of course lots of originality was not used to create major change especially in light of machines in this film
0,i fail a lot to watch the show religiously because if you pick up the section of the side structure you should look exactly where the series ends
0,but of course that 's a mere explanation for this film but it is how the topic of the first movie
0,the bear is played by ralph richardson who 's dreadful as the abusive and chubby adversary who
0,walking the white doctor has some fantasy what has you in
0,lucy 's initial fate is not on any points here either leaving her lady
0,there are little changes or quotes from most other people but this is a very beautiful movie by driven dreary animation lovers
0,having just finished my review of this movie dreamworks had no idea what it is except to tip two new sources for its acknowledgment of
0,and we never see a family in this world
0,then again she does everything just in time and this
0,five michelle yeoh 's strong charm as the harder character could really come up with her own
0,all in all you have your head messed for this movie
0,the monsters were campy seeing
0,reading the original conan doyle and his others and for those who like it do n't see it
0,drivein sex scene out of the oven collector falls down the chimney then hits to everyone in his head under the shower on the scene
0,coonskin defies a doubt wherever god of science fiction and other critics have subjective connections
0,i'm betting surprised that neither is a scene that really so caught in seeing gleason walking around
0,i ca n't wait to comment on imdb and reviewers get to see it on how we
0,they should have put a wider for children then
0,this movie is a total waste of time energy and effort
0,the direction is excellent although it does sometimes have the budget of having a story of a oneman 's band who try to disguise that george 's salary
0,there are some scenes where lite monks are preparing to escape wounds and positions fall at the
0,believe attack or diamond in by the 2 drunks of the overall arm is
0,so do n't get me started on the
0,also the police chief should give gangster movies any credit
0,this encounter during the movie plays that part which horribly contrasts parts of the story such as the taxi or the elevator which we know the air so much that the scene is seen as the
0,i'm going through construction general cinema clich that other than the racist jones
0,it 's not a heck blair witch project
0,that has to be the most wholesome of the roller coaster to watch as many have insult me
0,a film that is still dull but tone twists and turns
0,the judas brothers are an obvious metaphor to boost an airplane
0,such a allpowerful story has been told
0,the lighting seemed to be i thought this was which jagged almost
0,the concept behind the movie made me laugh dont even programmed to pay attention which i guess
0,what keeps him a secret for him is fiona 's character gradually goes to a new home as a family
0,i knew it was going to be more interesting but alas this does n't get much more dialogue than that
0,the main story is about as bland as a typical hollywood
0,the school in which the young hippie was tortured and denied her dad to have a child 's
0,the first half of the film is
0,it 's remarkable but its forgivable
0,of course these would n't really be an actionoriented modern field falling into the this template
0,this is about as difficult as i have ever seen before the great acting acting acting
0,from the novel was hit by major maryland as a result
0,and wholly kills horrid ladies from a really awful movie
0,i believe that someone might make a pop culture that feels spontaneous of
0,it provided an interesting look into the world of postwar urban european literature
0,the comparison with burt hills cop in school and the film 's charm sets a straight up love story of three adolescent american in paris
0,even the richest ungrateful fans is the greatest thing ever made
0,this moves completely off of wild stories and ridiculously squashed and thoroughly infuriated lunatic
0,this film was obviously made for world insurance
0,hollywood seems to operate many stock footage
0,the buttocks is clumsily staged by the book as well
0,sheba milano appeared on them and her santa claus was remaining far behind the mask
0,turturro has a cute moment in this movie showing the gents with
0,the permanent the writerdirector pairs them to appreciate the balance madness and excitement reminiscent of brokeback war 22 of them
0,i heard that for an hour and a half i was so irritated with all of this other weird films
0,after the new season of sharpe the gap between 800
0,either way i should team up well not like it is but the three camera angles are
0,so a film of protagonists and showcases dance routines at the time
0,i do n't normally enjoy gentle movies
0,see this if only i could forgive
0,there are in the audience some of the actors are mesmerising
0,this film does not even come close to being successful as a feature
0,this woman is clearly used physically moving is apt but her doll did not come
0,throughout the film goldblum portrays a rather cavalier cop with confidence
0,a viewer that deals with the unwritten and psychological aspects of new jersey for the corrupt people talking about several things but
0,the devil was so bad that it looked like a batman film about the animals walking around the sound of their wrists on the soundtrack
0,maybe he should just reconsider that question
0,the film ends with rishi in a
0,there i call a soldier dragging an lp and dish on number that said expensive about all the evils he has on his
0,in this case toni collette has him surrounded the game possibly recovers
0,colee daley appears as trixie 's ace maid rich to maintain her preppy lips
0,the adult relationship between luke and jimmy was pretty desperate for
0,and if you ca n't find someone who thinks that all really bad movies can be
0,as it stands it has been blurry lately but critically closed to the point of the film audience
0,she even had her own career just does n't make sense by today 's standards
0,ms hernandez seems to realize that
0,you know this to tell you that you have watched you figure at war times that
0,the special effects of the sopranos are quite frankly good

0,the movie seemed corny as it was obviously based on the terror of the original book
0,but looking back on how good the show actually turns out to be

0,why are people still doing this
0,by the end i still feel ashamed at the acting
0,pesci and rodriguez both have a look
0,but he is a mean actor and
0,connery does an admirable performance as the duke of notre dame
0,the movie without much pauses yet we see that it takes this comment
0,mike myers is also excellent as the psychotic kid and hackman is
0,among other scenes did you see life in different areas of paris and it does mock pg cgi scenarios and moves when they 've seen the same stage technical revival it

0,watch it and you 'll need to get the
0,now a bigger forgettable human being has paid bucks to mouth this in the process
0,the animation was fine the sets were great and the storyline was intriguing enough
0,i bought the movie for an afternoon of the theaters
0,apart from much i agree on the script the writing and direction is
0,how many digital shots of production has you ever said from the swim
0,not sure if our heroes are appropriately young or not
0,beefcake back in either way with gena rowlands
0,there is one unique thing clearly to satisfy and plate the thief
0,while at many points it has probably never been yet sexually inadequate
0,i first saw this movie at a test clip in my friends and i have a dinner room on it
0,it is just a giant joke right
0,the character in the hardened ng sex scene from the crypt is
0,to say that i feel more b or bowel over blue not bloody horror 'get me at all to
0,as many weeks for movies with consummate use of merriment however we glimpse the
0,big wow as i recognize that you can tell
0,the digital effects are so bad that whole that sequences do n't even have to go through the camera and lighting
0,instead of trying to put guys in love
0,they seem to be to bring out a lot of humanity
0,the other invasion made me want to know what 's the killer
0,that 's exactly enough to make it hilariously enjoyable because it woven historically into the marsh perfectly
0,i had a sick looking past before watching bmovies like myself the highlight of it
0,give him a script the head and ready for filming a visual load of clichs that hurt him all and more so no further
0,if you want to see some action and holiday movie which in this form makes jokes
0,even the most dreadfully embarrassing stalker dynamic scientists and bumbling
0,this is where i really regretted the movie all in all and it was almost overall the real event
0,this was another masterpiece filmed after the 1950
0,and the publicity is for someone to chase a scare for the hitandrun
0,first of all if you view madonna 's body you do n't have to
0,i doubt all this will be put together but wo n't indeed shock too hard on the viewing i
0,this film will be perfect for anyone who likes modern science fiction

0,this is one of the most famous films ever to hit the silver screen
0,i grew up watching a preteen goth female being a prostitute
0,the electric helmet and wisecracks are a highlight
0,if you are thinking of fleshing out after laughing when id all messed up in
0,the dialog were horrible and amateur and
0,inspired by the ferocious brute with axe looks and
0,i wanted to be tried to sell that and a friend in my power to watch the film because it was even worse
0,is to say a little about glimmers that is wrong because the creature is everything
0,the characters somehow supposedly end up being believable characters
0,this is not how embellishments can be salvaged from many

0,amazing every viewer remark if you tune
0,i think they market a film on the r1 story line with available gershwin making a buck who had gone in search of production line in cinema or bye alfonso sinatra 's novel wholly
0,it is more a film about the rather overdramatic story structure of a bygone era and a rare fact indeed
0,montgomery and cruz add to the suspense and terrible twisted chemistry that is blowing off fight
0,the movie was made dumbed down even more compassion than in this movie like brazilian blockbusters
0,i absolutely love war movies while this one is the worst
0,impressive storyline in its concept needs special effects better than the rejected arnie works
0,however the swat team fuels the match to wars in the neighborhood
0,it wraps a very complex movie on the set up and works in the right place with its story lines and characters
0,i saw swipes at the jackhammer from a thousand pills and
0,i hope they make a dvd on different parts and better copies are soon seen
0,it 's sad to see that this body was in relentless
0,all this movie fails on the levels of chaplin and i did n't see the happening plot
0,i kept waiting for the dvd to come across it 's subjects they made extra actions
0,and of course her disguised as france could have been written directed if involved in the academy of human rights like the germs she was put

0,the plan might have really made this geeky career have a lot more money
0,effectively that people who did n't think they can be a really great horror movie is nice to see but these characters
0,the costumes are low quality but there are still some near capra red up to the ending
0,it is so formulaic early on that the viewer has the time because luminous ends of fear
0,from helen mirren to 1969 very different from during i have found all the young actors in the movie elsewhere

1,i love movies that are so bad i was n't convinced of the characters
1,i do not understand the point
1,charismatic young woman who has a severe past in order to gain the inheritance of being a prostitute
1,technically it 's like that a bunch of teenage boys are being stalked by two guys and an old lady
1,adeptly filmed in black and white it is the color of colour and the music enhances itself
1,the plot was ok but there was one problem for me
1,it has the power to get a little over in the end but the movie never rises above that
1,this movie has a very good plot but is too short to handle a lot less
1,david lynch 's cinematography is quite stunning and the locations are great
1,i ca n't believe he has such an awful career as a director
1,they all do n't have a whole
1,with some other flaws the film is not the standard type
1,like a tv cartoon i do n't even think it 's so bad it 's funny
1,thomas brooks is the only real reason i could have imagined this movie
1,whatever he did this to be a bad movie i ca n't believe that this could be a great movie for the
1,if you want to see a good movie that is not a
1,do n't expect any kind of story of the
1,i thought this had been done as though he
1,i do n't know if i do n't get a lot of screen time in these films but i 'll give it a try
1,one would think that the two women in white suits are being interviewed in this film as well as their talents
1,a good portion of the movie is that it is n't even funny
1,the movie starts as a series of events from the book of the
1,i was also disappointed that i actually enjoyed the movie so much and wanted to see the sequel
1,if you are interested to see an original story of a woman who goes back and forth in the middle of a forest or something that you need to be moved to do
1,and when there are no other characters i have found it
1,long term to a man who 's a woman
1,the ending is great with a little bit of drama thrown throughout
1,anyway this film is pretty good
1,as with all films i mentioned the trailer is quite a bit too much to
1,like the original was a very enjoyable little movie that had a great cast
1,no one knows anything of this caliber except for a
1,the film also is somewhat different from the previous two movies which is pretty good as well
1,i really do n't think they 're going to have the rights to the story
1,the script does not work but the actors deliver
1,it 's as though the writer and crew decided to put it on the whole it 's shot and just as the
1,i saw this in the early 1990 's on cable tv station in
1,let me say that i did not enjoy the film until
1,she is also a fine actress and
1,fear of the evil dead is one of the most entertaining of the series
1,interestingly he 's not a very nice person in the movie
1,a real gem for all the great artists
1,the movie is a real treasure
1,he and his partner are very well done and the
1,i do n't believe this is a good thing when i say it 's just an action
1,the characters seem like they were written by an entire bunch of actors trying to show the life and the audience
1,theres lots of fun but nothing remotely special
1,i had my reservations to the end
1,he has to be one of the funniest characters of his entire career
1,some might argue but this film will be more fun than a lot of
1,what i did like about to be the film was shot over a weekend in the woods
1,just like i did and was n't a film critic who did not even care about the story
1,overall this may not be like a
1,if you 're going to watch this film do n't worry about the plot
1,notice that if i was a little bit sceptical
1,it 's a good movie a bit too
1,only one good scene was when we are talking to a character that
1,it 's a shame that many viewers have
1,or the fact that it was made for years to come to a climax of the
1,my friends were just sitting back watching this movie
1,last a long time ago in hollywood was an ardent success that is
1,some people have criticized him to be able to do anything but he does n't have a lot of talent
1,i really enjoyed watching the movie in the beginning and the only good parts were that
1,this one is an excellent film worth
1,and it did not help that the movie
1,just to name the plot twist is not a surprise
1,smith the film has no substance no real suspense and no real
1,who is that guy in the film
1,dj vu is a film that i can watch for about 90 minutes and it
1,but in the end it did n't even seem to me
1,110th street is about a guy who tries to kill his own
1,i thought this film was a lot worse i have a problem with the film because it was filmed in black and white
1,than all the people in the cast do n't seem to care at all
1,lightening is a classic example of how the media of the
1,just because i saw this movie on tv in the first place just fell flat
1,may not be this is a movie you are not going to do as one of the most beautiful but also of
1,it does n't take long to build up any of the
1,reducing the first two in their film to be seen for its entirety is the
1,and what we do n't get to know
1,the story is about a group of friends who work in a mansion together to spend two days together at an isolated cabin
1,one of the worst movies of the 70s and nineties
1,no one will get excited by the
1,the acting is ok though and the acting is pretty good although i am looking forward to seeing
1,the main villain with a bad name is the one who really loves
1,i have seen this movie countless times so i can watch and laugh
1,overall the film is well worth seeing
1,the only thing you get out of it is that it is a great deal of fun
1,just another bad movie about the worst days of our lives
1,it does n't really matter and is pretty damn lame and is n't really as fun as it was used the
1,if you have to watch a movie to see a good story or just have good characters do n't make your own movies
1,this film is a good example of how a
1,being a huge fan of the book i was a little sceptical about what was the worst movie
1,it 's a movie that is n't even remotely funny
1,it 's a very good movie for anyone who loves drama
1,hope davis 's talent to make a film like this makes the most of
1,compared to many others i know the difference between the old and awful and good is
1,how about the fact that this movie is only a very short film
1,it 's a really bad movie with no real reason to waste time watching it
1,do n't go see it yourself if you do have
1,after reading that i had seen the film that was the case when he died the film did not really work
1,dick is the best thing about this movie
1,and the film 's ending is n't very much and i think
1,we 've just begun to watch this
1,watch it you 'll never hear of it again it has no redeeming features at all
1,the story is about a man named ned 's wife who is sent from a mental asylum to the house
1,occasionally the film has a very strong cast that 's both good and a bit like some
1,sadie is on board a woman
1,you know nothing about the story but rather than the plot line
1,a must see and a very nice movie if you want to see
1,but as an avid viewer who is interested in a movie that has a strong message of how a film
1,if i 'd seen the movie and read the comments for the movie i'm sure
1,like most of the other commentators of mine in the cast the film is so
1,so when the story gets told and the
1,if you like action films and the original then look elsewhere
1,set in a small hometown on the us cruise are a group of archaeologists who is stranded in the south and live lives
1,her husband and wife are the only things to learn the truth about their feelings and their behavior and the way it
1,not that there 's any chance to do that because he 's a real person
1,they are in all likelihood of the best
1,you could almost see the director 's intent as a director
1,thorndyke the man 's mother was a little too sweet and
1,but then this movie will get you thinking
1,every character is a stereotype and has a strong sense of humor
1,but he has an unusual talent and is just right from the inside
1,unfortunately the film just feels nothing like what it is
1,the characters that are the ones i have always read about are all great and that 's
1,no it 's not a good movie but it is worth seeing because of the way that
1,marvelous music score with songs and a score and a very nice score
1,in the last scene when the young girl appears on the screen in front of the camera he looks like an old pro
1,1 what a great movie for a movie
1,in this one there is very little action to satisfy and is
1,the only way to give it any extra credibility is that it does n't get a 0
1,it 's very hard to believe such a poor cast of actors could be involved in this travesty
1,the acting was n't bad and i liked a lot of her acting and acting
1,this movie really is n't for a movie fan
1,the story was n't as good as it could have been
1,unfortunately when the movie ends we feel the need to leave the cinema and do not have much of an impact or even for
1,tom 's dad is a very good actor and a great actor and is very likable in
1,it 's a movie for all ages it is a real stinker
1,the plot is a little confusing and the ending is n't really very good but it just
1,basically i have to wonder how the director would choose the director 's name to this film
1,it was an okay film and i really dug out of the tv guide
1,hey the characters are so much different with
1,you can find that the producers are not going to be able to create a real horror movie to tell them they 're good and have enough of
1,of course i have a very low point of view on the whole movie because it is the
1,a few minutes into the dvd this movie is not just bad
1,or the guy who is a bit too busy to notice and sympathize with the others
1,ironically a lot of these people can
1,in short an excellent piece of cinema
1,i 've been a fan of the original but i am sure that he 's trying to
1,look no further than a real piece of paper
1,i do not know whether he is a fan or if i have a fondness for the subject of the whole show
1,based on a true story this film is a true story and that it has been directed by michael bay which was
1,jude law is a genius and i liked her
1,and of course it is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,oh yes he is a real hero
1,this was the worst attempt at a serious comedy you 've
1,in a way that is so rare that you have to see it
1,over the last few weeks i watched all the other episodes and i
1,kathy bates is a wonderful actress who is also underrated in her role
1,that would be a bit if a few scenes were cut into an
1,as far as the production value went it was a decent flick
1,of course there 's a reason why some people may like this movie as well
1,he is a great actor but he has such charisma that i ca
1,all in all this one is just a great movie that is worth seeing
1,major spoilers i was impressed with the end of the movie which was a little too long for
1,they do n't know much about the plot but i guess that does
1,the movie 's message was that we could relate to our heroine in a good
1,what is the deal of this
1,director robert de niro also directed the film with the big name cast
1,think this movie should be a warning to anyone who 's ever been involved with a movie that is
1,they have not yet gone back to
1,background noise has been given away by the use of the fword and it 's not even scary
1,these guys have to go on to make a movie about how they want to use
1,more likely you will have trouble sitting through this movie
1,then he says something like no other person can ever say
1,captivating and exciting movie with a nice score
1,this film is a travesty in how to get the worst movie of all costs
1,i am ashamed of this movie as it is
1,dubbing sucks and not so special as a tv production
1,note the music which is also very nice
1,the first part is n't that bad
1,the plot is simple and full of holes it 's so poorly written acted and edited
1,city of god is about a man trying to save his soul in this attempt to make his friends as a
1,there 's a scene where he finds in the bar of his family 's car accident and
1,now they are trying to make some of the same characters the one who 's played by stephen baldwin in the film that was supposed to be funny
1,is n't it just a stupid movie that was n't
1,one more thing that i thought is to give us
1,in all this is a classic and a must see
1,the ending which is also a bit unsatisfying and the ending is a bit
1,many of the actors and actresses had their own careers on this
1,le jour has some good moments the story of how a
1,this was one of the few films i saw in my lifetime that i
1,little girls are supposed to be a problem to me that
1,anyone who has anything else to do in this film is not very good at it
1,with such a great cast it was hard to tell who was the real star
1,i have seen many other movies with lots of bad dialogue bad acting
1,still it 's a good movie for kids
1,it 's not even as funny as it would have been if i
1,firstly i 've seen quite a lot of movies in my time
1,i have not seen the movie in a long time because it 's a very poor effort of the original and only because of the
1,there is a very dark atmosphere of the film and it is very very creepy
1,i 've seen it over ten times and i have seen it three times
1,and the whole thing really got worse and worse as the movie
1,jack 's love interest and his girlfriend love
1,the only real gripe that this movie is that the script is not so good that we get to
1,i think this show really is not a big deal in the world
1,see it or read it and save yourself the agony and watch it
1,scarecrows and cats is a good movie that really shows that
1,i did n't really care about anyone in this movie except for his family
1,a few scenes the director 's death on the boat is a real treat for me
1,two couples are invited to find that they find that one girl 's family has been murdered
1,but i guess the real reason why this was made is due
1,if you know the story about the real life it 's the first time ever
1,this film has a very funny scene where the killer goes on a rampage
1,so the audience is left to ponder whether you have a clue about the story or the plot
1,on top of that the actors and actresses are not a complete idiot
1,michael ironside plays a guy who is sent to the mental hospital of a deranged killer who wants to
1,as a result you ca n't help but be disgusted and entertained at the same time
1,christopher walken gives a stellar performance
1,why did the farmers have to be taken by people to die for them
1,of course if you are expecting something interesting and original this movie is a treat and a must
1,it is a good movie with a
1,they have a big ego on their
1,it was just a little more than it could be
1,almost every other scene is the one where the main character goes back to see the girl
1,hopefully i have to write a review about it on a good note
1,i was very disappointed by this movie
1,the film was a waste of time and money
1,being a very good director i have always been a huge fan of the series and this was a good
1,he is an interesting character but not as bad as the one
1,as the movie 's opening half begins this flick is an exercise in logic
1,in the end the movie is too boring
1,tim robbins is the only reason i can find this film
1,the film is a very poor imitation of the first of the two entries
1,even the acting was pretty bad
1,for some reason i had to turn it off but the plot was pretty thin and
1,however the story has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen
1,i have no words that there was a certain plot but this was so bad that it could n't have made sense
1,unlike the first movie the characters are very realistic the situations are great
1,during the second half of the film the audience feels the sympathy the characters have going through to the end credits
1,the story is very simple and has great acting and great timing
1,this is not just the worst film
1,davis 's first film is the weakest of her
1,you ca n't blame a movie that should 've had a stronger ending
1,you 're the kind of person who just wants to watch something that 's all there is
1,it was not a big deal that the movie was a bit of
1,their only true purpose would be the film makers and the film makers who were making
1,how is that all that ever happened
1,the actors did n't look much alike but they made it a very good movie
1,sure you know that you wo n't see it but you can watch it
1,the director does not know that it only cost a 2 hour
1,i would like to see a more convincing movie with a great
1,but in this case it was all a
1,the only thing you can think of is the fact that a movie is made and so is the last
1,that 's where the end comes in but when i found myself wondering how i could get that kind of
1,and then the whole thing ends
1,instead they make an endless mistake
1,robert deniro 's direction is so poor the script is so bad and that the
1,towards the end when i thought that it was a drama it was a complete
1,nick and the other tenants go to the woods to be killed with little care and have no friends in the woods
1,one of those is the story itself which is n't as exciting as some sort of action film
1,anyway i would n't want to see a remake of the movie
1,i have not seen the movie before but i was surprised
1,i 've always been a fan of the genre and am so happy to see a
1,suffice it to say that the characters are all over their
1,well this movie could have had a lot better if there have been a 0
1,i was n't expecting much much much at all and was n't a huge part of
1,a couple of friends have been killed by someone who has their eyes smashed in a house
1,i was lucky enough that the movie
1,and i 've seen it all it 's probably the same damn thing
1,he is a young man who has no desire to be found
1,i could n't help but laugh
1,plot is n't quite as interesting though the acting and cinematography are very amateurish the plot
1,he did n't know that to the point of his career that he was
1,and this is a very funny scene
1,as it is we 're not all that really good
1,he is a very beautiful woman
1,such a movie can be so difficult of watching in a movie
1,same old same old same old man is in
1,we 're not a big fan of bad movies but there
1,after a while i thought i was watching a bad horror film and that is a waste of the talents of christopher nolan and jason robards
1,britain was a good year for a british movie
1,but there is something about the characters that make you feel like you 're
1,and then i realized my wife was so stupid that she did n't really
1,it has all of all but it really has a really good plot line and it has some nice twists
1,as i was watching this i was hoping for an interesting twist
1,the script is also filled with a very clever storyline which
1,susan sarandon is perfect as a young woman in her thirties and one of the best actors ever assembled
1,because that 's what it is all about
1,yes and the movie does n't have a lot to say about this film
1,title character and all others involved in this film
1,a good movie for those who enjoyed
1,where is the girl who does everything to her
1,what i did n't like about it was that it was not about a child who just was
1,we know a little too much about the characters and they are more likable
1,in fact there is a whole lot of people getting out of this mess for no apparent reason except a few minutes later
1,julianne moore is very nice as an old woman who 's been involved in the death of a beautiful woman who 's a little rough
1,you know the ones that you will have to play but are they
1,it 's a film of a film and it is n't really
1,although the movie is a little slow and over the top is too much and the overall story was very
1,he and his wife are also a nice person
1,walker 's direction is the real star of the movie and i really ca n't imagine how people react in a different opinion than this film
1,janssen is just a bad guy with no
1,in fact i am a fan of the book that was n't really the case
1,i was also impressed with the casting
1,it 's almost as though there 's not a shred of depth in it and this has a fairly flimsy cast but they have to go to work
1,and as far as i can tell the first half of the
1,in the first movie the camera is on a very cheap looking show but the lighting was horrible
1,thus this movie was made for video
1,but the plot is so awful that
1,having not seen the movie my review is quite possibly the least enjoyable one i
1,i do n't recall anything about this movie at all but it was
1,it does n't make any sense
1,makes a good mistake about the movie
1,for starters they do n't get to do
1,i did not find the character to be
1,so the two men meet up with their son and sister and the two of
1,i had to watch this again to catch it
1,no matter how bad the production is and the acting is terrible and the plot has nothing
1,i did n't get the idea and the story is n't all that bad and it really makes it
1,first off i am not a fan like the one portrayed in this
1,and that is why the movie is so bad
1,one of the best films of the early 90s
1,the script was n't as good as they could have been but it does have the worst elements
1,this was a good movie and should have had some great acting lessons but
1,but when i watch it it 's a good thing as long as i could get it on the dvd it made me a laugh
1,i did a little research during this film
1,he does not know that they are trying to stop the virus but they have n't been able to stop his death
1,he is a little less realistic and the way
1,i love this movie a lot and it 's one of the best movies ever
1,a great example of how they are going to have a different movie in my eyes
1,and i was able to predict the difference between the lines and the story
1,his friend 's father played by george brent is the first of many crimes of the film
1,this movie is not funny and not funny
1,i think this is one of the best in the series
1,i think he should be proud of
1,you 'll feel it 's a fun thing
1,those who think that a decent movie has been done it is n't
1,how can a movie like this have made it to the
1,to begin by the fact that she was in
1,mary astor has the same expression as the lead
1,the story is n't the best but the acting is pretty good
1,it 's not worth a chuckle
1,but the whole film has all the elements of an original twilight zone episode
1,although the plot was somewhat weak it has some pretty interesting characters in it too what we find in the novel
1,what the film needs to make is a bit of a mess
1,being a teenager i thought i could find the film in my library
1,this movie is not that great but it is
1,really it has its funny moments but it is still a good show
1,that is what it is all about
1,when i saw an interview with my girlfriend i decided
1,however they are still very interesting
1,despite these drawbacks it is one of the finest shows ever
1,seagal 's a good actor but his portrayal of a criminal is a good one and he 's a big star
1,unlike that part of the original series there were n't many of them
1,the plot is so lame that even the actors are so stupid that you just could n't feel for it
1,at least that 's not enough to carry it
1,in fact it is a shame to see an australian actor like this one in such a role
1,poor directing and editing make a movie a bad movie
1,i had read the other comments on it and thought that this
1,samuels is a good actress but she does not have enough to do it in her
1,samuel l jackson 's performance is absolutely awful
1,i do n't have to agree with the others that do n't read this film
1,personally i think that the characters would be more convincing
1,in fact it 's a very simple movie that i think you 've seen on the box office
1,of course i do n't agree with the critics i know what was going on for those who were in the
1,i saw some of them on tv as the movie was a little more interesting
1,they do n't have a chance to kill a guy who they do
1,far more than enough you 'll be able to suspend disbelief for this movie to
1,here we are left with the fact that it is only about a young man who goes out and a guy who is a man of the church and does n't have enough trouble with
1,this time the actors are very interesting
1,i really think this was a very low budget movie
1,the only good performance of it was a scene that was n't really bad at all
1,somehow i was left wondering if i was watching some serious drama or was the director trying to get some real
1,i think there was a great deal of violence in these guys and their children
1,none of the performances in the movie
1,the film 's only drawback is that its so far the truth of the film is
1,its a pity that you ca n't do a sequel in which this is made in the
1,i could go on but you know that 's what the whole movie is and that there 's a reason that there is nothing good to make
1,this film has some good moments and funny moments but it is also rather dull and it really is n't
1,being the film maker who was able to convey the character to
1,a couple of the characters and the story just drags on and on and on
1,this movie is a must see for anyone interested in their music
1,the movie has very few funny moments at all but the jokes are so stupid
1,the acting in this movie was terrible
1,some of the scenes are funny but at least that 's what is being used
1,story a woman is kidnapped by a very
1,despite my negative reviews from the reviews i have to be honest about how bad the whole show is
1,red skelton is a wonderful comic actor that
1,it has a great plot and a
1,there 's a lot of action in there
1,the movie is about a man who loves his friend but he is the only person to be killed
1,they both had an interesting storyline and were able to pull off
1,but it does n't make a whole lot less sense
1,misty mundae is a fine actress
1,sister and son are sent back to the family to get a little too old for the kids
1,i ca n't imagine anyone in the theater and there is a lot of great things about
1,some of the shots seemed to be filmed and edited by the
1,some of the scenes between the characters were particularly touching as well
1,it takes place in the desert
1,the acting is poor there are worse effects that are better and the script is a bit over the top but
1,to call it a comedy would make a good movie to watch
1,the acting is n't bad at all although i did n't like her in it because she had a very good chemistry
1,as it turns out there are the usual suspects and other scientists
1,so we have this series on the shelf and
1,soon the movie starts to get pretty close to a real life story
1,and it 's pretty hard to imagine how she did it so well
1,the movie had very long potential and i was impressed
1,and i do n't believe that the filmmakers are doing this
1,stop the job from your job for a fun movie on this
1,and the movie is n't bad
1,and as i watched this i could n't help but notice why the film makers decided to use all that
1,this movie is one of my alltime favorites and that 's
1,now he 's a big fat man and it is obvious that he would have made a big deal with a man to make the life of an insurance company but the rest
1,anyhow there are some good parts but the movie fails to entertain and the film is pretty much a bore
1,there is no real plot or tension just like the rest of you
1,he 's the only person he has in the world who does n't make a living
1,whoever decided to do this film was a
1,it 's not funny but i think
1,sidenote the movie is n't really about the action or
1,supernatural sex is what makes her a little more interesting
1,in the end it makes for great entertainment but the only flaw i can give is
1,awful script and good directing make you want to see
1,and it really did not work
1,if you do n't believe that if you want to see the action you will find that the characters are stupid and the story is stupid
1,the movie takes a long journey to a
1,but what really struck me about the movie is the way they tried desperately to get it
1,the movie begins with the girl being raped by an older man who just is killed and the girl who kills him
1,and the film has some wonderful scenes and some great music
1,why not do it for the rest of the world
1,i'm not exactly sure what the appeal of the movie
1,already the film has a different feel to it and it makes for an effective viewing experience
1,for this it is one of the best i 've seen in ages
1,but as a matter of fact he 's not really
1,a couple of days later she 's the best girl in town
1,do yourself your own favor and check it out
1,we see the first of this movie and then the viewer and the other half
1,veronica 's character is not the same actress she played her mother with this film and she did n't know
1,wagon apocalypse is a classic example of the latter and it certainly is n't
1,it 's one of the funniest and most touching movie i 've seen
1,the film also has a fairly unusual story of a young woman living on
1,so the movie is a mess about how to get a job of being a cop in order
1,fortunately his work has been a bit more ambitious
1,unbeknownst to a small town he has n't been able to afford a new life
1,where the sidewalk is concerned with the camera and work in a movie is the director
1,instead we got a good movie that will be
1,in the past you see the end of the story
1,she is the epitome of evil and her own skin
1,jack palance and james stewart are just plain
1,to make sure that he does n't have much to do with
1,stock footage of it is very moving with
1,as soon as the movie gets going and a few minutes on the dvd it 's a good movie
1,i'm giving this film a 210
1,though the main problem is the script and the acting
1,cruel and depressing is an intriguing movie but for
1,the only thing i really liked about
1,crocodile dundee is a film that i 'd watch to
1,i have to say it is a great show and i have seen it twice on tv and it was one of my favorites
1,if the producers were n't trying to make one of the best horror
1,the film has a certain charm to it as well
1,i 've seen plenty of movies in my life and they 're both funny and i am amazed that i was not expecting something
1,i would say it was one of the worst movies i 've seen in a long long time
1,no wonder it did it on tv
1,but the movie is a little dull
1,which is n't a bad thing
1,and the plot the acting the script
1,the story and acting is excellent
1,secondly the script is n't as good as its predecessor
1,it 's a shame on the actors so much with
1,it 's not a bad movie but there is some
1,unfortunately the rest of the cast does an excellent job
1,in the beginning he 's all trying to keep his mouth on
1,the characters are all good and this movie is a must watch
1,i thought this film was brilliant
1,as an avid reader of the genre i can see why he would
1,if there was no story to speak out or just an annoying story it would have been great
1,the plot was very very predictable but it was n't
1,i have nothing against peoples that the two lead members have made a good
1,indeed a very good idea to show off in the early 90 's when
1,the film is a perfect example of how many movies that go wrong with the same subject matter
1,yes and this was one of those movies that would make you laugh at the stupidity that was supposed to be the character 's
1,i have to admit i did not like the original
1,the story was simple but it just went wrong
1,at this stage it 's not even good
1,this is not only an indie movie it 's a good movie
1,the characters were interesting the story the characters the music the cinematography i was really
1,i do n't understand how i would have liked the film
1,the film is a masterpiece it also has to be one of the most beautiful and
1,ava gardner is a perfect actress as a teenager but in a very different role
1,war inc is just a film
1,however if you can sit through this film and make fun of these flaws then why do
1,in fact they 're so stupid that each bothering to make a point to his audience
1,next time i watch the whole movie i will be more angry that i have been in the theater and i know how
1,if there was no way of going on the road with them
1,i did not think the film was worth a lot of
1,the movie is about the life of a
1,michael is trying to make a new love with him but he tries to escape in the middle of the desert but is soon
1,one more thing the acting the script and the acting are all bad
1,along with the original film is the first film that i 've seen about the original as a child of two extremes
1,in my opinion this film is an important example of how the world 's population is still alive and the fact that these people live in a town so vividly that it
1,anyhow the only way you can find yourself the characters in the film is the fact that
1,pick out the film by using a bunch of
1,enough to make a decent movie out of a bad one
1,we have seen her in her own right yet she does not look real
1,i thought of this film in a
1,by watching this i was looking for a good
1,even if there were no plot twists or surprises the film still managed to get the heck out of
1,alyson silverstone was n't perfect for her role
1,he does n't know how to play a straight character
1,the acting is excellent and the performances in the ensemble are great and that is what this movie was about
1,i do n't know i was looking to watch this movie to be honest and i do not remember the story it 's so bad
1,people like these people will hate it but they do n't even bother to make
1,there 's no real threat to what this character
1,what 's more shocking is how many people that i 've seen this film seem to have seen it
1,the ending of the movie in the first half is quite good but the
1,or that he 's a cop and a woman at the end of the movie and they do n't make the
1,todd yam makes his own appearance for his film and does n't have a good line
1,he 's very funny and the film is
1,but the best part of the movie is how it is the director 's
1,and i did n't think it was a bad idea to start with it
1,i ca n't even say how many times this was so bad even the dumbest of them
1,they have a few nice lines too
1,yor is a man who is a
1,abhishek is the master of the movie
1,the whole story has an interesting premise as in this film
1,for me the best thing about raptor master is the acting
1,it 's just a shame he 's not in it
1,but as the story unfolds i was hooked with it
1,it 's a pretty bad film
1,we know she 'll do it because in the first place
1,in the meantime this is the kind of film that is so stupid and pathetic that i actually laughed
1,yes it 's like the bad guys and the bad guy
1,but it is a real treat to see
1,now i do n't think any man who has ever been a good person has been touched by the movie industry has no qualms but to be a genius i do
1,pitt has not made movies like this and while the first two films is pretty good it 's not that easy to forget
1,as a result it has a great script and an incredible performance by a talented denzel washington
1,but the movie is a lot more than
1,the acting and editing are bad at best
1,if you want to see the film and watch the original i suggest you
1,although he looks the part of the movie and the film 's main focus is a little jarring and a
1,we are supposed to laugh at the results but the rest of the jokes are simply hilarious
1,on the downside the show 's plot has changed from the original
1,at the end of the day he is revealed
1,halloween has nothing to do with the other two movies
1,the acting was very good and the story of this movie was great but that was all
1,hillerman is excellent and is in his element as an eccentric and sensitive person who does
1,in one of the most tragic sequences she takes a bath of the baby 's mother and her brother sitting down to watch his face in the
1,this is a classic of a film that is so bad it was funny
1,this was the most painful movie i have ever seen
1,and if you 're a fan of the genre and the books or are just interested in the original series
1,not a great film and i think that 's saying a lot for it 's own good
1,before the action scenes are shot at first you know there are some scenes that are filmed with little more than pad
1,my friends and i sat down to
1,there 's a good performance by robert englund
1,that 's not really true in the
1,the film 's premise is pretty flimsy and the pacing is very poor
1,scooby borgnine and his brother try to solve the riddle to
1,i do n't even want to see it all in a theater
1,i would n't even watch the movie again
1,the script is so simple and so utterly unbelievable that its impossible to understand
1,agar 's character has been raised as a woman and it is the ultimate love between
1,if you can figure who is the bad guy or the acting you might like this
1,i am still waiting for something more new to come but what 's even more shocking is that the film does n't make any sense at all and the script does nothing interesting
1,investigating the story of a family who can overcome their life and their relationship as an adult they are n't all that funny
1,even if you 're not interested in seeing it you 'll probably love it it is a good film as well
1,and i love the character who does n't make his life seem normal
1,nevsky has created this masterpiece that i cannot believe
1,this is one for all of you who can see a true story
1,it 's like watching a bad movie
1,the movie 's plot concerns a young woman searching for her missing sister
1,the cast is also excellent with fine performances from the cast
1,tv guide i was a bit prejudiced that it was in the first two films i saw
1,they all seem to be a bit
1,of course it 's a lot of fun to see but there 's a lot of really bad movies and not enough of it
1,in fact there was no explanation about the characters
1,in the end this is one of the better movies that the director of
1,scott wiper is the master of his craft and the rest of the cast
1,the movie starts off ok a bit
1,we have all heard from her first movie she was in her early and career but
1,in the end this movie will not be
1,what does anyone really care about this film in its entirety
1,i have been trying to find the video since it 's first available on vhs but i have to say i ca n't believe i would recommend it
1,the movie is a great example of how a film should be seen
1,before he returns home he learns of his mother 's murder
1,even though they are a bit too good for
1,big brother who seems to be involved in an accident at the local supermarket station
1,also the plot twist is very similar to the one where the two men come to town
1,i saw this movie with my family and i think
1,i really hope he has to make a sequel to the series
1,toni collette is an excellent actress
1,this movie is one of my favorite films i have seen in a long time
1,i was looking forward to it
1,probably the greatest film of the 80 's
1,if you 're interested in the book read on and then watch this
1,well the movie has the same effect
1,what a terrible waste of time
1,ok so the premise has been told in such a way but it does
1,nobody would know anything about his character or about the character but he
1,the story involves two women with a
1,all of the above mentioned by a few lines
1,8 the movie is just a bunch
1,they were all very well executed
1,the director is very good also the director
1,needless to say they are the perfect combination for the film
1,some of the lines are hilarious and if you 're the kind who thinks it would be funny then that you have to watch
1,an interesting film that could have been better had they just have had a little more time
1,they do n't want to be as good as the original
1,she is a woman from a different world
1,david carradine is a delight as well
1,in this instance she is a young actress and has no talent whatsoever
1,i think this film was a huge mistake of the film
1,while it 's not an academy award winner at all it is a rather pedestrian movie
1,too bad they had to be the most original person to be in the movie
1,although the movie was shot at a very fast pace it seemed to have been set up as an afterthought
1,the acting is n't perfect either as the acting is a
1,after the screening of the first movie it would
1,is he going to die because she 's gone to bed because
1,the main villain was a very good guy for the first time
1,it has a wonderful cast with the exception of the leads of
1,in a way she was so awful that
1,as a result the movie is full of bad points like these two characters are in the
1,set in the first few countries i can guarantee that this movie should make a profit for any film buff
1,whilst some have mentioned this is just a film it shows us more realistic and interesting
1,stanwyck is great as her exhusband but the script is n't really worth the time and effort
1,bottom line if you are a fan of horror movies
1,and the music score is n't very good either
1,arthur askey 's acting is top notch but the script is just
1,people are not even talking about this movie
1,it 's hard to understand how the director is trying to get
1,however this movie has nothing to do
1,as with all american horror movies from the 70s the movie distinguishes
1,but then the movie turns into a
1,two of the most famous actors in this film
1,on a trip to europe they have to spend most of the summer talking at what is happening
1,later in the film the two lovers are arrested from each other
1,the plot line is so predictable that you 're left wondering if the writers were trying to make an interesting
1,sadly this movie is just plain bad
1,but he 's not really that great here he just looks like a
1,the only thing that was good about this mess was the acting in the two leads
1,this could 've possibly been more of a comedy drama with a
1,the acting was atrocious at best
1,and as the story progresses we can only assume that something happened
1,but when i read the summary the film was a flop
1,i ca n't believe that this one is actually going to be on the air of the shelves
1,howard bridges is the first actor he is in and the role of the detective is very interesting even though not very demanding
1,while i was hoping that it would eventually be made available on dvd as soon as my purchase to see it i
1,the only thing this show has going for
1,some of the other actors are very well known
1,but it 's not enough to keep it short
1,it 's a movie in which to tread the story and not only do the actors make a film that does n't seem as good as they are in the first one but it was n't
1,chaplin 's film is a complete piece of crap and there is
1,other than that its a great fun
1,bringing it on a whole lot is a bit
1,the story is that of a bunch of
1,director michael winner who obviously worked with a bunch of children as opposed to
1,his brother is an american and i found his
1,even the characters are a little onedimensional
1,it 's not just a film it is a total mess
1,i'm still wondering if it was in a bad film
1,it 's a bit slow and the end result is
1,the movie is a good deal of fun that is
1,the movie 's only saving grace is its use of shadows and lighting
1,but in a nutshell and so the audience is treated to one of
1,probably the most annoying character i 've seen since he is the son
1,i really hope that the next big name of the game is the best performance
1,back then i had heard about the plot the characters
1,and the only time he 's in the film is that he gets to the police to see
1,i have to assume that this is not going to win awards for best comedy in the
1,this film does the opposite but the film is not only about the dangers of life in paris at the
1,absolutely put the cast is n't that good either but
1,the characters are n't developed and neither can be developed
1,this movie was so bad it had to be seen and
1,the story is a little weak
1,you can feel what is going on when the movie starts
1,ms de palma did a great job directing this film
1,they even made a couple of bucks in the movie industry and had one to use
1,i 've never seen another movie like this that is so bad it is good
1,you will not be disappointed because the director could n't make you laugh
1,you should not waste your time watching this piece of garbage
1,still a very good movie for those
1,i 've never had the opportunity of watching this film so
1,a very funny and hilarious movie that will keep you watching with your family
1,a couple of times and you might be wondering exactly what is going on in this movie and if you are really interested
1,it 's hard to see why a movie like this has got its place
1,gorgeous women are never shown in their lives
1,and i 've never watched an episode
1,you could have seen the first two films of this movie before and then again in a new way
1,written by a guy who has made movies with a certain level of violence it 's all that makes him unique
1,the only thing that keeps me going to the movie was the music
1,i was expecting that to be the worst movie i
1,why do the two boys go out
1,it is a real shame that the movie
1,let 's face this movie is a total insult
1,though it 's a little too long it still has a good atmosphere but it does n't work
1,the movie was made in the us during wwii and it 's a very accurate film
1,this is a good film to watch
1,dirk bogarde also makes an appearance as a reporter who is willing to spend the last ten years alone in
1,the acting is n't the best but it is great and is just fine
1,does she know that she will be happy and that she can get into her life
1,in this respect is one thing that should have been done so quickly
1,surely the filmmakers will come out with something better
1,actually a bunch of kids are killed and there is the kid who kills his dad and sister
1,what a waste in a nutshell
1,only the title should n't be a warning
1,my favorite scene is when he walks around
1,this film is a complete disappointment
1,it 's all very very good and you can see that
1,by all means is this movie
1,if only the movie had been made to work in the us it would have been
1,the film does n't do without its own faults
1,the film is also a tribute to the first film
1,but the problem with this movie was that the whole story was n't interesting enough to make me bored and bored me
1,i have to say i did n't care about the people in this film so why not take
1,first off i 've been waiting for my own life to be shown on tv
1,the story of this film concerns a young teenager named sasha and his mother
1,now i have to say that the ending was a little bit predictable
1,starts this one up on the first movie as the film begins
1,i would give a rating of 3 but
1,his performance is perfect and the film is quite good at it
1,i ca n't wait to see how
1,she has n't been seen and been released in the united states
1,but it 's an awful film and the fact that you can actually tell the budget must have been spent on
1,by contrast in its favor to the american public this film is an absolute masterpiece
1,dee snider plays it the same lovable guy
1,another scene which i thought was very similar to a tv series was
1,you can imagine it as part of a group of students of the corn era and it 's a shame as well
1,if you want a good movie to watch and get into the mood and you want to watch it you would be fine as a movie
1,if you 're into the series for your own sake and if you get into the film then
1,playing the part of one guy whose life is tested is n't even hinted at by the way she plays the part
1,i have the honor to go to see this movie in the theater
1,film is set in a city of paris that is visited by a small group of young men
1,i had not seen much of him in so i could n't help but smile out loud a few times during the movie
1,it was a real treat to see a movie that did not have an emotional response to reality
1,not a lot of other movies
1,they are n't funny and you can hear the lines about the movie
1,back then i did not see it as a film
1,although the movie is very well acted the movie is not a comedy either
1,but the film was so stupid
1,the movie follows the adventures of the young couple a couple
1,some of the actors seemed to be trying to be a little too little but they
1,suspense packed with a great script and plenty of fun for it for it 's time
1,it was an interesting idea and it was a bit of an exaggeration to watch at first
1,there is no real action and there is no suspense
1,heck it makes sense but this is a good movie
1,clive owen is the perfect choice for the part
1,only a couple of good lines of dialogue
1,so the film has a little twist in it
1,instead of focusing on the fact that the character was so popular it made me realize that the film 's biggest purpose
1,less than the sum of the iceberg i thought this show was very
1,to be honest i do n't have that much idea that a movie is about the story
1,the film starts out as an interesting drama but then the film becomes tedious enough
1,another scene where the woman was on a road trip with an axe is a little bit too brief to be true
1,sorry i saw the whole thing on this show
1,in the opening credits they are both dead and the women are so close
1,the only reason i gave it ten stars is because the acting is n't too bad i think it 's really bad the
1,the script is full of holes and the characters all act in a different way
1,this is one of those movies that
1,note that he is a bad actor who just could n't act
1,another example of the greatness of film is that it is
1,they should have had some good dialog but this would
1,on the other hand the acting was atrocious
1,naturally the film is quite boring with the introduction of the hero as a result of
1,you are the one that gets to the point where i was watching this movie at the theater and i had to watch it to find it
1,a very interesting plot and a few laughs
1,the plot of the story in itself is a little too convoluted in a nutshell but it 's still
1,in my own life the movie is a good film for its audience
1,todd 's first wife 's boyfriend is so enraged in the murder
1,that 's the problem with the plot it 's
1,it was very much like a film that was made in new zealand but the
1,but for me this was a pretty good movie
1,he has also been known as one of the best villains in
1,nicole and arthur are n't really happy together and
1,on the other hand if you have a soft spot for the first film you 'll love this one
1,problems include the death scenes where the main character says to himself as i 've
1,this one is a must see for everybody
1,vlad also is able to capture himself and his daughter
1,j carrol naish and christopher lloyd play their respective leads as their adversaries in a good manner
1,i was in awe and thinking i will get a kick
1,the only redeeming part of this movie was the fact that it looked like a big budget effort in a small budget
1,somewhat in its defense of a series of flashbacks and situations that
1,to be sure we will never get a chance to see the original play of the week but this
1,floriane 's character is supposed to be a woman
1,most people do n't know why
1,emily is on to his father 's death for a life of
1,but as in films such as this one is a good place in my opinion
1,besides the scene where he 's having his head pulled over by a giant monster with a gun gun
1,but what makes this film so interesting is how they deal with each other and it
1,i love the way that these characters are introduced and that they are so funny to
1,that was one of the most enjoyable things
1,then i had to go to see this film and i did not want to watch
1,he had his own set of movies and he did n't try to tell us
1,the movie has a very nice touch
1,i have seen better films by the same actors in my day
1,it 's not funny its just mindnumbingly lame
1,i saw this movie at about 12 minutes and was bored
1,it is the perfect example of what the film was trying to accomplish
1,after seeing this film i can tell you that i am still thinking about the
1,this film is a must see
1,if there is one good scene in the film the entire sequence is a
1,however the film was a great disappointment to watch on the box and the fact he did not have a character like a real person to be a real person at all
1,at least that 's what makes it such an awful film
1,barry rudd plays the father in a rather different role he is more effective than the others
1,and as such i can only imagine a real problem that makes the film so interesting to watch when a movie does n't' make sense of
1,we can see the end of the series as the main character is a child and his father
1,as the movie continues to go down hill from the get go it was a pretty good movie
1,from the start the story and character development are the best part of the movie
1,could have made the difference between the two and the other half of the
1,set in london at a time in the west it 's the exact opposite of it but this is a little more interesting and more fun
1,my guess is that this film was made in a hurry somewhere along the lines of the most inane and contrived
1,the story revolves around four women who live with their children and each others
1,he also seems to be making fun of people who were not happy with the ending
1,the only thing that is n't a good movie was the fact that the characters are not believable
1,rosenberg is the only one who gets it right
1,tess is very cute but her acting is so bad and over the top that i was so irritated that i could n't get a movie
1,end up being the first three minutes of all
1,it really really makes you wonder which one of the most popular of the 80 's is a great idea but it 's also a fun movie
1,definitely if you 're thinking about reading the book i
1,in this film he 's quite good and he has good timing
1,but the movie is a fun romp
1,the acting is ok but it is still great that the
1,also why was the film so successful as
1,it seems it 's a really long film though
1,dan aykroyd is excellent as the cop and his character is the best part of the movie
1,the plot is not so great it is n't a complete waste
1,the film is also about racism and the need to have
1,i have always loved the series
1,trouble is the director has a little of his own agenda in a
1,no one should have been killed
1,furthermore i was expecting a great film to find the right place to be
1,with these two men there 's a very very bad thing i do n't think in a movie with a great actor but she just did n't get much screen time
1,john woo 's first feature film made by the legendary directors of the genre of a
1,because this is just another good movie about real people
1,this film is the epitome of a movie in which the plot seems to drag
1,it is all so simple and so
1,a little too much like an american film that was n't made by the studio in the states
1,anyway the first time you see an asian movie it was filmed in a country
1,the film follows a lot of the problems and the result is a pretty tame slasher flick
1,after his initial encounter with john wayne the director decides to take his own life
1,mrs reed is in the end of it
1,at the end of it i felt the film could n't do more
1,i have to admit that i have to say that i have not seen all the great muppet films and
1,this story is not for you
1,the plot is about two couples who try to find a new life a very dangerous situation
1,instead of trying to be the real life story
1,worth watching if you 're a diehard jim
1,sarah michelle gellar is a great actress
1,drool is a fine film that deserves its prestige for its unforgettable performances and for some superb
1,these two characters and two guys who get together in prison in
1,never mind that a sequel is going to be bad
1,if i did n't know the history of the plot to a certain degree of realism i
1,so it 's not a great film and
1,this was one of the best movies
1,but i have to assume that this was the biggest flaw of the film
1,two words are not only spoken by a person who is not a very human person in movies
1,the story is about a woman in a mental hospital that goes on the run with him and she finds out who
1,used to the other side of the tracks to the point of being there are some scenes of the real rio in the end he has to be at her most annoying but the film
1,they even talk about the possibility that a group of people who have been involved
1,there 's no plot or originality or originality in the acting and that does nothing
1,but the problem with the movie is its ability to show us the true meaning of love
1,and the fact that he was not an asshole does n't make a
1,hey i did not know what he 's talking about but it 's a bad thing to see
1,it is n't the best but it certainly does not deserve to go anywhere near its
1,on the other hand the pacing is slow motion at times and the story and the direction by both actors are absolutely terrible
1,very few of these films are available on the imdb
1,anyway a group of friends who have been trapped for a
1,it 's hard not to miss the
1,as if this movie was not a little bit of a comedy it 's actually very funny
1,everything is illuminated and the ending is not the best ending
1,we are supposed to identify with these characters and we do
1,there were a lot of movies that did n't have any of the same plot
1,a good actor in the movie
1,the first time i saw this movie was when i was young and so moved the first half on the sundance
1,this is a story of how the government is involved in the making of the movie
1,then the movie starts and we see the first one of which is so bad it hurts me about everything else
1,because they had no idea why it had to happen but i thought to myself this is the worst movie you 've ever seen
1,everything is so good and the acting is n't bad either
1,kate beckinsale is a perfect choice for acting in this movie and her character is so likable to watch
1,it 's all about the plot
1,not a good idea for some serious laughs on display on the part of a young man in a coma who is
1,that 's the whole point here
1,my advice is to watch it because it 's good
1,this movie is very entertaining with great performances by some of the best actors
1,if it 's a drama that you 'd like to do and have seen it the
1,bai houston is a beautiful woman in the
1,i have always been impressed by the way he portrayed himself as a character
1,there 's no doubt that all the women in the movie are so hot you 'll be watching this film as soon as you can and you should n't
1,also it seems that the director is trying to make a sequel
1,he was n't a bad actor he seemed to be acting in the movie
1,she has no problem finding she is a prostitute
1,keanu goldberg is in fine form as a police officer and is sent to prison after a suicide of his son
1,i have seen many of them but this is the one in which
1,upon arrival the group 's mission are a perfect combination of what happened to a man and
1,this is a great film for the whole family to enjoy
1,this film is an attempt to cash into
1,to me it was a really bad movie
1,the script was written for a very limited budget but the story is too weak for a
1,since they are n't supposed to be in a movie that has no real problems to the
1,he 's the type of guy you 'd likely not see
1,the actors have great chemistry with each
1,rehan did not even get to see her in a very bad film
1,but the only thing that stands out for
1,as the movie goes on its head a film that will never
1,the whole series just did n't get any better than
1,there is absolutely nothing here for a movie like this one of which is
1,c'mon the main characters are stupid
1,i had to watch this movie to even when i was in the audience it
1,advanced commander is a terrible film of the week
1,most of all the movie was a total waste of time and money
1,officer of the train arrives with the aid of the dead body and they have to stop the fight
1,even if it was not for the movie 's characters the film could have been a little better
1,the movie 's climax has been done before that i think that the director intended a good deal to be
1,for the rest of my life the film is
1,with his character the film was a bit too slow and boring but the characters were believable as well
1,too bad all the actors do n't have this one and that one would never go beyond the rest of the cast
1,he should never have made one or
1,as for any other movie the script was very weak
1,overall it is a movie you do n't love to hate but you should
1,it 's like that the script was rushed from an old tv series
1,i could n't help but think of the film 's creators
1,there is n't much else to say
1,and it looks as if the makers took the film out of their own hands
1,have they been so successful for the role
1,fear is the best film to ever
1,for instance he does n't know what to do but the way she does this movie is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen on a daily basis
1,go check it out or if you have never read the book i doubt you will be disappointed by the ending
1,this movie could have easily made some serious money
1,i think that the plot was pretty weak
1,also in it 's a really funny scene at the end where the kids are sitting down on their heels for some time i 'll be looking at my watch
1,getting a lot of good lines to be
1,i love it when the movie starts in a very different way and i really enjoy watching a movie about a group of people fighting over a car wreck
1,the movie is a little boring and does n't have a much
1,i would n't really want to spoil my own life as well as
1,of course it 's not a bad movie or is it a poor excuse for a director
1,in this movie you have a couple of problems with the film
1,and the movie does n't have many problems
1,the first time he was at least had his wife and his baby
1,and the ending in the end is very good
1,they all seem to have a different plan to
1,if your looking for something like this you 'll get the wrong impression
1,when you do it and you think you are not supposed to be a fan of the first film there is no way the story is going
1,the film is a bit slow moving
1,the only reason i gave it an 8 was because the actors were pretty bad
1,living proof of the problem is that the characters are in need of help in themselves
1,but as far as i can get this movie i found it hard to care less about it because of
1,you do n't see any of the other two or just actors who seem
1,a lot of people who have commented on this movie seem
1,pardon me about this film the acting is awful i have
1,in the process he becomes involved in a murder investigation where his family and their friends are arrested
1,but it 's not as good as a lot of the other films of the era
1,monaghan 's character seemed to be an attempt to portray
1,however for the most part there 's no need to
1,he has a nice time on a woman who has never experienced him as it 's
1,i would n't be able to get more into the plot
1,instead of having an identical role model he is just too dull and boring to work as
1,and this film was the one for my girlfriend
1,the story is a good one
1,the first one was a real treat to me
1,so why did we have to see it
1,and what can be said is that i do n't know anything about it being the best movie ever
1,the film is about an attractive woman
1,so why did n't they just go so far to be the same
1,why does they kill the president
1,the first time i saw it i thought it was great and very funny
1,but the film has a good deal of humor in it as the movie is
1,to paraphrase a series of things for that the film was a
1,this is one of the great films that can make the book a
1,it was a really good movie with
1,the main story begins with a bang
1,it 's hard to imagine a film that made me so dearly
1,only i could n't say much more than just
1,the main premise of this film is the fact that he
1,first it 's all so predictable so devoid of any of
1,if you have the opportunity to see it on vhs please check it out
1,what was the deal with that
1,feeling like the real thing is a good story it 's really very simple that this movie is so poorly made that it 's a waste of time
1,funny and the film is about the man who is
1,the film is filled with endless cutaways which i suppose is
1,they 're supposed to show us some really cool people and
1,i was very excited about this one it would n't be much but i
1,the first half is a very stylish and very very tense thriller that makes you think about a group of girls who go to a small town
1,some other movies are very good but
1,the film was not so good in every way
1,the story of a widowed girl is just too much to ask for
1,not a film that was written by people who did n't like the film
1,a couple of hours later he decides to
1,as with all of us it 's not even that great
1,if you think you are a fan of the tv shows and want to
1,what the hell 's happened to the children
1,and it does n't even look like the
1,so what is he doing in this movie
1,the only reason i'm giving it 2 out of ten was because i thought that he was
1,i 've never heard of a movie so much that i do n't know if it
1,dudikoff is a man with a brain but no one cares about
1,if you do n't think he 'll see it you 'll probably be looking for a good film
1,the film was a complete mess of a film
1,the director had a lot of good things going for it and the acting was so
1,they have to deal with the issues of living on the road to a small town that is a little too old for an indian family
1,the plot of the movie is that there is actually
1,i think i am not a fan of either of those two films but i 've never been a fan of his
1,the only redeeming feature of watching this movie was
1,one of the best parts of this film is that the characters
1,then you go on the rampage to keep the plot line and the
1,it seems to be the worst movie of all time and even worse the bad guys do
1,some of the actors seem so real that they all have a great deal of screen
1,on the whole this is a terrible flick that tries desperately for laughs
1,i think that is the way i 'd expect it
1,someone should make more films with their own children or something like this
1,the story has a lot of twists along the way and there 's
1,i was really surprised by how it is done but that is n't what this film has going for it
1,i just do n't get it
1,find a way to be funny with you and enjoy the film
1,beautifully directed and acted and directed in a great manner it is a very moving and memorable picture of the consequences
1,they all know it 's a mystery and that it
1,in any event it 's a very funny film
1,here we have the movie with a group of friends who want to be a little better than the boys
1,it is a film about a serial killer that preys solely on the body violence the two execute them in a very different way to make this show work
1,this has to be the worst film i ever
1,the only thing in the movie that i did n't like was the ending
1,this one is definitely not for everyone
1,i have to mention the whole movie
1,and the story line is a bit farfetched
1,anne heche is a great actress
1,they have no idea about the plot in which this movie fails
1,the ending is so bad and even
1,oh yeah i was pretty surprised
1,as the movie goes on his mission to save his life from his wife and his relationship with him he
1,george c scott has a very small role in a movie like the character of benjamin and the joker
1,i was expecting a film with a few
1,after the first five minutes i wanted the movie to end happily
1,it had more to it than that
1,it 's a really funny movie but it has to be done with an extremely dull and predictable story
1,a bit of the story is a lot like a cross between a series of sketches of various stories
1,the plot is simple and interesting to watch
1,and then the last shot of the story the girl is the only thing the movie did
1,it 's a pity they never got back the original movie and they did n't need to
1,she is an alcoholic who is a man to help his own
1,i have no idea how the other people in
1,the only thing you can really notice is how the film could get a 10 out of ten
1,try and save this one if you
1,why not watch the movie with a better understanding of the story
1,ben kingsley and his crew are also quite good here
1,this is one of those movies that actually
1,i would suggest the movie to get you on video
1,it has a bit of humor and the dialogue is very cheesy
1,not even the first movie which is a great thing for me but this movie is absolutely horrible
1,the only character that i wanted to mention was in this film
1,with it being a low budget production it really has some potential of quality
1,you can watch it on its own so you do n't want to
1,i have watched this movie over and over again and i'm addicted to watching the movie and it is great fun
1,the characters and their motivations are very human and you will see some things in a film that will keep the tension and suspense of the film for those who have the patience of seeing a film
1,watching it at times i found it insulting that the director was actually making
1,after i was able to watch the film several times i had just learned it was going to be good
1,this movie is an insult to everyone involved
1,but i would love to watch such a film as so
1,this makes up for the good acting and the great soundtrack by pino donaggio
1,plus the movie has a few moments that are well worth seeing
1,the film is a true masterpiece of art film noir
1,that would be a shame since this is a movie for the masses and for those
1,the first is the fact that it 's just
1,while i am not alone at all the movie looks very good for
1,i have n't read the book nor did it intend to be
1,i would say this because of the fact that
1,first of all i like the movie but it is not that good
1,if one is interested in seeing this film and then just
1,it 's a story about two boys and that they can do it
1,overlong and slow it 's not worth
1,maybe they were just sitting on my bed or talking about how they had been
1,but it is not a movie and it is a complete lack of originality and it 's almost a complete piece
1,unsurprisingly the film does n't hold back much to
1,czerny and his men were a real treat and i was
1,a little more of a plot than it would 've been a rather bland plot and a very interesting plot
1,i am so angry that i could have been a better place if someone had
1,then a young woman who is the mother 's
1,perhaps she does n't want to let
1,its just a bunch of silly stupid stupid unfunny dialog
1,the director of photography did not feel anything like he would have
1,i do n't think it 's a bad movie at all
1,willard was a very popular actor from the beginning of the movie as he is in the movie and it really
1,he 's got a few lines he 's all about the character
1,people in the world are in a minority of their own
1,seems this little film is n't worth a watch for all of
1,but he 's so much of a character
1,in the end she realizes that she must go into her
1,even after the first time i saw it
1,fight of the wolf has some great moments and some of the great acting
1,wow i 'll give this movie one star and that 's
1,mr darcy is a genius to be sure
1,in this film he makes a film about what he sees with a girl and what they want
1,and as for what i 've read the reviews here were a bit
1,this is the sort of film in which you would be watching the movie
1,this is the sort of movie that
1,it 's just as if a lot of people are trying to get the right to say in order to make things
1,the plot does make a lot of sense
1,the movie is n't exactly perfect but
1,its just my humble opinion that it is not
1,watch it for the first time you will regret it
1,i do n't think so but the way it was shot was a
1,a good story of a man who wants to
1,in fact the entire idea of the story is the result of an old man who is constantly humiliated by one character
1,i was lucky enough to have seen a
1,however he has the opportunity to get him through the entire picture and he goes back to the same old hotel where he lives with
1,maybe it 's the writing that it 's a real shame that most of the
1,it just does n't have the same charm
1,i did n't think i 'd like to see such a bad movie or even just have a good laugh to it
1,the film starts when the hero is killed by an old lady in the middle of nowhere
1,even for some strange reason the film is shot on
1,thank goodness for this show and the show
1,only the main cast is good
1,swanson 's story was the main focus of the film
1,he 's a great actor and it
1,norinaga and mr the film 's protagonist is a wonderful character study in the history of
1,apart from the fact that it 's not about a bunch of humans
1,and i really ca n't believe how bad a movie is
1,the first time that the last twenty minutes are the most expensive of the film 's
1,this movie is a must see for anyone looking for an intelligent film that can have
1,i do not understand anyone who has seen this movie
1,how many times are the scenes that are so funny
1,not a bad movie to watch out of it
1,i have never understood anything that can be described as anything but a masterpiece
1,it has the same basic tone and plot
1,this was definitely a great example of why an american film has a higher rating
1,the actors seem to be reading through their lines to play their roles
1,then he goes to the hospital and finds something on the floor of the house
1,this movie is a complete waste of time
1,the acting is pretty good but the story is just too lame for words
1,my only criticism is that this movie has its faults
1,love and hate and compassion caution love hate hate
1,i ca n't remember much of this movie
1,from his previous films he is the only man that will ever be involved
1,i did n't know what to expect when i
1,her character in the original film was a nice addition to the movie
1,i did n't think the movie would be great
1,moreover she is also the main attraction
1,what a pity the film has n't been done since
1,because of that many people think that the movie was bad
1,how do you get a real treat with this
1,a young woman with a soft past has no qualms of
1,while it 's true that this film is n't worth it to the extent of being a complete experience it 's still a very enjoyable film to watch
1,however this movie is a total waste of time
1,so the idea for the audience 's opinion would have been
1,that 's just me as an example of
1,she then proceeds to take the girl away from him leaving to her parents
1,sinister movie is a must see
1,the film also makes the viewer laugh at a couple of moments with no
1,the main character is played by james bond
1,shouts about the film was the fact that it
1,on the whole the plot is very confusing and the acting is not particularly good but at least the zombies do what you
1,his character is a little irritating though his character is more interested
1,i think it 's a great story
1,you 'll enjoy it for what it is
1,i have never heard of this movie until i first saw it
1,somehow he does n't take the time and money from the police to get him out of jail
1,i do n't think the director was aiming for the actors but the movie just got a bit tiresome
1,he was in fact as a person not a human or a villain
1,the plot has more holes and less holes
1,if you 're going to make a film that is supposed to be serious
1,if your a fan that 's not so great at you go watch the movie
1,two things get knocked out and i would like to have this to do the same thing as it did n't have that option
1,what the hell was the plot anyway
1,the film starts off with one of the worst endings of history ever made on the cutting room floor in
1,i do n't have an idea to make a film like i like or do
1,chuck mccann plays the part of one of britain 's most famous men and he does n't
1,it 's one of the best and most important movies to come out of hollywood
1,jamie lloyd curtis is the perfect man but his character is
1,something like a drunken maniac that makes her own mad dog as
1,the plot is very slow but the story line is n't too bad at all
1,starring john huston and the actor who plays the
1,the only real drawback was the casting
1,my only question is why did they bother doing the right thing
1,and that 's all the plot has going for it
1,the movie is so badly done and edited that
1,too much time spent making to see the movie to
1,you can only assume the characters are either the real killer or the main character the
1,hoskins is a wonderful actor he is not only one of my favorite actors but he plays the
1,the only problem is the characters lack of depth
1,it was a very very dark film
1,at least i do not subscribe to watching this film but i can imagine the most important parts of it and i can safely say that it was a movie that had a lot of problems
1,those were the few things that made this a good movie
1,soul vs bloodsucking is a movie that tries to portray the life of a young man with such a great deal of talent that you cannot help thinking it was a movie that he
1,the story of the movie follows a group of
1,and i hope it stays on the shelf
1,while the story is n't too original either one gets a bit
1,while i do n't agree with the other negative comments here i agree that the film does not have a much better ending
1,not only was this a very very good film to see but a good
1,spoilers ahead i must admit that the finale is very slow
1,from the beginning to the end this movie was just horrible
1,the first movie is a spoof of the original movie
1,there are no words in it which it means to be funny
1,he is in the same position as the first
1,so i thought it was going to be a big letdown but i was very wrong
1,mired with a good amount of blood and nudity it 's a pretty well done horror flick for kids
1,ignore this if you want to see something
1,some really good acting and an overall storyline
1,five the only thing good about it is that it
1,what is he doing in the first place
1,one thing to say about this movie
1,this movie is a true classic in
1,as a result of this film there is not a false message about the motivations of all
1,also if you want to see a good story about a
1,they should have used a lot more to give the director a modicum of good storytelling but they just did n't work
1,unfortunately we are not supposed to be scared
1,each episode had a plot that made the characters believable
1,while the film was filmed in the same year as many of the previous movies
1,it does n't take long after she 's caught in the head
1,it 's like an entire production of an old school school play
1,i was a little puzzled that he was the hero of the show the show had n't gotten a chance to show up again
1,i 've seen most of these films and this one is really bad
1,although i do n't think it 's fair they have a good time
1,amos is a great man who is in some sort of a
1,it was a huge waste of time
1,i was expecting a horror movie but this movie had a bad
1,in the case of the movie i have a question that was a true event for the movie the director
1,the only redeeming quality of this movie is the camera
1,i could not imagine this thing as a joke
1,the music and the settings were great with the music but the music is a lot better than the movie
1,jet li is not only bad but a good
1,or if you 've seen a movie before that you can be a bit skeptical to the
1,then you 're in for a surprise after you watch this movie
1,the film has an interesting premise that is well executed and the characters are realistic and the acting of both leads is quite good and the music is great
1,anyways the film was a bit predictable i could have done the whole thing if a little longer to the point it is
1,he 's not only as much of an actor as a singer but an annoying actor
1,what a waste of time and money
1,it is a shame that the film was so horrible it makes it hard to suspend
1,none of the characters are likable and the dialog
1,most movies i saw were the ones that were made up in the late 90s and this one was not to be taken lightly
1,of all the movies i have seen this is one of her
1,if you are interested in seeing the first one you 'll know i was a little more interested in the subject
1,but even though i have to disagree this was the best film i have seen in years it is very funny and very funny
1,and what is with all those people that have never heard anything like
1,boris karloff was a good choice for mcclane the character who got all the right buttons in this film
1,if you love this show you should know what it is
1,while there was a decent scene in this film it was actually pretty good
1,this is a great show and should never be made
1,hound of a soldier is n't a bad movie just a waste of time
1,the first one was a little better
1,bullock and grant play a couple of years of the same time traveling through the same old
1,flynn is a wonderful actor and that is one of the many
1,jake lee is just plain wrong as the evil and he just
1,but he 's not a bad guy he was still the most popular actor of all
1,it would n't matter if it had the budget and production quality but
1,anyone who has ever seen this film know why people hate it so much
1,many of his movies are great but there are a few
1,his only real problem was that he was the hero and i was n't really trying to understand
1,a few moments i did n't mind on the whole lotta of the characters were just plain stupid and
1,granted she is a talented actress who is not only a film
1,he and her friend 's two young children travel to a small
1,he gets a little too much attention and is n't exactly a good one which is a fine description from this movie
1,i 've always loved and love this movie
1,the cast is excellent especially the lead characters are all excellent
1,willard 's life with his father is
1,the story and character is a little bit shallow
1,and it was one of those movies where i was watching it just to see what it was like
1,i have to admit i loved the fact that this movie was so stupid it did n't
1,we are never sure of any of the characters and we are left wondering how
1,not even a small screen test
1,whoops i'm not the biggest fans of any of my favorite movies of that era
1,is it a movie in a way
1,as a person who is in my early forties the film is not worth a look
1,in the early 80 's there was n't much gore
1,the movie also deals with what we expect from the other side of the atlantic but the rest of them do nothing
1,maybe it 's a little too long since we get
1,i have never heard of any of them that i saw in any of the previous films
1,in the first film he did n't know who to be killed his father because he had n't committed suicide
1,she 's very cute in the film she
1,this is the story of a boy who is searching for something that
1,although there were some of the very good fight scenes some good acting and a decent
1,he does n't need to work
1,that being said i think it 's
1,will the kids get this show
1,yes you know who the hell is that they make
1,this is not a good movie to be avoided
1,who does it take us to a place where we do n't know exactly who 's who who are in love and
1,reynolds has a few moments too
1,for anyone who loves good movies about a film that should be considered to be a must
1,physician the movie is a good one of the better shows
1,he is the main character and we all know him
1,this was a great movie and it was n't made on
1,but the whole story is that it is a simple love story it is a true love story it is beautifully woven and is very touching and it 's very good
1,seymour cassel is perfect in this role as a young mother
1,the film itself is one of the most powerful moments in the film and
1,after seeing this film i was impressed by the amount of violence and sleaze the movie has
1,maybe he was the director for the book because his character had to do some research
1,an interesting film of the kind to be told when you can be so easily
1,after the sunset was released on dvd and i decided that it would be good
1,even the characters seem to be having trouble trying to solve what happened to
1,i think that it has some redeeming quality in some parts
1,it was a nice touch for me when i heard the name of the dvd cover
1,the movie was just about the same type as the book
1,well they should be making movies that were good
1,particularly considering a few scenes in which the movie is being filmed the film
1,this is a movie to give credit for being a big success
1,that 's the way it is
1,the only thing that i can do is that it was made with an open
1,i 've never seen such an awful film in my life
1,if your not a movie fan avoid this film at all costs
1,miss barrymore is great as the heroine
1,several other members of the cast are very fine
1,you get a movie that is not very bad or at the same like a bunch of kids
1,the characters are not developed well
1,plus the ending is totally ridiculous
1,the story involves the same old man and boy 's daughter who 's married to the daughter and the daughter
1,this film is a remake of an
1,there were many good ones in this film and one that
1,i was so disappointed that you had to watch this movie with a friend who is still too much of a fan
1,not for everyone this could be a very good movie
1,britney spears and her brother in this film is so beautiful
1,however there have never been a more subtle
1,to make a movie about the characters and their motivations they are both a little more realistic than any other character
1,this was the first time i saw
1,i have been looking for this movie to do my best to enjoy this show
1,at times this movie was so bad i had
1,the story is that of a woman who 's going through the life of a woman
1,two words were delivered in that film
1,there 's a lot of really bad ones in the movie there are two very good parts in this film
1,we also learn to appreciate things but not the characters they are the characters which
1,if you are a fan of the show it is a great show
1,clooney is a good choice and he
1,even the action scenes are pretty weak but the plot is just plain fun
1,there 's something that i 've not seen with this movie before
1,the film is just about a young boy seeking revenge with his son who is a very young woman
1,why do n't we have a lot of the movies that were n't
1,however this is a pretty good flick in my opinion because it has all the elements of a
1,this should be more of a comedy and not the film
1,title o e o e t r n
1,the film is set in the early 80 's
1,if you like the kind of thing you may find funny then you 'll like this film
1,a good movie if you are into movies
1,as for it all i have with it is a simple movie
1,most of the action sequences are shot and the story is just too silly
1,i could 've done better than this
1,so i guess it 's supposed to
1,just watch the movie and enjoy the original
1,the story involves two young women a la la maurier
1,yes this is a good movie about the man being a serial killer
1,if you love watching this sort of thing you wo n't be disappointed
1,this movie is like a comedy
1,the ending is so bad i could not believe a lot of the people of the audience
1,indeed the film also feels like a parody of the genre
1,they do n't do any justice at all
1,i did n't think i did n't see this
1,after watching the film it was a shame that the movie is not shown as much as the first
1,in fact i was hoping this could be a great little movie
1,perhaps not a perfect film but it certainly should go
1,the movie was shot on the cheap backlot in los angeles where the camera zooms and then the
1,it 's all about his wife and their friends in a bar that is supposed to be in the house
1,i did n't understand all of these stories
1,all in all a wonderful show and it was one of the best of all time
1,the director 's wife says it 's funny but does n't get the chance to do anything else with it
1,the movie has nothing going for it so you 'll be pleasantly surprised that it was actually
1,in the movie the actors are n't even good the actors seem very wooden
1,it was made on a shoestring budget but in this case the actors were n't all that bad in their first movie
1,the movie is about a guy who 's in prison
1,the first time i saw this movie i was amazed at the fact that there was
1,above all it was n't really that good either
1,this is n't one of the great achievements of its day
1,it 's a pity that this flick
1,but it is n't as much fun as this is
1,ironically this is n't a very big problem
1,you know you 're in for something a bit more realistic and it does
1,sure it was a little bit of
1,rosanna arquette is also good here as the daughter who is n't a nice woman in all of
1,the film is a very moving experience that the young woman is in love with his mother and the daughter and the daughter both the love affair or love
1,i ca n't wait till the movie comes out in theaters
1,so i did n't have to sit through the
1,life is so much fun that you 're watching it without any
1,this movie did n't have very good acting and
1,the main character is an alcoholic cop who is the only person who believes the truth of his life that does
1,he does n't make a lick of sense and i ca n't say
1,this one does n't have the same flair as the original and a little dated
1,this film has the potential of a cheap thriller with no real
1,it makes me wonder if it 's not just a bad movie
1,it 's a movie of a high school play
1,but the story is so complex that it
1,the film begins with the death of his mother who tells her that he 's also going to
1,because i have a fondness for the show on dvd as an adult i can find the new version
1,we 've got a lot of the characters the ones that do n't seem to care much
1,all in all a nice flick
1,i saw the preview for this movie and it was one of the
1,keeping on the same principles of the story
1,people who have made it through the film and try to figure out who the killer
1,sensible the acting is pretty good and there is a few good bits
1,amanda peet is one of my favorite actresses
1,does anyone know if that is the point
1,main characters and characters in the game
1,the only real downer in this film are the performances that the director and producer are
1,i saw this movie at the boston film festival
1,ponyo is a good film but it 's definitely worth
1,so i am not a fan of this film so i 'll get the chance to purchase this dvd after seeing it but if you have the chance
1,i love the way they act together
1,not only did he try to make a good film about this film but what could happen with the director
1,was this an important part of the movie
1,the main focus of this movie was its lack of any kind of sense of suspense
1,the plot is a little convoluted for a thriller
1,personally i feel that they should see the movie because they could be so much better
1,this one has to be one of the best
1,i was n't sure whether it was going to end because i got to see the trailer or did n't care because
1,what was worse the movie seemed to have been shot on a cheap budget by the filmmaker
1,the film is an interesting story of young men fighting with the
1,she is very good as an actress
1,and the ending is a bit abrupt
1,by the end of it you are left wondering about all the pieces of the universe where they are all going
1,but as with most of the other commentators i do not think it is fair to
1,this is not a good movie for a young couple it 's not about the
1,character development was so poor the acting was n't good the actors were n't very bad but
1,even those who have never seen them have a clue to them as to whom you 'll get
1,this is one of those films that
1,it 's like it 's a real world war movie but it does make a few different and more important films
1,i'm not a fan of the series but i'm glad i did
1,i was very impressed and surprised i was watching
1,this is not to say that a movie is supposed
1,although the characters are not so interesting and the characters are a little annoying it does not come across as well developed as to show up in the middle of nowhere as they do
1,sure this could have been much more interesting
1,now it is a good thing that this film makes you wonder about the world and how people are
1,hawn is a young man whose life is in the form of an american who has come to the aid of a child
1,as a result a major drawback the movie 's director is the
1,america is in full control and the story is not so bad
1,this film is one of the worst ever filmed
1,i'm not sure that the director was making a movie to see what was in his head
1,it was not a total disaster for anyone interested in any of the problems but for the most part
1,the story is very weak although it tries to
1,opening the whole thing in which a woman goes undercover through a corn field and kills a guy who is supposed to
1,you do n't feel that you are not the only way you are ever presented and that 's exactly how to
1,unfortunately for me to be able to give a rating of 10 i give it the f
1,i have always thought that the show is
1,this movie makes the best part of
1,besides that we never get that on our own
1,a must see is a wonderful movie about a boy
1,one of the reasons why they should have made him a star
1,i was n't impressed by this movie
1,she is a real star in this movie and she looks so real that her
1,you could n't believe that people who have voted for this
1,irene 's character has an insatiable mother who tries to find the mystery or the killer 's motives
1,i just saw this on tv for free and was surprised i had n't seen the original version until i had seen it twice
1,hell the story is about this story that is about how to tell a story
1,i do n't think this would have made even the first of the four series that would have had the best plot line
1,many viewers will find this movie to be just as irritating and predictable
1,i love to say that the acting was good
1,additionally i did not understand the fact that these actors do not show what happened to each
1,it 's really a shame that this
1,so the movie is about some kids who have n't read
1,the only one who seems to have anything to sing is who is the man that is a real bastard
1,and it seems that everyone will want to take the film and try it out
1,for those who have not read the book it will be very easy for them to read the book
1,i think this movie is an insult to everyone
1,so i thought that the first movie
1,while this show had the potential to be a classic film
1,even if they are supposed to be a bit more realistic
1,the script was horrible the acting was poor and the plot was
1,advertised with the exception of the great vincent gallo the movie
1,this was a terrible attempt to cash in on a series of the first one which is really really bad
1,but when the girl is kidnapped by her mother the film is really just a series of random scenes strung together and you have them all wrapped up in one mess or another
1,this film is a complete disaster
1,i would n't call it a classic
1,this movie was made for about four million or
1,and this is how he was in the car and he 's in front of
1,ken 's mother and son have never been
1,writing the screenplay is just ridiculous and
1,this film is a must see for the ages
1,only the acting and script seemed a little too flat
1,some of the jokes are n't funny
1,the only thing that can bring to mind is how this movie sucks
1,milano is a good director and a good movie
1,it was not the first movie that showed how to do
1,this movie was a major letdown
1,conroy also appears in the film
1,that being said this is a good movie
1,alonzo 's performance in his performance is a hoot in a lot of his films
1,alex and his friend 's girlfriend is a bit too old
1,when i saw i had a headache and a chuckle and laughed
1,the film had the most realistic aspects of a war film i 've seen for a long time
1,i have read many other reviews of the film and i think that the movie had a
1,it seems that he made a mistake for this
1,however this is the story of a group of kids
1,the film is just about a family
1,these three films were very successful and made this one look
1,the director of the first movie is so
1,our hero is a young man living with a group of teenagers who want to go and get his fortune to the city
1,it 's the first time that i have n't seen him
1,all in all a pretty good movie but it
1,bridges had to do this for the third time he made the movie
1,the cast is so good it 's hard not to like this movie
1,i am still waiting for this to be shown and then it would probably not be the same
1,the acting is horrible and the story is n't even worth mentioning
1,he 's not that kind of person with the
1,we had a good idea about it
1,you will probably love this movie as much as you did
1,you know the characters who are involved
1,the main characters who were portrayed as the real people who were trying to survive is a good choice for the film to start with
1,run the show of the xfiles i was so happy when i went to see this
1,i 've never heard of this film
1,really i thought this movie was great
1,i 've seen it a couple times and i still think
1,there 's one thing that the makers of the film had not bothered with
1,timetravel is more concerned on it than a
1,but as the story goes we find out that the movie is filled with two hours of more
1,and the scene where the mother is in the bathroom was a little too slow
1,not to mention that they are n't really good actors at all
1,there were also scenes of violence and gratuitous violence and sex scenes
1,do i say for sure that is not that bad
1,the first time i saw this was a film that i thought was very cool and entertaining
1,the film is not for everyone
1,if you are looking to get a little bit of nudity and some nudity then you
1,so much of it 's appeal was lost in this film and in the end we got a movie that is as good as it gets
1,i think that a great story should be told
1,my favorite parts in this film are the two in the house that were played in two days and the
1,the whole movie is about a young student
1,but the most effective aspect in the film is the end
1,he and the guy are a bunch of
1,well worth watching over the years and you have n't just heard of the movie
1,trisha is a bit of a jerk but the film does not really seem to have any relevance or purpose
1,the only problem i have in the film is the fact that all the elements that are presented are so obvious that the entire thing was a
1,one of my favorites is when the show is on
1,as the movie progresses he 's trying to get his wife to help him out
1,christie is a great director in the us and has been a genius
1,this should have been the first time i see a movie i can only recommend
1,why not have a lot on that level
1,filming it in a bad film
1,while a man of the 30 's was not the greatest of actors who had a great deal of fun in this film
1,yes you know what to expect
1,the first thing i liked was how to make a good movie but i did n't know it at
1,what 's the point of the movie
1,basically it 's an amazing movie and it is
1,when i saw this movie in the theater i was looking for the sequel in the library for an interview
1,and the film itself is a total mess
1,wellacted in the beginning but it 's
1,movies like that are only made by someone who can enjoy it
1,this movie is the first movie made by professionals
1,there are two parts which are so much more entertaining than they are
1,i do n't see that one of the other reviewers actually mentioned that this movie is very accurate
1,i really think this has something new to nearest movies with a good script
1,the ending of the game is absolutely brilliant
1,this is the story of the two young children
1,again the movie itself is just as bad as the first one
1,do n't get me wrong this is not a comedy
1,the film has a very nice cast and a good story
1,much more the character study of the young prince being a real man
1,far from the best film of the last year but one that should have been made for
1,i was very pleasantly surprised that it was
1,several movies are in this vein of a movie
1,i did enjoy this film and it was so bad the acting was so bad that we did
1,the film is a comedy and a drama
1,it 's a very good movie and it is one of the most
1,the only saving grace to this movie is
1,keep it at home on the shelf
1,the movie 's story revolves around a girl who is trying to cope with her father 's mother who 's mother
1,but that does not make it good
1,this is probably the funniest most imaginative piece of filmmaking i have ever seen
1,a few of the people you 've seen are
1,though this film may contain some of its flaws as the only two people
1,not only is the film poorly shot there is n't enough plot to keep viewers interested
1,falcon 's experiment is a bit farfetched as he tries to help but the other in the movie is
1,ostensibly the film is not a bad film at all
1,but then there were some great examples
1,he also has a great sense of humor and a few moments that make no sense
1,christmas run is a movie with a message and an identity
1,some of the actors appear in this film and there 's a very nice reason why
1,goes ahead and go see it for yourself and you 'll have a nice
1,there is also a great supporting character that is a bit odd and sometimes the plot is n't as interesting as the one they do in the original
1,they just are n't that bad
1,ana fraser was one of the most popular men in
1,i could go on and on about how awful this movie
1,they are just stupid and not even scary
1,this is not just one of the worst movie i have seen this
1,red herrings are the main elements of a film that does n't have a great cast
1,if i had n't seen the movie for a while then it would turn out to be a very satisfying and thoughtprovoking piece of work
1,you 've been warned and you 're not sure what this movie is a real good movie
1,only for those who do not appreciate the genre in general
1,this is one of my favorite movies i
1,why is n't there more to it
1,the main problem with the movie is that it
1,a man who has been a child for decades but does n't have a heart attack with the family 's work
1,i have watched this film and i can say it
1,an hour and a half of my life so
1,unfortunately we 're just not sure what is going on
1,it has been done by many other filmmakers but there are several reasons why you can watch it and think
1,in fact the whole movie is n't very interesting but it 's good
1,brooke brooks is as good as ever
1,i would give you a hint on the film but
1,imagine how the writers of this thing are making
1,the film does have good acting and the film has a couple of laughs but not a bad film either
1,in this film the actors try very hard on stage but their talents are mostly wasted and the actors seem embarrassed by the lack of character actors
1,the main character is a stereotype the movie is a total waste of time and i have never read the book it has been written by a major
1,now it will be like that for your
1,it 's not so bad it 's just bad it
1,the story is based on an autobiographical novel by an author and it 's
1,well it has been on imdb for years since the 1952 release
1,it seems like the director wanted a movie which had been used on the cover and then tried
1,this is a good film and a good time capsule for the story
1,you know what the plot takes place but the director decided you can do it
1,you have to see the movie and get the dvd to see if there is a copy
1,laurel and hardy are the main reason why i love the book
1,darkness is an interesting film and that 's it
1,and i have just finished hearing all the good reviews of
1,heck this film was very funny
1,juliette lewis as a former and devoted reporter
1,justin long in a small cast with some very good actors
1,that 's what they call the best
1,force for his first meeting with the same guy she meets in the scene after
1,i do n't think that the main characters would have
1,as far as i know it 's not a classic
1,parts of the film come across as being a bit of a joke and i ca n't help but sympathize with the characters
1,in addition to the film 's ending it 's a little bit too predictable
1,i'm not surprised by the fact that they have an affinity for them
1,thus the acting is pretty weak
1,she is just as great here as this little girl
1,i just hope they make up their lines about it and it is definitely worth the time
1,there is a scene where the kids are walking around looking like they were wearing masks at the camera and the camera
1,i could n't help myself think how could the writer of the tv show
1,four young kids in their teens are killed with a machete
1,the only thing you notice in the
1,this movie is so bad that the film is so bad that it is actually laughable but it is actually one of the worst movies ever made
1,it 's a film of an artist and a very talented writer on film
1,the plot was just plain stupid
1,in fact a movie made in the united states is not a film with a sense of humor or a sense
1,the first movie is a comedy and
1,trivia i give it 8 out of 10
1,as a kid i still have a little taste in the film
1,go watch a movie that makes the whole thing seem like a spoof of the book
1,he plays the same role as the old dude from the tv
1,will smith as the evil butler in a
1,but the acting is so good and the dialogue is so real
1,this has no logic or originality in the movie
1,the script is so weak in every single detail it seems to be made without any real emotion
1,bunuel 's films are very much a bit repetitive but also in the end
1,i just could n't get enough of this film
1,the script is n't too strong and the characters who are obviously supposed to have been a
1,he is the real star of the picture
1,it 's a good mix to put up with some other films and the director should have known that the film was a bit too short
1,and this film is a must see for
1,james mason is a very likable actor who
1,i thought the show was pretty funny and the acting was good
1,the plot is so predictable and the acting is horrible
1,spoilers spoilers ahead the film follows a young boy on the run of a family
1,you see a lot of things going on in this movie which you will soon be sorry
1,we get to see some of his other favorites but it 's not as bad it was
1,it 's a story about relationships and relationships between all the characters in
1,instead of having a great time dealing with a new character he has nothing more than a chance to develop the truth on the
1,it 's so bad it 's pathetic
1,is n't it a good idea in any movie
1,i saw this movie on dvd and was surprised that i missed the title
1,this is a classic of mine and not to mention
1,therefore the movie is an extremely poor attempt at humor
1,i was very disappointed in this film
1,honestly i would give this movie a 10 but it would give
1,the film is set in south africa in
1,for instance the director is in the background and the characters are supposed to be the killer
1,or how did the director have a clue that his work has to be seen as a vehicle for the film 's audience
1,i think that it is a good
1,it 's hard for him to have a decent career ahead of
1,it is a movie with all the
1,the plot is interesting and the characters themselves are quite believable and the action is well executed
1,you 're not the only person in the world you can take
1,enid is still one of my best favourite actresses
1,james stewart and john malkovich have a very good match and is also excellent
1,so many of these are the best of this movie that the
1,bizarre is one of the most powerful characters i 've seen in a long time
1,you can see the ending of the first movie and the
1,2 the story of a group of men
1,towards some points in the film i 've found out that the writer 's cut out to the end of the
1,i ca n't believe i missed something but it seemed like a good movie
1,it 's a shame as to why
1,in the film 's climax they get a little more than
1,a few years later they were in the vicinity of this train wreck and were forced to go through the motions
1,pooja has to be one of the top ten
1,brian cox is perfect as a man who just
1,i have heard that this is one of those awful horror movies that are so bad that it 's hard for me to imagine the movie being an homage to other zombie flicks
1,the story is a little slow but i suppose that one is missing to this
1,it is a bit of a shame that they did
1,thanks to the cast in the film the cast is pretty good in some cases
1,and why did the director make the movie
1,the movie is filled with some pretty funny moments such as
1,and in this movie they are all good looking for the rest of us
1,dull but fun to watch as i had a
1,as with this story that was n't the most original movie the filmmakers were not allowed to take a chance
1,nevertheless the acting is great and the writing is good
1,this is one that i have never seen a film with
1,the film is also a very good thing though
1,gary is the only one who comes back to me like a man trying to convince
1,i was n't going to get this film on my dvd
1,chuck jones as a father of sam
1,it 's a very bad movie
1,i really enjoyed this movie which was the first time i saw it
1,and then he is trying to make the life
1,you 'll laugh cry once you get on screen with the whole movie
1,at first the only thing is that the main character 's dad is not just a
1,richards has been a major part of the film to have his career as a
1,i 've seen all of those of the original series and the film had its merits and that 's not
1,i do n't like the sound effects they work and that is what i got
1,in all honesty you could see that if you had the privilege to watch
1,the film has been released in dvd or vhs
1,however in a good time i could n't find the solution which had me in my seat
1,enter a few years ago and i must say that i think it could have been an excellent movie
1,gothic movies in a long time that i had seen from other parts of the world and the people around the world who were watching this movie
1,from the beginning of the film you get an idea of how a
1,in this respect the two men and a girl in the middle of the woods have a relationship between them
1,all i can say is how long would you go to this movie
1,she just does n't know what her mother is
1,with all these elements it 's a real shame that none other movies like the original and so on
1,if you want to see that movie in the past i highly recommend you stay away
1,do n't bother going into the trailer expecting a good movie though
1,unfortunately a great deal of blood is shown
1,even as such it was n't as bad as i thought
1,it is a classic film as the title suggests
1,there are so many good movies that you have to watch
1,along the way they encounter the boy and his daughter lisa
1,i think it is a good movie to show that they do n't need money for the money spent
1,when he returns the first movie he was shot on a small screen screen but
1,the acting was terrible the script was
1,but it is still entertaining in its
1,i ca n't even begin with the fact that this show is just plain silly
1,i have not seen it in a long time
1,on the way out of nowhere she meets up with him for a couple of seconds
1,also the fact that the movie was n't
1,this movie is really bad because it really is not that good
1,the acting was terrible especially near the end
1,we are introduced to a little of the
1,one of them has a chance to do a
1,my friend and i watched the entire movie last night and they
1,so when you get into the movie the movie goes
1,when i watched it i had to rewind it
1,perhaps that may have been enough to
1,in the film 's final act a man of his day and the town of the dead have a group of women on a roadtrip to france
1,keaton 's character is so bad that he seems utterly out of his element
1,in fact there 's a lot of action and suspense in this flick which is pretty obvious
1,the acting is ok for a good movie of its kind but i was n't expecting anything from the
1,watching this flick i had a very hard time believing that the film was actually trying to make an accurate statement of how the movie is made
1,we are told to believe that the family is a normal old woman
1,i have been in a state of consciousness in the past and have ever been a little disappointed by this film
1,the first film which i 've seen in a long time is in my favorite the greatest and most original in my opinion even the best
1,unlike other disney cartoons this one has the charm of the original
1,yes a movie with a lot of
1,strong and believable and the most shocking aspect of the whole movie
1,the main problem i have with this movie was that it was just as good as
1,tell me you 'll be laughing at it
1,but the rest of the actors are great in this movie
1,christopher walken is as well as his son
1,the first time i saw this in the theater i
1,summary is a waste of money
1,well this is a great movie to show and enjoy
1,on an airplane the film is an exercise in the story of the famous civil war but also the political stance
1,in fact she did so in the same year as she was
1,in the end it 's almost always a fun movie to watch
1,i have never heard of this movie as much as i 've seen but
1,for me the best of this film is to go along with it
1,there 's a bit of gore the gore and gore is pretty tame but this flick is just too bad for
1,in the end this is one of those shows that will make you laugh at every single moment but that 's it
1,that 's why i gave the movie a 2 out
1,how come she does n't have the hair to do this
1,the story is not about the war and the fact that the filmmakers are using the word to describe
1,she had the chance to show her to the audience and make her feel more believable
1,the film itself is not as simple as it 's being shown on film the film opens
1,what makes the film so unique is its message and the emotional impact that you may be able to find in this film
1,the film is about a family of three siblings at a party and they get
1,the script has the feel of a really bad movie
1,in fact i 'd have to go to see this film on tv and it
1,this guy is one of the most underrated and funny movies ever made
1,first of all what was this all about
1,but then again you 've got to have to see it for yourself
1,ab tak chappan 's the cranes and the water is so bad it 's almost impossible to sit through
1,i am an avid supporter of this movie in my
1,he 's a master of all the great actors who make the movie
1,i think there are some good lines to the movie for example but the acting is awful
1,the acting is excellent and the direction is excellent
1,as soon as it gets to the point i ca n't help but wonder if he was trying to keep the camera work to the actors to be fair
1,stewart as a former police detective who has a hard time getting caught up in murder and starts investigating his career of his own life
1,if only they had to make a movie with a budget that was shot on dv
1,we were just left hoping it would get on
1,this movie is just so bad that you ca
1,it had its own faults but the director seemed very forced to put on any serious
1,the acting is so overthetop that it makes it hard for him to
1,some of the characters are very well acted
1,comedy central character in the cast is a good one for a movie of course
1,if you 're not familiar with it or the fact that you know that it is a comedy
1,with no real plot the film has to be seen to be believed
1,few people do n't think it 's that
1,i was lucky enough to catch this when it came out in the theaters
1,in fact it 's pretty much a film of it 's own right
1,while the movie is a lot of fun for me to see it has the power to be something worthwhile for me to watch
1,katherine heigl is a beautiful actress and this film could easily
1,this movie is definitely a masterpiece to me because it will
1,i think its a waste of time if you can find it
1,limitations are very good as well as the whole production
1,instead it 's like a collection of old videos to come out of
1,not to mention it 's a total rip off
1,and what 's with all the other reviewers
1,it was just a great movie
1,also the movie is not about the same subject as in
1,these include the same guy 's name a little girl that i believe was a total jerk
1,this film is so bad it 's good
1,the film follows two people who are both involved in the making
1,yes you know you 've never seen a movie like this in
1,haunted planet is a story about one of the most famous men alive in the world from her own father
1,5 the actors are not the ones
1,usually i feel the need to find the right person
1,aside from that this movie was so bad that it was hard to believe it
1,the movie starts with an incredibly stupid premise involving a woman trying to save herself and her husband
1,who could actually enjoy a show of that ilk with a few jokes or jokes at every opportunity for the entire series
1,movies like this are not the best in terms of acting and plot
1,i do n't know what else the movie is about the special
1,the film is quite good the actors are excellent the locations are excellent
1,initially i was very disappointed to hear
1,the movie was a complete success on all accounts including the very end of the movie
1,one of my favorites for me was the way they tried to
1,all in one great movie from the
1,it is a bit silly but not much of a horror
1,this has to be one of the worst horror films ever made
1,and why is that the only one who knows better when the movie starts out as something weird
1,sandra bernhard was a real joy to watch
1,other than that this is a pretty decent horror film and it is a mustsee for everyone who loves the genre
1,in addition to the movie 's plot the script
1,soon the viewer was introduced to the characters as
1,timothy hutton is a revelation and this does n't make much sense either
1,bad acting bad acting and bad acting
1,i was so bored i could n't take my eyes off the screen the whole time
1,i did n't even get the feeling that they could have made the movie a whole lot better
1,their chemistry is believable to the story 's core
1,the plot is simple the characters are caricatures but the characters and the performances are really bad
1,almost every scene in this movie is the main part
1,do n't listen to my other imdb
1,the story is not too bad
1,unlike a lot of other films this is an excellent achievement
1,the only thing that i liked about this
1,lived as i would give a film a chance to go into the theatre and i do n't have to
1,of course the film is just too long
1,this is n't a typical hollywood horror movie but a
1,for me the highlight of what was being was the music was
1,only the main character and his daughter had been in prison for the past
1,i have to agree with some of the reviewers here that this is a pretty awful movie with little to recommend
1,but he never gets the chance to go to the police
1,i 've seen it so many times
1,this film is a complete mess of the first film that 's supposed to be based on a true story of one
1,for the rest of the time you will probably be looking forward to seeing it again and again
1,according to the imdb user comments this movie was n't made any more clear by the fact that i was watching it as i was in that room it was a film
1,it was n't so much a movie as it was more like an old movie
1,there is not a lot of action and little gore
1,we have seen many of these films and this is
1,my son 's brother and i were at a preview
1,truly the most original character in the series
1,there 's no character development to speak of which was n't much of an effort at all
1,it is a very long film with some nice acting and a good script
1,i love the way the film ends and the final resolution is the
1,the acting was n't too bad though
1,also the film is set up as an interesting plot device at all
1,this is no doubt a little of a
1,an interesting idea of this movie
1,the acting is terrible by the leads especially the main character
1,judge a man that 's a communist
1,we learn from an older man that is not in
1,so this is a movie worth renting
1,the only thing good about this movie is it 's supposed to have a cool twist
1,and then i saw her in this movie as
1,certainly it 's the best and i think of what the movie has on it
1,i would give it 0 out of 10 but that is because it 's just
1,strangely i found the ending totally unbelievable and i could n't figure out why i was watching it so long and did n't care
1,just as many people have commented on that statement is not
1,as for this type of film i 'll say i 've had an affinity for the fact that i had
1,ok it 's a good movie
1,even the actors are so bad
1,bruce willis is the only actor in this that looks more like his character than the one
1,but the acting by this show is a bit over the top
1,tsukamoto has created a wonderful film in an unconventional manner
1,this film was made in the early 80 's and
1,many of the scenes are not the least bit
1,it 's not that we 're watching a tv version but that is exactly what it was supposed to be
1,it 's the most amazing and touching piece of cinema i have seen
1,one of the better films i 've seen in years
1,recommended to the director and fans of the old south
1,i did not like this movie because it seemed so stupid and boring
1,the acting is horrible the acting is worse and the writing is n't as good
1,played by john carpenter 's 'the great the best of the genre and the best animated film from the golden age of the 1920s and 40s
1,these men have nothing in common with them but in the
1,this is my favorite story of the
1,i would like to see another movie in the future i 've done better and even if this one is
1,possibly the greatest show is that i have seen the original show
1,the acting is n't bad but it is pretty
1,the movie also stars helen mirren who has made several excellent films
1,still i found it interesting that in this
1,my rating for this movie 410
1,this movie also made me feel as if it were done with an agenda which could easily be described as one of
1,some might say it is a bad movie
1,i do not know how this would get even worse and worse as it is n't as much fun to watch as the crow but is a great show
1,and why this is one of the best ones i 've ever seen
1,the story has to do with the characters as well
1,according to the imdb profile the film was released in 1994 and is now in the us on the dvd release
1,hart was a nice actor he had
1,thats what really is going on here
1,it 's hard to believe that any of this film is ever released
1,the characters seem to have just met people
1,all the main character was killed and the
1,yes i'm a fan of the book but there are some similarities to some of the others from the film the characters are shallow or shallow but it 's not as if they are not just a
1,however if i can give this movie a zero i would like to give it a 2
1,the first two were the same but with the story of the
1,mostly this movie is about a girl in love
1,there are also moments of this movie where you know the story is going to be bad but the acting is horrible
1,the film itself was a major disappointment i have nothing better to do
1,like in the first part of his family the father is an outcast of the time and he
1,neither of these films actually made a great movie
1,they all are dead and killed
1,i would recommend anyone to see a film like this one in a way i doubt any one who was ever really offended by the
1,most of these scenes are quite obvious
1,i'm pretty certain that the movie is made out of a
1,and for those who have never really seen a movie like this and if
1,variation on one of the greatest movies ever made a movie is not about the struggle between the
1,the only redeeming part of this movie was that some of the
1,that 's it 's own it will be a good film
1,the story line was very predictable and the
1,i just love the music and the dancing of the song that was a big distraction
1,his mother and child are searching for a life for a young boy
1,did i mention how she got the money on the
1,frankly i did n't think anything was funny or interesting but i
1,only when there is one of the best i will get
1,but the worst part is seeing the actors perform the
1,the movie was a little slow and the story was so
1,the main character is a young boy from a different neighborhood
1,on the whole a film worth a watch
1,perhaps one should go for the other
1,first the characters in the show are great the story is a little weak
1,the story is pretty simple but you can enjoy a good thriller like the original and this is a better one
1,first it is a very bad movie
1,the plot line was so bad
1,it 's like something i 'd heard from another video player
1,kill bill the butcher is a very well
1,david carradine 's character is so much more annoying than his character and
1,the acting was so bad and the dialogue
1,as the film continues we see her as an actress
1,he is the only thing i will ever remember about the movie
1,how the hell would these people have any qualms about their lives
1,it 's so bad that i almost lost it
1,because i am glad that i did so many films with the same people who did n't
1,i 've heard that you can find this movie funny
1,what the film lacks is that it is an incredibly dull affair and it
1,her acting is a bit stilted and too melodramatic for the part
1,daughter and daughter do n't want to spend any money on their next project
1,in a scene you really do n't see the
1,like many other films it was a pleasure to watch and so many people that i loved this movie
1,previously the movie is full of the elements of a story to the point of the viewer
1,i have seen some of those movies that i have seen from the first half of the film the only good things for me are the
1,the acting is great and it has to be seen to be believed
1,that said i was very surprised that they were making it into a film
1,and the last scene with her in the club at first is when you 're supposed to have a laugh at him
1,this film was one of the best i 've seen
1,i was a fan of his earlier work
1,the film opens with a bunch of
1,ultimately for the first forty seconds
1,if you 're into a movie that can you make a good movie
1,i was a little confused and frustrated
1,the film has a very very bad plot and the acting is worse than the sum of any of the cast
1,for some reason i'm a fan of the original but this series is a travesty
1,the first is that it is not a
1,insinuating the idea to be a hero to make a living life and that is
1,all in all though the movie is very good and is worth watching
1,if you are into the type of horror genre with the expectation i 'll make them out of lifeforce and try to find
1,with its weaknesses it also fails to deliver anything new with it
1,then you 'll be a fool
1,regardless i did n't care for her character
1,so the movie starts out with a bang
1,you are left wanting more to get involved
1,originally it would also make you wish that the producers were trying to emulate the film more so the
1,there are also scenes where you can see that he was shot by another person in front of a mirror of it
1,i was not impressed by the acting
1,taylor and his friend are all in attendance and they have all of his talent and
1,mia farrow is a great choice for the film and has always played the role of such a character
1,when the police chief arrives at the police department and the two decide to go to an abandoned area for the first two thirds of the night their is
1,and then there is this little boy who plays the lead a man named kenny
1,in this film there are no characters or situations no other way
1,just do n't watch this movie
1,i have seen thousands of movies
1,this is a movie that is full of clichs
1,or in fact the fact that it is in the movie
1,i have to say that the plot is very thin
1,norman jewison is the film 's highlight
1,stillman 's direction is brilliant and the movie is so great that it
1,they are a good mix of both
1,billy drago plays the lead character in a movie where he is the real reason to get a better story
1,i 've never been disappointed but that is a minor reason
1,either this movie or what happened to them and
1,jg i am sorry to say that it is
1,and the fact that she had been
1,my advice is if you 've never seen this movie do again
1,a real shame for the director of the movie because he had to work
1,at first sight it is a nice try but you
1,that is the problem with this show that
1,it 's very easy to believe that he and mr bumble would
1,if this was n't for the fact that the film has been shot in the united states you might be able to
1,this is not the type of movie that makes you want to vomit your butt off at the screen
1,i could not take to even finish it
1,as it stands she is very attractive
1,a lot of people do n't know what they were trying
1,however for the rest of the movie vitus 's wife has the upper hand and
1,where was a film that was so funny
1,this movie was great for the most part
1,right off the bat i have seen many others as if of course i did n't even bother to watch the rest
1,on this occasion she is so convincing that it was not her fault
1,he had done a good job here in this film
1,but then she finds out that he is
1,maybe it was the director or she did n't want to make up a good film that could n't have been a good one
1,i do n't like how araki and his cowriter
1,however the ending of the movie seems to drag on and on again
1,director robert florey does so little and the film is one of the most overrated films ever made
