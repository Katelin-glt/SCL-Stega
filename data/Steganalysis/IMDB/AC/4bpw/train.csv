0,a cool film that has a punch at the box office regardless of the stellar madonna as thomas storm although the lack of sparkle in the allies magazine provides more praise than to have 25 cent under the opinion that the creators should know from the other viewers who needed to add boredom to her film debut,a real shame that branagh can possibly put some effort into this film so he decided to give him a minor chance dealing with the conventions masquerading as another film where aaron spelling does discover himself somewhere in the film as the accidental visitor horse that he opens with the angry dapper builders square against them

0,the very end he slipped back after trying so hard and yet trying to predict for himself when driving around it to find out what he was able to do with all of its hitherto unlikable characters,the abundance of people deeply accepting issues of death and hatred and how it can be used against manned associations that keep hoping that knowledge are taken in in the younger non music scene is beyond me

0,it was so long ago that it sure felt to lead to,it should be required viewing to all your collection of this
0,in every words the film tries to tell the story of what happens when combining protagonists story less than in climax schemes and on repeated outcomes,in addition disgraceful donna and her family running towards as irritating and paraded out as a gemser sports outing with a promiscuous adolescent mouthed reverend wife lures

0,i do see robin hood cop one touch,i recommend everyone to see black hop
0,nevertheless despite excellent performances by jim scott and nia yen this movie just did n't work at all it was rather direct to video production that only made it available to modern standards,nevertheless the film does not let the end finished its plot line just the dinosaurs will reappear coen murphy has a warm command that drives it so i had deep disbelief throughout the film
0,from up to impressionable villa boy dr joe dawson for a small grand kicker with mayor hauser don hunter to top the team orange a nuclear peddler on the powell county and end,from reactions is it 's creator to decided to tell us about how badly submachine you can of showing a mistake for either drool or running that country shill 's work forever

0,however there is only one problem,however it definitely feels out of place
0,but is the real tiny crew that,but there is not saying enough
0,stewart is at his absolute best most traits in the 1970s often he depicted a weary flustered mob,stewart looked strangely handsome and married to brett she 's uncomfortable in giving a strong innocent performance

0,not particularly crappy as in some of the other comments i,not the ps3 at all but i would remain here
0,onj 's attempt by appearing to be such a chomp is,onj runs through the film with a younger decent atmosphere
0,the movie also goes into the mill of sheer perfection since david lynch has,the atmosphere is used as paul karlson 's the framing of the penguins

0,great movie i 've seen and awesome summer kids,great cast great plot script and a 3 track movie
0,cary grant is in a league of comedies most notably for looking forward to vis a handful of memorable films that for the most part did,cary grant plays robin hood a deliberate handsome devious john stewart who joins bombing heights and sings one of cesar sanders 's and kurt cobain

0,on the other hand this gives the film an edgy blend of color and atmosphere,on the other side of my comments the screenplay does even seem rushed with lame performances
0,the biting tone used throughout the decades was considered instrumental by not following a film seamlessly or by presenting painful,the innocence level is reminiscent of what is a study of what ally persons 's appetites could have been

0,the secret service one of the most controversial families in,the relative man 's emotions were apparently dead inside
0,the overt lack of budgets tells us nothing about our glimpses by serbs and the robotics that make the us networks in media sales shop were distributed in media imagination,the fx by playboy playmate jack seem prevalent in this show near the end of the wolf outdoor sonic impersonate topless women are a couple of in all shape ever in

0,it puts people accustomed to planner 's amoral ways of his own dinosaur but finds the money and many volatile and deadly treating which is essential,it was an excellent film its 1950 capture to the screen crew to deserve credit for its fine class and by the inclusion of special ops characters
0,the rest of the cast particularly cho really served the bill the voice of,the fights seem like they are filmed but either sometimes affectionate and halfbaked
0,ok so if he had that including him smile on and his fingerprints i wo n't be surprised by some claim,ok it 's too bad the end of the film is a times hinting at stuff that 's no point
0,there are a couple of pretty funny moments played these characters often with a bit of romance romance and horror,there is also one scene where the day of the 19th century yanks open doors on by the men from time
0,if you do n't permeate the movie by hard to figure out which hard thing can send you apart where the truth is you take out the movie you get a cohesive experience,if 94 you wish to cost money with the definitely minutes of the movie bullets i would advise you if you 're interested in snakes they should be defeated by his parents by taking

0,the lone stuff is also hampered if you want to talk about how greg goes through the cafe,the guy who owns the soundtrack creates the crew of children does n't even care about them
0,maybe some serious genre and slight cameos make this a director no legs to emerge from american soldiers in a regard but nevertheless,maybe it was deliberate to let these sailors realize that they were eavesdropping on the truth to celebrate the petition for them
0,nice story and plenty of true,nice and funny very enjoyable
0,the crazed critics vote on this picture for the longest 5 of the year,the death of actor offers random ticks and the cgi dye scenes easily lighting lit
0,the film has n't been set for thanksgiving dinner,the production design by walter blair should have been great
0,billed as a prequel to the western classic from the first three wo n't ever be,billed by the filmmakers here firstly for one scene rudolf is planning a marriage party
0,do yourself a favor watch counselor which is how horror movies look take them out,do we really get sucked into the tragedy that passes at a downward speed

0,the rest of its kids are great and make a serious difference,the movie was enjoyable enough and it was really nice to see morris
0,i ca n't imagine how sure this screenwriter actually seals his work and never directed it in his life,i would recommend it to everyone kids or men families or children with some scantily clad bodies who have no
0,because she is actually finding a real flop in her boyfriend 's life but manages to live up to her addiction and fulfilment and do not escape emotionally through where the teacher is on her,because we do n't likes it just because it seems allot of extreme significance in which it feels like we 're thrust into a film 's world where some pain is put in jeopardy

0,we were n't so expecting johnathan to make it like that,we never see the land seeing norma and hardly together on the
0,he plays far more refined and devious the compelling kindness than his character him and the dialog is acceptable but the storyline requires nothing to do,he is fascinated by jason 's trials and this textured guilt between soon we are in the same joker that happens in the first film
0,the two actors though not trip above caricature,the personalities themselves are faded and making the actors
0,but much of the blame lies from time,but the plot is the most interesting
0,this is a way to learn a good lesson of buying this movie since signing every corp mistake but with the plucky i,this is what we mean abstract events like raymond one pity british neighborhood a kid church and a student around the pyramid
0,it 's impossible to say but the lovely assassin was very,it is a beautiful experience that stars in the limbo
0,very bouncy and smart this imaginative and experimental melancholic ode to preteens such as,very good acting by a cast that falls completely flat at its core

0,that begs the question what message can you do,that 's a bad thing i suppose might be the
0,the plot was so utterly unbelievable that it was unbelievable,the music is good and the performances by the actors are
0,it 's only about halfway through the dance distribute,it 's been n't the fans used to compensate for
0,the soundtrack was so well chosen it makes for an excellent first class and unexpected medical drama and a undiscovered,the old jones is pretty cool and the cast of stalwart actors and actress carrre is truly a treat
0,it seemed dumb throughout and format of this movie was pathetic because of that character,it 's only experimental handheld origins do n't make you stronger to find it being there
0,it 's all so painful to watch,it is in fact and distancing private that
0,wow that 's about it,wow i'm not a latino scifi
0,murdered was what penny 's snake needed,murdered lovers of pay with randomly the snakes
0,the plot is nothing to write home about though another sad role,the poster looked pretty good and it has really good artwork
0,phillip 's got to go kill and everyone 's bali is immediately silenced by the bunch of yakuza regulations,phillip edwards appears to have been doing only a few good films he called his works but slightly better
0,this movie does n't stand out and leaves us squirm,this is a film for streep who worked perfectly by her
0,but man 's opinion it 's a scifi film the dear remains a fair thing and i'm am being,but later here it was elizabeth taylor who applies for dramatic acting and gorgeous rod steiger as angel
0,i ca n't see any criticism until a bravura jury contains this movie,i do n't know what the people who claim to demonstrate but of course
0,lumumba is a great film,lumumba is charming or provocative but
0,i will only list a few things that did n't require that would help,i must admit that the dictator or iii based solely on her movies pretty much
0,yet coyote sends his heart and tries what has to be the worst thing about,yet the worldweary thriller remains one of the few oldtime dramas i 've seen
0,despite great cinematic experience the aspect was quite weak and took my helsing to move my index finger further,despite the tantrums and a few scenes that seems to me the essence of this is intentional badly scripted and
0,then when all men put their differences on the old man 's brain the rex blows them up,then we are led to believe that peter brown is his brother and he spends a few years back
0,apparently he loves crawford and when she is his own and you will just read you could forget,apparently this film was the result of someone knowing that known this movie is simply pure garbage
0,since the shift is depressing or not why the hell did n't they just drag back together in one shot,since 911 is mainly about rookie attitude by films of our lead i courtmartial if unhappy to distribute expeditions
0,okada you 're supposed to look like you know what you 're dealing with,okada is still one of uttering the monster movies that arise to deliver
0,classic acting and directing all across this flick what 's up with the crappy 80s locations and cursing down the toilet with breakfast,classic level of irreplaceable logical stress turns into a thoroughly compelling and provocative portrait of love on any day of the night
0,the script is perhaps for a rarity and as you watch the action unfold in suspense it becomes painfully annoying but it really ca n't be that far as we are,the film starts off as a somewhat sloppy bore with robert englund overacting and a dry biting display of jack lemmon via his camera movements and james bond 's scope
0,all i can say is that nobody has any,all icing returns to riches equal time style
0,without sure the implication could have given him a little reference to previous films in cinema as he pursues the rest of the,without words because of the beautiful cars by the major players of the hundreds they referred to brando as our main character
0,there really was n't a lot of interesting information here a plot and turned out to be a true love to stunts from the first movie,there is a breast fire and several explosives exploding a crisp malls yet it looks as if they hear what looking for joe 's nite distaste anyway
0,michael niven is quite brilliant as what the lone ranger has to do if you can complete the brooklyn skyline,michael rooker 's early movies with bogart he did so many of his factory roles frequently made his performances both potentially
0,half of the movie is spent any real reason it does n't satisfy the need audience,half the movie is yes of a job just watching an episode closely unrealistic if you understand
0,the rest of the movie is a mishmash of boring jokes one leads up against others for a return to the film and the final sequence reveals that in the middle of the movie the ugliness of the conflict between the two men simply did n't make much sense of going behind a visible shootout as a psycho a student some black guys that kill a dozen weeks later,the idea of a divorce being turned into a performer of the annual wb era institutions and we have a character that receives hold of the same hardnosed pageant and questionable yet does provide one race against our society and starting in on a smaller try by waking up thousands of rwandan peasants this film ai n't 'another science or kurt russell but only a year before the great opening
0,from the start this film finally made me lose a dime in the 80 's but that 's all,from these faults cheesy disappointment is n't worthwhile and it is no surprise that it always does n't come right
0,having to choose the blind situation between alan and hank the girl is enough to,having read oscar wilde the reviews and romances of foreign cinema were beautifully constructed
0,lets start with the series resemblances to other animated episode and the slightly unexpected appearance of jon pertwee as diahann 's reallife officer,lets live without violence angry with wife even in the pants of a medical organization which would literally include a term hint of the
0,this fine movie bears unique excitement without resorting to much of coarse brutality and the one portrayed by several giant detectives is putting a remarkably devastating interviews between them,this film seemed to miss luna even mentioned samantha mitchell on early the sunday season cinemax rejected the fat children who were first timers with their eyesight and dishonesty they
0,in fact porky is his supposed muscle friend and a friend of remorse with the ignorant maria,in lisa 's room he feels like a leggy lady if you ask me tell spongebob

0,rather than profit she has to cope with data ends and costumed family situation,rather than a movie intentionally by it 's soundtrack the plot is n't nearly as
0,i did n't like the comprising some trying to get so a message that will and bore but we get to believe that in the end this is a great film and is n't serving very well either,i was totally enthralled this was one of diane keaton 's most recent film in the charlie chaplin collection and with queen rex i had not yet had an argument with the film due to lack of motivation for
0,because almost none of the singers are timeless and musicians spoke french accents,because i believe this he breaks in deep and becomes erect enough to release
0,amenbar is presented as a menacing nonentity who is also effectively human but never he enjoys her,amenbar would stop it most other captured critics must confront our fears our intelligence our sympathy for ourselves
0,but the acting is great films',but it 's to be on the
0,if any one person were impressed by this travesty and not just hated the first one it,if they could have been created by simon this film could have been a nifty franchise

0,i deeply enjoyed that god help the adopted nurse and they are lovers coming,i remember seeing films like scooby doo and 'the trash of zodiac colon this corpse
0,now off to the con man of all trades if she is away from something,now you can play the more russian version of amelie playing chimps like that
0,i kept watching this film from the director and that only left me dumber to the picture that was happening idiots working,i love mind that all movies are sinister to despise since they abandon pierce brosnan or something missed in his films
0,her longing for a stuff though never works,her performance and camera work in fleischer as the
0,perhaps without other ww2 bias this human led a lot of the killer rules and tries to protect the folks that it was based on,perhaps not all but admire most people who make you want to see a movie that will do you love you killed and appreciated thx
0,i learned scorsese 's class in tomorrow and learned about a tribeca musical instruments because the scriptwriters knew more much for giving us had to,i could not believe how crap this flick was but it was one of the worst films i 've ever seen in my life

0,you tell me when you are screaming which those you hate,you know through a window of yahoo that you feel some empathy
0,the rest of the movie contains gory images from the rock witch up until find the vampire house,the film is shot to a young named newland who is now involved in some with disdain
0,for those who think that los angeles 's real cool side of the stone is made a little more noble i ca n't really say much so i cannot say that this is a big flop and they seem one of the worst acting i have ever 're watching,for all the endless age of the bargain bin the film presents carrie a creepy thriller performer who served minor purpose such as male life and physically aborted masculinity annoyed parties envelop a young starving woman on this planet wasp etc although this is much superior to the equally simple
0,this time around to the surface is like one dreary rogue in the other makes the villain more palatable,this also leads to a somewhat schmaltzy final showdown involving robin using one of the dullest suspects to convince us
0,seriously the movie is a path that is authentically wasted with such rubbish but that cynicism cannot in fact bring more emotional emotion to theater seat,seriously enough this is zoey 's early model that she soon develops us often treated and the cast quote is huge and little soliloquies to them
0,being a mustsee but the main subject of the film not the others are forty miles away,being in the crusades preserve the surrounding religious regime behind morbid america of the victimization of mr black
0,classy experiences remain boring moody incestuous sad unsettling yet an unexpectedly unoriginal intellectually stunning film with very good costumes and a plot that might have,classy contact with the irs 's charles durning has given a walk to frank to performing a prison present as a live homicide agent

1,persuaded him to go out to work with one of the killers in the first place the movie was a real hit and a lot of the other stuff,persuaded for it he gets into a fight between his son and his family and his wife who has the ability to become the leader of the gang
1,this was the worst movie i ever had sat through,this is definitely a movie to watch if you 're a
1,i'm a huge fan of the original,i'm glad i did n't see this movie
1,i have to give this movie two stars because it 's,i think the main point of this is the film
1,maintain a few problems in the first,maintain my own prejudices and beliefs
1,i would recommend this to anyone who can watch the entire movie,i was very glad to read a review of this film and decided
1,finally that is what the director intended to be an egotistical film buff,finally the whole idea of what the writers of this movie could do with
1,the only good thing here is that it is,the acting in this movie is just horrible
1,sure we have the usual bad guys and a bad guy but it really goes into,sure but the real star of the film is the beautiful rachel taylor as mary
1,in the end the film is just plain boring,in this case the film has a very unique look
1,he was also pretty darn nice,he gets to do a decent job
1,the plot was weak but the acting was so cheesy,the acting is ok but the directing is good
1,henri chopra 's score is great for a small amount of screen time,henri was an excellent movie about what was the best and most challenging and
1,even if it were a little cheesy there 's a scene where the camera lingers on the floor and the final cut scene is shot,even after his mom dies we get a glimpse of his character who is in his early twenties a bit of a psychotic father
1,i think it will have to be the most beautiful,i think the filmmakers wanted the movie for the best
1,it 's a great film for a rainy night but it just ca n't be made today,it 's not only a little bit of a thriller that does n't make any sense
1,it would have been better if the director and director were trying to make it more interesting to make a story with some,it 's really a film about a very troubled father and daughter who come together in a life of two different factions
1,like so many different chapters of the film noir and especially the one i think i will always be looking at,like many films of our time it did have a message of being made and in fact the acting was so awful
1,in this movie a couple of the main characters have sex and it takes them out to the end,in the end i thought it would be a good idea to take an old man who could have been
1,actually the scene where the boys are talking at one another and the camera shakes the camera and is constantly shaking the ground of the audience,actually i was n't bored to death or i was a fan of hers or i 've never got the chance to see the whole movie i
1,his performance in this film is as usual as an actual pickle but not a good person,his only redeeming factor is that he is able to play a character and does a little bit
1,fortunately the script of the film has no real purpose in,fortunately that 's what makes the picture such a success
1,i 've seen a few movies so i can say that there is a certain amount of action,i just watched the movie and did n't have high hopes and i thought it had potential as well
1,the plot is quite simple but its not so great to,the acting in the movie seems to be an afterthought
1,you ca n't even watch one movie,you will find yourself laughing aloud when the
1,after the initial shootout on the other side of the spectrum the movie takes you on a journey to see how we deal with the,after the first hour of a movie i was very bored and wanted to see the whole mess and the plot was so good
1,the director has n't done a thing for the film but i do recommend the film makers,the acting is awful except for the lead character and a few other things he 's a pretty
1,the story line is a bit confusing,the movie is very boring and very slow
1,obviously the writers and producers are not trying to make something like this,obviously the story is that bad but the acting is pretty good
1,im surprised how many people on this forum who rated this movie higher than 1 did i have to disagree,im sure the film had a bit of an ending but the ending was really too abrupt and boring
1,any movie of a good script would have made the viewer,any normal man of note might find this a classic
1,better acting directing direction or special effects,better luck the movie is a bit different
1,this film is a true gem of,this film is a total stinker
1,the plot was so stupid that you could n't care less for the characters,the film begins with a bang with several shots and a shot of a bunch
1,they had to leave and the police did n't seem to think it could get any worse,they 're just plain ugly characters that are n't in the movie just the typical clich of all
1,the story was a little disjointed but was still the whole point of,the director has a lot of problems in making films like this
1,the acting in the whole film was so bad that it was hard to believe that the movie was filmed with such a cheap script to it,the film 's premise is as usual a lot less than two or three hours into the story and the characters are n't even remotely interesting at all
1,just do n't waste my time on it you can see it,just to be fair to this movie there is a little too much
1,but it 's still a very entertaining movie,but in fact they could n't have done more
1,it was made as another reviewer noted it was just the worst movie i have ever seen in my life,it 's the same damn movie that made the earlier movies that were made and starred in the movie with the
1,i am not a big fan of the series but i thought the first,i ca n't understand how this movie was released theatrically so many times
1,the story is very basic with the characters,the movie takes a very long time for the
1,from the looks of a noname cast to their respective friends,from the get go i find the whole thing fascinating
1,meanwhile he goes to the city to retrieve and,meanwhile the main character becomes an angry mother
1,it 's an interesting film and a great piece of work but i do think the director should have,it 's a little confusing to see a man like alexandre who is a bit of a stereotype
1,she and her brother move in for a few days but,she is a good man and a very good actress
1,let your life be on your head,let 's face this movie the movie is
1,i thought the movie was a joke and i liked the movie,i 've seen a lot of movies but not for those who have
1,in this case the movie plays two characters who are different from life in the very first form of the movie,in this case i do n't really know why the director would n't be able to take the whole premise out and
1,mother is the only man on the bus and his love,mother and son have a mutual respect for each other
1,they are very much as good as the two characters,they are not in any way connected in a way that
1,they 're on the other hand of a new generation who can not stop the wedding,they make this film a success to me and i must confess that they do not have
1,but this movie is just a good movie,but in the case of a man she 's
1,love of the original is a must,love was one of my favorite
1,as a result this movie 's got a bad bad rap score to it,as for the characters i feel that this movie is more of a family movie
1,i was hoping the film would be a remake in a different vein but alas it would 've been more entertaining,i love the fact that he is a good actor even though he was n't given enough screen time to show
1,this is a very good movie and has the best elements of,this is the type of film i 've paid a visit
1,but the movie is very poor at least,but it is not a bad movie but in
1,while there are some interesting bits in the movie and there are some funny scenes this is the only time of the film,while this may be the story of a man who has lost his wife 's family and the other two friends in his life
1,saloon noise was a great movie,saloon girl has a wonderful look but
1,an entertaining film that 's not only boring but a total waste of,an example of why this film is the best in the world
1,i do n't know how they have the guts to be this proud of it,i have to say that this movie is the worst movie ever put together
1,unique but undeniably enjoyable film that has been shown for years now,unique and very funny and the story of how the young girl and
1,love and hate for the us but this is a good movie to watch,love story the adventures of the men who have been married to a woman
1,not to mention that the only good thing about this is a very good script,not only is the plot a bit of a mess it does n't have its fair
1,i just finished watching this pile of crap and could,i thought the movie might have been much funnier
1,it seems that the makers of this film had tried to make a sequel to,it 's the same thing he makes of a movie that makes you think
1,personally i have just viewed the film,personally i 'd rather watch a documentary than
1,this is not your typical hollywood fare but you will get to find something better in it,this is the type of film that 's supposed to be a horror classic but it 's a
1,dante 's character has a certain fascination with his character who just is n't convincing enough but he 's also the only good thing he can do,dante the director 's editor should have given up his movie career and said this one is the funniest of all the movies i have seen
1,it is a shame that such a classic movie could n't get released theatrically on dvd,it is difficult to believe it 's supposed to be a parody of the same genre that
1,mixup has to be the most boring movie that i all saw on the,mixup is one of his best films that he has done for years
1,before the devil returns home is a complete mess,before she returns to the apartment she becomes an obsessed
1,for an example of how awful this movie,for some reason they did the same
1,the story of a boy traveling through gunpoint to avenge,the only thing that really bothered me was this
1,much of the film takes place in the desert in a remote,much less of the same can be said about the plot
1,the movie starts on two levels and they start to take it as they are trying,the acting is horrible and there is zero chemistry between the characters or the action
1,next we learn that the real killer,next time i was watching it
1,it does have some of the elements of a horror film that is so funny i could n't stand the fact that the zombies were,it is an example of how the director 's script is in the book and what happened when a person died in his life
1,but you will get a lot better,but he ca n't be bothered
1,absolutely horrible movie that i 've seen so far,absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen
1,it was very enjoyable and the story,it is as simple as that
1,the film is about as much fun to sit through,the story is about a group of young boys who are
1,and then he 's got his head on the ground,and the story line is a joke and the movie is
1,the only good moments were the fight on the back of an elevator and the,the movie is n't very funny and is very dull and is n't funny
1,first the film is shot in a style of its own which has its fair share of,first of all it is a great example of how it will be in the theaters
1,there were so many things wrong with watching films,there were no other characters so no real plot development
1,this is a very moving show from start to finish,this was one of the few movies i 've seen in
1,we all knew we had a lot of time to,we can only hope that some will see it
1,suffice it to say that it would take a long time for the movie to get out from a wider audience,suffice to say that the movie 's main focus on the film was that he tried to cram humor into it 's
1,first let 's face it that makes an already good movie,first of all it does seem so long for some kind of
1,the plot is n't all bad,the film is set in south asia
1,the only thing it really was not scary about this piece of trash was that it did n't feature much,the film is so bad that i ca n't imagine any other actor who ever existed at that time
1,an excellent director of the play a film that should have ended in a good way as he had a lot more to offer,an odd plot involving a very young man who wants to find her way into town but she 's left to find a job and
1,he is the first man in the movie and it is also very hard to figure out who,he has the same ability to get a glimpse of the life we have with this film
1,i do n't think that i could have done,i thought the film was so well written
1,kurosawa is a master of the macabre,kurosawa 's film is n't too bad to
1,to my surprise it does get a few of its credit,to be honest i found myself wishing i had watched another movie
1,it is a film that makes me,it was a very poor film
1,the only reason it gets is because of the bad dubbing,the film was pretty awful but it has many faults
1,you will never learn what happened or what is coming and why the people in the movie are so good,you will never want to read the book but do n't expect a movie to be a classic as a kid
1,now if you 're a big fan of the genre then the first series is better to watch,now i'm gonna start with the fact this is the first episode of the show and it shows what
1,some of his films have little to nothing about his life,some viewers will like it as much as i did
1,the plot of the movie is really good and the acting is very impressive,the movie is also very similar to the first and i did n't really care
1,roaming the streets and a couple of good actors all of whom,roaming a bike on a plane with some kind of hand
1,what is even worse is that he,what was a great movie was
1,i think it 's great for anyone 's eyes,i was n't really expecting much from this movie until
1,if this is n't enough for kids who think they 're not really a cartoon you 'll enjoy,if this had happened to be a major flaw of the production it might have been great
1,in the end they find it easy when the girl is kidnapped,in this episode i was n't a fan of the show
1,his character is the villain 's sister or whatever it 's like to,his performance as a young boy is the closest to the character
1,still you have to think it is that bad the acting is pretty bad,still you get to know the man that you 've seen earlier in his life
1,some movies tend to be a comedy and a bit,some are the most obvious aspect of the film
1,zanuck 's film was a complete flop and this is only in the end where the film,zanuck and the cast do very good jobs but the film is filled with pointless dialogue
1,beware of my time but the film is very good,beware and a few other films that are better than this
1,i do n't know how much i liked the movie,i 've seen this film a number of times so i
1,but you know nothing about the film or what it is and it is,but i did n't think the movie was going to be too gory
1,the first part of the film is an exciting one,the acting is good and the direction is excellent
1,i do n't know about you,i thought this is an excellent film
1,instead of watching the film it has the same effect with the same exact same plot that is n't used,instead we just get the feeling that we 're supposed to believe that the movie is about to happen
1,the acting is great particularly in the first act of his last film,the movie is very slow and the acting is just as bad as the
1,they also had to do a decent job and the film also seemed to make up for what they were trying to get,they are so much better than they did and it was obvious that they were trying to save the movie from the film that
1,director jacques audiard has created a very unique film a film filled with a strong cast and a unique story,director david cronenberg has produced a few good films with the exception of a great filmmaker of his type
1,the movie has an excellent story and the,the movie is set in new orleans
1,my friend said that the movie did n't work for me,my only negative criticism is that the movie has a bit of
1,probably the best film i 've seen in a long long time,probably one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen
1,joan crawford and john cusack are great together and the movie never really hits any of the,joan blondell is very good in her supporting form and in this film she is excellent
1,a great deal of money to see,a good story line and a few good
1,a lot of people have said here the plot is a little farfetched and the characters are just stupid,a film that 's so good that it makes me question a question and i did n't want to see
1,this movie really was a waste of good,this movie is n't a great movie
1,sure i do n't care if it is a bad movie but i think this movie was great,sure there is not another aspect of the film that does n't make a lick of sense
1,he is not a great actor but a good guy and an excellent actor and a good actor,he 's supposed to be the killer that killed the dog but he ca n't stop the girl he
1,it is the funniest part in movie history,it is about a very different woman who was
1,it was a really funny movie,it 's the story of a very
1,in fact it 's an old film of a movie that is n't as good as i would have seen it,in fact it 's just a little bit too easy to figure at once at a film school that the viewer might
1,the actors in the first movie were good but they were good,the movie has a little more than its share of moments which are
1,never before was the fun that he did,never mind that they are talking about their love
1,the first half of the film focuses on the lives of a group of people and some of,the film is also about a woman who has her heart and her life in the country
1,no real character development could save this turkey,no other actress has ever known for a film
1,it 's not a terrible film as it is an overlong movie,it also showed the real problems of how the world war 2 ended
1,it would seem that the film was made in the,it is a film i would never watch again
1,ah a few moments but the story line is n't all that compelling and it works in a very interesting way,ah what do you expect a film where the hero is a jerk or a hero or is there anything more to
1,of course we 're supposed to feel like the story is about it and,of course the only character is to be one of the three characters
1,a group of students get married,a film about a bunch of people
1,another highlight is when i went to the film theater to see the,another thing i did not have was the music but i did
1,not just because he likes his movies but in fact a bit in the past is just a,not to mention the fact that i was watching a movie with that little plot about it
1,this movie is an exercise in bollywood 's golden age,this film is a complete insult that is what makes you
1,now i have to go through the comments but i 'll just do,now i can find that the movie is a waste of celluloid
1,i have heard that this is a movie that i could n't believe it,i really enjoyed how the movie got the censors it was in fact that i
1,not that this was a bad movie,not only that but it is still one
1,uncle sam is very good in everything he did and that is why his,uncle america is the kind of person who has just lost his wife
1,on the other hand if you 're thinking about renting it and have some mates who have,on the flip side the film follows the adventures of four couples in a dysfunctional family
1,the acting is horrible the story is weak and i love the actors,the actors are so bad that in many words the director tries to hide
1,yes the acting is horrible and the direction and the acting are,yes the story is well written and the plot is intriguing
1,today a movie with great special effects and a nice plot line it is hard to believe that the movie 's,today the filmmakers of the show have never had to write the script which is more than a little convoluted
1,she 's not a good actress and she does not seem to care much about,she was at least one of the most likable actresses i have ever seen
1,and i have to add to the point why,and in fact that was a lot less
1,the acting is so bad the script is bad and at times the plot,the film is not about the same kind of thing as the original
1,sad to see the director of this film,sad in the movie and i would n't recommend
1,it 's an insult to this,it is a great movie that is
1,aside from some interesting performances and the supporting cast this movie is really quite good,aside from the first few of the episodes the film is just a bunch of random
1,i love to say this movie sucks but it 's,i would n't even give this movie a 7
1,i think this is a great film and it shows that the story is based on a true story,i saw this at a preview screening for a long time and i still found myself wishing it would have
1,fortunately the two leading roles make him a star,fortunately she is still in the film and she becomes
1,i am not sure who they would think of this movie because it was so stupid to watch i was laughing in the,i just wish they had done their version more well because the characters were just a bunch of characters from the book
1,ok we have a movie that looks like it would be an homage to the original,ok so i am an expert i do not understand and is a bit harsh
1,when she finds a woman he is in a hospital with her husband in an attempt to escape her father 's mother,when his mother 's son dies and begins to take care of him his mother 's suicide is so bad and so lame
1,it could have been much better,it 's hard to say that the
1,also the fact that she does get,also it 's all about him
1,at the same time the main problem with these two films is that the director does,at the same time the characters are in full force and they just have fun
1,the only reason i watched it was because there were so many other films out there to make you laugh,the first and most obvious i saw in the theatre was this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,sure but this movie is n't even that well known either,sure the movie does n't have a lot of action but the
1,i love it because the show has a very nice premise and some great episodes,i love to have a little more time but this film should have been called
1,it was a complete waste of time,it was a very good movie and i
1,campbell 's character is an actor in some ways but not a great actor and it seems he has a bad taste,campbell wilson is so good in the role of a preacher who has a crush on him as a father of his son
1,my husband is a movie student on the way to california in,my friend and i all laughed so early during the film
1,i think that the film is a good movie but you,i thought that the characters could have been very funny
1,it was a shame and expected,it could have been done in a
1,unfortunately i could n't have made more sense,unfortunately for her and her mother it seems that
1,i had the privilege to see this and as a child on tv,i just found it hard to believe that the entire family could have been
1,the script is quite clever and the,the film is not a documentary
1,it has the most amazing story line of my childhood and the best thing to come out of the country since childhood and its the best movie ever made to date,it was one of his best films he was able to pull off the part in which she 's a bit over the top but her character was so strong she does
1,ivan is the best actor in the film,ivan van patten is very talented and he 's
1,sue is n't a great woman but she still is n't as funny as i expected her,sue is a wonderful actress and is an intelligent character actress who has a strong charm
1,i 've had some friends who have never known that the,i was n't really impressed with the first fifteen minutes
1,his brother was a man of sorts,his acting is horrible and in his attempt
1,kidnapping of the people he meets in an accident,kidnapping me as the movie was a waste of time
1,analyze is the best film by the master of the director,analyze the movie for a moment that is actually very funny but
1,i'm not a big fan of musicals and i really have n't seen,i'm a fan of the genre but i do n't care what
1,the story is pretty weak the acting is poor and the,the movie has very few interesting characters in the movie
1,this is one of those movies i have not even seen in my lifetime so this is the kind of movie that,this movie also shows up in a small village with a couple of guys with no legs for a few seconds
1,however the director and director decided to show,however this is all the movie about
1,do n't get me wrong i never really liked anything,do not confuse the people with the same review
1,i thought this movie was a bit too slow and too slow but that 's all i could say it has a lot going,i saw it at the toronto international gay cinema fest in the uk when it was broadcast and had a very pleasant family
1,channel 3 was a terrible move but the ending,channel 4 is n't just a tv show
1,let 's put it simply because it was directed by peter ustinov who i thought,let it suffice to say that this is a good and very good movie
1,maybe because of the fact that he was,maybe that 's why it does n't
1,as a fan of the original japanese television show there 's very little to this series,as the movie unfolds and a young girl goes from a home town to a mental breakdown
1,some of the best in the world and a lot of fun,some may disagree that they are in the minority of movies but i
1,it seemed to me like a bunch of people had to have an hour,it 's a movie about love and relationships that we all have to deal with
1,i 've always enjoyed this show for some reason and then,i was n't impressed with the plot and the acting
1,oh my god and i just wanted to kill everyone who wrote this movie,oh and by the way this is a complete ripoff of the original
1,since then they 're all good,since i have been to the area
1,the plot of the movie is the same as the first two films,the film is very similar to the earlier films and also the one that
1,yes i do n't get the chance to see this film but if it is on the video or dvd i would purchase it,yes that 's right it would 've been a lot better if the movie had been more interesting but the story line is so poorly
1,it 's a lot of fun to watch,it is the ultimate message of life
1,and i ca n't tell how much the film makers of,and why is this movie so popular and so far
1,also the fact that the film was made as much as a horror flick is pretty obvious,also there are some pretty nice touches of dialogue and some scenes are in the trailer
1,the movie is so bad i just ca n't get it on a theater lol,the acting is horrible and the acting is just below average as the acting was n't
1,okay i 've seen the same bad,okay that 's exactly what you 're looking
1,hell i saw the movie the day it ended,hell i love the fact that these are the movies
1,its just too bad to have seen this crap,its a waste of time if you can find it
1,the whole movie is just another dull mess from the start of the movie,the story of the mother of four young girls is a mystery drama that has
1,time for the future to occur,time has come to shove in the
1,this is n't one of those movies,this is not a horror film it 's
1,that 's about as much as you can get,that was the only reason why this movie was so
1,the film is so bad that it makes the entire movie laughable and,the film starts out well with a lot of twists and turns
1,the film is n't perfect in its own right and the actors are mostly all bad,the film is set in a very small town and the sets are often very cheap
1,he does n't even come close to it until one character gets the chance to use a few,he also has a knack for taking a trip in which he is forced to kill the people from
1,of fact it is a shame,of course she 's not a very
1,well there 's a lot of plot in this movie and i,well i can forgive the movie because i ca n't tell
1,now we see them both as a sort of act of the two,now the two guys have some weird moments together in what appears to be
1,both of which have already been seen in film adaptations but the first one with the same title,both women are a little too common though and there are plenty of other movies that should have been
1,therefore the rest of the cast including their fellow costars are n't very good as the two leads,therefore the film is about a group of women who have an affair and the film begins
1,the acting is good as far as i am concerned with it,the story is a mishmash of events in all respects and is simply
1,it is a very good story,it is a real treat from all
1,this film was a waste of time but it certainly is a film that should be banned on dvd,this movie was a very good movie i thought it 's going to be the biggest star wars movies i
1,why on earth did the makers of this piece of trash have no,why not have a director that 's making a film like these
1,that 's why i loved it but i think the movie just did,that 's the only complaint i 've had for the whole film
1,is this the same kind of thing and it just happens,is that really the movie the point you 've seen about it
1,and then the two main characters are a bunch of friends and friends,and the music is very bad the soundtrack is horrible to me
1,the first time i saw it was to a friend who had the misfortune of watching the first one in the theater but still i thought it was funny,the movie has a lot of twists which is a nice thing to say when we get to the end of the film and it 's very interesting at times
1,you know this is supposed to be a romantic comedy but it is so ridiculous,you will also love the movie but i would give it a 1 for that
1,clearly she 's a victim who is a little too much and it is hard to imagine how she got a job,clearly the movie does have a lot of problems but it has the same level of style for those who know that there
1,also the plot is just plain stupid,also the ending is a bit abrupt but
1,that said this movie is a complete,that 's just what you can
1,in fact the only thing you 'll see coming out of him is that he makes a difference in his,in a way you would know something about it and you are left feeling very sorry for the actors
1,but what was wrong with the film at the time,but i ca n't say this is a classic
1,there are two other movies in this that are made to date the most,there is no real plot there is no excuse you must feel it
1,furthermore this movie is not about the same people as the real life it is also rather a psychological study about the consequences that occur during,furthermore the movie is not as funny as the first and as long as i had missed all its flaws it is n't the best
1,the plot is that you 're supposed to,the characters are all interesting and believable
1,legendary and talented actors like john wayne and john wayne are a wonderful combination of talent and skill,legendary actors do not appear to be the real person in the movie but he does have a bit
1,no one will notice this as the worst thing in the film,no one is going to get a chance to make this a movie
1,my friends and i were laughing at the camera and the audience and it 's a nice,my son and i saw this movie and i was so disappointed that it was rereleased
1,the film is a complete disaster of the genre,the plot is simple and is interesting enough but the
1,the story of the film is as follows the lives of,the main character is a woman who is constantly pregnant
1,add to the mix a new actor and it is an attempt at a new version of his,add to the mix an eerie atmosphere of the movie 's atmosphere and of course the music
1,at first i thought it was a very good movie,at least it 's an attempt to make the audience laugh
1,this is one of those movies,this movie is n't a total waste
1,as an avid reader he 's always been very good,as a fan of this series the show is not nearly
1,let 's just start off by giving it the benefit the director deserves,let it be on the top 250 if you are a fan of the
1,parents of those who are looking for,parents will not regret this show
1,it 's a movie and i wish that i had to watch it over and,it is just a good movie that will be lost forever on the dvd
1,the movie opens with a scene in which tom goes on a rampage in which,the plot is about something very real and it has a very good story
1,entertainment value was never really necessary to watch,entertainment value of horror movie is n't a bad
1,far beyond that i have never seen an episode of a show where the jokes or gags are funny,far too long for its failings the only two of the three characters who seem to have been a caricature
1,when the film is done it 's a movie that everyone should see,when i started watching this show i felt that they had just wasted an
1,plus i do n't know why people who think it is so,plus it was a pretty funny movie especially the one time
1,that 's the only thing that made me laugh out loud a,that is the reason why he made it into a movie
1,or if you have a taste of,or in one way or another
1,it may also be hard to believe in an american,it 's a good film that you might enjoy
1,charlotte rampling as an actress who has no,charlotte rampling who is very good also
1,we know what he has in this movie,we get a glimpse of the relationship between the
1,obviously it was the fact that the film ran a few years prior to its initial release but also with many,obviously a bunch of people who want to spend their vacation in a big city building are n't very happy
1,she and his father 's girlfriend try to find out,she just does n't have anything going for it
1,the acting is excellent the script is flawless and the writing of the film was so good i had to fast forward,the only saving grace for this movie is that it is based on an actual book that is actually quite good
1,not in the same way he 's,not just for kids not kids
1,basically this was the best of the bunch of the series and,basically it is the same thing we had to get through
1,joel mccrea also shows up in the scene when she does n't know where to go to the door,joel schumacher has done a good job of bringing the show into a whole different mood but is n't too
1,i think a lot of money was spent to pay for this movie,i 've also liked this movie and i would not have to watch it
1,imaginative story line is the perfect example of what you 're looking for,imaginative acting from john rhysdavies and robert ryan who plays both his character in
1,we 're supposed to be a huge fan of the film industry so i do hope that i do n't want to see them as,we never really learn that his mother is in love with a child but she is n't happy in the world as being her
1,it 's a story with plenty of laughs to keep the audience interested,it does n't seem like they would have been much more on the show
1,in other words it is a comedy and an action scene for the rest stop there,in a way it 's so bad that i almost lost my sides from the beginning
1,from the opening scene where the camera is on the bed,from the opening scene to the end you 're hooked
1,the acting and acting is terrible although i,the actors in this film are great
1,this is just a very cheap film with no redeeming part whatsoever,this movie was a perfect example of how a movie about an american
1,talk about how he 's going to go and save his wife from his wife,talk out of the ordinary for the movie to be a bit of a cult classic
1,i am not sure why they should remake this,i would suggest that this is the only thing that
1,only one of the actors in the film would have been better suited to this movie 's success and not been so,only the people who thought this was a great film should be ashamed and to see for all the wrong reasons
1,of course you have no idea that something will happen to your head so there are no words and,of course we 're not supposed to feel that way too much in order to understand the plot
1,but this is a bad film and in a very bad way,but that was n't the point of what they would be if the
1,but it just does n't have any real problems,but that 's exactly why the filmmakers decided to make
1,garbo who is also the first one in her career has an incredible performance,garbo is also the main character to be a star and actress she portrays a
1,this is a great film for everyone who loved the book,this was a film that was a perfect combination of comedy and
1,out of ten i was a little surprised by the fact that the film was made,out of nowhere this movie really did n't end until the end of the movie
1,occasionally they did n't seem to have any reason to see a movie which is a waste of an hour,occasionally i was disappointed at the time that the director of the movie was a fan of a story
1,an old tv show made by a teenager,an interesting one is an extra bonus
1,this movie could have been done in a different way,this film shows the true life of people who live in
1,this was supposed to be one of,this movie is a real masterpiece
1,the movie does n't work and does n't get it adequately into a bit,the plot is a complete mess and i have nothing to recommend it
1,the main focus here is that the film was about 3 hours long,the movie starts as the movie picks you off into the woods with the
1,in the meantime a man has n't seen the first,in fact the film has some great music score
1,soldiers and civilians are sent into the prison to go through the,soldiers were very good and could n't stand on the outside
1,the story is that it is set up in a few scenes when in real,the film also feels as though he is enjoying the movie as a whole
1,suddenly the movie is shot and it 's all about an insane man,suddenly he meets a girl and they fall in love with a very strange
1,as the final credits rolled i knew the movie was going to be a total dud,as for the story it 's not as funny as it is a very funny film but
1,for those who have n't seen this movie i think that it would take to a new level,for example when a man is walking out of her car he looks like a cross between a rock
1,before i wrap up a film i do n't want to give it to me,before the final shot i was a little hesitant to see what happens at the end
1,if anything the movie is a waste of time,if you want to watch the film with a couple
1,turner lundgren does a fantastic job with the cast,turner and the other performers deliver this film
1,it 's very hard to understand who 's who are the guys at,it does n't take a lot to realize the director and director
1,i have seen several films of the same age but in the end i thought this one was a bad choice from that movie,i have to assume that he was one of hollywood 's most prolific actors to date for all he did for paramount and his career
1,basic premise and the script were very good,basic instinct is a story about the holocaust that
1,and the ending is the best ever,and this is where the movie starts off
1,that 's why i gave this movie a,that was a lot of my advise
1,the movie begins to fall into a real slow mode where you,the film 's title makes no excuses to be a film
1,i was very impressed that they actually went,i think this movie was a joke
1,he does n't want to be his,he is a very bad film
1,ruggles has an affair with her boyfriend,ruggles and pressburger have created a wonderful comedy
1,the film is very funny in the extreme,the characters are all good and the script is
1,a little more than a bit less than a waste of time but this film is not bad either,a lot of the humor is just flat as the movie is a bit of fun to watch but i
1,i ca n't imagine how people could like this movie and i would like to warn you it 's just a cheap horror picture,i do not care how anyone who 's been interested at that time would want to watch a movie that makes this movie a must
1,was the only good thing about the,was this a very interesting idea
1,grace and his friends are a dime for the,grace for the first time as an actor
1,the movie is a mess for anyone who likes this sort,the plot was pretty stupid and the acting was horrible
1,obviously she does n't need to make the story of a woman to be seen as a good actress,obviously this was n't a good choice for the writers to have their brains cut out to the point of
1,but what did i get when i heard this had been done at my local video store,but if you have seen the original and do n't think that 's too good it is an
1,the cast was good although i did enjoy the movie,the film is a masterpiece but the acting is superb
1,this is the worst horror movie i,this is a very bad film
1,he plays an important role of his wife,he should n't have done it again
1,needless to say they are very good,needless to say the script is full of
1,direct to video sequels and the original movie was a big disappointment,direct from the start of the film i was n't impressed by any
1,a very funny film that you will have to see,a few scenes are not the usual one with the usual
1,the characters were so bad it 's laughable,the cast is n't bad and the plot was
1,possibly the worst movie i 've ever seen,possibly the worst of the three series of films
1,firode 's film was a great movie,firode 's character development is not very convincing
1,it has been done in a very good manner and in several instances i think,it is a film that i can appreciate but it just goes way far
1,one of her favorite scenes was when she was asked to take over her baby 's home,one of my favorites though is that the story revolves around a young woman who goes to the
1,yes there 's some interesting scenes,yes there 's no plot and the
1,before she 's the mother and is one of the most interesting things i 've seen in a movie in years,before i begin watching and read the book a friend of mine i had not read about the book for this adaptation
1,it 's a great combination of a good movie but not as good as the other two,it 's like a documentary but i do n't like the original but i have to disagree with
1,i love the scene where the two main characters and it are,i was n't looking for an accurate adaptation of the book
1,that 's why people should have known that it was a bad idea for an actress as she was trying to,that does n't matter too much as a film of the type where all the action happens in the beginning
1,reanimator 's character is a little bit crazy but it also makes him one of the most lovable people,reanimator has been released on dvd as soon as the original and as soon as it 's available
1,the only good thing was the plot,the script is pretty lame as it lacks
1,i saw this movie on my first viewing,i am a huge fan of the original series
1,evil is a perfect movie for the whole family to watch and i highly recommend this movie for all you diehard fans of old school,evil dead was the first film i enjoyed the first three sequels but i think that the second is the sequel to the sequel
1,the movie starts off pretty quickly and then disappears to the,the main character of the story is about the son
1,i was n't sure enough to take this movie because it was so funny,i do n't know why it is the best but it 's a movie that
1,heck it has the same kind of person that is the devil king 's pet dog and that 's the point you 'd like,heck what does you expect from a movie about a bunch of people who try to steal money from their bank for themselves
1,i have seen it in a couple of years and it was a lot better and more fun to watch,i have seen many of the series that i 've seen for the first couple of years and never forget that
1,this film is a masterpiece of epic proportions,this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,now i 've seen the first one,now there is a certain sense of humour
1,as with the other movies in the world,as a result of their lives of the two
1,the acting is terrible and the special effects are terrible,the story of a young woman who moves from a small
1,good to all my friends and i have my own copy of the film,good acting good direction great music lots of action scenes and a good story
1,oh and a couple of the actors in the movie have,oh yes the movie is an enjoyable experience in itself
1,if you have a choice to see a movie that 's funny and enjoyable,if you want to make fun of the original it 's just great
1,there are a lot of other films,there is something about this movie
1,at times he does n't have to face the situation at all and the whole,at this point i can not believe a film is a masterpiece of art
1,it really is a very poor movie,it also seemed to lose its footing with
1,martin sheen 's character was one of the first major characters to come out with his character,martin landau was also very convincing as the cop and the movie had no point where everything was
1,to be fair the actors are n't really the only people who could act better,to say this is my favorite movie is n't my idea of this movie
1,this film is the perfect example of why,this time the movie begins with a young woman
1,though he is not a very bad guy in my opinion it is n't,though the movie is quite good it 's almost an hour long movie
1,the only reason i went see it was that it was on showtime,the film has a great cast and it 's a great performance by willis
1,so he 's a pretty decent actress and does an ok job,so he gets a lot of money and his car is used in
1,fred willard is n't a total jerk and he seems to be a part of his gang to have a career,fred willard who plays the main character has an affinity for the role of a hitman who believes he is the best
1,developed to give us a real sense of humor the film just is not very good,developed as a vehicle for a movie that had an audience with such a great concept it
1,also the film is a great example of a movie,also it would have been a good film in the hands
1,the film also has an underlying message to the story,the plot of the movie is about an english couple who
1,i 've seen this film countless times,i think a lot of movies were made
1,i'm not kidding it in my opinion that it would be more of a thriller,i'm a fan of the original series of films such as this i think
1,i have never seen such an amazing film and while there are no redeeming qualities,i really like her and have n't seen a lot of her other films
1,the story of two sisters is very good,the film does n't need a strong plot or
1,then the guy gets killed by a gang of thugs with a,then i had a headache and this was a good show
1,this is a good film for people who love it,this is a film that does not go unnoticed at all
1,if anyone is interested in this film i would like to say that it really is the scariest film ever,if you can find the uncut version with a restored version available on vhs for purchase dvd or vhs and dvd
1,i think i should have a movie about a guy who just wanted to make a film about a real,i think the filmmakers have a lot of fun making this so i 'll give it a fair score
1,although this film is not as polished as i would have liked it it 's still fun to look at and even the ending,although some of the dialogue is not as bad as they would have been in an attempt to get out of the film it 's
1,off his work the only thing about the movie that i wanted to,off screen i thought was the coolest movie i have ever seen
1,the acting is poor and the story is so poor that i wonder how it would be a waste of time and,the music is also very very very good and some of the scenes are well done and the scenes are great
1,only the most ardent and the worst ones ever do,only a couple of minutes are spent a lot of time
1,this is a very interesting movie for the whole family,this is a story of a young boy who is caught
1,he 's a great director who manages to create a movie for its,he is also very convincing and makes up for it very well
1,a lot of the movie 's plot is just plain stupid but there is no denying of this,a lot of the plot and the characters are very good but not all of them are very memorable
1,costner was in an early silent movie and as usual he does,costner 's character was the epitome of one of the best
1,arthur 's mother a woman who is a lawyer in a nightclub,arthur and andre are the same as they are with each other and
1,they are so good in their roles,they are all very talented but they do
1,i was hoping that the filmmakers would throw in that a lot,i would have known that this was a very poor movie
1,i 've heard the book and read some of the comments here saying there are a few flaws,i would have loved to see more of them in a row or a dream and the movie could
1,when the guy is a girl they decide to be a good boy,when a young man is killed and taken away the whole time and he
1,claiming that it would be a good idea for someone who can do a good job but a bad person should make an argument for the writer and writer that this should be an insult to anyone who is in,claiming to be an old fashioned tv film with the same director and a couple of actors who have no choice but to play their parts of the movie and their work it works very well in the movie
1,the acting is ok too the story and,the plot is n't even that good
1,i 've never seen it so much on my hands,i am a fan of david lynch but i think you
1,it is like they 've got to be a little more interesting to me that this show is,it 's a very funny and clever comedy and i do like the way it is portrayed
1,it 's also quite interesting if it were that bad,it 's just an attempt to shock the audience through a
1,she was able to play the lead character in a film that was n't quite funny,she does not know how to make a movie but the girl is killed by the car
1,its about one of their better enemies,its not a very scary film
1,the film 's title has an ancestor of a girl who is constantly murdered and is,the music is fantastic the cinematography excellent the script is brilliant the writing is perfect
1,if only a friend of mine has watched it and who said i would n't have,if you want to see some more of her work see her as a woman
1,i was very impressed by this film,i do n't think there are any redeeming
1,the ending is a complete downer,the first is the music and the
1,jason robards was one of the actors playing the guy who made this a really great and underrated,jason scott has a great supporting role as he is on the show from the first episode
1,almost every time they made an appearance i laughed and then i laughed at,almost every joke in the book is the same which is n't funny
1,two girls of the town are murdered by a deranged psychopath who 's only on,two of the greatest actors ever play the characters who are in real life
1,it would have made it a nice one,it 's not only that the two of them
1,and i think he has done better,and the music is good but the movie
1,but if they had all of them they had the,but the film is a complete waste of time
1,with the exception of the one that 's supposed to be the same the film is a good film,with the addition of a couple of other films this was one of the best i 've seen in an
1,the acting is ok but the story is n't as bad as it could have been,the movie does boast a very interesting story with a bit of a plot and a little
1,i am not a huge fan of this movie but if,i love the film so i will never get bored
1,someone should stick up the film,someone said it was just bad
1,heck this is a movie that has some redeeming,heck this is one of my favorite movies
1,the only reason this show is so great is that it is a,the whole film does not even have the feel of a movie
1,i 've seen more than two movies,i 've been watching several movies on tv
1,according to most of the movie 's comments this show stands out as a great comedy,according to what i saw and hear about this film there is a very nice atmosphere to
1,if you are looking for a great movie and you need to watch every second of it you do n't see any of,if you are looking for something that makes you feel like you have a child 's face you 'll be sorely disappointed
1,i think the film has a nice enough appeal to the film 's atmosphere to give it an interesting edge,i think it was the intention to make this show that it was a very poor attempt to exploit it
1,an excellent film from start to finish,an excellent film that deserves some respect
1,many of the cast are fine including a good cast a solid direction,many things are not explained but the way the characters are portrayed
1,the acting was poor the plot was boring and stupid the acting was terrible and it was hard to believe that there was a scene,the story is a bunch of people trapped around a world where they can just walk down and down and down for one person
1,al pacino is in a league of films,al pacino is just great in the role of
1,all i can say is it was a waste of my time,all the other reviewers are raving on here the acting is bad the
1,her life has never been to her and her boyfriend will never leave the island,her character is the only reason why i did not have to watch it
1,and the movie is a pretty decent experience,and i have n't laughed so hard so deeply
1,i just do n't see how people who can,i have seen most of the other episodes
1,not that the story is anything that was n't logical and could be developed into a film but the plot is not very original,not even as one dimensional person the guy who played the other characters with a lot of his hair on the side of the story
1,as far as i can remember the music was very,as to whether it be the plot or not
1,in a way i did think that i could n't stop wondering how did the film,in the end there is a lot of sex in the world as it was shown but
1,thus i do n't get the point it gets too,thus a movie can take place in the us
1,the story is very good and it 's really a good movie,the first scene was the most exciting thing in the movie
1,marvin 's mother has also been married to a married man for a while,marvin is a young student who has no problem facing a crime syndicate
1,although not a classic film i have seen it twice,although it seems obvious that the main actor is a complete
1,the only thing i can say about this is that it has the same kind of plot and character development,the characters are shallow and annoying with some of the best lines from the two movies in the movie
1,i think that the reason for this is the lack of a good story,i had been impressed to find that this is not as good as the book
1,the movie was made during the 80 's when a few of us were used to see the film and we laughed at it,the acting is excellent from the leads but they are all excellent and their scenes are well suited to a few of them
1,the film has been edited on tv for one reason only because of the fact that it 's not even a horror classic,the cast is excellent especially goldblum and pfeiffer and while the characters themselves are pretty believable there 's plenty of action to be sure
1,there is very little to criticize the movie except for the fact that they all,there are a few twists in the film that are n't really worth it
1,are we really supposed to laugh,are we to believe that the director
1,it 's just that a movie with no real purpose to this movie,it 's a shame that a movie can still be released theatrically on dvd
1,wonderful acting and some good stunts,wonderful film from the director of the
1,my favorite scene in any film is the climax where a,my wife and i had to watch the film twice
1,so much for the acting and the direction and direction and the plot and,so we do not have the feeling that the director was a genius
1,much of the action focuses upon the two brothers in the background who seem to be trying,much like the series i thought they were going to get the characters on the air
1,it 's not a classic film that you ca n't get a chance to see it in the theater and,it is one of those shows that you really should have seen the first time to watch every episode
1,you 're in for one hell of a ride,you will not be able to see any of the
1,but it 's not as though this is a movie designed as,but there is nothing here that can be forgiven for that
1,down until the last twenty minutes and still irritates the viewer and,down to that point the movie is full of funny gags
1,if you do n't mind this show is the same thing you 've already seen,if you want to get a movie look at the characters and enjoy the ride they
1,but the rest of the film is so incredibly,but i still do n't get that far
1,music is the best and i think the music is,music by robert englund is one of the best
1,the story line is also a mess but the performances of the leads the movie 's charm and the performances are,the film begins in a bar where the group lives at a house and is invited to an underground house
1,recommended for all ages that should not be,recommended from a friend and a lover
1,the acting was very good and the plot was interesting,the story is a little thin but i suppose the filmmakers
1,there 's also some nice scenery and some,there were a lot of great songs
1,meanwhile it 's not so much the focus,meanwhile the woman begins to kill him
1,some people say that there are a few faults i found this,some of the special effects are just so poor to watch
1,confessing the real world and of course this could be the best film in my book collection,confessing to his family 's work and the two have a secret meeting with a young woman
1,the film does not work well,the cast is excellent the characters engaging
1,the only redeeming value is that it was made for about two quarters of the movie,the film has a lot to do with it 's own and it 's a little jarring
1,the acting is superb from the leading actors and the story itself is great,the first movie was a good one which had a certain effect on the subject
1,by the end of the movie a bunch of teenagers take a bath on a deserted island and try to find their way home,by watching this movie i can not think of any other one that has a chance to be the same with the first one
1,overall the movie is well worth seeking out,overall i have n't seen the film
1,matt has no trouble solving problems for any reason,matt dillon makes an appearance as the sheriff and it
1,a very good documentary and a fantastic film with superb acting,a movie for this kind of film to be a success
1,at the end the movie is about how it was done to a t it seemed like,at least not a good movie but the movie itself makes an excellent movie of yesteryear
1,margaret reid plays the young victoria and she is very good in the movie as it is an important role,margaret and her daughter are also in the house and the girls are very attractive and they look like they are
1,the first scene is a masterpiece with a few chuckles in,the script by michael moore is a very funny movie
1,most of the film is about the war as if he 's trying to convince his students the most important story of the american revolution,most of the time they show in this movie how they are in the film as long as they are not the same as if they
1,the director is not going to be a fan of this film,the story is simple enough in a way that is the result of
1,unfortunately he has an enormous amount of money and his own,unfortunately a man who gets a good deal is a young man
1,all in all this is a very good thriller and a good,all in all this movie is a great piece of work
1,there is some of the best dialog in the movie that was not the least bit,there is absolutely no chemistry whatsoever but it 's also funny in its own right
1,the story was that of the main character and the movie seemed a little disjointed and it seemed so rushed,the main reason i did n't think i would be was the soundtrack and the way it was done
1,the main characters the film are also based on actual events,the film is about a family who are caught by their son
1,to me this was probably the worst of the two sequels,to be able to make a sequel i was very wrong
1,urich is the ultimate hero and she 's the perfect suspect for,urich is not a very good actor he just does that
1,tragedy is the only place in the movie,tragedy is n't a very good movie
1,stash of the living action is one of the best movies i have seen,stash of blood is a film where you feel bad for you and want to
1,i did not find the movie funny and that 's how i felt when,i thought this movie would be a good thriller but it failed miserably
1,those who love the first movie will see this movie for being a good action movie,those who are willing to accept the world 's atrocities are not the world war ii but
1,it seems like it is just too hard to get out of your mind and you can find a good guy,it has been said about it and i hope that it stays with me for the rest of my life
1,in short i would n't have to go with the plot line to save it,in this film however the main character is the father of a son and a child
1,i was looking for something to happen and this film did n't work as one,i would love it if this had the potential for the main plot or acting and
1,having a few friends that i have to watch on tv or a few of,having said i did like him for this movie it was a huge disappointment
1,while there has to be a bit of gore in the entire movie there 's nothing inherently interesting about the film,while the actors in the film were so bad it 's almost embarrassing to listen up for a few scenes
1,however that movie was a good idea and it was a little disappointing,however it is very easy to make a movie with a title like this
1,the story has a certain consistency that is somewhat reminiscent of the previous film,the acting is awful the direction is worse the story is n't funny
1,the plot is ridiculous and predictable,the plot is simple in many instances
1,yes it has plenty of action going for it but it 's pretty much all of,yes but not only that there are still three things the movie 's worth it
1,kevin kline is the perfect actor as the villain he has the best lines in the movie,kevin conroy plays a very sympathetic and likable guy on the show who plays the role of john
1,gabriel 's character was so ridiculous that i felt the urge to leave him in order to get to the bottom of the story,gabriel has always been the perfect man for a tv audience so he should be proud about taking the same name for himself
1,i did n't even care about any of,i just saw this movie in london
1,water is a very interesting story about,water in particular is a movie
1,writerdirector john woo 's debut feature length the postman and the dead end street,writerdirector david cronenberg also has a very interesting look and feel to it
1,now the whole thing is set in a crumbling city in a small town and,now i would n't recommend this movie unless you are an orthodox film lover
1,complete bs the first thing i could of done was when a film was,complete crap and i hope they will rerelease it in hollywood so quickly
1,this movie has its moments and i found myself cheering for some of,this is the story i thought was good but did not deliver
1,if you want to have a good time you will not get your eyes out you 'll miss the first movie and if you want to,if you 're looking for a movie that could make good use of the material then be prepared for what it is a good idea
1,i'm glad she did not give a good performance but that 's no more of a bad thing in my opinion,i'm not a big fan of the genre but it was still good for the old horror fan the best
1,there are a few things that do n't work for me,there are a few twists which will never make sense but the
1,it takes place at the north pole,it 's very difficult to suspend disbelief but
1,the movie opens well with the introduction of the viewer at the very beginning,the director and writer tried to make it seem realistic and in a way that
1,you 're not really a fan of this kind of thing,you see the actors in the theater are all so bad and
1,did n't they have the money to tell you the truth,did n't he know it to go and get him and he
1,disenfranchised and his son have all been caught up in a world war ii so they,disenfranchised 's performance and the acting ranges from good to worse with the whole cast
1,the story was great and the characters and their relationships were,the movie has an intriguing story and an interesting story
1,paddy considine and john cusack are the only one able to pull off the leads in this movie,paddy considine is a wonderful director and should be ashamed and proud for this film to be remembered by
1,if they had n't done a remake of it i 'd probably never have made it to dvd,if you 're a fan of italian comedy movies like the patriot or the exorcist you will probably like
1,i could have made a movie about my life and i had to go to,i am still trying to understand who 's going to go ahead for me
1,it has so many plot holes and so many subplots it becomes laughable,it 's like the makers had a budget that was to create a new
1,and the last part of the movie is about a,and the ending is just a bit too old
1,the whole idea for him is a complete lack of interest in his character and his performance is the same,the whole thing is just pointless and stupid but as a whole you really got to know the characters
1,and that the actors were so real,and i am a very jaded viewer that
1,i thought the movie was a great work,i would love to see a movie with this
1,she has n't been very convincing but her role for the film has never been so believable for her as she does here,she and her parents are both a great combination of the two and a half of each other and how they get into
1,but for a lot of reasons why ca n't be more so than the sequel as you have a few things,but then there you get a movie where you ca n't take your kids to a whole bunch of kids
1,lastly i found that i thought this film was excellent,lastly the cast was quite poor and it did n't even
1,this is a good little comedy with a good twist but a few twists,this movie has been put in its rightful place by the critics who have been
1,to sum it up just watch the opening scene,to sum it up this is not a good film
1,todd is just a bad actor and there are no redeeming qualities in this flick which i would like to point the out of 10,todd is an expert of his own but it 's always a relief to find an artist who is unable to make his work
1,spend the money on a dvd,spend your time with this one
1,if not that is what i got,if the viewer has to give up any
1,marilyn 's character is a complex one with a very difficult and loving,marilyn monroe is a delight and the cast is very well done
1,the movie is a complete mess,the film is one of the best
1,this is a very bad bad movie,this is just one film in which you
1,i have to assume that the director is trying to convey this to his audience,i 've seen a few films from the director that have been very good so i
1,but you will know what to do because the movie is n't as good as you might have been able,but the rest of it is n't very much a little bit different in the style of the original
1,they did n't even mention it,they 've just been a pair at
1,probably the most irritating film of the year,probably the best of these four films
1,let me repeat it again this one is a masterpiece of a movie,let 's face it the director does not know it to be that bad
1,in the end it just becomes very irritating with the exception of this man and her two,in fact he gets a little more screen time than he does in the first one
1,even with these actors that they are n't a good one,even the action scenes are laughable and there you go
1,sadly that makes it a little tedious and boring,sadly that is about as much fun as it gets
1,also some of the scenes are a bit,also starring michael caine and robert culp
1,this is one of the worst movies i,this movie has an excellent story line
1,tom wilkinson had a great deal of,tom was an extremely bad guy
1,but in the end he 's a great movie,but as an adult i still remember something good
1,richard crenna is one of the few actors that you could believe in him,richard gere played the young and loving wife who is still a joy to watch
1,although i'm a fan of the genre it 's definitely not worth commenting on the film 's success,although there were no surprises here there were so many elements that were n't as interesting as the original
1,he 's a pretty girl a woman so a bad guy,he is a great actor as he is the perfect foil to
1,too bad she got paid for it,too bad for a movie i have just
1,much like the characters in the movie we just ca n't,much of it does n't even make sense to me
1,very little the story of the film,very disappointing movie with lots of action thrown
1,i really wanted to say this is a great movie,i was so glad to see such a poor film
1,the acting is so bad they 're all good to watch,the story is a bunch of kids from the same era who
1,i would not be surprised if that was a good movie if not the story 's direction,i have watched it over and over because the story and the characters are so underdeveloped that it
1,in some of her other movies of this,in conclusion this film is quite entertaining
1,the movie was not really very good,the script was good and the direction was
1,case is one movie that should n't take long to see,case is a film that does n't make much sense
1,it has a few funny moments but i would,it 's like a play at one point
1,rejecting it 's own story is the most disturbing and graphic aspect of it to,rejecting these movies is an interesting idea for a film to be released with
1,the movie is filled with great performances by actors,the story is simple and the characters are so believable
1,so much for a young boy who likes a movie and that is the first of,so the only thing that kept me watching was that the ending was quite suspenseful
1,lai plays a character he has the potential for an early 80 's early on to play football,lai is very good as the slimy but honest butler but is not a character who is so overthetop
1,the movie is pretty boring and is full of unnecessary twists and turns,the film starts with two people with a different kind of sexual intercourse than
1,on the way there and they are talking for a lot of them i do,on the downside the story is pretty basic and the ending is quite predictable
1,so i can see the movie,so i am going to do it
1,the plot is n't the least bit funny the character designs are n't bad either,the movie follows the adventures of the family in the late 20s and the us and
1,also i think the director who made the most memorable part,also the plot is so stupid that it is unbelievable
1,shameless but i liked it a bit,shameless spoiler in the scene the hero is
1,she 's also the only one who thinks that he is the,she 's just in this one for her looks and acting
1,in the end we are not sure if the killer is,in this case it 's a really really great movie
1,meant to be funny i was n't going to be able to see this movie,meant to be a bit less and more interesting this film 's premise is quite simple
1,when the two men have the exact same fate they are forced to confront their relationship and the two remaining men who get caught up in the same circumstances,when all the problems of life were made into this movie i found myself wanting to see a movie about the way in which they had been in the war
1,soderbergh 's performance in the film was so poor he was barely recognizable in any way,soderbergh made it a film that had all its virtues and has been produced by several other
1,the movie is just an attempt to capitalize on the original book by the same name,the acting is so bad it makes me wonder how this film could have made the film
1,as a fan of these movies i thought this was pretty good,as much as i like the show it is a little slow
1,cast and crew have a great deal of talent here,cast it 's like they are playing a role in all
1,i think this is a really bad movie,i think the film makers wanted to make this
1,but this is just too much of a sided,but in the final analysis we can see why
1,the cast is superb the script is perfect and the characters all feel as if they had real,the film has to be seen as the only one i have ever seen in a theater
1,the script is about as predictable and boring as it sounds,the acting in this show was superb and the music was wonderful
1,the movie begins to have a few good moments but it 's just so predictable,the only good thing about this movie is that it 's a very poor story but
1,the first half hour is just awful,the acting was great and the music was
1,what i like this is the ending,what i liked most about this movie is
1,the only way to make a film like this,the acting is pretty good but the characters all get
1,on the other hand if you love kathy bates you will love this version,on my website i could n't stand by a single person from the director 's
1,he is also a good man in the,he has a great deal of talent
1,the story has been told to many people and there are times,the film 's plot was a bit predictable and did nothing
1,furthermore i have no idea and i was in this movie,furthermore the director of the film is very much a director as
1,long ago he meets the woman who is in the apartment of the local doctor,long before this movie was n't the main character in the movie i knew there are
1,the movie is a mishmash of what should be a good idea to spend,the movie is pretty much a parody of a series of tv sitcoms
1,if you 're a diehard fan of the genre this is one of those movies you will always remember,if you 're going to have a movie that is the most interesting in the history of cinema
1,a lot of things i have n't heard in a while,a group of friends who find the body of a group of
1,she is a good actress in the same role as the main character,she is a great character actor and she is the only reason to watch
1,it was very funny in its own,it could have been a classic
1,i do n't know what to say about this because there is no doubt that,i 've been searching for some really good films to tell and i think
1,the only person who did n't die was that there were some other good parts,the film is set in rural france where it takes place in new york
1,ivor novello is great in this film but his character is flat and the script is very dull and very predictable and does n't,ivor novello in a small role as the head of his family as a man that 's a tough change in human behavior
1,they 're going to be at least a little bit interesting,they were the best and i 've seen them all
1,the plot twists are so contrived and the characters in the story are pointless,the plot is very thin and the director does n't really seem to know how
1,i have no idea that he 's a very talented actor but i think,i saw this on dvd at the seattle international film festival in london
1,the film 's story is a bit complicated,the plot of the film follows a young man
1,for an early 90 's horror film,for me i would say that
1,ernst brophy stars in this film,ernst baldwin who made the best of
1,to me the most disappointing thing about the movie was the soundtrack,to make matters worse the acting is not very good though
1,in fact i could n't even identify with her,in fact he never got out of prison
1,give it a chance if you want to,give it a try i guess you do n't
1,but the best thing i can say is that i,but then the story gets a bit more interesting
1,his character seems to be a stereotype,his brother who had just made the film
1,the plot was not believable and so i,the story was really really really dumb
1,and then he has a chance of finding a killer,and the ending is as good as it sounds
1,in fact the characters were very stupid and i,in this day i never saw another movie
1,i think that the acting of both men is better than a film 's a drama,i would love to know where this is filmed and it 's not even close to being
1,travelling through the film we get a movie to tell you and do not get that,travelling through the streets with a young woman he 's trying to escape to the house
1,blade runner is one of many things that should have been the onehour classic,blade runner was a very good series which i think is a very interesting movie
1,so what was this film made in,so they 're going to be a nice
1,her character was so bland to have,her character is the best ever
1,votes like i can think of this,votes and comments do n't contain spoilers below
1,in a nutshell i thought that this was the worst movie ever made and only one movie could have possibly been better,in fact it 's not a bad movie but it does have the potential of the original and the acting is very good
1,already he was not alone and this movie has the feel of a bad film and is not in the worst of the,already she gets a job in the middle of the movie and then he becomes jealous of the other guy 's friend
1,christopher mcdonald had a good supporting role,christopher plummer is also good in this and
1,some of the shots of the ship are so much better as to make a very interesting experience to be done in some way,some of the other comments from other reviewers have said the movie itself is quite bad as well as the other two actors but they
1,it 's a very entertaining film and the acting is great,it 's so funny and i am grateful that it had a
1,the plot is very simple and very predictable but the plot twists were very good and i liked this movie,the plot is a bit weak but the director and screenwriter did some research at first and it 's a very
1,i would like to see them die on the floor but,i could n't find a good review for this one
1,the movie makes the story all the more enjoyable to watch in any aspect,the acting is great and it is one of the best and most underrated movies
1,way to spend the rest of it but in this movie,way too many loose ends and not enough material for them to
1,we 've been done so many times since but this movie is so bad it 's almost,we were treated to the movie and a lot of people walked out of my seat
1,i love it the director who 's all about the character,i could not believe this one was made but the script is
1,woodward is as good to do today as in this movie,woodward did have some interesting moments and it is a nice twist
1,this film was a complete waste of film and not to mention the lack of talent in any of the actors,this film is a must see for any fan of the genre and i liked it as a kid in my opinion
1,the whole thing is completely different and,the script is also pretty weak
1,it 's a great piece of acting,it 's just sad to see how bad
1,an interesting plot is told by the writer to keep the viewer going for some time,an example of how people would have a hard time making a movie like this that does
1,you 're in for a real treat,you know you 're not alone
1,the film is very well acted the story of a young woman who is trying to survive,the story line is a bit too melodramatic though and i was disappointed to see it
1,he was a very poor actor,he was a very nice guy and
1,of course there is a scene in the movie where the film is filmed with the lighting on the faces,of course the fact that all that is said about the story is not really explained but a very important point
1,charles laughton is a good actor but as he,charles grodin is great as the main villain
1,i'm a big fan of the genre for this,i'm just glad i got away with it
1,guess i had to write a movie on the imdb that this was just a bad movie,guess this was the first movie i watched this i was not surprised at how many times i
1,the story of a young boy who lives in the small town of a small town of ember with his,the story is simple with some very clever moments and some really funny moments that makes this film watchable
1,menial spoiler the cast and crew are pretty good,menial to say that you should avoid it
1,i think the fact that i was a fan of the book and the movie just was n't,i think if it was n't for the fact that some viewers have already seen the movie
1,producers should have given us a lot to think about this film,producers are a little too enamored with this movie in the first place
1,but this is a very good movie but that is about it,but it 's an odd idea to get into an otherwise bad and
1,if you have seen it you would definitely know why it did n't have an end,if you want to make a movie about a group of people who are going to be
1,this is one of the very few of john waters 's works of cinema that makes,this is a movie that should be viewed by all those interested in the medium
1,turkish film critic who has been trying to,turkish movies are made of their films
1,this is an excellent performance in his career,this time around a little girl gets involved with
1,i do n't see what the producer was thinking about,i had to keep it out of my collection
1,abigail 's acting skills are all wrong and there are many very nice ones as,abigail lange gives a terrific performance as the daughter who is a true artist
1,meanwhile a group of friends try to get their hands on a group of thugs who,meanwhile his father is forced to stay behind him and a friend of a family
1,with it 's release in mind that the world was made to entertain us as it was,with that in mind and a few people in the cast were good actors and actresses i liked
1,the only way he feels he is is is that it is very long,the movie also features an array of other actors playing their parts of the characters
1,a woman who has a crush on the child 's sister 's husband,a bit of a mess on the whole lot of people i have not
1,she 's also a woman with a chip,she 's a little too hard too
1,the film opens with a woman chatting to his son,the only real downer of the movie was that it was
1,most people would know if the movie should have been,most of the actors were obviously trying to act
1,and if you are looking for a movie that is as good as it,and why is he wearing the dress at the end of the movie
1,while the first half is pretty good overall it was n't bad enough to be a sequel to a sequel,while the characters have a good deal of realism it does manage to do a little bit too much for the
1,lovecraft 's acting was excellent the direction was great,lovecraft is the most successful of film makers
1,only the two lovers are in love with a man that is n't even close to,only watch it if you have the chance for renting some of the other films
1,while the movie contains no redeeming qualities i have to admit that in some ways some of this has a good story,while the movie was n't as much as say it 's in the mood for the first half it does tend to be
1,with this film 's a great deal of humor i 'll say that the,with all the lights and explosions you can see in a different film
1,what the hell is that about,what is most interesting are the very
1,finding this guy is the most ridiculous and stupid movie i have ever seen,finding a way into the old world in the first few days of her own
1,it is the sort that a real treat and i think it 's a very good movie for me,it is not a movie about the life of the people or who we were in this movie
1,the story is a simple one and the director is the one who will be in a coma,the film was directed on the heels of the french cinema in the same day the film is set
1,duncan 's daughter is a bit too much with a nice girl for a man,duncan 's character is supposed to be a very serious but ultimately human character
1,the movie is also about the friendship between the three main actors,the plot does n't have much to it and it was only made
1,brad pitt plays the part as a,brad dourif is in the film
1,not only is that the best and most important part of the film it is also a very good film and i,not only are they in the script the acting the acting the script the dialogue the acting the dialogue the editing
1,ok if you 're expecting a horror film with a sense of humor you 'll love it,ok so it 's the typical hollywood production that can be forgiven for the film 's plot and
1,most of the scenes were filmed with the usual and annoying and sometimes pointless,most of the time you see this movie and you 'll see it
1,lets see it and be prepared for it will be a,lets hope that this movie can be remade on dvd
1,the only reason i gave this 1 a 2 is because it was,the main idea of this movie is why it 's so popular
1,it has a very good story,it 's not like that it 's
1,the film 's director robert taylor was able to make me cry to tears so i had to watch the dvd as he was offered to the screen by,the film itself looks like a low budget film about a group of college kids trying to escape from their past a small town in which they live
1,while most of the film takes place in the same location as the old godzilla series it 's not that much of a stretch and,while the original is a bit dated today it has an upbeat style and atmosphere but it is also quite a bit more enjoyable
1,i saw this movie and after hearing that they were talking about seeing,i have to say that i laughed at some of the comments
1,yes i have a problem with that,yes it 's an enjoyable ride
1,i was expecting an extra film but i have to say the story has many layers in the film which are very rare to get a,i do n't know whether it 's the fact i'm giving it 1010 but maybe it was because i was expecting more than a movie
1,just as we are watching it and the acting is terrible i mean that makes,just like the other reviewer 's comments about the film it is quite good
1,there 's a very interesting story in this film,there is a scene with a guy holding an arm
1,it is a very good movie,it 's so bad it 's laughable
1,i saw the movie as a child at that,i have seen thousands of movies on it
1,also the characters and the actors who were involved are in the film as well as all of these actors,also in it 's defense it is an intimate story of how the war affected and fought the life as it
1,so what if it is that a woman that is so rich with her husband,so it has to be said that the ending is rather abrupt and contrived
1,first of all the film is just plain awful,first of all it was just another story of how
1,it was like saying i was watching the same movie from a different movie,it was very interesting to hear what happened when the movie was supposed to be
1,in fact it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,in addition to the fact that there are people who are not familiar with
1,they did not really know it when they were so funny,they have n't made an entirely believable movie since 'the lost world'
1,this movie does n't have to be,this movie has a certain charm to it
1,but for a fan of the italian horror flick fan like me the movie should be required viewing,but there is a great deal of action in the film which is what you should see
1,black hawk 2 is a disgrace to its,black comedy from the 1930s and 60s
1,this was one of those movies for me,this is one of the many movies that have
1,james cagney who plays the head honcho is always great in a role that is not too difficult to play,james brolin 's character is very unlikable and i do not think he 's supposed to act so well
1,there 's nothing wrong with that as a,there 's plenty of violence and nudity
1,before the final scene in which the two women were murdered for the final showdown there were only 3 scenes,before i watched this movie i did n't expect a single thing with the story in the first place
1,now i'm a fan of the genre and it 's a little more for me and my friend is not a little more than a couple of people,now in the film the only thing in the whole film that does n't show any emotion is that the film is actually pretty good but also it has
1,the movie starts very abruptly when it gets a bit more serious,the director of his first film should sue his own life for the
1,judy dench plays a very sexy but vulnerable woman who is attracted to the younger,judy and her friends are the only two things that could make him famous
1,my favorite part of the movie when the girl and,my suggestion do n't make me a great time
1,the ending is a joke i wo n't say but the plot is really bad and,the plot was very good and the acting was good for a lot of fun
1,he had to go to a party for his brother but he,he also has some other things going on in his head
1,in this movie the movie is pretty well,in the end a truly terrible film
1,the story is so boring that it can only be put together in an incredibly stupid way,the only time in the film was a bunch of the girls who are being chased
1,one is just like watching him walking through some of the windows that are the,one day the girl and she decides to stay with the other two children
1,not only is this a good movie to be honest but it does n't need to have the same impact of it,not only are the characters a wellthoughtout little runt who lives alone with a handsome mother who also happens to have the fortune
1,the only thing i liked about this movie were the few good parts and all the acting,the acting in this film is so bad that it 's so bad they are funny
1,he has a knack to take care of his own problems and his ability to,he is able to make a film out of this but not that great
1,in this one he is an actor who would never be in a film with no,in my opinion the film 's greatest asset though is the performance of a character
1,i was not surprised that the director wanted to use a different type,i do wish the director had done an experiment with his friends
1,sadly they are trying to save the last seduction by themselves,sadly the film is still a very good film which is a
1,he is a complete idiot in that one as well but this is a good movie,he should be ashamed of himself and to find it difficult to find a better version
1,is that his only true motive in this movie,is the director 's vision of a film
1,as for that fact i have never seen any movie that i could think of as an action hero,as the film continues it 's a pity she 's given the same thankless persona in the first film as
1,if i could go out of my way to see it again the first time i had the chance to watch,if you do n't see it then the title will not disappoint but for a sequel it is a classic
1,is it supposed to be a comedy in that,is a film that would appeal to any other horror
1,but it has to be so bad that,but the film just does n't deliver
1,i was expecting it to be a remake of my typical b movie but even,i would say the film is pretty bad but it 's just too bad
1,however it was n't the worst movie ever made to be honest,however as a result of these two movies it 's the only film
1,the movie 's main problem is that,the movie is a true classic
1,the movie does n't try to be scary,the movie has no redeeming features whatsoever
1,unfortunately the film 's director and writers were all on the verge to make the story worthwhile,unfortunately for this one the film just drags on and on and the film seems more like a
1,all three of the most important parts of the feature series are those in the final third of the show which also gives a,all you have to do is make a movie about the real story and this is where you are in the same predicament
1,the film is n't so bad it 's good i do n't care if any of these,the story was so ridiculous with its own characters and i could relate to the characters
1,the acting by the three leads is excellent,the acting was terrible and i could barely believe
1,the only saving grace is the acting by the entire cast,the story is about a group of people who have their own
1,she does not seem believable enough to be considered,she is not the best of the bunch
1,while it is not a comedy it 's simply an interesting movie,while the film does not seem to take too long to get into
1,the film is not a drama and,the plot is a total disaster
1,predator is a very good film which does not really matter but is a very interesting and entertaining film,predator iv has all the elements of one great tv episode the best and most original movies about the evils
1,here is the plot the actors try to bring to life the fact that they do,here is the story of an africanamerican woman who is living in a beautiful apartment that he
1,the story is told in a short running time with a little bit too much exposition but not enough to give you anything,the movie is also quite good as you have a group of friends working together for their friends to attend the island
1,another thing i did not notice was that the film was a comedy,another thing i'm a bit harsh in my mind is the ending
1,check out the other comment about this,check for yourself a good movie
1,bunnies and dolls are always fun especially jordana brewster and her,bunnies do n't have the same voices or the same
1,but for some of the characters in the movie i did n't expect a lot to,but in the meantime it takes to show that this is a very bad movie
1,this is probably the worst movie i 've seen in years,this time he 's going to show up at the airport for
1,it 's a lot of fun to see a great actress and actress of great actor,it 's just a movie and that the story was so predictable that the movie would n't
1,the movie makes sense at about three different levels that you would have had,the only positive about the movie i had to watch at was presume
1,it is a shame that the script was not developed to the story of this,it 's about how we can get the message it says to each other
1,and of course there are numerous scenes that seem to have just fallen in love,and if you 're in the mood for a fun movie with a message of sexual
1,the acting is horrible the script is awful not even the special effects are terrible and this movie does,the film is so full of clichs that i'm sure that they could have done a little better
1,for all the fans of the series and for that matter i highly recommend that you,for starters you have two very nice actors and actresses who are not so much
1,i do n't think any of the actors,i had trouble deciding about the film
1,i was surprised to see a movie depicting the life of war and the war and its consequences the way in which the film does not work,i really ca n't imagine that many people are comparing this movie to the great godfather i was expecting but it was so funny it could have gone
1,then he goes back and forth and it 's up to the actors to get a look for all that they are supposed,then again i did n't really care for the other characters and they seemed like they were all trying to save them
1,but this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,but then you have to give him the benefit of this mess
1,c'mon the whole movie is like watching the same train building in the same way,c'mon this is a good movie but one that is so bad that it hurts to
1,the movie was very much like in those days,the plot is very good the acting of the two
1,hoskins and lombard were the stars of the movie and it 's,hoskins is one of my favorite actors i was so impressed
1,sure there were some very funny moments but the movie did,sure there are some parts that just seem very silly
1,the film is very dark and claustrophobic and the director gives the film some genuine thrills to be found,the only redeeming quality was the fact that he tried to hide the movie into the book and it looked
1,in a world where we are presented a film which would be as good as i have seen all the way through this movie i will probably go,in the last days when a stranger in the local town and was rehearsing the film in the theater of the 1980s it became my favorite film
1,finally i saw this movie on the tube and found it quite enjoyable,finally when they get a hold of the house 's house in the woods
1,despite some of his fans and the others that this movie should n't have i think that a lot of the jokes just seemed to be a little awkward,despite some of them in the film there is a scene where the girl is sitting and watches her naked body walking around in a closet to get a beer
1,there is absolutely nothing else that i do not want to watch,there was no chemistry between the characters and the plot was predictable
1,but i did like the film too,but it could 've been a classic
1,we see it as a series of flashbacks as the first time and it shows that the movie is about three hours long a,we are in trouble with each new man a little bitty with a large heart for the family and a few of them
1,but i still prefer it that it 's a great deal of fun,but the real problem is this is not just a movie about the battle
1,the film takes place in a big town of the city which was a little like a dream movie,the acting is n't bad at all but the music is just as good as the film itself
1,zeffirelli has a unique eye for his role as a woman in a small colorado town who is determined to get to,zeffirelli also shows that he is not a master of the craft but rather in telling it to a wider flaw
1,not to mention the fact that the film was n't made,not to mention that they have a very small budget
1,when we watched the movie i realized that the movie is just so damn bad that i could n't help it,when this show came out i was n't sure where this was going to be and it 's no fun for a
1,it 's one of the more interesting entries made me a great fan and i was a fan of a good story line but did not have that option and the film was,it was a bit of an attempt to recreate a film with some very interesting elements and characters that would have been a lot smarter but the overall story is quite interesting
1,that is probably why i gave the show a 9 star rating,that 's why the characters are so unlikable you ca n't make an
1,after the opening night of watching this movie i will watch another movie like it and that 's not the best thing to say to anyone,after seeing the movie for a change the film is filled with a very strong subject and has a great cast that has the potential to work
1,her boyfriend did so in an attempt to make her own life out of him,her first meeting with the other woman and the boy is quite nice and the movie
1,nina is a very likable character who has always been an actress with the ability to pull herself to tears,nina the son of mrs x is a woman who has inherited a child to the world and decides to take
1,since the first movie is really funny it is a complete loss of a movie,since there are two films that have all the elements they are made to entertain and
1,all in all this does n't make for a great film experience,all the actors involved did not seem to be on the project
1,just do n't miss it unless you 're a diehard collector,just like i first read the book this film could be a
1,nurse betty was a good movie but not enough to warrant an award,nurse vengeance is n't one film that i could n't sit through it
1,so in my case the film was so poor it would have been better if,so much to the point of the film it 's a joy to watch
1,so they get caught up into the mix with the other kids and all around,so what we get to watch is one that was only soso at best
1,as you get older and deeper in terms of the acting the film is not really all that great or is,as in some of his other movies he has n't even done a decent job of delivering a decent performance
1,the plot is a mess of a movie,the story of a boy who comes to the
1,well it would have been nice if that,well there is nothing here to indicate
1,i think this show had a lot to offer and was a,i saw a preview screening on this film the other night
1,that is why i'm so interested in making it,that 's all i really need to say on the
1,her performance is so bad that she looks like her every ten minutes or more,her character is very different from other characters but they 're all very likable and lovable
1,this movie is a complete waste of,this film was a complete disappointment
1,the story of two brothers of an old man who has a daughter and his daughter who live in a hotel in the mountains after a,the film also shows us how a young girl could become possessed into a world that is the first person that does not fall apart
1,he had some of them all the way through this film,he then goes from there to see where the two meet each
1,guinness is a fine actor but is still a great comedian,guinness is just a guy who ca n't act a word about
1,the movie is an absolute masterpiece,the movie is a little over the
1,while the actors were very bad with some very good actors i felt sorry for the actor who plays the guy who plays jakob,while it is n't as funny as the first two films there is one thing that 's missing and this is n't the case
1,while i have a few problems with this movie i really think that the movie should n't be made in color,while this may have been some of the better parts of the book a few years later i saw the trailer for
1,all three movies are so bad it 's good i mean,all in all i give it 9 out of ten
1,this could have been a decent little movie about time travel,this is just one of those movies where you just do n't
1,i ca n't think of a better film that is so,i would have preferred this to be something like something
1,while they 're on the run to hell they have a good time to go,while the film had a lot of potential it had to make it easier to see
1,the only other actor who seems to have been performing his acting performance was,the plot is very thin and the actors are just not very believable
1,he 's not one in the way and he makes an easy decision to find a woman,he is a master of many genres and shows that he is also very well known
1,through it all flavia and her friends are all the same,through the series the audience is subjected to a more emotional and
1,the music is good and the music is perfect as the title suggests,the plot is n't so stupid and the actors are all on this one
1,i thought the story would be a decent,i really enjoyed this very first episode
1,if the story has any real depth or meaning that of the original story it would still,if you want to have a fun time with you i think you 'll like it
1,anyway the movie is about a young man,anyway it 's not worth the trouble
1,it has the same amount of atmosphere,it is a good family drama
1,this film will not disappoint if we have not to watch it,this is a movie for those who are curious by the time i
1,there 's not much of a plot but it 's,there are no redeeming qualities and no real acting
1,the acting was excellent especially from the young actors who were very very real and are very convincing,the film 's climax is pretty bad even with the ending which seems to come as a bit too
1,can i believe that it would have been a,can he save money from being a nun
1,if you 've just read a few of the other reviewers here on this site i'm a sucker for this,if you like a movie with a few laughs and a bit of suspense then this is your movie
1,discretion aside the story is n't entirely convincing as it is supposed to be,discretion that would have been better had a bit of the plot was handled with
1,they have an eye in them,they are all good actors but no
1,sea of evil is a very interesting and original film about the life of,sea of evil was one of the best films of the 80 's
1,the film is a masterpiece in a genre of action sequences as is the action,the acting in the film is also quite good and the acting by some of the
1,when the movie was released we saw the movie and it was retitled i was a bit shocked,when the first movie came from the theater and then it was n't on its own i just saw
1,maybe it 's worth noting that the movie,maybe he just did n't get it
1,yes this film has nothing to do with a plot that 's about the same thing as the aforementioned one,yes you have all of the clichs in the movie but the action sequences are just as good and the acting
1,beautiful and very touching and i think this will make you smile and,beautiful locations are the only reason to watch such a classic film
1,underestimated films that were n't made in the year 2002 are not a,underestimated is the first thing that has made the whole film bearable
1,what 's even more remarkable is the director,what is the deal with this movie
1,and it is n't really the scariest film of its kind it 's actually a pretty decent movie i guess,and the plot is that bad a young woman is not given to her son and does it really have been
1,i did n't like the original version which made it somewhat different,i 've seen this film twice and still enjoyed the film as much
1,a must for anyone who enjoys the movies,a lot of the movie was n't so bad
1,i'm going to give it a 10 because he 's,i'm a fan of hers in the movie though
1,but the only good thing about this movie is the fact that this is a bad,but it 's too much to ask for a long time on a friday night
1,what makes this such great fun film,what was with the rape scene
1,however the film is quite good,however the film 's premise is a
1,he should definitely be a star if that was the case,he has his moments which may be the funniest of the whole
1,the film was also a success to the point of making me squirm,the movie also has a few problems in it that is too much for
1,reb 's father is a very good film with many different scenes,reb is a great talent as the hero who is able to cope
1,while a good idea is there is a very weak amount of humor here,while i liked the first half of the film i was n't sure whether it
1,the film was a complete waste of time and i,the music was great and the dancing was great
1,the film follows an unusual and sensitive relationship between two brothers of the same age,the whole thing is just too ridiculous and contrived for it 's own good
1,they also are just as stupid and nasty as the rest are not,they 're the one that is so beautiful that you wonder what the hell
1,in the film he does a very bad job of showing that there is a killer that will,in my opinion this is my favorite movie of the year in my opinion with a capital
1,it was a movie i was lucky enough to have heard of but it 's not a comedy i think,it was like the script writer wrote a bad screenplay on this movie which is very misleading and boring
1,the first movie i saw was really a lot better,the only reason for this is the fact that the characters
1,on one of the best parts of the film the camera pans off,on the other hand i would recommend to a little more fan
1,good action flick that was well done and very believable,good luck to the cast of a great film and this
1,but i found that there 's a lot more wrong with it,but in this movie i think that the movie was a bit better
1,the characters are so poorly written the characters are stupid,the movie has a little romance and a couple of nice
1,misunderstandings aside it 's pretty good though,misunderstandings are never resolved but the movie is
1,another thing i noticed was that it was a little bit of a good thing,another good film by the master is the story of how people are treated by a
1,she has the most convincing acting job,she is also a very likable character and
1,note that there could be a story,note in the scene where jack is walking
1,nana patekar 's character who was very funny is the only character that can,nana byrne is excellent the actor is a very cool and funny guy
1,there are so many reasons to recommend this film it 's not a horror movie,there is a bit of slapstick and some humor but this is one of those bad
1,kristen hilliard plays mary a rich housewife who finds solace in this beautiful woman in a society where she can never become hers,kristen 's father who was the only person in the movie is very young and the other characters are a bit different from their
1,angelopoulos 's film is a good movie,angelopoulos 's version is the same
1,i think it was the first time he was making a movie that was not to,i have always been a fan of the work of james belushi in the original
1,problem the way this movie is so bad is the fact it took such a long amount,problem is that he has the most successful and famous cast i have ever seen him
1,i saw it a couple of years ago and was surprised when it came to this film i was n't expecting something much,i was so angry when i found out that i could n't possibly get a kick out of the movie and just watched it
1,indeed the plot is very simple and you are never really sure whether,indeed the director had an agenda that could n't be properly planned
1,it does n't take for granted the fact it is about,it had a great cast great script and great music
1,with a script that makes it more important to the plot the actors and dialogue are all over the place,with a script like that we all knew that the movie is n't really as bad it 's actually not as
1,it is a great film that should never have been released,it 's a story of an evil doctor who kills himself but
1,all the people who made it out of the gutter were in their early forties,all these factors are a lot of fun and the film has a good message that
1,the plot line is a bit of a downer one with the characters,the acting is very good and it 's always worth a look
1,to see this film will make for an enjoyable movie,to be fair this movie was the biggest problem
1,although she is the most likable person in the film it shows us that she is one of the greatest actresses that i have ever seen,although i am not sure how anyone who likes watching this will get the dvd 's it will probably be released on dvd for 399
1,the story is n't very clever the acting is horrible,the movie is a waste of money and time
1,it takes long to get a great deal of screen time and then there is the possibility that it is still the same story,it 's a bit confusing to be taken seriously but it 's still worth seeing the film 's final confrontation and the ending which was
1,this film was made in a country where a bunch of students are being tortured,this was a good thing but that 's not how it was intended the entire movie
1,he did not do that much in the way of character development and acting ability and,he is a man who ca n't even afford to be able to do so
1,a good film about a very difficult subject of a woman who 's a teenager to get married and get her own way,a film like this can only have been made commercially and in the early 50 's when people were looking for a film with
1,having lived in a city of royston vasey and ours i felt that the movie could be,having seen the first two and then the other i was expecting that the movie does
1,the story is about a married girl who comes home from her husband 's life and her family and,the only way i could have laughed was when someone says that they are funny or you know
1,the actors were all excellent with some of the,the characters are so bad it 's unbelievable
1,it has to be the most expensive film,it is a complete waste of time
1,now they can be a little unfair,now you might want to go into the
1,but the movie has its charms,but the worst was the acting by
1,it is n't even a bad movie,it 's the exact same kind of story
1,in my book it is a great film,in fact if a film had n't made any
1,so the movie ends the way it is made up for when the main character 's head and,so why did the filmmakers bother to make such a mess and a sequel to the original
1,the film was pretty dull but it could have been a lot better,the plot is a bit of a comedy though the acting is very good
1,eighteen years later the only other thing that is funny is the way it moves,eighteen seconds of the film with just a few minutes running out of time is nothing
1,there is the odd lack of a character development to make this one of the best performances you can get,there is something good about this film which is very very bad because it was a waste of time
1,i have always found it entertaining but never heard of the story in the first,i love the soundtrack which is so sad and i ca n't believe it
1,seems that the film is going to turn,seems a little more real to me
1,what we all know it is a movie,what was the point of the whole
1,it 's a very interesting film about the holocaust and how people will have the power to change the,it was a very nice change and i think that they were a great choice for the movie
1,i was in a lot of bad cinema and decided to check this one out when it released in the theaters and,i was n't surprised that it was a remake of the original the exorcist that was a remake of the classic
1,while this film 's title is based on a book of the book by john page it is one of those,while some scenes were cut to bits of suspense such as the flying scene and the ending of the film
1,so if you 're looking for some serious horror and horror films do it you 'll see a lot of it here,so many of these people are very similar and not only a bit of the filthiest one can find them a bit of
1,if you like mindless horror and horror movies like this and you enjoy the original then you will get bored to say this is a,if you 've read the book you 'll get a surprise of what you would have liked if the movie had been so terrible
1,this movie is so bad it is funny,this is a real pleasure to behold at times
1,you will feel your pain for the,you will be glad you did
1,most of the scenes do n't really flow and you ca n't help but notice them and,most of the other cast members are the only people who have a very strong role
1,avoid this film unless someone is trying,avoid this one like the plague
1,maniacally filmed and edited together with lots of extras and camera angles it,maniacally and with a lot of the movie it makes no sense
1,i was n't impressed by this adaptation of a movie,i just saw this film at the toronto international film festival
1,that 's how the movie got to,that 's not what this movie was
1,why could n't these movies have this one,why does he always have to take a trip
1,grateful i got this in the dark,grateful is the one that does n't have
1,in fact the main characters had a tendency to be in the character of a friend of a father of the family of the young man in the movie,in fact this is n't a bad movie but it 's not that funny and the characters all seem to know that the characters have little to do with each
1,but he does n't really care about any of the characters other than a few other people who seem a little too much like an,but i was n't able to get past the fact that this is a very bad film and it was n't worth the wait
1,but the script is really really good,but i was looking after i saw a
1,the plot is n't quite a snoozer but the story really,the story line is good and the acting is superb
1,which brings me to the end of the film,which is why you can see the movie is not
1,the movie is based on the same basic play as the movie in which the author of the book has a very faithful knowledge of the world,the film is about the struggle between a man and his wife to whom the person who made this film is so confused that he decides to get
1,i really do believe that this is a movie for you,i do n't think that anyone ever thought of this film as
1,the music is beautiful and the songs of the show are excellent,the film is a comedy that should be the subject to a larger
1,while she does not have much of an impression of her character the film is,while i do remember this film being a remake of my favorite horror movie
1,jacob the ripper is the first movie he made with his name,jacob has been sent to prison for the murder of a woman for
1,that 's not all this movie is going to be,that would make it more difficult to sit through in the
1,lucky enough for a few good action films of all time,lucky to know how the people in this film are supposed to
1,this movie really shows how bad it,this was not a good episode
1,seventeen minutes worth of the film are shot at all you get to the,seventeen monkeys of the same name are the three stars of this film
1,good luck but in a way this could have been great,good idea is that it was made with an extremely low budget
1,but for me it just does n't happen,but the movie is a fun movie and a
1,i was hoping this would be an attempt to,i was a little disappointed in the film
1,he 's a very fine man who is still alive,he is also known as a psychiatrist at the local university
1,but it is the story of a father and son,but this is probably the best of her films
1,that makes up for the good fun and good fun,that 's right a little harsh in the story
1,it is a great film to see it is n't even about the love of god it 's so bad it,it 's the best movie of the year and it 's not only a film but a very enjoyable movie
1,there is some good action scenes in this movie but for those of you who,there are a few funny bits but they too often consist of stupid jokes
1,the story does n't need to be told,the movie has a lot to do with the
1,because the film is about the power of war and the life of women,because the story itself is as follows and the acting is very good
1,in this film the hero finds out that the boy is an infected murderer he 's trying to protect her,in the end i would give it a zero but there are so few laughs i do n't care if there
1,two of the characters are all great and the story itself is,two of the best movies of this genre are the best
1,in my opinion this is the best comedy series ever made,in fact a film like this could have made it better with
1,exploitation buffs are all so glad i did n't waste my time watching,exploitation films such as the texas chainsaw massacre halloween ii and nightmare
1,i saw this movie when i was about 6 or 14 and i still ca n't,i have heard that it is a little dated but it is n't very much
1,they also made some really interesting comments on a few people who have reviewed the movie a,they have a couple of scenes of comic relief but not necessarily as the film progresses
1,as the film goes on we are introduced to the characters themselves,as such i have n't been watching the whole thing again
1,it 's not that i can say that the movie is good and i do n't,it 's a good thing to see and the movie is definitely a must see
1,still it would be easy to watch with the lights off and,still do n't make a decision to watch this on dvd
1,there are some good performances here but the rest,there were no good parts of this movie
1,i could not help thinking that the film would be a little too much too short,i did n't like it until the end it was like the end to the final reel
1,while the story is not all the actors and locations the film is,while this one was pretty bad the acting is n't too bad
1,but in reality the two were never released from prison and were treated in the same fashion,but it has nothing to do with the original film 's story the first one is a series
1,mostel was the only good aspect in the movie,mostel and crawford are great in their roles and the
1,so why ca n't you go to,so you see the story unfold
1,as for the acting of the characters it was a great film to watch,as a result the whole film is so boring that it just becomes laughable and
1,it would be a little difficult to swallow a few of the,it is n't very good it has a good story line
1,whilst i 've seen it numerous times before the original film was made by a bunch of people who were a bunch that were involved in the making of it,whilst i 've seen a few that i would n't like a movie like this to be a little bit of a horror movie it is not an examination of the
1,kramer vs kramer was a perfect match for john cena 's first movie,kramer reed is n't good in this movie and he 's quite bad in
1,the movie is a real treat as far as i'm concerned that i will never,the characters are believable and the characters are likable and their performances are great
1,i have to say the lines and the music fit well,i am glad i was able to get away from this film
1,deniro is a genius as a young girl with no talent for his,deniro is a wonderful comedic actor but that is what he does
1,this movie was a real treat,this movie is just plain awful
1,writer stephen minghella does a good job portraying the plight of a young man who is attracted to his own children as a father his father and son are,writer joe gordon is a genius and he 's always able to keep the story from good direction to the characters who are both funny in their roles
1,the script of this film is so bad i ca n't even,the acting is awful and the dialog itself is not funny
1,there are a couple of memorable moments but the movie is pretty boring,there 's a good deal of atmosphere but it is too little too late
1,duke 's character is an unlikable and irritating woman,duke and his team are just fine enough
1,i have to disagree that there was only one thing that i liked about the movie i,i was very impressed by the film and the acting and the acting in this movie
1,it was an interesting experience for those who liked the movie,it is an odd and eyeopening view of society and its consequences
1,for the love of god please do n't,for me this was one of them
1,their chemistry with the main characters is really really bad but you can find something new,their performances are all excellent although in the beginning of the movie it is clear that they
1,definitely the worst of the series,definitely not a waste of time
1,i'm a fan of the movie and i have seen many more,i'm sorry for you the movie just got better and worse
1,there 's a reason this movie would have made,there are plenty of bad movies out there
1,its not the worst movie ever made but i 've seen it,its hard to believe that a film would be so bad
1,i would recommend this film for anyone who has ever seen a film that has a lot of,i think this movie is an abomination but it would be nice to see a good movie
1,i think this movie is one of those rare classics i have watched and it is not a big deal in that,i think the filmmakers were trying to cram into the film 's theme but they could not be the main ones
1,even more as the final chapter of the game the characters are introduced at the very least one time they are introduced to each other the characters themselves,even though there are many aspects of the plot that make it a bit more effective a lot of movies that are n't made much for the audience 's
1,while this movie was not made on a shoestring budget budget production values it really is a great film,while the story and plot development is very slow the storyline is very simple and it never seems to be
1,but i do recommend a film to a little more than it 's,but if there 's nothing to make up a minute it seems like it
1,there is nothing to recommend for a film to be so utterly awful,there are many other movies that i 've seen where it does not look
1,its a little dated to me and it may be the best movie ever,its not the worst movie ever made but it is n't bad either
1,to sum this up is that the movie seems,to me he has no sense of reality
1,in any case i think that the film does,in that same way it was so bad
1,it is not just a bad movie but,it 's a pretty well made movie
1,the only reason i was able to laugh through it was the ending,the plot is not so great it 's actually a good idea with the
1,the movie has a lot of things to say about the,the whole idea of a good guy was the same
1,but that 's just it and you,but it was a great show
1,it has some interesting points and some good laughs,it really made me sick when i saw an interview
1,there are also some very funny scenes but this is one of those,there are lots of movies that should have had more action than this
1,in this case it is a very nice movie to see,in my opinion this movie was not only bad but as it
1,at first i did n't expect a lot from this movie but at least it was interesting,at the time when i heard the words said about it i thought it was going to be
1,the story is very original and the actors involved are excellent,the film looks at it and feels like they were trying to
1,the acting is very stiff too,the movie is a little dated by
1,the acting in this film is great and i hope the director writer 's cut to get the best,the only problem with this movie is that it just is n't a good movie by any means
1,elder sister is a beautiful love woman,elder peaks was a very entertaining movie and
1,in the end i just did n't care about the,in fact it had the worst of the worst
1,we also get to see some great talent in their roles,we do n't even look into it until we get to see
1,and as a result he 's not going to,and there is a lot of bad action
1,george clooney was one of the greatest actors of his generation and he was very convincing as well but he did not carry,george is a great film maker and it is worth noting that it is not the only film he has made for
1,yes it was the first time that i saw it i did have no idea what to expect,yes this is a comedy to watch but you know the type of movie i saw and it is
1,next thing i would say was that the film was a great movie,next the story of the story unfolds in a way that was n't completely
1,toomey is one of those people who really does n't want to see,toomey is perfect and the rest of the cast is excellent and the film
1,ok so the film was a lot of people running the gamut of people 's clothes,ok i 've been waiting to watch it since the late 70s and loved it
1,not a bad movie but this certainly was n't even a comedy,not only was it a very bad movie but it was good and
1,note that the film is one of the most moving and informative dramas of the silent film genre,note in another review the story line has been changed in english and the french language is a bit
1,the story line is quite simple and the characters are well played with plenty of depth and dignity,the characters were good the dialogue was a joke and i think this movie was great because it had
1,in the end there is absolutely nothing to hold your interest,in the end i think the ending as the plot continues to
1,dustin hoffman plays the main character of the movie,dustin hoffman is very good as the lead
1,we see how the story of a man in new orleans is able to cope with his own family and the consequences of the people,we had so many problems with the film that one could only assume that they could have made a better film to make up the budget
1,yet i was surprised at the positive reviews and,yet i think it 's a great start
1,i have read the comments by this film on imdb and thought that the movie was good,i was not a teenager when it first came out but that i was a little skeptical but
1,part of the reason why i enjoyed the movie was because it was n't a good film,part of it is because it 's a lot of fun and it is definitely worth seeing
1,outside the world she does it with the devil and she looks like she 's being stalked by a bunch of people,outside of the fact that a bunch of people have a very good idea of the film i do n't think i would
1,i did think that the film was shot in the future as a,i saw her and she was in love with his younger brother
1,but the whole experience was in the end as the ending,but what i got is some very funny action sequence
1,in this film she is a good actress of her own in many,in the end the main character 's motivations are not really important
1,the cast of characters have been so much more convincing than the film in my first two days,the acting is superb but all the characters are so bad that i was convinced that all the actors
1,way too short to mention it,way too many loose ends and the
1,this movie also has an unusual premise,this movie is a must see
1,top secret agents are always on hand as if they have a real problem,top notch and this is a film that should go into the library
1,however there is a scene in which she sees the film and it is clearly a tribute to those who want to be challenged,however i would recommend this movie to the people who want to watch a great story and this one 's a good one
1,this is just the most boring and stupid movie i have,this is a movie that does not deserve for everyone
1,after a long absence of dialogue in this film it 's clear that the,after a long time it 's a film with a lot of action
1,soon i realized i was watching a movie in,soon the killer begins to investigate the mystery
1,james brolin stars as john wayne a retired cop who is a man who is trying to make,james caan does not come across as very suave but his performance is a joy to watch
1,beautiful and interesting but the movie really does not deliver the goods of the book,beautiful and exciting this is a movie about a group of misfits at the school of
1,there is n't a bad message in this movie,there 's a lot of sex but nothing that is
1,days later he begins to go to the house,days earlier a new york is in town
1,he is an amazing man and i wish,he 's a man of his dreams
1,it 's a very well made and superbly directed film,it 's hard to tell why she could not save the
1,it does not deserve to be,it is not so bad it 's
1,the music is good the scenery is beautiful,the story is a series of loosely connected stories
1,it seems that the filmmakers in this movie felt so bad that the producers forgot to include the characters,it 's a shame because the only reason i could n't make this movie was because of the director 's
1,by the time i 've watched the movie i had a lot of,by the film 's end it has a good sense of tension
1,and it looks like it cost an academy award worthy for it,and it just was n't worth the time of the film
1,i was n't really expecting much,i thought that a movie starring paul
1,i was very pleased to see her in a film with her own performance in a movie that was made by her husband,i really do n't care if the writers or directors tried to portray this story or what was supposed to be a plot
1,jay chou is a fine actor too,jay mohr as the cop was excellent as
1,the characters are so stupid that the movie just becomes boring but at,the characters are not caricatures of the story are the main characters
1,it also features some very good scenes but the dialogue never really becomes maudlin,it 's almost as if the screenwriter had no idea how to make a movie
1,but there are some great moments between the three brothers,but that 's just what the moviemakers are talking about and
1,not much else is left of this one either,not to mention some spoilers but not really worth watching
1,and the fact that we are not sure which one is in fact is it 's,and the ending is just as stupid as you can find in the first movie
1,true it 's not just a movie for children,true it does n't seem to be in fact so
1,strange that she did n't appear in this role because she 's not the one who plays helen,strange enough for an actor to be so much more convincing than to be seen as a child
1,he plays his usual cocky and shrill role but does n't seem like he might have the ability to do anything he could,he has a few lines of dialogue that will probably appeal to people who know it but they ca n't be so much more
1,it is a pity that the producers had to use the word necessary to keep things lively throughout the movie,it seems to be on autopilot and the story line is quite a bit too slow as you can count on
1,as for the acting i ca n't say i was n't expecting citizen kane in the way that the movie was in this movie,as a result of some sort of bad guy i could see why the film was made in a hurry to do the story of
1,that is how i was able to determine and watch,that 's because she did n't want to be
1,godfather ii is a masterpiece but it is still good fun to watch,godfather 2' iii has its moments but also the ending feels tacked on for
1,and i thought the film was quite good at all,and the music was not even so bad by the end
1,but it is so obvious that i ca n't say anymore but this movie is one of the worst of the bunch,but this is not one of those movies that is so dull that you feel like you 've been watching it for hours
1,recep is also the most sympathetic character that i 've heard in a long time,recep 's son is a bit skeptical but it is n't the story that i thought
1,if you do n't like those things you will love this movie,if you do n't like anime you will find that there 's a
1,after having searched for it for the first time i was expecting more,after having seen the film again and the subsequent introductions are not the only
1,the only real thing i could do is is that it 's not,the movie had a good cast that was n't all that great
1,farscape is a wonderful movie that should appeal to fans of italian exploitation,farscape is one of those movies and the acting is really excellent
1,the story has been told and the whole thing,the actors are n't even good as well
1,now in the end it 's hard to imagine how that is what he 's thinking to have the movie is n't,now this has a little too much going for it but it really does n't help to make any real sense
1,a good idea but not enough to make a good horror flick,a movie is the best of this genre and it shows
1,unfortunately it 's not as powerful as that in this movie,unfortunately it 's not the most interesting thing about it and i
1,do n't expect a great story,do n't be fooled by the cover
1,i was looking forward to seeing another movie,i was really looking forward to it
1,5 the story is just so funny,5 the film has a very strong feel
1,two guys in a bar and a few minutes later on a day of events together to stop the world,two guys are sent to a hospital where they can take refuge in a motel room at a small californian town
1,melville did n't make an appearance,melville 's story is the same and
1,even if this show is to be canceled i do n't know,even the worst of that it 's very entertaining and it is just
1,please i digress i 'll never be kissed by another movie that is,please if you 're looking for a fun scary scary movie this is a
1,there are some funny moments the story goes nowhere,there are a couple of good moments here
1,it seems that it did happen with the,it was not even a funny movie
1,people like the young guy that the older man and the son played like the black kid the bad guys and the bad guy,people who get to do the right thing do n't know what they are doing and that 's exactly why they should n't take the
1,nothing can be said about this movie unless you are bored and i think,nothing more but the way this movie ended was like a bad movie
1,i could n't believe what the movie was about,i could n't believe that the film was filmed in
1,that 's a minor complaint of that kind,that 's why i like his music
1,i do n't mean to spoil it but what a fun,i 've seen this movie a number of many times
1,but that is where he becomes the most likable,but it 's also a pretty good movie that is
1,lorenzo 's character was so funny and so well written,lorenzo lamas stars as a reporter who has to go wrong
1,but what can you do in an american horror flick,but then again i think this movie had the potential to
1,i was so excited at a film that i was so moved by the ending,i had trouble deciding what a real treasure was and how the movie got
1,this movie was the last that i watched before me and had me laughing,this movie is a true treat on the senses that this film has
1,and why did the writers just put this into,and the film is full of bad actors
1,the script is a lot of fun too but the dialogue is,the first two were excellent and the movie was very good
1,i do mean the characters of the movie like a character with the,i thought that this was the best thing i have ever seen
1,the movie is about how it was done the right way,the movie does n't get any more realistic than this
1,this film is not a total waste of time it 's,this has to be the most boring movie ever made
1,awhile of the film is the story of two sisters who,awhile for me this movie did n't do that much
1,this is just a bad show,this is the best movie you have
1,the plot in the book is the worst thing in the movie the execution of the story is pretty poor even,the music has a haunting atmosphere and a sense of style as opposed to the infectious nature of the movie
1,well the idea of an invisible man is a bad thing but the characters are,well this one did not go out there that would be a good idea
1,that is how we 're in the present day of that time,that was a major mistake but as i said it is a very
1,it seems that the actors in the movie should never have had a show like this anymore,it was one of the many films i have to say but i have n't seen it
1,the main reason why this movie was so awful is because it is a bad movie,the film is very slow and boring and it just seems to have been made on a
1,his first film is an extremely funny and funny,his wife gets his hands on the way
1,changing and a little more and more importantly the characters are the same,changing on a new low budget movie this has been a major success in
1,most of the actors were pretty good for,most people do n't understand the ending
1,i was n't even sure if that really,i had high hopes for this film
1,most of the time it 's really boring and there are n't many surprises about the film as it is in fact the plot is n't,most of these are very good people and their families are not just about the only good things and the acting is just plain terrible
1,no doubt he was a talented writer in that era,no one was ever going to tell him if they wanted
1,how many people were given a movie by someone who could,how do we know it 's such an ugly idea
1,im not a fan of the show but there are many great performances by jamie walken,im amazed that the director could have pulled this film off with a lot of other commentators
1,the movie starts out pretty well then it goes on the last minute and so it gets a little confusing but as for the story it could never end,the acting of the characters was so lame that it was hard to believe that such a bad movie could be made in such a horrible film if you were
1,do n't worry on this film,do n't go into it expecting a
1,i have to say that the first movie was pretty weak for me,i had to see the ending of the movie to find out why i
1,when it does he is an intelligent person and we are led to believe he is a hero,when the movie ends i could n't get through the story and the characters are so underdeveloped
1,instead the show has been lost on the big screen,instead of being a movie it 's a bunch of characters
1,i 've never been a fan of a romantic comedy,i have always been one of the biggest ones
1,he is still a good actress not a good actor but a good one,he seems to be at the helm when he is a hero and he does
1,another thing that bothered me from being is that i never got to watch this film until my mum and i both,another thing that 's so obvious about this movie is its title that they just want to add in the film
1,this is n't so bad that he is actually worse to watch it than to laugh out loud and then watch him prancing through the forest,this movie shows some really great scenes and a lot of scenes like that were not in the movie the way that they were used to make
1,ms and the stranger is a pretty good film and the acting is solid,ms smith who is the only actor member of the cast does not get it
1,this is the worst film i have ever seen,this is one i 'll watch in my youth forever
1,there 's nothing more thrilling than watching a movie that is n't supposed to,there is the possibility of the film the director must have been shot
1,what 's the deal with the girl,what 's the deal with her
1,it is the most disturbing film ever made,it 's not a masterpiece but it 's a
1,seeing this film is a delight to watch,seeing them get involved in a film of a
1,john wayne is not only a small screen legend but a,john wayne has a nice and funny performance in it
1,operation on the orient express was a fun and,operation des death was an extremely bad movie
1,the acting and direction seemed like some of the acting is bad the story line is bad,the first is that the story is not entirely a little boring and the story seems more like
1,i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good,i was looking for a big movie from its creator
1,i 've never ever seen such great acting,i do not understand the appeal of the film
1,yet the film does n't really add much to,yet that does not mean anything like that
1,okay it was n't a great show and i,okay so the plot is not very funny
1,even the music itself does n't look remotely like the rest of the story,even when the movie is supposed to be a parody of the first
1,a lot of movies about real people who have no real life no one could do,a few people might have seen this film at least in it 's simplest moments
1,elmer bernstein has a really good voice,elmer keitel plays a young man in a
1,trinity the heretic is another film that should appeal to everyone,trinity was the only person in the theatre that seemed to exist
1,then the movie starts off the same way,then the end abruptly begins to roll
1,it is the fact that it is not the only film,it 's a story of a man who loves her and a
1,there is a very young woman who was in a position where she 's been born with some sort of religious upbringing,there 's also a little bit of nudity too many cooks in the house and the film is set on the head
1,i thought this was an interesting concept that the film would take place in a near future in the middle of nowhere,i could n't get into this movie it was just a poor excuse to get the actors to act like they did n't
1,she has made a movie out of a few of the best movies,she is a good person she plays the role of a woman
1,well i think i am going to say this movie has some really stupid moments,well it does n't have for a single person who 's into the mind that this
1,super mario 2 stars for his role in the,super hero meets the woman on the train
1,bambi and day have never been a big success,bambi 3 is one of the best movies i 've
1,we 've seen it about 3 times or that we 've seen all of them and all,we have to get to know a little more about this man as his wife was
1,still do n't waste your time and money,still the movie was great and i think the
1,his first wife lisa is not nearly as bad as,his performance is so bad he is just awful
1,everyone has a bad time in your head,everyone involved is a bit too long
1,of course the whole thing is so ridiculous and pointless in its own disconnected way that you 'll never,of course you will want to make it your way a movie you do n't want to see
1,crossfire is very much more a drama with a plot,crossfire is an amazing movie and i have no interest in
1,not one of the best i 've ever seen,not even as i could tell a story that had
1,ok if you have n't seen this movie,ok so the acting here is bad
1,not much of the same is over i was wrong,not that there ever was more of it than that it
1,this film is one of many times that i am ashamed to say i love,this was a very good movie and i have n't seen a more mature asian movie
1,all the women look in their way while the rest of the actors look like they did n't,all that is left is the story and character development of these people trying to find answers
1,at times it is hard to understand why there were so many people left out of the plot but,at the end there is the final battle between a guy and a girl which is very good
1,the story does n't do a great job of explaining this plot as you have no plot or characters to tell them but they 're in the middle and the characters are all over the place,the film was shot by a cinematographer and his cinematographer in a very informative approach that i think is supposed to be a comedy of the 1930s but the director should have been able to get a
1,and it shows a lot of the talent of the character and its,and when the movie is over the line does n't make sense
1,there were other times when it was made,there is a story to this movie
1,after reading about his performance in a small film in this film this adaptation of the film was very faithful to a book that,after all of these years this movie has been remade by critics and is probably the only redeeming feature i 've ever seen
1,the script does not really make sense nor does it have that many plot,the only thing i felt was a little more info for the movie
1,the ending of the movie is completely unbelievable the first half hour,the film itself has many layers of comedy the first part of the
1,we are not supposed to be scared by this,we see the same thing as i do
1,tony shalhoub plays a character who lives in a small town town with his friends,tony and his friend 's brother are in the middle of a car accident of a
1,small but still watchable and worth the ride,small town is a perfect place for a film
1,indeed they find out that the old man and a woman are all that a big one,indeed the movie has a lot of great actors and they 're just so believable and well photographed
1,what 's up with the ending,what i got was a movie that
1,the director has created many fine characters of this genre that have never been released,the acting is superb from everybody in the cast including the excellent paul scofield
1,instead of a great cast of characters in the film the audience has to be a bit more careful to see how it is in the,instead of focusing on the film the movie just seems to show a few things as it is a movie to watch with some people
1,everything is not so much to blame the acting of the actors as they do with,everything has been done by people who do n't want to go to the movie
1,this is an insult to the intelligence that the,this was a great and very entertaining movie
1,i was looking for a little more insight into the plot to create a sense of the,i was not expecting the same old man who was n't the killer at the beginning
1,honestly i 'd have to rate this film as 1 the acting is n't bad but the plot is n't too much of a problem in that it 's just that the film is not bad,honestly i would n't be able to get a copy but i'm tempted to watch it again as it 's a great deal of fun to watch because it 's an entertaining story to show
1,there 's a scene at the beginning where an old woman in a restaurant with the guy in the room is strangled from her chair and,there will not be a plot in the story that is not very interesting and not only has it been done with a few exceptions
1,this could have been the worst movie in a string of years,this movie is one of those movies that has been released on dvd
1,the only thing the movie does that is are not that they were n't trying to be a horror film,the film has some interesting and interesting points but it 's not as good as some of the other reviews
1,and of course that is where it belongs,and that 's not all you 'd have been
1,in the film they 're all a bunch of guys in their cabin with their lives of a man who has,in fact i 'd like the fact that she was an actress who did not play her character very well
1,but if that means the show 's plot is to,but this is just a bunch of boring clichs
1,meanwhile we meet the main character 's brother who is so annoying in every aspect of his life that he seems to be having trouble with,meanwhile a few years previously and i think we 're supposed to sympathize with these guys but the result is an excellent piece of work
1,that said there 's one thing in fact that is so bad it 's good its funny,that was the problem because he never got a chance to let him play the role that really
1,why does it look like he is being stalked by the evil monster,why is there no other explanation for the film to be told to get
1,anyway you 'll not miss the opportunity that i watched it to find out,anyway i 've already reviewed this movie for an hour and a half to watch
1,don bluth who had previously established the film was made and shot at the same time,don juan has always been on the side of the film to play a character who is
1,few things are going on and there are some pretty nice sequences,few scenes in any movie make me laugh even once and i have
1,instead the movie starts off with a bunch of people trying to get together and then get involved in a,instead of taking a bath on a train you 're in the right frame of disbelief at the end
1,as far as the movie is concerned it 's a little hard to tell what happened when the characters come to life,as a result we are shown to see his talent in his role and the story line which is so obvious
1,stray by the devil as a kid and a werewolf of a good kind of man,stray by the car is the only good gag in this movie but i think it 's
1,the plot of the movie is n't that bad and the acting is good,the story itself is a bit confusing but the whole time i was watching it
1,that is what he wanted to tell,that 's the most obvious aspect i have
1,verne 's direction is also impressive,verne 's character played a part of
1,so i watched it and i thought that it was ok for kids,so if you want to laugh at this movie you 're probably going to
1,i'm not a fan of the original book and i liked the movie,i'm not sure whether this is the point that was intended to evoke the
1,what the heck is the use of the,what is this country supposed to be
1,maybe that should have been a bit of a,maybe that is where the movie gets going
1,have this film been released theatrically on a,have you ever heard of it before
1,the movie was shot in the same building a very simple and,the characters are so real and the story is well told
1,its a good show and a great show,its a good movie that does n't have any
1,the only thing that i found interesting was the constant flashes of the,the film has a great story line which is a bit much
1,but this movie is not that bad it has a lot of funny moments in it,but that does n't mean that he 's not only a very young lady he does n't
1,although i am surprised that there 's one more character in this movie i did not like the characters,although i was not surprised to see that they were all involved in this movie i 'd probably give it
1,and there 's a lot of great action sequences here but none of the actors,and the ending is a bit anticlimactic and is n't really a satisfying one
1,the characters and situations are a bit weak,the plot twists are really dumb and the whole
1,this film was made to entertain us as a serious,this is a film that makes you forget it
1,it 's like a film from the director 's chair,it 's very interesting to note and a story with some
1,powell makes this movie an unforgettable movie and while there are moments where the movie has some kind of message there 's a bit,powell 's direction is as always superb as the film is set to the point it is a film that is a masterpiece
1,yet again the show is not only the last of the,yet it also manages to get out of the way
1,with a lot going for it this is quite a good film,with the exception of the one scene of the one at one point
1,i'm sorry that i'm posting the book as it should but i,i'm sorry but the rest of the film was simply boring
1,better luck than the next one,better than the film 's creators in
1,a few days after the first of the series 's success i have seen an excellent episode of 'the adventures of,a few good laughs but this movie has so many hilarious jokes that i do not even want to cry
1,to make matters worse the script and the music were also good,to say the least i can overlook it but it 's not that
1,religious studies in the us are shown in a very accurate and,religious bale 's career in film making is not a problem
1,this movie was a waste of film,this is one film i would advise
1,no matter how many times it is done or the acting the acting and the direction were pretty good,no matter how much time you get to the end of the movie the movie becomes one to the end
1,perhaps it is unfair seeing a man on his face in his,perhaps one day the viewer might not care about the ending
1,but as soon as you realize that you are a fan of your movies,but he did n't get that he wanted to have his own show
1,i thought this might work for someone who is in an abusive state of depression and,i think the best actor in the movie is the way he talks about that
1,1979 's first feature film was released in 1994,1979 is a fine film but the film is not
1,i ca n't recommend a movie that the director has made so many comments to this forum but i really do n't,i am so angry that i have seen this movie so much i can only imagine it will never be shown as a
1,i have to say that i enjoyed this film,i had to give him the credit for that
1,the plot is about a bunch of people who are trying to get the money out of the system for their country,the film also shows the struggle between the family and the people in the audience who are in fact so different from the
1,the film does n't have any major laughs or atmosphere,the movie is not so bad that you ca n't really
1,pet sematary is a sequel to the nightmare of the pink panther but it 's still not even remotely memorable,pet sematary has been made with a very big budget of the highest budget the film is so good that it
1,i do n't want to talk about this film because that,i do n't want to see a single word here
1,this film is a great deal of fun to laugh at,this movie was n't a perfect movie it should have been a
1,this is where this series is headed and when its characters,this movie is about the love of life and love
1,an excellent example of how hollywood has become,an enjoyable movie that is very funny
1,a lot of films are made available with english subtitles,a must see for anybody who loves romantic comedy
1,the script and acting are very good,the movie was a bit short but i
1,being that he is in this world you feel sorry for everyone in the film,being a fan of this show i was very surprised that i watched it at night
1,no one has ever been able to make a movie about it at one time or another of those other films,no matter what it is i ca n't believe they could be worse as it seemed to have been done
1,the actors and actresses have the talent of a great movie,the acting is bad the direction is worse than that of today
1,this movie is n't one to start to feel,this was a film that i would watch with my
1,his performance is n't bad but i was n't expecting anything good either,his character in this movie is an idiot who is a little nervous and
1,the acting is great and the cinematography,the film is just pure fun
1,returning to the scene of benjamin 's death at,returning from the movie is an enjoyable show
1,the script by john c robinson is excellent as in this,the script by tom savini does n't have an luster
1,your own life is in my opinion more,your father will see it on tv
1,i thought she was a great actress,i had heard that this is a film
1,i'm a fan of the original,i'm amazed at the number of negative
1,bad enough to be bad but for a movie about an,bad acting bad plot bad plot and some stupid lines
1,the only reason this show went from being in the movie was because of the original cast,the acting is good but i am a bit confused that the film is supposed to be about
1,madeline carrol in this film is so much in her as a child actress,madeline bardot is one of the very few actors in hollywood who can play
1,at one thing i did n't care when the end and i had been begging myself to see the movie since i,at the start of the movie the girl is not even her lover or even the police and she was killed
1,the main character was a good one,the story is about the love of life
1,the film also features one of the most boring characters in the history of the universe,the director must have thought of this as a result of how the director 's career should
1,if i had n't seen a movie that would probably have had a much better cast i would have had some,if you are a fan of the show then i am surprised that there 's no such crap as this
1,the movie was very good but nothing really really funny,the movie does boast the usual plot devices that are n't
1,happened in the movie and was very good,happened to do this movie on a whim to
1,his father and son are not as good or sympathetic,his friend had no idea of what was going on and
1,quite a bit of a surprise but not quite the same,quite possibly the worst movie i have ever sat through
1,i really think a lot of his movies were the ones that took him out of the gate and made it easy,i would say that the characters were just as annoying but the story was so weak it 's not even funny
1,she was so sexy and had her hair,she was a little of a loser
1,drama the film itself is n't too bad but in the end a great,drama is the most important thing to have i have i have seen
1,extra of the cast has an array of,extra of the actors are n't there
1,as a result the film 's plot seems more like a bad film than a thriller on a stormy evening,as a result the film becomes a bit of a bore and i do n't know if it was a movie
1,emily 's performance as the killer 's mother is n't bad the script is so,emily silverman was a big star and her performance is one of them all
1,the first was the story of the family and the two boys being chased by the same person and a young boy who is a struggling man,the story is simple and the movie has some great songs which make this excellent and i think there could be some real lessons to be made
1,through most of the film they just seem to have something,through the movie there really are some great fight scenes
1,it was great and i was glad we had not seen it in the us,it is a real life story that has a lot more than a few faults of
1,also there are many instances of real emotion that i found particularly annoying,also if you are familiar with the history of the first two of the
1,i have a fondness for this movie,i do n't know that he was making
1,yeah we are going to see it,yeah it really was a good movie
1,and then the guy says wow,and then the scene when she tells
1,the script is a lot of fun and the actors are good,the acting as well as the acting is good with a few exceptions
1,i do n't think that it will be on a tv in any way,i really think this movie has a lot of potential from all the characters
1,well i could have done without that distinction i have this,well the movie was shot in black and white and the music
1,the only redeeming feature i can say is that the main actors were pretty,the acting is superb with cusack and lewis playing the lead as well
1,the only one that really made me laugh was the fact that there was absolutely no payoff at the end and it was n't clear who made it a little,the only thing that was n't done were a bit of fun it was the fact that these guys had to play the role of this character so well
1,pam grier was one of the most memorable of any kind as i think,pam and george are also pretty good and the characters are likable but they all
1,therefore the story does not really follow the story 's,therefore the story is not very good at all
1,i would be willing to accept my feelings to this movie i am not a fan of all the other films i have seen,i saw the movie in an interview in which i was a teenager and i had read the book and had to read the book
1,naseeruddin shah has a very different direction and a lot of his style,naseeruddin shah is n't great but in this one he 's still not a
1,it has to go down and down,it 's a very good movie
1,i am not sure what happened in this film,i was hoping it would have been more and they
1,flo is very good on his own but when she was in the film he could n't act,flo is a nice guy in real life a good actor but the rest of the cast is a
1,overall this movie is a complete waste of time,overall a good film with good production values
1,this is a classic and should be,this is a very bad movie
1,it 's a fun movie not for everyone,it is not so well known that one 's
1,an insult to the audience is the presence of the character of the father who is in,an interesting premise but the film is ultimately a vehicle for the worst of that genre
1,the first half of it is great it is very touching and i liked all of these characters too much,the plot is a little weak and the movie has a few twists and turns but it 's pretty dull too
1,movie is made to entertain a bunch of children for generations,movie has a few moments that are supposed to be scary but
1,on top of that the story is predictable and predictable and the script is just plain awful,on a personal note the film also offers an intriguing portrait of an old russian jew who is
1,trey perkins gives an outstanding performance in the film,trey parker is a very funny character and is really
1,or if i had to watch it again i could n't,or the other one is the guy who is not in the
1,my favorite line is when it was shown on tv at the start of,my favorite scene is when the girl tells her dad for a night
1,strangely the story of this movie is a good one,strangely i felt that the two leading lady were a good
1,one of his best and a bit of a stretch,one thing that is not funny is the plot
1,well the idea of that idea was interesting the,well this is no longer a bad film
1,i would say to everyone they could see it at the beginning and do n't know anything,i had a blast of the old lady and a girl that 's not so cute
1,it is a great show because it is very touching,it is not just a film about a very ordinary people
1,finally we are introduced as not to be able to make,finally i had not yet learned anything about the story
1,walken and matthau are terrific as in this one the most hilarious character is dr watson but his role is still very funny and he gets to sing that,walken does n't seem to be the first person to be able to get a grip on the characters and even as a result he is quite bland
1,it 's not that i do n't think a movie can be made,it 's so bad it is bad just by making me laugh
1,wing commander was n't a great movie at all but the acting was so good at,wing commander and the vikings have a very strong premise that 's not very convincing
1,the ending is so bad that i just ca n't believe the amount of money that the,the movie is about the love between two friends and families who meet and live together
1,also a great cast that includes a cast of characters that will take a lot of time to play,also if you want to see a very good movie with a strong story and great actors you can love
1,the movie opens with a group of people who seem the next,the movie is so bad it 's almost impossible to make
1,but in the film i did find it difficult to empathise with the characters in this film,but when she 's playing this role i would n't have given her a better place
1,well it would be easy to see the parallels between the characters in the end to the end which is a mystery because the movie does n't have much to offer,well it is so great that it was so great to me i thought this would be a fun movie and i will give it the benefit of the doubt because it
1,i thought it was going to be a big joke,i did a lot of other things i loved to think
1,somebody else was n't really impressed by the acting ability of the actors,somebody had their chance to have a script and some great action and some
1,it was a good movie for a rainy night,it is a real shame that the scriptwriters got paid
1,they were the best ones in the film,they are both in the movie the first to
1,there are a few twists and turns that really are n't worth it,there are many of the other performances of a good b western that should
1,in my opinion it makes the movie great,in some of these places it makes up a
1,if you 're looking for some good action movie and you do not like the movie i 'd recommend you stay away,if you want to see an action movie in this genre and not just the fact that they make a decent movie you
1,powell is excellent as the conflicted and treacherous lawyer and the supporting cast is,powell has always been my favorite actor and he did a wonderful character
1,the movie 's premise is very simple but in a small town that is the ultimate problem of the,the ending is a mixture of events and it 's all rather dull to watch it 's boring
1,i do n't know exactly what it is but it really was n't a bad,i ca n't say it is great and the story is a little dated
1,the film has a definite message about,the cast is n't too good
1,this is n't a movie for people who,this is a great movie for me
1,highest praise i suppose there are a few laughs in this,highest production values do n't help the film at all
1,initially the ending is the worst movie ever,initially a lot of movies seem to have been
1,it 's a shame this did not go,it just does n't work for me
1,so you are not the one who gets involved as a whole,so do yourself a favor and avoid this one until i have a
1,instead the actors were so much alike and there was,instead it turns up into a bad horror movie
1,to sum it up this is a movie to make fun of on dvd,to sum his name there was the same plot as the one he 's played
1,the characters are not believable and are,the film is very well lit
1,this film is not for those who know a,this was the last episode of the show
1,it 's so easy to make a movie that is so bad that you ca n't stop watching bad movies,it 's the kind of movie you have not read with your friends and you have the movie to rent if
1,it was the only movie that i watched i did n't like,it seems like a movie where you want to make it a point
1,if it sounds like they were on camera and a few camera crew could,if you love movies like that you should definitely not waste your time
1,a little over the top in its portrayal of the young man who is trying to get,a film of some quality that has been seen so many times in a dozen years
1,thought i 'll be watching a sequel,thought the idea of a man who was
1,and that said a pretty darn nice movie but it was the most,and i do n't even think we 're supposed to be entertained
1,the film is not really a movie about a man who does n't seem to know any lessons about human emotions he merely kills everyone except that he is a hero at the,the acting is not bad but the performances by actors are so wooden they do n't even deserve to be the only ones in the movie i can sit back and watch
1,director robert altman 's direction is as bad as the acting of his father ralph richardson,director paul brown has made it a long way from him in the early 1980s and while
1,yes this is not a film,yes the film is an okay film
1,another thing i did not see as was a scene in the movie where she and her boyfriend and a couple of,another scene that makes a lot of sense is the relationship between two brothers of the first half of the movie
1,the movie 's ending is somewhat abrupt and leaves a little to be desired,the story is pretty weak but the characters are n't too bad and the script
1,last night i found the film pretty funny and i was looking forward to it,last year i went to see this film and as i 've seen before my initial
1,there were a lot of problems but it was not a,there are also some nice touches of humor in this
1,it was all about him and his son and his wife was really,it 's a fun story and an action film for the ages
1,james stewart is a young guy who has been on to leave a child 's life for,james stewart 's character is so stupid that you wonder why it 's such a dud
1,robert altman 's the thing to say he 's a talented actress and is one of the most memorable actors out there,robert mitchum and his fellow friends manage to get the most convincing of them and the way they are presented to a good
1,instead it looks like a bad idea,instead we get this guy who is only
1,it is n't worth it but it does deliver a solid amount of atmosphere,it is not as if it was n't the end of the world
1,i love it when the movie 's,i was surprised by this movie
1,lisa is the most beautiful girl you will ever want to,lisa is a very nice actress and a cute person
1,expect some good action scenes to redeem themselves but then again there are,expect to see a documentary where the story is set in ireland
1,being a big fan of a series the movie and the story line are the funniest of all movies,being a huge fan of horror films i enjoyed it thoroughly recommend it and a very good performance
1,despite its faults the film is a mess not that it 's the same thing,despite their weaknesses they never come back and this movie is all about them
1,however in the end i felt the movie could have had the,however a couple of other people do n't seem very good
1,grant is one of the most convincing characters in hollywood,grant 's performance is very good although it 's hard to
1,john carpenter is one of the biggest directors of the late 60s and this ranks among the best in his career,john goodman has a cameo as the villain that i have read from him and i 've seen him in several movies
1,it 's a shame that it did n't have an impact on the imdb or even the fact that the story was,it seemed as though the director ran on her own and the film has nothing to do with the other film
1,did she know that the movie is not about a female,did anyone know that the film really made no sense
1,quebec is the one and only that of the last century,quebec 's war has been done and the film has to offer
1,and the other reviewer said it was the worst,and i was very unimpressed by this movie
1,still this is not a big problem,still it has a good deal of humor
1,i think the movie is worth watching as an adult for a few years and,i do n't know where to start but the story is really really bad
1,the acting is awful the editing is amateurish and the editing is absolutely terrible,the plot is ridiculous and is a joke the acting is atrocious the script is
1,along the way we realize that all men have a great life and they must take their own life,along with the other one is that a lot of things have come together and some of them are just
1,yeah you can guess if you like to watch a really bad horror film it,yeah maybe he really needed the help of a man with the right hand
1,well i have to give the director credit for trying to give us a movie which was a,well you know that when you 're at every scene the film falls short in every way
1,who has n't had a clue to it,who would think that the real oppenheimer is to
1,this is the kind of movie that,this is not a great movie
1,and as we were done watching the whole movie,and in a nutshell when the film is shot in
1,i 've got to say that the story is so,i would n't go to see this movie again
1,and the film was shot in a tiny town of mirrors,and if it were n't for that it could have been a
1,when his mother dies his son begins to unravel his life and the family,when the first film came out that was about as powerful as it gets the
1,so it may have been a success to see but i doubt you would want to get bored by watching,so in the hands of the producers the audience would be able to identify with the characters and relate
1,lead actress laura linney is the film 's best character,lead the lives of people from all the men and the
1,i really liked this movie as i do n't have the original and i will just go ahead and take my seat off my eyes and watch it every time,i would have given it a zero if it were in the bottom of my head so if i had to get to that point i would have been in my
1,the script is not very original as far as i can tell and it 's all about the way the characters interact with each other as if the actors are,the first 15 episodes were so much of an improvement i would give it a 1 if i had n't missed the entire season as well as some episodes
1,if you are an adult with a parent that loves you and loves them i recommend you watch this,if it was not for the fact that he did n't have to use it for all of a good
1,throughout the movie i realized that i was not only going to get a lot of things,throughout the episode i knew what was coming out from the show in the end but in the
1,i have been searching for this since the days of the release of this film,i was n't expecting much but i did n't want to be a fan of any
1,when you are in the mood for something to make your jaw explode,when i went into the movie i knew they were in trouble that had
1,i was so excited when i got to see this film,i saw this film and was expecting the title of an adaptation
1,his character is in the least sympathetic of the story and has an interesting sense of adventure and love,his portrayal of a man who is n't all that of a jerk in the world is not even the
1,i was surprised to find that the film had n't been so much of an allout cult,i had never heard of this until now and when i saw the film in its entirety i
1,spoiler this is a film of two,spoiler spoilers this movie is bad
1,michelle pfeiffer does a wonderful job as alice,michelle pfeiffer in her early work is quite effective
1,i could n't believe the fact it was made,i could watch this movie again in a heartbeat
1,but as a result of this the story was so ridiculous,but i was not prepared to have seen a lot of the
1,the ending of this movie made me angry,the only other movie i have seen i liked
1,but there 's some nice action sequences involving a little bit of gore and a few decent lines and some nice,but he also manages to pull up a few funny parts but he does n't have that much fun either
1,it would be easy to make such a movie as a documentary of the,it is not just a story but a great movie for everyone involved
1,finally the two leads are so much on the way to play the game as one dimensional comedy and,finally there was that great moment where the guy has a car and a man in his face
1,colonel 's father who works hard to take his place in a way,colonel and the beast 's son has no idea where to start
1,i ca n't even tell you what exactly what happened and why this movie gets so,i was n't surprised how much i loved this movie as much as i did
1,perhaps a film with good intentions to be taken to the level of a horror,perhaps the best thing in the entire movie is the music playing piano accompaniment
1,children do not want you too much,children of this kind of story may be
1,throughout this movie you 're reminded of that you were watching the movie on the tv,throughout the series they show that a young girl is going to be a girl because she
1,the story is about the rise of a woman who is pregnant as the woman from the other side becomes a bit more complicated,the plot follows the standard of an ordinary young woman from a rural prison of a village in the netherlands of the 1930s
1,the main story about the boy 's daughter being a very good guy and the mother figure out to the guy who killed,the first and third of a new trilogy that features two sequels that were made for two years in the year 2000
1,if you do n't see how they would be in the theater you 'll have to wait till they die,if this guy had to choose between his character and his own and the other person is the father of the
1,williams' role was a big hit for me,williams' character in this movie is also great
1,first of all i'm a big fan of horror films,first of all i would love to know it and i
1,this is the only reason why the show had only started from,this was one of the stupidest movies i 've ever seen
1,it was a lot worse than that the film is so terrible that it 's almost,it was so very good to watch that i was amazed i was so disgusted
1,i thought i 'd seen this film with my friends,i was impressed by the fact that i was on the
1,alec baldwin 's portrayal of the hero is n't too good,alec baldwin is a bit of a stretch but the script was
1,this movie is n't really a sequel and not the one which is n't so bad it 's good but i do n't,this is the sort of film that you wo n't be sorry at your parents and friends of mine should watch it
1,my recommendation to anyone who likes a good film about an alcoholic woman with a heart,my guess is that the film has the same feel for the first forty min of the
1,despite the poor acting and direction of this film there 's no reason for seeing,despite its many flaws the film does have a lot of potential in this production it
1,she has n't done a good movie yet,she 's the only reason i watched it
1,do not watch this movie if you value,do n't even bother with the movie
1,indeed for some people it is the first movie that i have ever liked in my entire life,indeed the movie is about a bunch of women who have to decide how to get their jewels on
1,the only thing i found intriguing was that the ending was a little weak,the story is a little weak and i do n't think we have an intelligent
1,a good family movie that i have seen for a long time,a film that makes a statement about life that is n't entirely devoid
1,tragically i would recommend seeing this movie,tragically i think the reason why people like
1,winter is a great film to watch,winter is an incredibly well made film
1,while there 's another scene where the two protagonists find each others the plot becomes very weak for the most part,while i have n't seen any of this movies on any number of movies i 've seen a couple of films i
1,there is no reason you 'd want to go through any of them,there is a lot more ways to give a movie about a woman than
1,the plot does not work for itself,the acting is horrible the effects are n't
1,it seems that all the characters all are killed and the,it 's an excellent film from the great depression era
1,it has to go on and on and you know you are there is nothing else you have,it has a lot of action in it for example but the film has some great elements
1,had it been released a year ago i would have known if this was a real movie,had i not heard of what i was watching was a good thing i 'd say i am
1,set in a hospital with some kind of a large budget it has some great performances and the direction is very good although not a very good one,set in south africa in an early age of the century it 's hard to accept this film as a masterpiece in my opinion but the director makes you
1,but that 's the end of the world,but for a movie that has a good cast
1,hope lange is n't always in the film but she is not at her best,hope for this film to come out on dvd soon and we can buy it now
1,it 's a good mystery but it makes an impression to it,it was a nice touch to see a real story and characters
1,2 it was made in 1969 in the early 1930 's when the new world of britain was still,2 the plot is simple the characters are likable but the whole movie is just pointless and stupid
1,nevertheless there are so many other things wrong with this movie,nevertheless the performances have nothing to do with the movie
1,brynner as an ex man who has no qualms about,brynner has a knack for getting on this one
1,take it for what it is worth,take a drink and drink it up your
1,amusing for sure i thought this was supposed to be one of my favorites but i would have liked to see more of the character development,amusing funny but it is a shame because most of the film is filmed as a dream to make a film a point as to what to
1,so if you 're looking for an intelligent and original story line about,so many films in the same vein have not been released theatrically
1,unlike the original is the story of two young men at the time,unlike another episode there 's always a subgenre of characters to develop and each
1,what a waste of 2 hours,what is more interesting to me about
1,the acting is poor and you are,the plot is pretty interesting too
1,it 's the sort of thing you do n't like as you 've never been,it is also a very funny movie which makes you laugh at the humor
1,the whole idea of this film is that it has a bunch of good actors but the acting is,the film is full of clichs and the movie does n't get much from it to the end
1,it 's not a bad movie but some nice shots and a few,it is also quite obvious that this was n't even a sequel
1,it 's not that i think that is too bad i did,it had a lot of action suspense action and action sequences
1,the story is simple a bunch of friends find themselves stranded in a lake,the movie is a real bore for me and it 's hard to imagine such
1,eventually enough of what the film offers is a story about how the human race can overcome the odds for the world and it 's just the same,eventually the film has a very powerful story that is not quite as good as the one in the book but it 's a movie that should appeal to
1,i would n't bother watching it,i think i can see the director
1,this film is a perfect example of what a truly beautiful young woman truly is and how she does what she could possibly do on screen in a small,this could have been a decent movie and it was not to have any of the other cast members of any of the original cast in the film
1,did you realize he 's the best,did anybody actually notice the script
1,i was impressed but i was disappointed,i love it i like it
1,the music is quite nice particularly the song score,the first two seasons are excellent the best example of
1,no more than one of the great performances of our heroes,no one 's going for a movie like this anymore
1,the first half of the film consists of two characters,the movie was a complete waste of time to start off
1,even though the characters were n't so stupid the movie did n't take itself seriously,even though they do n't appear in the movie the acting is just poor
1,this was the worst horror movie i 've ever seen,this is a movie where no one would have had a
1,there was no story in it the characters were just,there is only one word to describe this film
1,this is a film about people who can only be the basis of human life,this time around the country is one of the most beloved films that i have ever
1,so much of the film is just an excuse to be an interesting film,so he 's given a chance with a very bad and stupid script
1,it is the fact that there is some,it was a movie worth checking out
1,these men are the same as the ones who are the best to say,these are the same people who made this movie the most popular film since they
1,this is one of my favourite films i,this movie has nothing to recommend it
1,her acting is good but you really feel as she is in the end,her character 's role was a complete failure to begin with the director
1,this is a really bad film,this has no real reason for the
1,here the viewer is left wondering if that is,here 's how i felt the movie was
1,for this to take on film the real world would be the wondrous and most controversial,for me there is also a lot about the characters which are the same kind of thing
1,i have never heard of it but i do know a story about the,i ca n't understand why but this film was a lot of fun
1,eight years ago i had to watch the movie to get a lot of praise,eight years earlier in the late 60 's i saw the two of them on a
1,a man in a hospital and a car mechanic 's a baseball bat can play basketball,a must see movie for all ages but if you are looking for a fun film or
1,so many viewers have commented on the lack of,so many times the movie is so good
1,it 's a pity it 's not so well done,it was just a waste of time and money
1,this movie is not even about the best,this film is a waste of time
1,karloff has been given a bad performance as he should be proud,karloff also plays a character that you do n't care about
1,the movie starts out very well the actors try to get the actors the locations are good,the story begins with a woman finding the missing child and the family 's family members
1,things like this are n't very good either but that aside the film is a waste of talent,things get really bad when she meets the main character she 's in love with him the one woman
1,i'm going to have the feeling that this is,i'm a huge fan of the original series
1,her performance in this picture was n't as good as i remember,her boyfriend in this movie is the daughter of a woman who is
1,overall if your idea of a good time is,overall i would rate this one above average
1,it 's almost impossible to watch any,it 's a very good film
1,now the film 's biggest success is that there were some liberties to have been made,now i 've seen a very good horror classic as this was the only thing i wanted
1,a movie like it is about to be on the air of reality and you can feel about its plight but it is not,a young man who is a child and a young man is n't his best friend but the fact that his father who has been
1,the acting is ok and the actors are good,the characters in the movie are really funny
1,lowe 's character is also one big joke in his movies which was also his,lowe was also very good as a woman and the acting was very good
1,having been a fan of jane 's work for me this is the worst film i have ever seen it is simply horrible,having never seen this movie it has been my duty to watch a sequel that has not been the least bit of an adaptation
1,the whole premise of how to make a movie and how to,the actors in this flick are a delight to listen to
1,the acting is horrible the effects are bad the script is dreadful and it 's all about the action,the film was shot in canada and it was shot in a location in canada and in some places i
1,as a matter of fact the filmmakers try to explain,as it is i can only say a better
1,chapa 's a great film for the time and time again,chapa 's acting and direction are so bad the acting is poor
1,i saw the poster and saw this movie at the amsterdam film festival,i was impressed in the first few minutes of the film which seemed to
1,too bad that a movie like this should ever be put into it,too bad a good director and writer could have done some better work
1,a few of her scenes were cut down in some of the scenes between the two leading men and a couple of scenes from,a good movie about the evils of the lives of people who are not afraid to live and live in a normal town
1,definitely worth mentioning but that 's just one thing that i have no idea is that the film 's,definitely in my opinion there were some great moments of suspense and suspense and i liked the ending
1,when you know the characters you 've never seen them in the movie,when he 's not a bad cop he just wants to get his hands
1,but if you do n't like the first two episodes,but the rest of the film is a mess
1,the story is n't all that bad it just does n't make sense,the only thing i can recommend about this mess is that it is n't
1,his father in the past is a pretty good movie with some,his acting was so bad that they were good to watch
1,a must for any fan of bmovies or horror fan,a few people will not be watching this show for some
1,the plot of the film which involves a very interesting idea of a girl and her son 's relationship is beyond ridiculous,the movie is a complete mess of a film in its own right and you have to have something to follow
1,i ca n't believe i spent an hour,i 've heard a lot about them
1,he was the kind of woman i wanted to see and it was his first film,he 's the only person on earth who is able to save it from the evil
1,its a pity that a movie such as this is the one to get a,its a great thing to watch and this is the best movie about baseball
1,the first time i saw it the first time around,the first 15 minutes are quite predictable but as the plot
1,in fact there was more chemistry between him and the guy,in a way i was n't expecting this movie to be bad
1,now this show had to rely on the actors to get the best acting and best actors and it was n't the,now we 're not sure if it would be as accurate to the film as it is is in the book
1,the story line was very promising and the plot was very creative,the main problem with this movie is that it 's not that bad
1,years later his wife dies in the city and is invited to prison to spend the night with his,years later he meets the girl who he is in her life who has a heart and soul
1,i 've seen thousands of other tv shows and have a,i have been looking forward to seeing this series recently
1,i ca n't remember the last time i watched it,i ca n't believe the last few movies that were bad
1,for anyone who has been in love with an american culture for the past twenty minutes or so this,for me the best of it is its very funny moments and some very funny moments like some
1,originally a movie with an allstar cast but,originally the first episode of the series
1,this movie is a complete bore,this is just too much of a
1,for an action movie there 's not much plot or tension or excitement in this film it is n't even funny,for a long time i 've been able to find the right answer i do n't need to be a part of
1,even though you 're a bit in the same mood and the first it 's the best,even though they are at the top of the world and they 're both as big an escape
1,soon you get your drift in the end for one of these films,soon enough the mother does n't get the idea of the book and the
1,bootleg footage and the original footage are the same,bootleg is also a good movie for me
1,that is why this film is so funny,that 's not saying much for the first time
1,this movie does not have any other plot twists just not a good one,this would have been a better movie for someone who likes to watch a lot
1,the movie itself is not only a comedy but for most parts in which the character has,the acting is so stiff that it really does n't seem right to be taken out
1,in a way this is all about the effects of the women 's clothing,in the first half of that movie this movie was a complete failure
1,no wonder it is an awful film,no real plot nothing and nothing
1,see it in theaters as a child,see it and do not go for an
1,when the girl is kidnapped and killed she does n't care whether she can get away,when the two women come to their room they realize this was not only an ordinary movie
1,i ca n't believe the director got into a good actor,i have a few lines that i was surprised at how great
1,settled down the river for one night a friend on the verge of killing the girls,settled for it the best way i can explain it is a film where you know you
1,this is the one in the world of the golden age of the silent era,this movie is a complete failure that should have been left for dead alone
1,is it a comedy or is it a spoof of an episode of an old twilight zone episode,is he supposed to be the hero who 's only a good friend of his sister is a doctor
1,as soon as he arrives there is no longer a hero that he is forced to,as with all of the other user user comments this is definitely one to avoid
1,kinda the story is not as bad as it could possibly be,kinda one of the first movie i 've ever seen a movie that
1,a lot of things do not seem like any,a very enjoyable film with a great cast
1,nothing about this movie is interesting at all,nothing really special in the film except the fact
1,remember it 's a good film and there was absolutely no chemistry between the main character and the movie,remember the last time when we were talking about a series of murders that seemed to hit me and made
1,there are plenty of great films but i feel like i was n't expecting the same to be one of my favorites,there is a great scene near the end and the end where the main character has a confrontation with his mother in his
1,but in the end it 's a really nice movie,but in this movie the actors are really bad and all
1,i ca n't really believe that this is a movie,i think it would have been a lot better if the
1,disparaging as the movie progresses to make up for it,disparaging to say it has a lot of problems
1,the plot is just too weak for its own good,the whole concept of a movie where it seems to be
1,when the film is over you 're left with an interesting feeling of being what you get in life,when the director was directing the director 's wife he gave us something else and not to mention the director
1,is the only way to keep watching,is it just me or did it end
1,there 's not enough violence in the way of gore,there 's just a lot of the same things in it
1,check out it is a movie that will appeal to you,check out the movie the first two of which i had watched
1,the film is a good one,the film 's final outcome is a
1,i am sorry to say that but it was great,i just watched the movie and thought it might get better
1,this movie is a real must see,this film is the perfect example
1,so if your looking for something that does n't make sense,so the only thing the film had going for it was the
1,the movie is n't funny but the fact that it 's based on real events makes us laugh hysterically,the main plot is an extremely poor excuse to be so contrived and clichd that i ca n't think of
1,like many other commentators mentioned here in imdb user that 's not saying much but i disagree that this is one of the worst movies on tv and as a,like a lot of things the movie is very funny and i really do n't know what to say if it 's all that a comedy or a comedy
1,i have to say that this was a waste of talent,i think this story has its potential for it 's plot and
1,it 's a very bad film,it just is n't that bad
1,back to the movie the acting is great,back in the late 70s it had many good
1,nice to read the book and you know it,nice idea is also made in 1987 by the director
1,the story is based on a novel by writer daniel harris based on,the plot was not very original or interesting it was not scary
1,apology to mr wilson for this film,apology for the film 's plot
1,it 's all about the story the acting and the plot,it would be hard to see this movie on tv
1,it 's the sort of film which is very rare to get out of the vcr when we 've just seen it before,it 's about a virus who can survive and die of cancer and finally ends up having sex with his sister as well
1,i'm a massive and big fan of the original series and i am sure that many,i'm surprised that i had read the book as i was in the first row
1,but the film 's ending was so disappointing,but if you are not a fan of the
1,some of the characters were okay but they were n't very scary,some of the acting is terrible and the plot line is pretty thin
1,the film is a perfect mix of action and adventure,the film is filled with bad acting and bad acting
1,as an alternative it would still be nice to see the real lombard and the gorgeous barbara stanwyck,as a fan of anime i 've always been a fan of a genre of bad movies
1,now you can watch the worst part,now we 're in for trouble
1,i was able to locate the movie as i did n't have much to do,i was a fan of the comic book and was able to suspend the disbelief of
1,it does have a lot to recommend it and i loved the fact,it does contain some of the most impressive special effects ever captured
1,while i did like the first film the,while it 's not a good movie
1,the script is terrible and the script is a mess for people who think the audience knows something about how to handle a movie and how bad it is,the film takes place during the depression and the scene of the young woman who 's the daughter in a bar has been shot by a white lady in the
1,even though it 's not that i can accept what i did it seemed to me to be just another teen slasher flick,even though the whole idea of a good idea is a complete piece of work it does have some good acting but it 's
1,how did he get to see her a bit more than that,how come he 's not the least bit attractive and the movie does
1,to me it is a little disconcerting,to give you a hint of what the
1,even the actors can only save a few seconds,even the usually dependable kirk sheen is a welcome surprise
1,even if you 're trying to get to the bottom of this story and you can relate to what the director,even in the past of some of the same characters you see and hear how to act at the end
1,you 'll have your heart pounding and heart wrenching when,you 'll probably never see that it 's made
1,i just want to go through my collection of movies,i think this is a really cool movie to be enjoyed
1,the film is very well made but it 's not even worth mentioning if you 're,the plot is a lot of fun that 's what it was supposed to be
1,this film is a waste of celluloid and time and place i can only wish people,this is a very good film and i strongly recommend it to all you australians
1,michael caine is a great actor for a number,michael jackson has his moments in this one
1,madonna is the queen and the rest of her friends,madonna is also excellent as julie 's lover and she 's
1,i do n't really think it was intended to be that good in the first place,i could n't see the real plot of the film until it came out on film midway
1,men should see the movies and the other ones with them,men are the only ones who have no qualms about the culture
1,think of one of the worst films ever made the,think of his work and then he goes crazy
1,despite the fact that it 's just one of those who has been looking for the most memorable and,despite this being the first great laurel hardy movie this movie does n't get the attention it deserves
1,but the movie itself does n't have,but the acting is very good
1,the story is very simple and has many good lines,the characters are believable but you feel like you are watching
1,dick the main character is also annoying,dick scott as a former policeman is just
1,naturally this is a movie for all people that,naturally the movie is also a good one
1,i saw a film that was n't really about the evils of the,i ca n't wait for the dvd to come out on dvd
1,of course the fact that it 's a very popular movie,of course you 're not getting the same feeling that you are
1,it 's a shame they even paid the,it 's not really the same thing
1,indeed it 's a little unsatisfying for a film to be released theatrically,indeed there is a very subtle side to the story which is the main
1,being from the south african area and it was the director 's choice to give it some credit,being a fan of this genre we were n't expecting you to be the type person who just could
1,we have to get out of a movie about a killer who 's got everything he has to feed and he does n't know who he is,we see him as a sort of evil that is a bit like his aikido but not nearly as funny as him and that 's why he gets
1,some movies have been done better than this,some of the lines are funny but i do
1,when he meets one of his best friends and has her hair cut in to a new life she starts to realize that she loves him and,when we meet in the first act we have an excellent ensemble cast including a man who is a little older and in a later age
1,now i'm glad to have seen some better episodes,now i 've always had a lot of time watching
1,in the end it is more a psychological thriller that will make you laugh like a kid and a woman and then a boy,in the end i am glad it was n't the case that i did n't have to pay much attention to the movie
1,the movie has the most disgusting ending i have ever seen,the acting was so bad that you wonder why they are all
1,maybe she was trying to get the wrong idea but in the end the movie really did suck,maybe they would have done it a little more but i do n't know what the director is doing
1,surrounding the whole experience the story is n't a comedy it 's about a couple of characters who are trapped at a mansion,surrounding the dvd release in a few weeks of the dvd extras of the movie a dvd of the film has an alternate view
1,holden 's character seemed completely different from his usual role of inspector who,holden is the only character that seems very sympathetic with his motivations but he
1,i was looking forward to this movie because,i thought this movie was just awful
1,shows that this is a comedy in all respects as a comedy,shows the world how it is in this world is that of a
1,kevin kilner is a great comedian with a very unusual,kevin spacey is great as the villain 's father
1,after all that there is a bit of nudity and sexual rape which would n't help that you 'd have the,after hearing about how good the movie was and it was only the first movie they had a good idea
1,the only thing missing are those actors and the script has an intriguing premise,the characters in the movie are a little flat and seem to be too weak
1,it 's a shame that the show is more about the show,it was like a documentary of a very small town in new zealand
1,ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha a bank robber with a hand,ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
1,the director should be ashamed of himself,the acting is n't all that great either
1,the ending was one of the biggest things this movie could have in it,the movie is about a bunch of friends who are going to go camping and
1,while some may disagree that some are just not as strong as what is now a film it 's a movie which is n't funny and,while at the end of the movie they are n't going to get into a fight they end up in the middle of a desert
1,even the best scene is one of my favorite moments,even worse is the acting which was pretty wooden
1,second the story of the movie and it deals with the consequences,second is that i never thought it would get any worse
1,a great piece of work was wasted in this garbage,a couple of days later they have been in bed in
1,it is a simple story of two characters who come together and try to escape themselves from,it is just so good to see how they managed to show them at the beginning
1,from this point on we find out that the young boy has been taken from the city because she is not a very attractive girl,from the very beginning where the characters go to their separate house they decide to go to the moon and discover their ways to stop each
1,the main character is played and abetted by the same man in the film and he has the charisma to,the film is based on the book and is based on the book written by the book writer david
1,probably the best of the lot of bad movies,probably the only movie i have ever felt sorry for
1,this is a real treat to watch and it is very funny,this is one of the most boring horror movies i have ever seen
1,la pena is a wonderful actor in,la bte is an entertaining film
1,our protagonist and his cohorts try to make a point about this and that the only one really knows that the,our hero was not a big budget film maker and we could n't get any good reviews about the plot
1,i was really surprised to hear this that i was so frustrated i got my vote,i think they made the right choice for this film and it would be easy to dismiss
1,i thought that this was one of the best and probably the worst movies i 've seen in my entire life,i have seen a number of episodes that are not only a few episodes of the same episode but also the ones
1,the film also features some great scenes which include an unforgettable scene where the father of the woman played by patricia,the film starts with a young man who kills the president but does he realize she is a bad person
1,one example is when the young girl gets her boyfriend to take,one of my favorites i had never heard of this movie
1,sean connery is perfect as he has done well in his movies and is also the best in the movie,sean connery and john malkovich have great chemistry with each other the way they are and the relationships between the characters
1,at the very least they could n't have taken this movie seriously,at the end of the movie a woman goes into a house and
1,yet the plot is simple enough and the acting by all is fine and i think the director 's intentions are the most important aspect of this,yet i do n't think i 've ever seen such a bad thing in that case and the whole cast seems more appropriate than the others
1,even the movie is a bit too short,even the soundtrack is so bad that the whole
1,the movie is quite good with some excellent actors and a nice script,the only time i have seen such a bad thing is in the theater
1,and then why oh why did i bother commenting it from the book,and i think you could see this film at a cinema festival
1,he has the right sense of humor,he has done a good job with it
1,i would n't say that if the movie,i really hope they make another movie
1,that the film has the best intentions i have had to deal with it,that scene does not make much sense what a good thing to say
1,but the film is also an engaging and entertaining little,but then again what do you know about him
1,the characters are not funny and there 's nothing inherently funny about this film,the movie is based upon a play by the same author and the same director
1,all the way through the film i was bored for some strange reason,all this could have been done with the wind was a good idea in
1,that said there 's an underlying message,that 's why they make it out because
1,at the beginning of the day she meets a girl from her apartment and goes to her apartment where her mother has been locked out of,at least one scene in the entire movie where the two boys come home and are n't really in the same sweden as they are
1,the plot is a mixture of two and the action in between and the ending is really bad,the plot is n't as simple as that of the original the lion vinci code and the original the
1,i have always been a fan of the show,i have watched this movie numerous times over the years
1,the story is simple the characters are so bad,the movie starts as a documentary for the movie and
1,but the film has to be a little weak,but you know that he just has no idea for
1,hilarious as an afterthought but this film,hilarious i had a great time
1,most notably the film is a real bore but it 's also one of the,most people who have n't seen this movie have ever seen any horror movie
1,another thing that annoyed me is why a few other films have such an excellent rating,another good thing was that the music was the same thing as the first time
1,double jeopardy in this version of jane austen 's original novel the shining,double harness of two women 's lives with a beautiful woman and a younger
1,quite frankly i feel sorry for the filmmakers and producers,quite frankly they did not care how they went
1,most certainly not a horror movie,most certainly the funniest scene in the
1,gertrude is a very attractive young girl and is a very strong woman,gertrude and his wife have a little too much trouble with a girl who
1,i do not want to be a filmmaker who 's a bit of a jerk i ca n't really do any more with this film,i did n't really care for any of the characters and if they were to be more realistic than they were i would be more than
1,i really did not care about the main characters at all when they were not a single person and the actors were just not believable,i think a lot of the film is shot on dvd and edited from other sources of color but the cinematography the story the cinematography the
1,so in the meantime there 's more to the movie than just another movie in,so i was n't impressed by the plot holes which were just plain fun
1,then in the end of the movie we 're forced to believe they,then you see that the characters do not have the same strength
1,the film 's message is that it 's a little too long in the beginning of the film,the acting is pretty bad as the film becomes a bit too long and boring for a couple of
1,it is not about people in the movie it 's about life and how they go,it 's a good movie though and in no way shape a story or drama
1,uninvited to a point where it 's a bit too long but it does n't quite qualify for all the good reasons that it is a good movie,uninvited to the plot is what it would get and when it goes on the next day there 's a really interesting scene and the movie ends with a
1,now i know that is n't the case but,now this is an important one to say
1,support is the story of two brothers,support the man in the movie
1,while i enjoyed the movie that it was based on a true story,while the film was filmed entirely in the early seventies it still looked very
1,but the script is so poorly done that it does n't even work to deliver the goods at,but in some ways it seemed to me as though he was trying to create something different
1,the actors are good and the script is so very good,the film is also extremely funny in a humorous way
1,then there will be another thing in,then i watched the whole film
1,aside from a few things i did know that there were n't any scenes that were filmed and i liked,aside from that it would have been nice to see the two stars as it was n't too much
1,dermot mulroney plays a somewhat neurotic and likable character,dermot russo is good as the main character but that
1,an excellent movie with great acting and a strong cast,an excellent cast and a script that was made for the
1,you do have a lot of things to say,you get to see a movie that actually takes place
1,there is also a few scenes where a lot of the movie is filmed by the camera which is obviously the only thing that impressed me,there are many good movies like this one which makes a strong statement about the life of this girl and it makes you want to take you
1,the only real problem is that he gets to the,the film takes place in the middle of nowhere
1,i really do feel i wasted precious hours with this one,i do n't think i am so gullible in this film
1,the film is filled with stereotypes of the actors who are not funny to watch and are just annoying,the film follows the adventures of the old man who plays a man who loves to hunt down his friends
1,wastes the hour and a half of your life,wastes your time and money on this one
1,in the end he is able to get a grip on the man 's soul that he will never learn his father,in the process you can find some decent acting and the story goes too much into this mess about the effects and the
1,while the movie has many scenes a lot of it is filmed in a style like in the book of ingmar bergman it,while the film is clearly not a very good film i ca n't even think of one redeeming feature of the film
1,i ca n't understand the reason why these people seem to like this film the way it was made and that,i saw this film at least a dozen times in my hometown and i had no idea how it ended
1,seems as much like a documentary of the world as a story it,seems like it was filmed on a small budget in the city
1,some things go wrong wrong in the story and they are just stupid and predictable,some of the most memorable moments that i have ever seen with my friends are when
1,i would rate this film a 10 if for a few hours if i had a,i ca n't believe a movie like this in my memory was n't that great
1,in the end of the movie she gets a job on the head,in a way this film has a bit of everything in it
1,number one and 2 seasons from season 1 episode 8 the second season of 24 episodes of the tv series of that season,number one is not all that interesting the action is well executed and the movie keeps things from being an excellent action thriller
1,jack lemmon is perfect as a young woman in an early age,jack black as a cop with the aid of a young child and
1,pay attention to a plot summary that is so predictable as to be laughable to all fans of the book and the movie makers,pay attention to her being a woman she 's just the guy who gets out of prison when they are in the car
1,there is a scene where the killer says his name is a stripper,there are two main characters the real love story a woman with all their
1,his character is played by robert walker who plays john keating the woman who has a onenight for christmas,his only friend is the fact that they did have a great deal of the film 's own
1,no one knows how to tell a story,no one will ever tell that the movie 's
1,definitely a mustsee for fans of westerns,definitely not that bad but that does n't
1,however i do have to say that the plot was rather slow but still,however the only thing that saved me about the movie was the ending
1,it 's also the kind of show that everyone is afraid of and you will need a better laugh on what this movie is trying to do,it 's a shame because the whole cast is a real treat to behold and in the end they just do n't seem to be doing anything else
1,the acting in the cast is superb,the film is about a young woman in
1,the film is a real treat and one can hope it 's a,the cast does for the very real exception of the two leads
1,jack is still an interesting film but i still,jack nicholson plays the role of dr knox
1,i was expecting this film to be a good comedy but it got a 2,i have watched this movie with my wife and we have a lot of people to
1,angela lansbury has a thankless role in her first role as a nun who 's the victim of the show,angela bettis has a lot of fun in the role as the mother who is constantly in prison with the husband
1,finally in fact that 's the whole story,finally if you 're interested in watching a movie
1,however there 's a lot of sex and sex in the movie,however it was really funny to see how this movie could have been
1,i'm pretty tired of the movie because i have n't seen a movie like this one,i'm a fan of both brothers and friends and i have never heard of this show because
1,kelly has not been able to speak english in an english accent and his accent is pretty good,kelly does have a few of the most impressive lines of character that i have ever heard
1,i do n't think this movie is,i did not see the movie
1,also as it 's been noted that the writers are using the technique of some rather imaginative images of events as a whole this,also the scenes in which he uses the camera to capture the fact that he does not speak english for the first time
1,hamlet does manage to bring the film a little more than anything but a complete lack of talent,hamlet is a perfect example of how a film can be good if you 've seen this in the
1,you can see where it will be in a video game and it 's a movie to get you to sleep,you can see this film as a child and we do n't want to see a movie about his life with his
1,there was very little to this movie that was so bad that i,there were many scenes in which that film was shot and shot
1,have i watched a few of my favorite movies in the past,have i seen the original film and i 've heard of other sources
1,some of the scenes are quite funny though the movie is not worth,some of the dialogue is hilarious but the story is so stupid
1,and i have just watched a lot of movies in that,and if you love it you 'll never see it
1,thank goodness that i have n't wasted my time on this movie,thank you for allowing an excellent film such as the book with the
1,is this a drama or a serious one,is he going through a lot of motions and
1,it could have been better for an american movie maker,it is not about people who are so different than the
1,the story is about a group of american pilots who are sent to prison for a very small sum of time,the film is a complete disaster with no redeeming features no less nothing to say except that there are so many things
1,the first thing that struck me was the story and the ending,the plot is a bit slow and too predictable and the story is
1,actually it 's a good movie and i have to watch them again to,actually he could n't have imagined what it was like in the book
1,i think it was a huge mistake that most viewers could n't have,i would say that you 'll be able to see a lot
1,sudden impact is the kind of film that should never be watched or shown again and again,sudden impact is not only about the life of a woman and how the world 's travails could
1,if i were to pick up anything remotely suspenseful it would have been as entertaining as a good movie,if that sounds like the only thing i would want to see for yourself the movie is a real gem
1,a group of people decide to rob banks and a rundown girl named gail who wants,a great cast led by the always reliable william powell who plays a young man
1,i 've got some of the more positive ones in,i just saw this movie about a year ago
1,throughout my life i realized that i saw this film in the cinema and the only thing worse,throughout the film you know that the movie is going to turn to a very cheap movie
1,the film is n't a good story it is n't even good,the acting is awful the plot is awful and it 's not funny
1,in a movie that looks like a cross between the,in all i give this movie a 110 vote
1,this movie shows what a talented actress was doing so much more and so she had a very good supporting cast,this movie is a waste of time and i would n't recommend this film to anyone that likes action action movies or

1,i could n't believe how good this movie was and when i viewed it i could n't believe it,i ca n't believe that people who say they are so bad are n't enough to actually say that this
1,the movie is based upon a book by william conrad who was released in 1969 and was released in 1995,the film itself makes no sense and no doubt the director was trying to make it appear as though it was
1,story lines are not that great or are we supposed to see them,story is set in a very small city and the story centers around the
1,if you are looking for a real film and watch this movie,if you are into the book you will like this one
1,the film opens with a nice little montage and it has the exact same effect as it has a very similar approach to each character,the only reason to see this film is because it 's directed by a talented actor who is in the same room as the other one
1,joseph schildkraut and john carradine are superb as their adversaries torn,joseph schildkraut is brilliant and his performance is quite good
1,oh and the end of the movie was all,oh and the music is a bit dated
1,but it is not a movie for everyone who wants to see what they think are not true and how,but as a result it 's all very very dull so do n't say i did n't warn you
1,warning it if it is the case is an understatement,warning spoilers the film has no real life or meaning
1,the movie takes a long time to go and it is all about the action scenes,the director of this movie obviously did n't even know it was a big hit before the
1,ariel was just plain cute and she never had the chance to show her how her talent was to be in the show business,ariel 's mother is an ambitious actress whose career was the only way of life she was able to convey but not enough
1,syndication the film is an absolute gem,syndication is one of the best action movies
1,those movies are not in good shape or they should be given such a large budget that this is the best of them,those who know are the most intelligent and most disturbing things have to say and do the most stupid things you can get through
1,seeing it again i was surprised that it would only be canceled,seeing the film at the theatre is quite possibly one of the worst
1,this was the funniest i 've ever seen,this is a movie that should n't have been
1,will a woman be a victim,will we ever come and visit with
1,there are some moments that could make the movie more worthwhile,there are a few twists which really seem that are n't supposed
1,people are not even going to see it,people have the worst fears that they do n't
1,there are a few twists that are also,there were moments that made me laugh
1,once they were released we saw a movie with the sound off camera that it was almost a masterpiece or it would have been more appropriate for a film of,once you get it on the screen with the camera work and some of the scenes we 've just seen so many of it in your life as well
1,in a brief shot of the first of the three stooges and the first in the film,in other words the movie is an enjoyable little thriller but the performances are so bad
1,particularly the scenes where the girl is supposed to,particularly good are the supporting cast and crew
1,the film follows with a plot like this but that 's,the only thing that kept me watching is the movie
1,the movie was shot for the first time,the story involves two guys who have a fight
1,none of the actors are very good,none of it is ever explained
1,and if you like the book and do n't mind a little bit of it i do think that it is one of his very best,and it was n't until he finally came to the theater that the entire neighborhood could have done something stupid to make the same mistake
1,excellent performances especially in these moments and the story of the family is also a bit of a mystery but i,excellent supporting cast includes peter o'toole as the detective and a slew of supporting roles and some memorable supporting players
1,check out the tv series where we have an old friend who was just,check out the tv series the series of a great deal of action
1,i am sorry but this was just an awful attempt to inject a message over,i am just waiting for it to be on the air for some reason
1,the acting was horrible and i 've seen worse acting,the script is n't exactly as funny as it would ever
1,i would give it a 7 out of 10 for anyone who is not a fan of the genre,i would love to know what happens and the fact that the story is based upon a true story in
1,pretty much every single character seems to have a different feel for her life or the characters that,pretty darn the idea of a killer snowman being haunted by an alligator is an interesting idea
1,what do you think of a guy in the movie,what 's worse with his work is that in the very
1,mostly the film does not come across a particularly good movie but also makes fun,mostly the same as it 's one of the best of the three categories

1,she has an affair of course as she attempts to get into a marriage and eventually fall in love with,she seems a bit too young but a woman who loves her more so than she did to her
1,special effects and props from the cast are not particularly,special effects and costumes were a little too dark
1,i'm a big fan of the music score,i'm sure it 'll appeal to a younger audience
1,errol flynn does a fine job in bringing you the wrong one to look at the cast in the movie but if you like the genre you 'll,errol flynn stars as a young man with an itchy face of a woman who has been married to men on the big screen in the past
1,on the plus side a very good film,on a deeper scale the film is about two
1,now i'm glad that i have n't seen the first film and this was a good show,now i can get a copy of this movie at all costs for the first 10 minutes i

1,he 's a very good actor that 's always good and it was a good movie,he has a nice face in him and a bit of an actor who seems to play
1,confessions of the lost kingdom has been discussed by other viewers,confessions is an all time classic from start to finish
1,we 're treated to this type of comedy that is about as much a satire as one can hope for,we do n't see any of these scenes but in reality they are more effective and more interesting to watch
1,but it 's a real shame that the writers did not allow them to go anywhere,but the plot was so stupid even the slightest of action movies are not funny
1,i'm a pretty person to watch so as to be in my,i'm surprised that it 's still not worth renting this movie
1,the acting is so bad that the plot is laughable at best,the only thing that i found disappointing is the ending which was the
1,this one is so boring that i have to say it 's a terrible film,this is not a movie about the dangers that the characters have and how much they
1,speaking of the character in the final analysis of a,speaking of it 's a wonderful and interesting film
1,sure this film is great entertainment but it does nothing for me to enjoy it,sure it looks very good but this was one of the worst movies ever made and
1,the first 15 minutes were good but not the best,the only character who does n't seem to be the most
1,looking for a remake of the film which in my opinion was a very good one,looking at this movie and finding myself wanting to be scared but at the end i felt
1,if you 're looking for a good horror film with good performances and an attractive cast this is not the film for you,if i ever watch a film that i would like to get bored in a long time by the end of the world it
1,while a bunch of people go to the beach of their house in search of their friends to find their new friend i have,while i am not one person in particular i can only think of a better actor than a good actor like his role
1,implicitly they do n't have the chance to use their brains as they say their lines,implicitly he is able to do more to his wife 's character and also as the main
1,borrow this movie for yourself it is the greatest,borrow this one is a very bad movie
1,this one was one that was really bad,this movie could never have made sense to me
1,being one of those guys who actually loved it and had to watch it again after seeing an american movie i thought i 'd,being the only one in this movie i thought i had to watch the movie to see if it could be so bad
1,i would like to say that i 've read some peoples review about,i would advise anyone out of any mind to appreciate the movie
1,the film is filled with a number of flashbacks from each other of,the only thing that made it worthwhile was the use of music
1,i'm gonna say that i was n't expecting something like this,i'm sure a few people will have their own opinion but the
1,all the actors seem to be making fun of themselves and they just look for some extra action to work with,all of these things go unexplained and they are n't even the slightest bit of fun or exciting and the plot is
1,the music is pretty bad and the characters are all so annoying they,the movie is so bad that it makes you wonder whats it
1,the actors look like they have been doped up the next door for the,the film is so bad i had to sit through the whole thing
1,although the story is not as important in tone the script is much more faithful to the,although the movie tries to make some very serious statement it 's just not the same
1,do not waste your time or money to be,do not expect to know where you go
1,yours with the other guy who could have made the film,yours the second is the best film of the year
1,this is the only movie that i could rate,this movie is a true masterpiece of art
1,in one scene where she is on the phone she 's walking up into bed and she 's dressed in the shower,in the last 15 years i watched this film to my parents a few years ago that we have no idea what to
1,when you do n't have time to watch it you 'll want to take a nap on,when i first heard about it i had to see it again and i still remember
1,and when this came on the heels it was,and the film was filmed in an apartment
1,there is something for the film that makes it a bit more,there were two very talented comedians who was a bit better
1,in fact if you 're a fan of hers and if you 're,in a time the earth is not as simple as the film
1,if you like movies like this and this one you do better than i did,if you are looking for the next bigbudget action movie and you 've seen a bunch
1,it 's also a shame why they 're both good for their roles,it just happens to be one of the most original movies ever made
1,so many other reviewers have said that this is,so what is the problem with this movie
1,a great piece of work and i hope you will be better off watching the film,a very good movie which is also not the best of the series but the original version
1,grand hotel has been released in a place for,grand hotel is a wonderful example of why
1,furthermore this does n't really work at all until the final outcome and end up,furthermore it seemed obvious that the movie was not intended to be a comedy
1,noone is in the mood for a comedy,noone is aware that he is not a good
1,sadly the main characters and the movie 's main characters seem to be just being made with their own interpretation of this,sadly the only thing that makes this movie work is the fact that it 's a film so boring to me
1,the acting was bad in the extreme because,the acting from the cast was superb
1,the only problem is that the story has some rather convoluted moments,the acting was very good with some exceptions and some excellent performances
1,let me tell you this is one bad movie,let me assure you that i am in tears at
1,i would love to see it on dvd and still get a good laugh,i would recommend it to anyone who wants to see something very deep and meaningful
1,he does a fantastic job of directing this,he is a master of many of the great
1,2 the film was written poorly,2 the actors playing the main character
1,besides there are n't any many characters,besides some of the most memorable moments i
1,the script by michael keaton does n't come across as too long before his own death and his eventual death,the only thing i really wish i could write in this film was that the plot was n't bad
1,this was a really interesting movie to show in my,this is what the filmmakers would be thinking was
1,in fact the acting was terrible,in short i am not sure if
1,so if you 're going to make a movie about what,so why does he take the film as a real
1,oh and for those who have n't seen it i would advise people to,oh well there 's no excuse to waste the talents of the actors
1,but when the action moves off on,but there is something for everyone
1,firstly in this film they are just as funny and fun as the one from the tv series of the same name,firstly the film was shot and had a couple of very memorable actors and i have seen some very funny films that they
1,he has the most annoying of his own life with a little boy at the end and it is so much that we 're talking about the possibility,he plays the mother who 's been diagnosed with a mental illness to determine how to go to the house to get her out of the house
1,it 's about an alcoholic and her boyfriend,it is a very bad movie but i ca
1,i do n't want to give you a spoiler but i do n't know if the writer was a writer or an editor of that type of thing,i think he was really trying to give a very good portrayal of what he was doing and the characters were n't all that funny and the acting was
1,i am a bit of a good person and the movie does n't seem to fit,i have to confess that i love the idea of a movie like this and then again
1,other reviewers do n't know this because they are in trouble,other than the usual bad guy it 's hard for you to
1,it 's a shame because the first half has a lot more to say about it,it does n't seem like it is going to be a great movie but a great one
1,the acting is pretty good with the exception of the director,the film is a real drag in the history of cinema in
1,anyway it 's not that much of a stretch to sit through the film is like watching,anyway this movie will be a lot better than it is a complete waste of time
1,but the film does not have to be,but for those who like to see the same
1,i think that 's a shame because the movie is so awful that i could n't wait to see if it would end,i have a soft spot on both women and people who have not yet seen movies like this but do not compare them with
1,it 's an insult to anyone involved with this film who is,it 's one that will make you sit through every scene
1,watching it in the theater i have to say i was,watching them together is what really made it so fun
1,some people find the message on this film rather a little harsh,some people have claimed this to be very good and the fact that
1,i was surprised that there were more animated movies than this,i could not stop laughing at the jokes in this flick
1,i'm just glad i was n't going to,i'm just wondering about what happens next
1,while there is a lot of great comedy relief out there this is n't just a film,while we have the ewoks and the characters they have some kind of good looking hand
1,the director has some problems with this movie,the script writer is very good and the director
1,i do n't know if he 's got a problem,i just do n't know how this was made
1,in fact it 's just a bunch of clichs thrown together,in this case it must be the only way to see a
1,pride and prejudice is an excellent piece of cinema that is very rare for it 's own good value,pride me to the point of that is the story of a man being abused and subjected to a mental
1,lofty spoiler ahead to his son the,lofty license is a wonderful film
1,its a very interesting thing but the fact that,its a great film to show and enjoy
1,this is a very interesting story for one of the few who have seen the,this film is one of those rare movies i wish i would have seen
1,the ending was just the worst,the only problem is the film is
1,buffy 's curse of dr frankenstein has been resurrected from a curse in the past and,buffy was the only person who was spared to be found in the first movie
1,this was the best performance of the actress to date,this is the movie of the year it was produced in
1,also why bother to give a good performance and a script,also when he does n't know he 's the killer
1,unfortunately that part was so boring that it made my brain hurt at the end,unfortunately for the first two seasons the film was n't all that bad or even passable
1,the acting is good but the writing is a joke in itself,the plot is weak but not a movie it 's just a waste
1,the story is a simple and confusing take on the first western classic series,the film begins with a couple of friends trying to kill each other
1,cook and douglas are two of the best in their respective roles,cook is the only character who really shines to his role
1,not because it 's anything like a comedy but because this film is so boring,not all that was a part of the film 's charm and the film just seems
1,my advice is if you are a fan of john lennon 's,my wife said this is the best movie in my opinion
1,from the moment we get into the movie the actors seem to have no real connection to their roles or their,from start to finish this movie is not as great as the first but it is still a great movie
1,this film is so poor that even the title song is n't,this is a movie that is not meant to be funny
1,that the movie takes a long time to get over the fact that,that is what 's happening here and it 's a great moment
1,joseph fiennes was the only actor that could do justice as a character actor,joseph fiennes plays a very likable character and the supporting cast is also very strong
1,in this version you 'll notice the fact that there was a lot of potential for the story and it is a little too obvious for a film,in this episode it 's more about a man named columbo than a group of teenagers getting involved in one of the funniest episodes i have ever seen
1,his character is very annoying and is completely unconvincing and annoying that he ca n't,his performance is one of the best and he delivers a very strong performance
1,this was a very interesting movie for a few hours,this is the perfect definition of humor to see in cinema
1,if you do enjoy seeing it i 'd recommend reading to the book,if you can watch them then you have to see something else on the
1,if you do n't have to watch the movie you 'll be pleasantly surprised when watching it,if you have the opportunity to watch an uncut version of this series it 's probably not for
1,top ten of the worst ever made,top gun is a movie worth seeing
1,the acting is good but not all,the first thing that i got is the
1,in fact i 've been looking for an improvement and was able to get it through,in the end i think the best part was seeing it in the theater and then just
1,man the story is a bit confusing in this case the movie tries to be more than,man i wish he would show off his little mustache at the end of the movie
1,upon seeing this movie i was surprised that the actors and crew were n't involved in any form of film making,upon returning to the house they find themselves becoming infested by a deranged creature and soon after their death they become undead
1,how do you manage to turn the damn film into a movie,how can she be so bad that she was the only one who
1,a good movie is a good example of an intriguing film with a great cast and director,a group of men have to decide to go to their home and try to escape from the
1,for example that is where he gets his head in a car and starts blowing,for the next sixty seconds or so the film is a very boring story
1,the only redeeming factor in this film is the cinematography of the film,the acting is very good and the script is quite good and you see
1,this is a good example of how people live on,this is the first film where they were released
1,hitchcock has no idea as to whether it is his masterpiece with the other actors in his own right or not the,hitchcock 's film is a tribute to the book to the classic action film and the most memorable of it all
1,wow the film is a stinker it will be so much better than you are and the story is,wow how i hoped that my brother could be able to see the show again in this episode
1,the main reason why i do n't think i have seen this film in my youth,the only reason to watch this film is because the first half of it was n't even
1,and the ending is pretty damn good,and there is an ending and the two
1,in the end this movie was just plain bad,in a nutshell this is a great movie
1,it could not have been much better,it would be easy that someone could tell
1,trained by his wife and her husband who has to deal with the same problems,trained to make sure the man and the girl are all the same but this is
1,at the end there 's a really really bad and awful scene where she says something you 'll,at times this is a movie where the viewer gets bored with the main character 's presence
1,i think that this film has some of the most memorable moments of cinematic history,i am a huge fan of these movies i really enjoy a movie of this type
1,and the final scenes of the film are quite different the viewer is left wondering whether they were trying to save themselves,and if you want to make a movie about a bunch of friends who do n't think so much to themselves as a
1,less like the director 's previous film 'the elephant man' and the second and 4th installment of the series 'the texas chainsaw massacre' the adventures of buckaroo banzai vol,less than a few moments and the story is so complex that i ca n't believe it was n't canceled and that would happen because it seemed a tad long
1,once upon an attempt to get the money out of his house he decides to try and save this guy,once a week and a few more people have decided that they could be good and they would be doing something
1,but that 's the whole point for the rest of,but i would n't call it a big success
1,its like a movie in an attempt to make,its an entertaining film with no redeeming qualities
1,this movie is one of my favorites,this was one of my favorites
1,with no apparent explanation he 's merely trying to be a serious villain,with a supposed budget of about 500000 this is not the best movie of
1,as it is that is n't the case with the movie as far as the characters go,as the film starts off i 've seen the movie countless times and still have to get my
1,5 you 're so bad that you want my money back,5 it starts off with four guys getting a little bit of
1,the whole premise of the original is so boring that it 's actually funny,the film is filled with moments of dialogue and the film seems very dated with
1,it does n't really have to be that this movie has,it is the most ridiculous movie i 've ever seen
1,the only thing worse than this movie is the music,the plot is n't just a cheap teen slasher movie but
1,she 's very cute as a tough girl in the middle of nowhere too,she is a beautiful woman but also a very beautiful and beautiful young woman with
1,so they go to the house of a little,so what 's wrong with all of you
1,you ca n't really be a good actress in acting and a lot,you see it just is n't very clear but it still does
1,i am sorry it will have many great stars,i am not a fan of the movie and i
1,i do n't care about him because his wife is in love with,i would rate this movie a 9 for its sheer entertainment value
1,how can a woman get out of prison for the rest of the,how could we care about the plight of the protagonist 's mother
1,one day he meets another woman and she falls in love,one thing that made this movie great was the soundtrack
1,andrew 's direction makes a nice contrast in the film,andrew mclaglen is a standout actor for his part
1,we 're supposed to sympathize with the characters and their personalities at each other,we are shown to be so much fun as to be the first one
1,the acting was ok even better than the first half in the,the plot and dialogue was just too stupid and too predictable
1,i thought i had wasted the time to watch the film,i would recommend this movie because it is so funny
1,the story is about the power of love,the cast was n't all that bad either
1,the script was also quite predictable and there were no plot holes,the film has a nice pace but this movie lacks substance
1,but i would give this one a chance if not for a,but this is the best movie since scarface is my favourite
1,example a young boy named alex 's father and father,example the whole movie was a little too long
1,obviously this movie is not about a gay guy trying to kill his way to a brothel where he,obviously the producers wanted a better movie and a lot of money would 've been used that way
1,what a shame that this film still had a reputation in the world of a handful of people who like,what is it 's supposed to be and not that there is a single single element to the film
1,it 's a pretty good film,it 's a bit of a shame
1,obviously a few more times and more and less people were allowed to take their opinions and put them in context,obviously she 's not going to be the only character who could have made the role a little less believable
1,avoid this one at all costs,avoid this unless you 're a sucker
1,the plot in which the heroine is kidnapped was not an interesting,the only problem is the ending which really is n't there
1,it 's one of the worst i 've seen in a long time,it is about a man named sam who 's trying to steal the diamond
1,maggie cheung is a fine director that is the only one who could find this dull and boring and she is just not convincing,maggie cheung is also superb as the mother she was very good in a good role and she was very sexy in the role she
1,it is n't so much a movie of the same timeand as an exercise in logic,it 's like someone made a halloween film in the 80s and saw the same thing over
1,check out the first two seasons or the second series and see something in the way of the original,check out the other reviews for this atrocity that are a lot more than what i had hoped for an
1,2040 the movie was just a good excuse to be honest,2040 the movie is a good movie to say about the story
1,first of all it would have been more interesting to show that there is no way they would do this kind of thing,first of all we all know that these women are actually going to die and have no friends and they will be in trouble
1,when a bunch of scientists come to a village where the russians are attacked by an american uboat in afghanistan with the help,when i first started watching it i could n't have been more wrong and the first time i saw it i knew
1,check out his other films like these earlier ones,check to see the real story of what i believe
1,nor did they try to be,nor could it be for the good
1,my favourite of course in the film was the fact that the guy and his,my advice and see this movie on tv and you wo n't get bored
1,this movie could be made in the us with english subtitles or,this was one of the worst films i 've ever seen
1,a few things that i hate about you will love and,a very good performance and an interesting and interesting story
1,while the film is a bit violent it does n't feel any real purpose,while i thought that it was a bit like a movie about the war the
1,for a while it 's so bad it just is n't funny,for me the only reason i'm giving this a rating of 10 is
1,i would n't watch it again,i was impressed by the story of
1,while the story is interesting a very good one with a strong and interesting ending this movie has the right amount of humor,while we never learn whether we were looking at some or whatever you are seeing it you know that it is a pretty low
1,it seems that the director and writer do,it 's not all that well executed
1,a group of friends and a girl named kenny and his wife and a group of college friends are invited to stay at a,a lot of people have complained about this film and i think the film was a total bore to watch as a whole
1,the ending of this movie was so ridiculous as,the first and then is the most boring
1,spin on the wall of the original star wars film this one was just not as bad as other movies from the late 1970 's,spin up in a few days to see this film is the same as many other movies but it 's all there for this one
1,naschy is the best of the lot,naschy 's performance as a character that 's
1,we have a movie that is a little slow in tone and is n't as exciting as the first,we are given such a good sense of time and effort of the young victoria and her love for her
1,sutherland and dunne give one of their best performances of a lifetime but not,sutherland is a master in the movie industry and has some wonderful moments
1,along with his wife and the woman he is forced to go on and on,along the way alvin is a young actor whose family has died from prison
1,there are some interesting moments but there 's never any real tension or tension,there are also the usual cliches of the movie from the start where they were
1,this is an absolute mustsee for any scifi channel fan,this film has everything that has ever taken and a whole
1,2008 i saw a clip of my childhood and my grandparents who are n't in,2008 is a great show and it is a great show for all ages
1,this film was a real chore to watch and i,this movie really shows how the world has changed
1,they were so very good that they actually kept going to get to be the real ones,they are trying to find the new meaning they want but then they have to fight for the
1,however i was n't able to predict it in any other detail,however this is the worst piece of acting i have ever seen
1,you know you 're a part of the story,you do n't need to get any more than this
1,he 's in his prime to be a bad man,he also has a good performance in the cast
1,i have to say that for those who want to know if the movie is good i do not recommend it,i did n't like the movie and would suggest that it 's only as bad as it did with the plot of
1,if you 're like me and you do n't want to watch and learn for yourself that 's it,if you want to make a bad movie out of your average movie with a good script this is what
1,i would recommend seeing this movie and,i am so glad i did
1,this is the worst movie ever,this movie is so bad it 's
1,the acting was good all round and this movie would,the plot is interesting and the characters seem welldeveloped
1,my only gripe about this movie is that most of the action is so fake that it 's impossible to get the sense across its plot,my favorite scenes of the movie in my opinion are the last one and a scene when the police commissioner and the girl try to be both
1,he has no clue what to do with it,he gets all three and he 's able to tell
1,i was n't expecting a lot of the film but it was very very good,i have never seen a movie before and this did not have anything redeeming to say
1,squirm as they are n't all so good,squirm and blood is a good example of a
1,in fact it is not one of the best movies ever and most of them are the ones that make it worthwhile to see,in this film there are a couple of things going in to keep the movie going along at a reasonable pace but it is n't
1,the story is very simple and it is hard to find a movie,the main character is so stupid i could n't stop thinking of it the
1,yes you 'll get the dvd and you wo n't regret it,yes there 's a lot of bad movies out there which have to
1,however after a few minutes i realized that the only actor who had seen the movie was a child and i really liked it because his voice was so good that i was not thrilled and i was really enjoying,however if i were to watch a film about the characters i 'd have to be a better person and have read some positive reviews and comments to the extent that you would probably agree with it that way
1,whoever wrote a script for their film was a genius,whoever wrote this script should really see this mess
1,one of the greatest films of the last 50 years,one scene that i do n't remember is the scene where
1,this film is not the only action movie i 've ever,this is a truly beautiful picture with an excellent cast
1,he has a very small cast that is not,he is not an ordinary filmmaker at all
1,it 's a shame because the original is so bad,it is not worth your time watching the movie
1,this has to be one of the best films i 've ever seen,this movie is a waste of time unless you want to see a great
1,if you want to watch it do n't watch it if you have n't,if they could make up their own mind then they would have done it to
1,well i was looking forward to this,well that 's a good movie
1,it was made with a little imagination of the early 80s and in the late 1970 's the movie,it makes this very difficult to watch and it does n't even try but it really is n't
1,that is n't saying anything that is not meant to be a good,that is what the fans want to say with such a film
1,it was a waste of time,it was so bad it made no
1,great cast and excellent acting from the,great acting great writing excellent direction
1,adrian pasdar 's accent also is very well suited with the character he played,adrian carter plays an annoying character that is not only a very good one
1,but this movie has a few problems 1 is the main plot and a few,but you do n't expect a lot of violence and gore in the film
1,life is never explored and the camera work is so good,life is about one person and his wife is a love story
1,to be expected this film was n't meant to be taken seriously because i was bored,to the film 's credit the film is quite enjoyable and well worth the time
1,the whole cast was very good,the movie itself was good enough but
1,in my opinion this is a classic film,in a sense of fact i have to say
1,my favourite character was the daughter who was the daughter,my favorite parts of the show are the car crash in
1,the only other thing that kept me watching was the acting was pretty good,the acting is good especially when you consider that this is a very funny episode
1,rian paltrow plays a rich housewife that is in love with her,rian johnson is a great actor who is a good actor
1,but even after all the plot twist to the end it just felt like the story,but then i have to have the feeling that some of the acting was good
1,the characters seem more human than they are all in,the script is good but nothing to laugh at
1,the story is a little over the top with a few twists and turns but,the whole idea of the movie was so lame and ridiculous it was laughable
1,nevertheless this film is a very good film and one that will stay with you for its myriad length of it,nevertheless it 's not worth mentioning the fact that he 's not even the killer and his wife is a looker
1,desire to find out that this is a comedy and not a movie about a family that are a bit different and it 's hard to know what,desire to get the president of the united states to make the money in order to take her to a nearby home to locate and sell it
1,nick is one of a kind of old guy to a movie that is not only a good movie,nick nolte is the best of the three films and he is the best thing on the show
1,as the movie starts the action sequences are quite good as the story builds,as a result the film has the same feel as in the book
1,amitabh bachchan has a good voice,amitabh bachchan gives the best performance he
1,they do n't know what they 're talking about but they have some great fun,they do n't do enough to make the audience feel like i was watching the worst
1,as in the first movie i think that this is the best of the two,as with all of the other comments the dialogue here is very weak and the actors
1,how could you do this film,how can the director get a grip
1,you 'd think that if you have n't seen the movie and you,you 'll not find anywhere near as much fun as the first
1,you have the worst movie ever seen,you 'll be surprised to see her do
1,of course it 's a bit slow but it 's a good thing,of course i did n't care about the character and the character
1,you should n't be a fan of the movie or even if the movie is not,you could see it and would n't have had any idea of any better acting
1,later on in the movie when the young boy gets,later that night i had to stop watching it
1,whether you 're into the genre you might not know how to play this picture,whether this is supposed to be some real drama or a drama and as a spoof
1,the actors are n't even good either,the story is told with an unconventional and
1,but the movie is not very good,but that 's okay because that was what
1,however this is not your average hollywood flick,however they are just trying to make a film
1,even after that i have never seen anything quite like the first two games,even if the film had a budget to it that was n't bad
1,filmed on location i found this one to be a complete waste of time,filmed on location in a small californian town in new york and then it 's
1,as it turns out the only possible explanation of this serial killer is the killer,as to the fact that they were made to have taken the show to a new
1,this film is about a guy who goes on a hunting mission to,this is the kind where the film has a very low budget
1,the characters are shallow the characters are flat and the jokes are so unfunny,the acting is bad except for the two leads who made this movie even worse
1,i would say it is a great movie,i would n't recommend this movie to anybody unless
1,i 've seen it a few times but it is still very funny,i thought a lot of these were good guys like these guys but i
1,i do n't even want to talk about this movie,i 've always liked the music and the way the movie
1,on the other hand i found the story more interesting than i really thought,on a journey to be a hit a movie is a great success to watch
1,we learn to be so much different to the book and for that,we all know that he ca n't get away with his work
1,and the movie did n't have much of a plot,and in fact the only thing this movie does lack
1,on a deeper level it 's a good movie and the director should n't be able to pull this movie off,on this particular film it 's a movie of a young woman being trapped in the middle of nowhere and the other
1,as i have mentioned this one is a bit much,as i watched the film it seemed pretty interesting
1,i did n't get that in my,i could have done without them
1,she has never been a great actress but she was in this movie and her acting,she was quite convincing with a very good performance and the supporting cast was excellent
1,but the best thing about this film is its complete lack of logic,but i did watch this episode and i could n't help but notice that
1,it 's a pretty good film but not,it 's not a good thing though
1,if you are looking for action and good movies do n't bother,if you 've seen a real movie on the subject matter of the
1,a great film to be sure if you can find it,a good film that could have made it a decent movie and
1,there are no plot no real twists or surprises,there are some funny parts and a great score to
1,originally the story of a young boy and boy who were abducted by the mafia for a while after being sent into duty by the devil of,originally it was made to be an epic version of the 1968 hit which was the most controversial and it could have been a good movie
1,so what 's with all the twists and turns,so i was a bit shocked that the first 10
1,that was a very interesting idea,that 's exactly what it is
1,i am surprised that people who know not like this would have the patience to spend the last 15 years with this film,i do n't understand what this movie did with the first one but if i had to give it a 1 i 'd be
1,about the only thing is a slight flaw in this story,about the way in which they are made to the island in
1,evans is a fine actor in his film career with his performance as his brother the very first time he is offered his character,evans has the perfect sense of humor and has the ability to get his heart out of the way of a character study
1,and this one is not a good one to watch,and the movie 's final shot of the film of the
1,however the film is so bad so poor that i just did n't care,however for those of you who think that it 's a good idea of the
1,those that do n't have any of these actors are really good to look at,those of us who enjoyed a lot of movies have a few things you 're going
1,hey i have to say that this movie was a waste of time,hey if you 're an adult do n't watch this movie do n't
1,the film makes the first two seasons of the original series look like a masterpiece with many of,the film itself is a total mess and a waste of time and money to sit through
1,it was the first film of a movie and i,it 's a pity that they 're making sequels
1,later this movie was a complete dud,later on and he meets the old woman
1,i was n't expecting anything from the movie,i ca n't believe i had wasted my time
1,anyway there is a bit more than a few lines,anyway i ca n't say enough to describe this
1,and he does n't seem to go back to,and i was n't impressed with the ending
1,what i do remember is that there is no question of how the movie ends,what you get when you 're being a fan of the movie is the worst movie
1,the main point about the film is that the plot was too thin and was never explained,the only thing good about this film is that it does n't have a bad plot or even
1,it is a great story that has to keep it,it 's a nice addition to the original series
1,ice cube is just a bad guy he is not even the,ice cube is a good actor and a pretty decent actor
1,strangely it 's a pretty bad movie and the movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever,strangely enough they had the same thing in the book which is probably the only reason
1,at one point he is a little too old as he does n't seem to be very interested in finding him and he just seems to,at its most crucial moments it turns out they might be a little more subtle than the typical suspects but is rather boring and unnecessary
1,i do n't remember much about this movie,i would not have seen this film but it
1,ca n't you figure out how bad they were and how to get one thing,ca n't believe that she was in the film and i just did n't want to
1,the film is filled with a couple of scenes of violence and some gratuitous violence,the plot of two children having a house in one of his home house with an
1,by a long shot of the old man 's the man is shot to a pulp in an attempt to capture,by that time the audience will not see a single scene where she 's playing a role on the screen
1,if you 're not going to be bored you do n't want,if one is interested in this movie is the way it should feel
1,there is one thing in the film you can never forget that you,there was no character development or the actors were the main players
1,after reading the book this review is a must see for anyone interested in their own experiences,after the opening scene where he was a member of the family i wondered if a person was
1,but i guess it is all so predictable that i felt compelled to write,but this is a film that is just the same as the first
1,a group of scientists who have had to fight a deadly percentage of their own and have been in the past,a few minutes earlier we are treated to a great and exciting sequence where the three stooges play the same game that
1,actress robert duvall is the best i have ever seen in a movie,actress who is in the wrong genre has a nice turn as she 's
1,which is why the movie was a huge disappointment with the whole concept,which is why the story is interesting yet is never told and the viewer
1,a film that was not just about,a good cast of familiar faces
1,uncle kirk 's wife and son are the best part of their film,uncle sam is a very very young lady who has a child a daughter
1,as with the original the movie was not as bad as this,as a result the movie fails because he has never been a film
1,a film which has not only been made in the,a movie that i wish never to see again
1,as a matter of fact the plot was just ridiculous,as far as i think the director would have been able
1,the plot is simple and the characters are believable,the only redeeming quality was the lack of any substance
1,are we supposed to sympathize with them as they learn to live their life,are we supposed to care about the characters so much more because they are real
1,is it possible to see a director who has never done,is he trying to solve the mystery of his life
1,stupid movie that is so stupid that it is almost impossible to make a popcorn movie about,stupid people do n't think that a movie is the worst of all the untold to me
1,the film is a masterpiece with lots of action sequences,the movie is a total ripoff of the classic disney animated
1,note there is a bit of a hint in the end,note in the film it 's a very good movie
1,this is definitely his greatest work,this has to be the worst movie
1, the only real complaint with the script the director and the cast, is the best film i have ever seen and even i have not
1,in a sense that this was a very good film with good actors with some good actors and a great,in conclusion you can get a hold of his own life to find out what the movie is saying
1,after all the film has its roots in their lives and the lives,after the movie was over i found it to be pretty lame
1,adam west does a good job as usual but the film is n't a good one,adam sandler plays a cop who has an affair on his own as a woman in love
1,i 've never been so impressed by it,i love this film and its one for everybody
1,but as a child i really liked watching this movie,but there were so many funny moments in this movie that
1,fast forward to the very end of the movie when you think that she 'll be a good woman,fast forward button on the road with a gun of a man that has been strangled by a truck driver
1,the acting is superb in the way it mixes in,the only problem with this film the other was the way
1,i would like to know how the writers could n't make a good ending and that they just were n't,i think that the movie might be a little more enjoyable if it 's not a good action movie at all
1,and then the girl is wearing it for it,and if it comes out on video please do n't
1,and then when the guy is killed and the girl looks like he just wandered out,and that 's the way it is in our hearts to watch all of them
1,seriously if you 're looking for a fun ride of the,seriously i do n't see anyone complaining about this movie
1,the main theme is the same,the film has some good points
1,it was a good film but it 's a bit too,it was great to have to give him a chance
1,it 's really a pretty awful attempt and the film fails miserably,it was a shame because it was a bit bit of a stretch
1,that is the best thing about the,that 's what happened to me
1,even with his acting skills his character is still a bit unlikable and at the same time vulnerable,even with those few scenes and a lot of talking about how much we do n't really get to
1,rounding out this film was an insult to the intelligence of the director for a long time and some nice scenes which i,rounding out all the bad comments about it on a friday night on ebay i 'd suggest it 's a must see
1,in short the film has a lot of good stuff,in a movie where you feel like an idiot 's character
1,some of the acting and writing is a little stilted at times but not much else,some may find the character development somewhat underdeveloped or the other actors who have n't even made
1,the music and the story line is quite good,the first is the most famous of the films of
1,really bad movie but at least the one i saw the movie and was able to watch,really the only reason to watch this movie is because i think the first time round i found
1,after all these years later the movie is not about as much of a stretch it 's a very good movie with a lot of good ideas,after that his acting is horrible and the only good parts in the film are when the film is supposed to be shot in a studio
1,john goodman 's character is supposed to be the hero 's brother,john mctiernan directed a film where he could n't handle that much with
1,script is great and it makes you think about the whole world of people who are the,script is very poor i cannot say if this is my most pathetic movie ever made
1,and this was the first movie we made,and the whole cast of the cast
1,she was one of the best actors in,she was quite sexy to look at
1,that 's all i can say,that 's why i do n't like
1,stan laurel and oliver hardy were the two stooges and the two were pretty good,stan laurel and jack frost and all of the cast members are very good
1,do yourself a favor and do n't waste your time with this movie,do n't worry about the good reviews but the good ones here
1,with the exception of a little more of the comedy and the jokes it is,with the right attitude to it the rest of the gang is pretty bad
1,i do n't think she should have been,i was in junior high years of my youth
1,someone else who is a bit concerned with a movie should have been allowed to get their hands on it and get away with it,someone who did not want me to say i did n't like the movie so i'm just gonna cut it up and give it
1,further the film is set in a new england city with the usual british accents and a few nice scenes,further the film does n't seem to make any sense at all it is a boring boring mess that will never
1,thats where it is going for him,thats all that makes this film watchable
1,jumps along to the house and the man,jumps around his room with his wife 's face
1,it also has more than enough elements,it has its moments and it was a
1,he is so funny as being an older man,he does not care about the people around them
1,from the start i thought that the film was very good,from a historical standpoint i was amazed that it was even nominated
1,i did n't have to wait until i,i thought this was a great movie
1,this is the most pointless piece of cinema i 've ever seen,this movie has the potential to bring down some interesting points but it
1,throw in a few twists and turns but you ca n't be bothered to see what a,throw in that the main characters are stupid caricatures who have nothing to do with them
1,it 's very difficult to believe that this movie,it also features a bit of a cameo
1,however the story is not entirely original enough for us to enjoy this film,however the script is very poor with the exception of a poor actor who is
1,sure the movie was funny and a bit,sure it 's not a perfect movie
1,but when the movie started out i was so happy it was a waste of your time,but there are no other reasons to recommend this movie except for a few chuckles that are not
1,i think that the film might have been better suited to other movies such as the shining,i have n't read the book and the film does n't seem that far from what the book
1,are you to know what this is about and if they 're talking about their,are there a few laughs out there that should be left to those viewers
1,the story of a young kid who gets killed by an alligator with the same name and a child 's play is a joke,the music score by john carpenter is an absolute masterpiece from any other film which is not quite that bad the only good thing is
1,it 's a nice movie to watch on a rainy day of your life i can watch again,it is a story of a woman who is dying when a man who is not interested in a
1,although i think i agree with other reviewer above the comments on the film and the reviews,although this film had it all in a way that would n't be the case with its predecessor
1,somehow there are a number of things in between that,somehow it turns out to have been a success
1,probably the funniest thing about it is that it,probably it was the director of this film
1,i think it is a better choice,i could have done more of the story
1,standard stalk hunters and all the typical suspects from the past,standard american comedy is not a classic but a very entertaining watch
1,acting is ok except for the fact that the actors were the most recognizable character of the,acting is so bad and so bad that at times the film is n't even funny
1,kilo 's love life in this film is all that matters,kilo 's mother is n't the typical mother that she does in
1,i have n't seen her in other films before,i think that was the reason they had to show
1,you 'll probably want to make a movie like this,you 'll get to see a movie to make your eyes
1,it was the first time i saw this movie,it was a little too long for me to enjoy
1,he then is forced to go after him and he has to find out what is happening,he does a lot of jokes that make it fun to sit in and laugh so hard sometimes
1,just watch the movie and you have to feel what you 're seeing,just do n't expect to get up for a movie that is not for
1,i saw it in a theater in the late 90 's,i thought that this was an interesting and entertaining film
1,seriously the script could be the same for the actors it had to be the actors to work in,seriously that is why we 're supposed to care for this guy so he 's a lot worse
1,the cast is also pretty good at their best,the acting is very good and the direction by the
1,it 's a great movie that i can recommend for fans,it is a wonderful movie that i could watch again
1,if i had to rate this film a 0 it would have been very low,if you 're looking for something special but do n't bother watching the movie
1,everyone should see this film if you have nothing else,everyone involved with the movie was very good and so were
1,let me explain to you for another example of how many people,let 's start off by saying that the characters are real
1,let it be done by those who say it 's a good thing just to make a film that i have,let 's start with the premise and how the hell did they make these movies so badly and so bad
1,it 's like a bunch of kids just sat in the middle of nowhere trying to get a few people out of a jam building a bunch of beer,it was also the first scene where he died after his grandfather died leaving his mother to take her daughter back and let 's not forget that a woman is
1,the movie starts off with a man searching for himself,the story is a mixture of comedy and action
1,but in a way it is n't,but i do n't know why some of
1,then the show starts to fall short of its predecessors,then the movie switches back into the mind of a man
1,some things seem to take place in the basement,some of the special effects are so bad that it
1,he 's the most famous character of the film and a very good performance,he 's trying too far too hard to be an easy action character to the
1,mgm should be embarrassed that i can say it 's one,mgm should have known that this was an important movie
1,one thing i did like about this movie was the fact that it,one of the most interesting stories is the fact the first one
1,unfortunately i have to say it 's not bad or even good at all,unfortunately the film was not very well made and has some really cheesy scenes
1,so it does n't seem like that,so why do you choose this
1,he 's not a very strong actor he is,he is the most beautiful man on screen
1,she 's also one of the greatest characters,she also wrote the script and was trying to
1,this is one of those movies that i wish i could find myself on and on with my family 's favorite collection and a few,this would have been a decent movie and i would rate this at least 10 out of 10 stars for giving an excellent score
1,because of her own problems with it she was n't only in a coma but her daughter,because of the great plot that it does n't take place on the same theme this movie shows
1,the music was also very good,the whole thing was a waste of
1,sounds good but the movie does n't have any kind of impact or sense to it,sounds like a good idea for a tv show but with all the usual plot twists and
1,malkovich plays a character who is a real character and the supporting characters are,malkovich 's character and the film should have been a lot more enjoyable
1,perhaps the most memorable scene is the sequence where the two men are talking for,perhaps this is one hell of a good horror movie with an amazing cast
1,one of the best things about the film in fact was in fact the fact that,one of the most moving and touching films i 've seen in the last years
1,the acting was horrible but the actors are great especially the two leading,the acting is awful and the direction just is n't very good
1,but the only reason i did n't give up a few dollars was due to the fact that,but the director never failed in any way that this story could have been much more effective
1,i was so excited to see this movie on the,i was very excited to actually see the movie
1,in other words it 's a real stinker of a film,in the end this is definitely not a movie that is not
1,recently released this in the year on tcm,recently i saw the trailer and found it quite
1,yes there was another scene in which she goes on her way through a door at the end of the,yes the film has a good story to be told but it takes place in the middle of nowhere
1,the only thing that is good about this movie is the fact that there was no way that the director could even get the name,the actors in this movie were very good as the young man who plays the bad guy in this film is a great movie
1,if you are the best fan of the first movie you 'll not be disappointed,if you like bad movies this one may be you should check out the worst i
1,i could have picked up the film if,i was n't even expecting anything else
1,i am not a big fan of the book but,i think this film is worth buying the dvd
1,the acting is very good particularly the girl in it trying to do a bit of overacting,the movie is very boring and i do n't know the ending but the way that it ends
1,this film has a strong but compelling script and the director is a bit,this film is the best piece of film in the past 20 years
1,i thought the acting was terrible,i saw it at the tribeca film
1,one character 's motivation to overcome the fact that he has been in the world has already caused the life he is trying to bring back to,one of my favorites is that i have n't laughed since this was released in 1988 this is one of my favourite films in the series
1,all in all it 's a fun and entertaining ride that makes it a little more exciting but ultimately a bit slow and is n't very well handled,all in one with a minimal cast of actors that are all uniformly excellent and a talented and very talented director and writer john frankenheimer makes for a nice
1,there were two great moments in the film that the best of me was the scene where jack and the boy are in the room,there are some good things about this film and the characters are interesting especially the one played by the actors on a cruise ship
1,overall the film is a bit too dull,overall it 's very interesting to see the actors
1,absolutely no redeeming qualities to this movie,absolutely the worst film i have ever seen
1,the film is a real piece of,the film is a real treat
1,that is where it falls flat in it,that 's why i loved the movie
1,just do n't waste your time on this crap,just a few minutes later the movie was cut and
1,barty does an okay job as he,barty is perfect for this role
1,watch this show and do not watch and,watch the film for a few laughs
1,if you want to know that this is the worst movie ever made,if you do n't see it go ahead and get a little deeper in
1,instead the movie takes its name away from the audience and the audience can actually be rewarded by the story,instead she 's the character of the two musketeers and it is n't even the story which is more or less
1,then in a scene where the guy was supposed to be the killer snowman it was just implied that this movie was,then to be honest i do n't understand why i gave this movie a 9 because it 's so much better
1,an attempt at trying to save a little more money to use the word,an excellent cast in their roles but this one has a huge flaw
1,there was also a strong element of an ending and that 's why all it is about,there is also a bit of a great scene where lloyd is talking about his father 's death
1,this is one of the best of the series,this film is a waste of time unless you are
1,the plot has an intriguing premise,the acting is excellent the story is
1,like the first movie this was very much a horror flick with a great deal,like many films have made some sense of what a great film it is
1,if the movie could have been remade by some competent director this could have,if you 're looking for a good horror movie this is n't it
1,you can see what this guy is trying to,you wo n't get the same feeling here
1,watch this movie and feel sorry for it,watch the first 10 min for this one
1,all you can think that is that the characters are very interesting but the plot is pretty simple,all the actors were very bad and the story never gets better and the story is really just a
1,alison taylor 's character is more likable with no depth than she 's ever seen in the movie,alison 's character development is a caricature of a woman that could go beyond her usual husband
1,matt groening was the best of his career,matt helm and paul mccartney were excellent as a
1,or even in the us a young woman who does not have the money to take the,or the next day and we 're talking about what is supposed to be a joke
1,the only redeeming feature of this flick were,the film does provide some interesting scenes
1,there is a sense of humor about his character that you 'll be familiar with the film and it 's,there 's a great story told with a flashback by the actors the two characters that are very funny
1,the whole thing takes place in new york,the movie is quite entertaining but it 's not
1,kudos to a lot of actors involved,kudos to the cast for their performances in
1,carrie and her sister find themselves trapped,carrie has a small but healthy life in
1,these two actors are very well cast and i have not,these two main characters also were all likable and sympathetic
1,next time i watch this movie i feel that a movie is better than the book,next time my friend 's friend and his sister are killed and killed the next day he
1,the only other film i did not like was that one of the great directors that did not seem to have,the acting is superb and i do recommend watching it again for a good time and for a nice diversion
1,it 's a pity they made it onto a movie theater,it is n't the worst movie it 's certainly not a bad
1,that is what it is but this one is a mess,that part of the movie is also pretty well paced and it
1,they 're a nice pair with their own personal demons and the real world is all,they 're just as fun to watch as they did in the first one and i did
1,and of course the movie is n't a horror film it is a,and there are some funny gags involving the guy playing his wife
1,also the scenes with the girl are hilarious,also it shows the struggle between them and it
1,i ca n't help but feel sorry for her,i could see where the movie was filmed
1,ooh it 's like they do n't want to try and stop the audience,ooh i have been a fan of many of the movies and i do n't
1,nothing is very funny and it 's,nothing is explained in the film
1,this show reminds me of that episode where there are people in this show so when we,this is one of those movies i saw over and over but it really is n't
1,he was n't at her best as the man who did,he was the one who could identify with the man
1,it 's hard to understand why people think that this film,it 's a movie that makes no sense at all
1,there are two scenes that are cut together and the story of,there are plenty of action scenes that are not even thrilling
1,this was not the best movie i had seen but that made it to the top,this is definitely one of the better films i have seen in a long time
1,i'm not saying this is anything i would enjoy it but it 's a real stinker and it was a fun surprise,i'm not a big fan of the original and it did n't really matter as it was supposed to be a good movie
1,this is one of many great movies about the,this movie is not even for the kids
1,hutton 's character and his motivations are completely different but he is the real life,hutton 's character is very convincing and he does not have too much screen time
1,but the movie has a few moments to show how a great movie should be and how,but this is a movie that makes you think about what the hell was going on
1,it was so stupid and stupid it 's hard to describe how they were actually trying to make a movie,it 's a shame as to the contrary of the movie and it has some very good special effects in it
1,i 've seen this one a couple of times and it was pretty good,i ca n't really recommend it to anyone unless you 're looking for a good
1,expect the most interesting of what it is,expect more from the film and you can tell
1,henry fonda is as good as usual to play his roles in a movie but they are,henry winkler is also a good actor but he is not given much to work with
1,nobody has seen the original movie and we know what,nobody 's in for one second thought or less
1,i was n't expecting this to be a bad movie because i thought it was bad,i saw the film yesterday and i was so confused that i did n't get my copy
1,mr bean has his usual moments but the rest of them are really annoying,mr and mrs smith and their friends are trying to save the day
1,dalton is also great as the lead and it really helps to create the story to the,dalton and matthau are a very talented actress and is not the most popular film star
1,even the director was trying to convince us that we were all too stupid to know who he,even though the plot line has been done well and many are still interesting things get interesting
1,i think the problem with the film is that it is not a drama as a whole it 's a complete ripoff,i have n't been watching the movie ever since the first time i watched her and i was impressed by the ending
1,incredibly funny and a must see movie,incredibly the film makes a statement that all
1,the film opens with a bang,the main problem with the movie is
1,nobody wants to know what they do and the movie does n't really seem to have any point of interest it 's simply a,nobody seems to have ever read a book and never quite knew that this was a movie to make a film that is
1,i saw this in the theater as a free rental and then saw the movie tonight,i think this is a very good movie with great special effects and excellent acting by all
1,it has the usual feel of a high school play and the acting in the movie is a little too weak for me,it 's a story of a young woman who is a little of a sadomasochistic marriage a young woman who is attracted to her
1,what a waste of time and money,what 's even more tragic is how they
1,when they are talking about their work there is a very nice story,when i watched the trailer from the film it was really bad
1,those who have seen it have to be one of the most beautiful and,those who enjoy this will love it but they are never really good
1,so this film really is a must see movie,so if you 're looking for a laugh riot go
1,brian 's evaluation of a new version of,brian is not the worst of it
1,turns out this film is a bad remake of a story that had been made by an old english,turns out that this is a good idea if you can manage it to have your own conclusions
1,ursula christensen as the older sister is pretty good,ursula farmiga as a young woman is not as hot
1,if you want to watch a very bad movie and not watch a crappy movie watch it,if you 're going to watch the film do n't waste an hour and a half of your
1,maybe the film makers had no idea of how to get this story,maybe the first time you go on watching a bunch of people walking around
1,sure i had never heard of this movie and was very moved to seeing it,sure there are a bunch of interesting moments but the most glaring flaw is the ending
1,wei is not an actor or actress in a movie about a woman or,wei kulkarni and james belushi are wonderful as the lovers of the film
1,at times the acting is horrible but the actors who plays,at one point the viewer is reminded of his performance
1,the only reason i got this was because it sounded,the film was a waste of time and money
1,i do n't mind the story in the original but i would n't think,i have nothing against this film but i have enjoyed the film so much
1,it 's a shame they never released any dvd release of a dvd,it 's a very difficult subject to find a copy of this story to
1,very funny and funny movie and a lot more laughs,very similar to a lot of other films and some scenes
1,you are supposed to believe it is,you will never hear the music sound effects
1,otherwise they could have put the movie back at a decent rate but overall this is just a poor script,otherwise i am not going to go against the grain of the plot but the movie does not flow into the
1,there 's even a scene which takes place at the beginning of a movie,there are a few things that are wrong to say about this movie
1,i do n't know how this movie will ever end up being released on dvd but it just might not have a great deal of time to,i would like to see a sequel as i had the chance to watch and watch again and again i am able to find something new
1,this was a waste of time for the entire generation of fans,this is a very enjoyable film with great performance from the cast and
1,regina carrol is not the best actress in this film but the movie is quite good,regina malone is in the movie as a reporter with a penchant for tolerance for her work
1,everyone 's just waiting for them to make a movie,everyone is in it and then they 're talking about things
1,bogie is in a mental state a woman with a heart that has been dumped,bogie is a fine actor and he is perfectly cast as the conflicted cop
1,these are not only the first few seconds of the,these are not your characters the characters are stereotypes
1,i was in a big city i was not expecting it to be but i do n't care for the,i ca n't help but think it was all that funny the acting from the entire cast was great
1,i saw this film when it first aired on the tv,i thought that the movie was very suspenseful at times
1,virtually the entire production is just a bunch of people getting the same thing over and over and over again,virtually every scene seems almost identical to the original the original is so stupid it has to do with the rest
1,sorry this is a very interesting film but,sorry i have no respect for it
1,i'm not going to write the subtitles i guess but the movie is very,i'm a fan of the original book but this film is too bad
1,where 's all the other reviewers,where the film really needed was it
1,now the only good part of this film is that the first two films are so good they are so horrible they,now that i'm not too critical for words and i have my doubts this is still a fun movie to watch
1,jackie is an expert who has a small problem with the idea that,jackie chan and his wife have been a real cowboy to me
1,she is a nice guy to watch,she plays the role of a woman who
1,based on that fact in the name of the writer 's review the movie was made to be a classic but it,based on the memoirs of a group of young men the story is told by the author of the original novel
1,shots from the previous film had a nice atmosphere,shots of the buildings are n't too far away
1,seriously it was a bad movie,seriously i was impressed by the story
1,she does n't want to take kindly clothes off her back,she meets the girl 's lover but she soon gets him up
1,it 's so bad it is n't funny,it is a great movie with great music and
1,some might complain that he has a good grasp of it,some of its lesser acting and some good performances by the cast
1,so it 's a little bit of an odd ending,so the movie makes sense and the ending is really bad
1,three people have no reason for their actions,three sisters on a roadtrip from an abusive island
1,when there are two things we do n't know at all,when he finds an abandoned man in a small river in a
1,on the other hand i did not think that it was a,on the other hand that 's what i have to say
1,i have not read so many of that other reviews but the fact that the main character is actually in this film is really annoying,i ca n't imagine how people would like this show it would n't be as good a movie if it had to have a bit more
1,this film was one of the worst movies i 've ever seen,this is the movie i have seen for the first thirty seconds
1,i did n't know how to use the word so this was a bad movie,i do n't see the appeal of this film as i am a fan of the
1,those who think it looks like they are in a hurry to do a great job at the end,those that are so good that you cannot tell the difference between the 2 sides of the film and the
1,the acting was horrible the script was awful,the plot is a joke the acting is mediocre
1,may have been an influence on a good movie that had only been,may be the best performance of his career in any given movie
1,it 's not a bad horror film and the gore is pretty graphic so it 's done to death,it would have worked if the movie had been made to have been filmed in a different kind of manner
1,when i started getting into this film it seemed like it was shot in a,when the movie is made of it it is very entertaining and very touching
1,well if you do n't get that sense this one is for you,well in the end you 'll see a bunch of people who are n't
1,even if you have n't seen the original film it is hard to say whether you can find any good looking actors,even though this was a bad movie the acting was good in this movie and the acting for the most part was excellent
1,i would recommend this movie to all kids who like to know their children,i had n't been able to see such a high rating for this since the
1,it was not about the battle that was the only person who could n't see the,it is n't even the movie that made me laugh as to what it is
1,they do n't have to go down the stairs to cover this one to pieces,they 're supposed to be in love by her but she takes on her family after
1,and the scene where the two girls are talking to their kids with,and when that is said i mean i had to endure it
1,but when i finally see him he 's so cute that i could relate to his character,but there 's one scene with him standing there staring in bed for the whole movie
1,gunga din is a fine show and it has its flaws,gunga din 's character was the first film i 've seen
1,yes i 've always seen the other side and i do n't want to give away the ending but there are some really cool and disturbing scenes that do n't come,yes this movie is so bad that i think that the film makers have created some of the scenes and they do n't seem to fit into the movie either
1,it is a great show that you are not afraid to be addicted to,it is the same old same type of crap you 're watching on the stage
1,this film had a great score and a very nice story,this movie could easily have been shot with a lot of money
1,to sum it up i must say i was a little disappointed but it,to the point of being this one is just a little bit confusing
1,the music is excellent and the music by ennio morricone is wonderful,the plot is a little hokey and the action takes place
1,close encounters of the third kind the film tells the story which i thought was really great,close encounters with those who have a knack for freedom and the military are also very fond
1,as you can read a few comments of the movie i read that it has been released to video,as with the earlier movie the actors and directors should be a huge success with each one 's worth noting
1,as a result the story of the mother is not particularly compelling,as a result this is n't as much of the stuff of the
1,there were so many things that i could find wrong about,there is a lot of bad choices in the movie
1,apart from a few bits of the puzzle it 's also very hard to watch this movie,apart from that in my opinion there 's a certain point of view on the story that i
1,the only reason i could watch this movie is because it 's a pretty,the acting was superb especially considering the character 's motivation for the character
1,do yourself a favour and check it out if you do watch it,do n't be fooled by this movie 's message and just go to the
1,but the story is too thin too convoluted and too short,but i did enjoy the movie and even if it is n't
1,the acting was good i was a little concerned at the time this was filmed and the fact that this movie,the film begins with a very funny prologue in which the entire family is trying to get the car together
1,he just goes to show up to a little girl,he seems to have a knack for finding his way for
1,an excellent cast of characters including the best in a supporting cast,an attempt at a serious film about the world is a great deal
1,ina is a beautiful blonde lady who is a real trooper a man who is a young woman a woman who,ina 's husband the young son of the boy who has inherited from his parents' mother to do the same
1,the script makes for a great time with a few exceptions,the movie is set in an english village which is in a
1,elimination the first of the three consecutive and good points of view,elimination is a movie with no substance to any story whatsoever except for
1,am i a minority or a teenager and this film is an,am i really glad i did and i was just bored
1,i 've found many people who actually liked the film even though there is a definite,i think that this movie was one of the best of the ernest chan series
1,there are some wonderful scenes and the film does well with a good cast including a,there 's so much confusion between the two characters that it really boggles the point
1,having said that the movie has a nice cast and good direction,having been so excited about it in a film that i found it
1,this film is a disgrace for its director and the director,this movie is very difficult to get the book and all the
1,whereas i was impressed with the fact that there are two main characters and so many other people that seem to be having fun at the screen it seems to be an elaborate movie,whereas i think the director 's attempt to make a realistic narrative seem a little too forced it does n't seem that the director was trying to make his way into the movie
1,mentioned that this film is about an elderly lady who goes to the house where she is found by another,mentioned above i must admit that if you 're looking to watch the movie i would recommend this movie
1,i ca n't see it a single year 's eve,i am still waiting for a good time for a film
1,what do i want to go out and see this film in it,what is with its penchant for the film for the most part
1,this is one of the most entertaining movies of the year,this movie is very funny and is funny at times
1,now i do n't remember any other one i was impressed with and the movie is just so boring that i never thought that i could get any sympathy,now the plot is about a woman who is married to an older man and falls in love with some of the women that have been born in prison
1,she and she is a very good guy,she has no chemistry with his fianc
1,sadly i would n't have to say,sadly this movie is n't even worth seeing
1,i 've seen it over 50 times and have never been tired of it,i think that the director should stick to that of a movie and instead of
1,too bad that the story had more holes than the other two thirds of the series,too much money to get into this film it 's pretty much what it seems
1,just for the hell of it i 'd like to say that it was very boring,just as you know it 's a bad and bad movie it will ruin your enjoyment for
1,it is the worst film ever made,it 's all a very bad idea
1,michael pare is a young man who becomes a hero,michael 's brother and his friend are also in the middle
1,eventually the woman is killed and the girl dies,eventually the movie starts off in an interesting manner which
1,the ending and the story is pretty good,the story is very simple and has one interesting
1,so this film is worth a rental,so they could have done with this movie
1,it 's a pity that the dvd is not available on dvd,it was not as though that a movie is a little difficult for
1,in the end i found myself wondering who could possibly find a new movie to be a masterpiece,in the movie there is a story and there is a lot of action and the whole movie is
1,if anyone has not seen this film yet it deserves a 10 because it is one,if that 's your thing for you then you have a good thing to be
1,i do n't think that they do n't take risks,i 've got to believe that it did exist
1,several times are the scenes when they 're talking about a bunch of people sitting,several of the cast are also the same as the characters or the story
1,from the beginning i felt the movie was a bit slow moving though as it is in the case of one of the better films this one is one of,from this point on we all know where they are at the end they are killed by a bunch of guys who make them out to be a monster
1,first of all the ending is predictable and not really funny either,first of all the plot is just stupid and the characters are so
1,also i do not know what is the purpose of all things,also the only thing missing in this flick is the acting in a
1,artie simpson has been in many movies lately,artie fletcher as a drunken mother is the least
1,this movie should have been made in theaters but in this movie it takes a little while to get going to the first,this could have happened if there was a story line and some characters were fleshed out and it is a film that could have
1,had to get rid of it 's a matter of fact the first one got better,had i just been watching it on a tv in the middle of a tv it is
1,there is one line of dialogue where the two are reunited with,there are also a few scenes about a psychiatrist 's face
1,despite his faults and being in her late forties she is n't the only character her character can do without being,despite the fact that these movies were made about the way they made it to be shown on tv i felt the
1,claudette colbert was excellent as the conflicted,claudette colbert is perfect as always
1,this is an insult to the audience,this film has a very similar story about
1,but even though this movie is n't that great it 's definitely not a great deal better,but it 's a lot of fun when the movie is a fun and entertaining ride of sorts
1,this is another example of the film 's,this one is a waste of time
1,all in all a very funny and enjoyable film with a very good story good acting and a clever look at,all we see is that the director was a real person who was interested in the story and the acting
1,the movie has a few flaws which you can see but it is n't,the film is set on a cruise ship which seems a cheap tvmovie
1,overall this is a pretty good film,overall a good movie to see if you
1,it is a film where people are not willing to be entertained and that there is not a lot of talent in the audience,it 's hard to imagine the film is so bad because there is no way that the movie should come off as one that is
1,when a movie is so bad it 's actually funny but it is just so bad it 's good,when the director 's cut and paste is done the viewer gets the impression that he will soon forget his
1,this film is one of the best i 've ever seen,this is the story of a very young boy who goes to
1,it 's the kind of movie where you ca n't even watch the whole thing and do n't care,it is a movie about the life that transpired to a young man in a small village who had been
1,forgive me i will not spoil it too,forgive me i was so pleased with the film
1,filmed in a very tight manner the film is a very dark tale of two sisters who come and go to a remote farmhouse when two young lovers live,filmed in a very tight fashion that does it to create a gritty atmosphere that makes it accessible for the audience to follow the plot of a story
1,the actors are great especially the ones who did what they could do with their role,the acting and writing is superb the story is compelling enough and the characters and story are
1,but the acting was good especially for,but i could easily see that
1,and the music is also great and is well worth mentioning the music the score and the,and that is the main reason why this movie was n't even released theatrically for me
1,surely they should have made a movie out of the book by the way people did n't like it,surely this was supposed to be the first film ever made for a movie and i ca n't imagine why
1,what the real thing is that the story does n't have to be the only problem,what is more the film 's story line is a good one for a good thriller film
1,which is a shame that the series is better than the first one,which is the shame the people on here are trying to make this movie
1,i had n't seen the movie before,i think that is why the film makes
1,it 's a film i 'd love to point out,it could have been the most boring film i have ever
1,two words have already made a difference,two years later the man who lives in
1,an absolute mustsee for fans of asian exploitation,an interesting premise with good acting but an engaging
1,still the only reason he was n't in the movie is his uncle michael,still this show is so bad it makes you laugh and cry at how bad
1,this is one of the best films i have ever,this movie is a joke but it was not
1,at least the characters are the same as the ones who have the same problems to,at times they were supposed to be humorous and they could have had them all
1,there are a lot of movies that go nowhere,there has been a film that will be on the
1,i do like the way the movie was filmed on the streets and as it was made,i really enjoy that one and this was a very nice change from those who have been living
1,for the rest of us who 'll appreciate this film i would advise you to watch it again,for a film of his best to be an artist of the stature of its own failings this was
1,my first complaint that i have n't seen such a bad film is when a movie is bad,my suggestion is that the film is based on the book of the same name and i would have
1,the movie also features a cameo appearance from bruce lee a woman that you might not have seen,the movie also contains very little footage from new jersey city and i was looking forward to this movie
1,personal impact and a good deal is a good movie,personal instinct a movie that should be seen on the big
1,in a nutshell this is the best movie ever made,in fact this film is an absolute disgrace to the eye
1,bob dillon and john goodman are the most interesting things about the,bob clampett should 've made the big trail of his career
1,i was n't disappointed when the story was changed,i have never been a fan of the genre but
1,especially after being the killer 's dad 's head as the mother he disappears for no particular reason he 's given to the child to do something that is n't very important to the boy at all,especially the scene where he is in a chair with a chainsaw of a rope is the best i 've ever seen i do n't think that the best way to describe it as such as the original
1,i do not want to give them any more spoilers to,i do n't think i'm exaggerating the director for this
1,i was shocked it could make sense,i would highly recommend this movie
1,perhaps it 's too late for this type of movie but they just have their,perhaps if we were lucky but you do n't need to see this film
1,so if there is any point in the world for the first episode in,so i thought the story and acting is great the direction is brilliant
1,an excellent piece of work that is very entertaining to watch,an american woman named josef von sydow is one of the few
1,sadly the rest of the story concerns what was really important about a girl and what it,sadly this was a great movie about a woman who 's trying to find her sister
1,a couple of points for the film was,a must see for a great family
1,mario and the gang have made a movie that was,mario bava and his writer are a big hit
1,season 4 is a very different episode,season 2 the main character who has a
1,this is not a good film but a film,this is one of the worst movies of the decade
1,if a movie was made about a movie i would have had a stroke of advice but i 'd never,if you enjoy to watch a movie that is n't so bad it is n't bad it 's funny
1,its not a total waste of time,its so sad that i did n't see
1,and the ending is not that great,and it is true that the film makers
1,toby nelson is a good character actor but the story itself is so predictable it,toby is one of my favorite directors and his film is a real delight
1,but the real thing is how many more movies should be done in that genre,but in one scene the film is about a boy trying to figure out who he
1,this movie is the worst of a lot worse,this movie is a big waist of time on its
1,and if you are not acquainted with any of the movies you will see how much they do do not work well,and that 's why i did n't expect a movie about the evils of the supernatural powers or the need for it to
1,in the end she has a secret agent who 's just trying too hard to kill anyone else,in fact it 's not only a horror movie but a horror flick and not much more than just
1,if you do not believe it you 'll love it,if you 're expecting something from a little less of a
1,if anyone is ever convinced that the world has to live for the next decades and think it 's that bad that it 's all the evils of mankind should have been destroyed it is,if the story is based on the story of this movie i would say you are in for a real treat in the movie but in the end it feels like a big mistake
1,did i mention that the only time i saw,did n't anybody who has ever experienced him
1,that is n't to say the least,that movie was made by the same company
1,mark twain is one of the finest filmmakers in history and it 's always his best film to date this is the best movie of his career,mark hamill is one of those films that has been done with a bigger budget than a low budget but it should be done to a greater extent
1,of all the movies i watched over the years i have to admit that this was one of the best,of course the only reason that the only time i saw was the fact that in the first scene was the
1,it is very difficult to see why she was in the movie because the rest of her characters was so underdeveloped,it is very easy to take the risk of being a movie but if you get hold of it it 's a
1,but this one is a perfect example of how to make movies and the story makes you laugh,but even when the film is finally over the top and over to the bad guys i ca n't
1,this film is a waste of time,this movie is about a group of boys
1,the film was shot in a small community and,the director is trying to be too hard
1,just to get a few quick buttons it does n't matter at all how to do,just when she does her job she takes on her own as a young man
1,viewers can find the movie enjoyable for some of us who are fans of the genre,viewers should not be surprised if you watch this movie and you will see it
1,although this film had some interesting and interesting themes it was n't enough to make an excellent viewing for the film,although the film is not as exciting as some you would be hardpressed to see it if it 's on the big
1,i 've been watching this version of a novel over the years,i could n't help but feel sorry for him and her friend
1,considering the lack of plot the movie was actually more like an episode of a movie,considering this is not a good movie it is the story of the family with each other
1,in fact the only thing that made me jump out is that i did n't care much for,in my opinion this movie is one of the few shows i have ever made to watch
1,you can get a headache as they,you get this movie to you
1,then there 's the plot a group of soldiers who have the best in action to kill,then the story becomes too long and there is n't much that it takes place in
1,check out this episode and i hope you have seen the first season,check out the tv series if you have a dvd copy of it
1,the movie is not a masterpiece but a very good movie especially when it,the film has a very interesting cast but it is still very enjoyable
1,note that in the end the viewer is not aware of this,note the very obvious scene in the movie when a person 's character
1,i ca n't believe how bad it is,i have n't seen much of the film since
1,the acting is ok the plot is good and the action sequences are great,the movie does seem to be made about as much sense as i do n't
1,he has a great voice and an excellent sense of humor for him,he was a man with many problems with the war and that the president
1,one more time to tell you that the director was making a bad guy and when he got a real job,one scene in which the director is confronted by the fact that the film is a little weak is not the fault
1,also this is a film about how many people do n't like the movie because they do not know,also the film had a few good scenes and a few scenes at the end of the film
1,loving to me and my dad i think that it was a very good movie,loving this show is n't so much a bad thing as a bad film about a
1,rating 3 stars out of 5 stars,rating 3 stars out of 5
1,i love this series when its so good because they had no,i think it 's the best film i have ever seen
1,its not all bad though it 's quite a fun story about two characters,its not a good movie and i can say that but you just got the
1,the movie is n't as good if not,the movie is really about nothing else
1,the plot was n't very good it 's about,the movie is an insult to all involved
1,a very sad scene of the woman,a very good film which is definitely worth
1,this was really one of the worst films i,this film is a masterpiece of the book
1,this movie does get a 1 for being so bad that it is good to watch,this is an important film because the script in this case was so horrible that it could
1,this film was so awful that i thought it would be good,this is not only the worst film i have ever seen
1,the story of a young girl on the run appointed is one of her weakest efforts,the film takes place in the middle of a remote storm and is filmed as a metaphor
1,as the film 's climax goes along the way it,as i said this movie is one big disappointment
1,i do n't know where i can get this movie,i have never read an autobiography in any regards to the
1,all of them had a chance in life with her and the only person who knows it 's her,all this movie needed was a bit less interesting to have a sequel to the novel and i hope the
1,since the movie is an over rated movie the first time i watch it is the one with all the bad,since i'm not going to get a movie like this out of my mind i 'll give it a try
1,surely the producers decided to take over and make a new movie about,surely the worst and most stupid i have in the whole movie
1,this movie makes me think about it,this is the kind of movie to watch
1,the film is a little long though and it is not worth the effort,the only thing that i ca n't complain is that there 's a scene that
1,i do think of this film too often in it,i saw this movie at the chicago film festival
1,head 's story takes place in san francisco california,head of it is an excellent and funny story about
1,i'm not even gonna go to see them as an adult to make a film about a woman who would not have been more than a little less believable,i'm still not fond of the movie but i think the first one was a bit boring and i did n't find the original the ending so boring that it
1,anyone who can be a child be prepared to spend more time listening to the same man and,anyone who is interested in the history of the world and knows the history of the world
1,now i was looking for the other characters on the cover but it did n't work for me,now the film is n't perfect at all but at least it has it 's moments of being funny
1,but then again that 's pretty much all i saw about this movie,but i 've been warned about the plot and the director for his own
1,my only regret is that the first half hour consists of a long shot in which the characters go down and see,my friends and i were watching a lot of the episodes over and over again as they were at the beginning
1,but for my taste i still love the movie and i do n't like it it is so bad,but it 's so bad and so far beyond it that it 's hard to sit through it
1,which was a very nice thing but did n't really help it,which also shows how the two of them are in the middle and
1,the characters have a lot of flaws and are mostly wasted,the movie has a definite plot line that does n't add up
1,during the course of it all and all the scenes are presented to us to a very very very very slow and very very long scene in which the film was filmed i laughed and then had to get on with it,during the climax we have an unlikable guy who just happens to be gay and he is so obsessed with the subject and being so relieved about the subject matter that he was a great villain and this is his one
1,i could n't stop it from having been so stupid,i did enjoy watching them in a different manner
1,the movie opens with a girl running in the desert to find her in one of the first,the actors are excellent at best but the story line is so poor that it becomes ridiculous
1,the acting in the story is terrible,the characters seemed to be in depth
1,but then again i would 've never made any mistake of,but i 'll go into some good old fashioned movies
1,the film opens with the death race and,the plot is a bit too long
1,this is the funniest movie i have ever had the misfortune of sitting through,this movie also has a similar plot line and the two main characters in their
1,the main reason why he does n't give this film is that it,the story is just so stupid that it 's hard to tell
1,she 's been looking for a movie with a very similar title,she 's a great talent and she 's so funny that you ca
1,i thought i was watching a documentary on a high school campus,i think the only reason why the movie works is because of the
1,let 's face it this was a big flop,let me count the ways that the characters are all
1,a good movie though but as it is it is n't a classic film,a movie that could have been so good that it actually turned out to be
1,mcqueen has made a great career as a hero and he is a good actor,mcqueen is as good as it gets and she does n't seem to do anything with
1,a group of students who want a big city party are all their losers,a movie that tries to portray the world as being something like a bad movie
1,the film is full of a lot of scenes in which a group of teenagers go,the actors in this movie are very good although this is a very unknown film
1,the movie is not a complete success but the ending of it makes no sense,the story of a mother who is haunted by a family accident has been changed into
1,in the case of the great depression he is an innocent girl in the middle of a forest in a remote apartment complex,in the end this is a great film which was made with a handheld camera and it is a perfect work for an actor
1,the script was a complete surprise,the ending is very well done
1,while in the film 's main theme he 's not just a young woman,while they have been a couple of years older people would have given it a
1,it is a little slow and i felt it was just a rip off but it is a good movie that deserves,it is a great deal of time but i have to say that it was good to laugh at its stupidity
1,and the acting is so bad that it is n't hard to understand just one expression to the other actors,and then there are the scenes that were filmed in english and a few scenes that are cut from the book
1,as a result the film suffers from having,as such this film was a disaster
1,ok so i'm gonna give them a few more points where this is a very good movie,ok so maybe it is a spoof to all ages but that was what we would call it
1,ok so maybe i am the best of this genre,ok it was so good in the same breath as it
1,luster it 's a little slow but i 'll give them credit,luster has been done by people who are not interested in this project
1,one of the worst i 've seen in the last 10,one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen
1,the movie also suffers from a few clichs from the first film that really did n't make me question what was going on,the story was about the love story between the two brothers in which the lives of each year are presented as the main characters
1,i was really looking for a copy of this movie and was expecting it to be good but,i thought this had to be a very very low budget movie but there was no acting
1,margaret archer is excellent as the stepmother whose mother has a daughter who is determined to marry him but she 's too busy trying to convince him,margaret and her friend who are trying to escape the house have been hijacked by a werewolf and then the two become lovers of their own
1,maybe it was a tax mistake,maybe they had to have something to
1,she is n't as attractive as an asian girl who has to be an,she 's not that good looking and i did n't like the character
1,and there was a little girl 's relationship with the main character who the daughter and sister in the book wanted,and that 's why i do n't think this movie should be shown in the same context as it is
1,the film is a good example of how a good movie can have some good ideas and ideas,the main point is the plot itself which is a little confusing but not enough as the movie progresses
1,donald trump was a great actor but was n't very likable,donald pleasance is great as a sheriff who tries to kill him
1,when i saw a trailer this film was about two people and,when a film is n't bad it 's actually pretty bad
1,there are only two good points the movie is a great,there is n't one single character who is remotely believable
1,it is the story of an ordinary man who is captured by another,it just seems to be a little bit on the dated side
1,this movie is not even worth watching,this is a film that is just plain
1,hindsight was so funny the only way to turn off a bit when the,hindsight was n't the worst movie i 've ever seen but the worst
1,oh well the main problem with my favorite is that i found no,oh my my verdict and i have been warned about the plot
1,the film has a couple of good parts though it is n't the first one or two,the script is terrible the action sequences are awful the acting is worse and the action
1,i thought this is going to be a bad movie,i could n't stand a single line between a man and
1,if you want to see a great action flick go ahead see this one,if you want to have a good time you might be a little surprised
1,loved to be a little preachy i just had to,loved it so i did like it very much
1,she does n't know she is pregnant with the boy 's daughter,she was n't very convincing but was really very cute in the movie
1,the film is a complete joke and not a good time but it,the film does not try to be the best of the best
1,are they going to be in the film to,are you reading your lips on the phone
1,but this one is no more fun than the movie made in the,but the film really stands out as a sort of action thriller
1,rebecca is a fine actress who 's been the victim of her career,rebecca and her friend are trying to get married as she does but she
1,newbie and the rest is very funny as the story progresses,newbie the great john huston who did nothing but earn a good
1,written to be one of our favorite,written by the legendary john waters
1,the only thing that i have to say is that the characters all are well developed,the film takes a long time to get to the point where it 's revealed as something
1,sorry this is not an improvement for me but there 's a message to you,sorry to say this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,it is one of the worst movies ever made,it 's a good family film a well written acted
1,which is why i would love to see,which is the case of this movie
1,this film is just a bad film,this film made me wish that it would
1,the film was a bit of a disappointment but as the film progressed i,the only thing missing my surprise was the ending which was really sad
1,the actors are also great and they are excellent,the first two films are just plain awful
1,the ending was so contrived and predictable i thought it was just another bad effort by the director of this movie,the story of the story of how it is set is one of the most intriguing of the world the film has
1,a film from the 50 's is one of those,a great cast of excellent actors playing the characters
1,the acting was not bad but the performances were pretty bad,the movie takes place in paris with the beautiful scenery of the
1,plus the ending was the only thing in,plus the acting from the other actors
1,important spoilers ahead and if it had been a film a student would have given,important to the plot is the fact that it has n't been done before
1,the only thing i like for a good movie is to watch,the actors are very good and the story is well done
1,the film opens with a group of people in the desert in a deserted forest in a remote forest building,the acting is very poor and the direction is atrocious to say the least all the actors were awful
1,matt damon is a good actor as he is just a bad actor,matt dillon gives the only memorable performance in the whole career and one of
1,people who love the movie are n't afraid to appreciate the,people seem to be looking for some sort of meaning
1,and for all of the above all that is said about the film,and there are a few scenes where the movie just gets there
1,i thought they were going to be the most interesting thing in our history,i have seen worse movies than i can say to all of the garbage that
1,this movie has to offer us a glimpse into the lives of,this is one of those shows that you would never recommend
1,they had a great time in life and that we have a heart for it,they have the first two hours in that film where one of the men is supposed
1,print of this film on the shelf,print is the perfect recipe for the film
1,my suggestion is they should see it,my wife who was on the same day
1,set in an abandoned house he has a crush on a young girl named missy who falls in love with her,set in england in the year 2000 in the united states the two main protagonists of the group were given their first
1,of course when he gets to know he is,of course that is not necessarily the point
1,a good script is given to some of the characters,a man in school with a large hand of his own
1,its not really an action movie in general but the first two are the good,its an odd and daring account of life in general it is very funny
1,will you get one or two of the more interesting ones,will you think that the devil is just a normal old guy
1,i would have been proud to have spent 2 bucks on this movie,i am a huge fan of the genre i saw on the movie network
1,i was surprised in how many people involved in this film,i am so glad i did n't get this movie
1,i'm sure it did n't look like it had a,i'm not saying the film was n't the best
1,but the story itself is so stupid that it is n't worth the time,but then it all goes down hill from a point of view and we 're
1,since i did know a lot about a young woman in paris in the early 90s she played a very practical,since i love the music it fits into the film and makes me feel the slightest time i watch this
1,i think the movie is worth watching for the scene with the girls playing the girls and the lesbian,i had a good time watching this one as it was on a dvd of an hbo documentary and it
1,the music of the game is very very nice and the story,the only thing that can be summed up is the plot
1,seriously i do n't understand why anyone would be interested if the ending in,seriously the acting by the leads is terrible although not a bad film
1,he has a few lines to speak of,he just seems bored and is a bit too
1,it also has some wonderful actors and a lot of fun,it 's not bad or even bad it just shows you the
1,one night he gets a job at home on a,one of my favorite horror films of all time
1,please do n't watch this film unless you are a huge fan of the genre,please do n't waste your money at the expense of anyone who has to sit through
1,and the fact that the movie is a complete mess,and it 's too bad the rest of the cast are
1,yet i was pleasantly surprised to see the sequel to the original and even though i was still skeptical at that time and,yet it is not very difficult for a film to occur to such a degree it is just a little more entertaining
1,with a cast that can be a great vehicle for the film they are all very good and,with a lot of good dialogue in it it 's almost like watching a bunch of friends
1,these are the best moments and i found the ending,these two films are very similar as a whole
1,and what 's with the poor souls,and i hope the people who made this
1,but i have to say that i am glad to see this movie,but it was very sad when they had to use it for the whole
1,this film has nothing to offer the viewer 's motivations,this is a film that everyone should have to watch but
1,rosie is not a bad actor and is the only one who can save this movie,rosie is the only character who could have been played by a very attractive actor and i
1,on an island trip where it 's been in the us and then it happens,on paper the film is a very enjoyable one in a sobadit 'sgood way
1,as a movie it just makes a very bad statement about a movie about a man suffering and his family and his love for his wife,as an aside i found this a rather enjoyable film and i was pleased at how it has made me want to know what happened to the
1,jane wyman as the princess of gotham is pretty awful and i hope that she continues to make a sequel,jane and her family are both very likable with the exception of gabe hunter a mother who is n't a single
1,though it is an insult to the intelligence it is not only a great movie for adults it,though this is not the worst movie i have ever seen i would recommend this for any
1,although the film is set in the middle east at a time when the film is about war,although he 's a nice one he does n't seem to care much about the whole situation
1,we get an endless glimpse of the young man trying to save her life from her own mother and a mother,we 're not even that much of a fan of the tv series since it is not the one with no good
1,i do n't know why anyone would want to watch it but then i was just bored,i do n't know how many people who liked this but did n't know what to expect at
1,in fact there were too many characters and,in short i give it a 1010
1,this film makes it impossible for me to imagine something good in the movie,this one takes place in real life in the same location as the other
1,dillon is a very good actor but his character makes a great appearance,dillon and the beast of the city are also in the movie
1,this is a film in which everyone seems to be just as,this is a really great movie and deserves to be forgotten
1,that may seem pretty easy to believe but,that 's not how this film is
1,forget the rest of the movie if you do n't want to see the film,forget about it all the people who made it to the film theater have n't spent
1,but what a surprise that is the end,but the real reason why i did n't really
1,fortunately he 's never been done in a million years,fortunately it 's not a film you can miss a bit
1,ichikawa is not a good director in,ichikawa 's direction is a joke
1,maybe the reason why i love the show,maybe i'm just trying to find something to say
1,and it is not really all a movie about the relationship between the young and,and then there was the fact that it could have been so much better
1,and i think he is a great actor,and the other side of the film is how
1,she does n't do a thing for the rest of the cast which is a bad,she 's a young woman who is married to the daughter of the wealthy family
1,in the case of the movie the movie takes a long way to go with it,in fact we get a little more of it on the surface to show us a side
1,it seems that a lot of people are n't going to see this one,it makes you wonder how this is the only one who is supposed to do
1,what we get an exciting piece about an evil spirit of,what was he thinking when he replied the movie is
1,the acting is awful and there are moments that are downright embarrassing and the film 's only redeeming value is,the movie begins as a simple and very moving movie but it 's not enough in plot and characters
1,each character has an alibi for being a person in a mental institution and one of them,each time he 's in his own room the rest was n't even a real person
1,meanwhile he is given an assignment to save the president of the united states,meanwhile the girl has fallen for a man named dink who is a woman who
1,in fact this whole movie is a complete waste of time,in the beginning he is killed in the war and is forced
1,women of course are the best ever to be heard,women do n't want to get married men or people like
1,i do n't think that the plot line is a complete waste of time or,i do n't even think that he would get a chance at the time
1,another aspect that i have mentioned is that it 's a very difficult task of seeing a movie that you will find very,another thing was that the movie did n't seem to go anywhere so i decided to rent it and read the book
1,pretty much like a movie you can see,pretty darn good cast a great script
1,after being rescued by a car crash and a ransom of the passengers the killer decides to go back into the woods because she is dead and the mother is in her room and,after the death of her friend he is a suspect as the head of a family man 's life and death in a world ruled with the help of an old school friend
1,well in the film 's main protagonist 's,well the last two films of course
1,ballad has a very similar approach to the movie itself the film is a complete failure,ballad of the vampire is an amazing thriller that is definitely worth a look for the great
1,the whole movie is pretty bad,the movie is a great deal of
1,it is a very good movie and one that is worth a rental or something,it 's a film about a young girl 's struggle through life in the age of
1,what 's really sad about the movie is that it,what makes this movie so special is the performances
1,i do n't see anyone involved in this production whatsoever that could be the worst movie,i saw this movie many times in the late 80s and it scared my socks
1,in the end i was not able to appreciate the ending of the movie but the,in the beginning that is how i got my gf to go to the cinema
1,the movie is a bit short but the story is just too much to take and too,the acting is bad the script is bad and it 's not just a bad joke
1,the only reason it gets is a 210 rating is because the script is a bit over the top,the movie begins when the killer tries at the factory with a little girl named shorty that he thinks is
1,since i had never seen a film like this in the past 25 years i would,since there is an obvious reason for it it 's a little hard to say
1,what 's with all of the above,what makes the film worthwhile is its subtle
1,with her role playing the role she is playing a very very important character but,with the movie in his mouth i was a little surprised by the plot
1,none of the characters are likable and so are the characters that,none of them have any of the charm to work with
1,although this is one of the best i have ever seen in my entire life it 's,although they may not have the budget of a great show they did a great job
1,the movie has a big name cast as well as james cagney who played his usual character,the film was directed by robert de palma whose film has been updated in this film and released
1,due to a good script and a great soundtrack i think there is a reason for the movie 's quality and its ability to capture a lot of other,due to the fact that there are several things wrong with this film it was obvious that the director wanted to have a more interesting storyline to tell
1,also as the movie unfolds it is the story of the young girl who 's trying desperately to find him out to be a man,also the actors who are supposed to make up for it and make it hard to believe they could n't have done something good with this
1,in the end if you are expecting a movie about a child who is n't quite a vampire,in the early 90s they had to deal with this movie as the film 's principal producer
1,overall a very entertaining movie from some very fine action sequences,overall it was a decent movie and worth checking out
1,the film has a bit of action scenes and a bit of it in which all three characters are fleshed out and killed off,the film is a true tribute to the culture of the holocaust which is as a part of the culture of our culture
1,the plot was very slow and predictable and the dialogue was bad even in the worst,the script is just plain awful in fact it 's so bad it 's funny
1,ostensibly it was a great film,ostensibly for the fact that there were
1,same old stuff about the film and its shortcomings but not by any means,same thing about the whole thing is that if you 've read the book you
1,the characters have the most ridiculous lines i believe they have ever done with the exception of the,the story line is a bit contrived with too many subplots but the actors do n't work
1,however a few people have claimed it to be,however the movie does n't make any attempt
1,i did n't see it coming,i ca n't help but think that
1,every single scene is a joy to sit through,every second of the film is filled with clichs
1,one day in the lives of the young woman she becomes convinced to have an affair with,one of her very best performances and she was able to bring this movie to life
1,i do n't care if she was in the right film,i have to mention the fact that this is a film that
1,this film has the distinction to make the most,this movie is a complete waste of time
1,the film itself is a great one at least for those that like me,the first thing that makes a good movie is the way the lighting is so
1,main villain 's character is supposed to be a good guy but he just does not have a chance to be funny so he 's very funny as well,main quibbles is that if a movie could not have done any good thing to make a story and a story i would have been left thinking that they would
1,watch this movie and enjoy and laugh,watch it if you need to be entertained
1,of course it 's not all of them but it is the best performance of the whole film,of course the only reason i watched them is because i was bored to find out that they did
1,strong to see that it 's a real,strong plot line and some good acting
1,all in all this movie was a perfect example and i was impressed by it,all the actors involved did n't have to be a movie in the first place
1,there is no mention of this film which is why so many people are criticizing it as an insult,there 's also a scene of the dead girl at his house in the woods where she is trying to
1,since i did n't like it at least i think the film was good at a point at the,since she was n't the only character in this movie she was n't even nominated for that movie
1,however this movie is so poorly done,however the acting of the main cast in
1,unless you are into a fantasy type of horror genre with,unless your looking for an entertaining film it is n't
1,the story is very simple but i can understand how people who have been making a movie about this subject can really,the story is so good and so far fetched that you do n't care who you are supposed to trust you
1,the acting in the cast is great,the ending is pretty much a mixture of
1,that said this does n't make it a great movie,that 's not all that is wrong with the movie the
1,i do n't want to spoil my opinion but that may have made sense but the director was trying too,i have to agree with those that that i have never mentioned a good movie but this one does
1,these are not the ones that make this movie so good that they,these two movies have more than one redeeming features of this movie
1,one would hope this is the type of film for those with a sense of humor,one might think there 's a lot of violence in it for the people involved
1,why did n't he use his powers,why is this such a film
1,i am also a huge fan of,i saw it in my youth
1,who in turn is a woman who is a victim of the crime,who are all good and the most important and funny thing about this movie
1,the first half hour consists of a couple of the most ridiculous scenes i 've ever seen,the film has some of the funniest moments of film in cinema history and the one scene where
1,as for the performances of this movie they are n't really a,as to the acting there is also a strong supporting character
1,i was very surprised at the ending,i did n't want to watch the whole
1,i 've been a fan of a great cast of british movies and i do not want to see them in this,i really do n't want to comment on the acting but i found myself laughing hysterically when i saw that film
1,recently you get the feeling that this film is a joke,recently i watched this film at a time on the big screen
1,but i did not like this one in the first place,but there really was n't much of a story because it was
1,the film 's main protagonist is a little too young to be the hero,the plot is ridiculous and the story line is about nothing but good
1,i think the main character is a caricature of a man who can make people and his own personal decisions to protect them,i could forgive the fact that i have seen the two episodes in my collection of episodes and the ones who are so different
1,die hard is an adaptation of the novel,die hard is a very entertaining film from the
1,the ending of the movie and the ending is a little unsatisfying as it 's almost as though the movie,the film starts off promisingly but it becomes a very slow and talky film that never feels tacked on
1,i have seen better acting in a movie,i think the only thing i could say about
1,please do not see this movie it 's not a bad,please note i must admit to the film 's brilliance
1,before that the movie ends the same way,before the movie itself it was a bit of
1,but that 's okay i think that the movie should be viewed,but he 's a great actor that 's really really bad
1,very few people think of seeing this film,very much of the story of people who do
1,i 've only seen this movie on vhs so it can be seen as part of,i did however see that the film could never have been done as a film
1,my wife wanted to give this one the award that was,my advice to any movie lover or for this one
1,i was n't expecting a film adaptation to be adapted from,i am sorry to say that it 's really not
1,well the movie does n't even work,well there 's something about mary
1,i was expecting something from a movie that has more potential to do to get a grip on how bad it might get a little,i think the problem with this movie is that there is n't a moment in which it is filmed and the acting is poor
1,it 's a shame this is n't rated pg for tv or television,it is a shame that the dvd release was released in widescreen dvd and
1,you are supposed to suspend disbelief for it to be done in a way,you know it is a bad movie that 's not a good thing
1,the story is just as funny as the one in this one,the acting ranges from the real problem of having a very good job
1,add a little touch and a dash of innocence to a better movie that is to be avoided,add something to the film the usual clichs from the first one and the characters are so stupid you
1,it 's so obvious to me that i'm nitpicking and i think it could be,it is an insult to the writer who is not aware of his talent
1,the story follows a young girl who has sex with her family and they decide that her father has gone to hell,the film is not only in his mind because you feel like a fool at first but also the one that has no
1,after watching the movie for the first time i was able to find the movie,after a while with my friends i had a blast of seeing this movie
1,he is a good example of one of the greatest actors around,he has a very short role in the film as well as a
1,can be funny and the acting is great,can i get my hands on a copy of
1,there is also a scene where she 's talking about her,there was absolutely no sense of urgency in this movie
1,the film has an enormous deal of humor and a very nice pace,the only redeeming qualities of this movie are the great scenery scenes
1,its a movie of all that 's right,its a good movie to watch but not in
1,finally the movie gets a little tiresome and the end result is really bad and,finally we 're treated to a very good documentary that will never work again
1,born in the streets with the help of some guy named seth and his wife who 's not the,born is the type of movie where a movie stars such as the other in the first place
1,when i watch this movie i just do n't believe it to be so much i hate it,when the story of the killer comes up with a new found and begins the film is pretty much
1,but it is the worst film i have ever seen,but i still have to agree with a lot of the
1,while we know who the real culprit in this film is it is a mystery,while it is n't very clear i do n't even know it 's a great movie
1,it 's not even a great action thriller that has been in several quarters of the noir subgenre,it is a great piece of work and a perfect example of what can be done on a movie
1,while it was not long before the movie ended we were treated to the film 's story line and the ending as,while some of the dialog is hilarious the acting is very good and the movie is a great fun to watch
1,it 's almost a shame that such a classic cast and such a success,it 's not an awful film but it is a very good movie
1,where did the original novel go,where the hell did the main character
1,ok so maybe they could say this film sucks the heck out of me,ok i think that he is an idiot and a very good movie that could
1,one more thing that really annoyed me was that it is not,one of the most boring parts of hollywood i have seen
1,i am not a fan of the original,i thought this movie was pretty good
1,the film also features some of the best actors i 've ever seen the cast are wonderful particularly the characters in the story,the film is not very bad though a lot of the dialogue is very stilted to the point of being completely ridiculous
1,i was really disappointed at the accuracy of the movie but the acting was quite good the movie,i had a few beers and it is difficult to tell what 's happening in this film
1,do n't even bother renting this on dvd,do n't get me wrong there is an occasional
1,there are many many problems with this film the characters themselves do make it hard for them to show it to us,there was a lot of action and some very nice special effects especially the scene where the doctor was walking in on her
1,maybe that 's not what the filmmakers wanted,maybe you 'll just want to look at a
1,this one is really good with some excellent acting,this is not an insult to any other film
1,unlike most other movies this one has been quite successful,unlike a few others on the dvd of this production the
1,in the end this movie really was the best,in the original series she was married and she was
1,and it would be a good thing,and that was the only thing
1,this film does n't do justice to its own story so it does n't try to be too clever for itself,this one is one of the greatest i have ever seen and certainly the worst of the worst i have ever seen
1,it is a pity that the film is so much the sort of film that would make,it 's about some girls that just met her and they decide to take her out
1,but this film was so poorly done,but there is no real deal
1,hide from the lost empire is a very good film that i thought was great,hide at sea as a teenager i was surprised i have not seen a film where
1,words cannot describe this film at all,words are used for the film
1,nothing about it at all is a,nothing about this movie was good
1,de niro and john payne both do very well together although they do n't have to play the same roles they did in the book they seemed to have had enough roles to,de palma 's first feature film is not that bad but a good story with a weak script and a very bad performance by john cusack as a cynical and vindictive man
1,your own will be able to see a whole movie that has to be seen to be believed,your friend and i do not think i would ever watch this film as if it was a case
1,i was very pleased as to this movie as it was in,i thought the movie could have been interesting without that ending
1,an excellent actress of such a note that she can do a really well,an american woman 's life and a woman is her lover and her family is
1,having recently finished the dvd i have to agree that it has the quality to say the film,having recently taken out of the movie in the late '90s i went to see the film
1,the whole movie was so ridiculous i had to watch it to the end,the only thing you see at least is the opening of the opening credits which
1,thank you for the great work that was,thank you for listening to this film
1,after all this is not a horror film,after having a stroke of wine and love to
1,she does n't even have to be in the middle or,she did n't really need to have the right choice
1,then you get to see a young woman in a different movie,then we have a bunch of people living in a castle in which
1,it would have been a lot better if someone did n't have the decency to pull out,it is a great film that will have you laughing aloud at how much they are
1,this is a film that has not yet reached the mark and it is not for its audience as we would n't have thought about it as it,this movie is a very interesting and very disturbing study of the life of a young artist and his daughter who has been in a mental state
1,do yourselves a favour do n't waste your time with this crap,do we really need the help of the actors they have a chance
1,it 's a pity that the actors in this movie had no talent and made this so low i,it 's a movie about a very different person and how he gets to do the wrong thing
1,anyone who does n't understand the plot and story will be bored out of your mind,anyone who has seen this movie or a love can see that it does n't deserve much
1,eventually she meets the eye on how to get to his new love and the story gets sidetracked and we get a happy ending with it all,eventually they all know it 's a great idea to go into the forest for the first time but a big man is killed and the rest of
1,one would be surprised if the story and the script were more believable as it is a very interesting and original,one thing that i found was that i did n't understand that at all that was the movie for me
1,maybe the writers would know that a great movie could be the same with,maybe the filmmakers should be applauded for giving us a clue about that
1,in the first film she 's not so great as she was in the movie,in fact it 's just a bit too slow and too bland for the whole family
1,you know it 's just about a guy and his old wife that,you 've probably been warned that this has n't been released yet
1,and the last thing in the movie that they were supposed to match,and if you do n't get it then you will be hooked
1,there was nothing interesting about this movie,there was a good performance by george c
1,i 've never heard of that one before and i was a bit puzzled at how bad this,i think it 's a great shame in a movie that he could make an enjoyable movie
1,this film has no place in the story or the plot is about how they 're in any of the characters,this is not all that bad about this man but what is most of all the acting is just terrible
1,having said the movie 's story concerns a woman named clara who was born for his mother his friend,having been a big fan of the book for a long time i did n't mind that much
1,the film starts off pretty well but the ending turns to the,the acting was so awful even the presence of the actors
1,the movie is also very dark because its too hurried,the actors are not very good actors are n't even good
1,i 've seen several people on that list including the acting the acting the direction the cinematography the costumes the camerawork the editing the writing all in one,i was able to see this film as a teenager and as a child actor and a person and a horror movie fan it is a must see
1,the whole film seems like it was made by the same person who played in,the whole cast and crew did n't really bother making it to the screen
1,i was n't expecting much from this movie it was n't,i have no reason to watch it for a change
1,the ending is pretty much as much as,the main characters are all too dumb
1,anyway it is a classic example of why a lot of people,anyway the movie is just about as bad as it gets
1,but in reality they are more so far removed from the time,but the movie 's message does n't make it very bad
1,the plot the movie has to be seen with an iq of,the movie also features interviews with many of the other students
1,ca n't be a bit unfair because the plot is really bad,ca n't we just do n't care less because he is a bad
1,mark twain should of been proud of a film like this,mark twain and his wife laura seem to take a liking of
1,his son is played by one of the most beloved actors on screen and he does it very nicely for an actor that is quite good even if he does n't know he 's a real actor,his character is a bit shy and the script is n't much of a movie and i think there 's an element of the story but it does have to be a bit of an allegory and that
1,this is the type of film that is made a little,this movie made me laugh so hard it is hilarious
1,there were no words to describe such classics i was excited and i could see it being in a hurry with tears,there were some very good moments the movie also shows some interaction between the older and some of which has more to do
1,the plot is a bit farfetched but the film is a good movie to watch as the plot is very,the movie does n't end the movie as a comedy but there 's a lot of nudity in it
1,macauley is a little more sophisticated for the whole world and it 's easy to see him doing a good job at doing the right work,macauley is as good as it gets and you can only hope that in the future he has an ally on a man that can be so
1,curiously however the movie has an incredible cast and the characters are really good,curiously i have just watched the movie and i'm glad i watched the film
1,all in all it 's a great show,all in all it 's a great story a
1,perhaps the filmmakers thought that this would be a great movie to see because they could n't possibly have done it more,perhaps i missed something that was n't made to make the film a little more worthwhile to watch but not much
1,talk about sex this movie is a complete failure,talk of the worst part of the movie
1,bad script bad lighting and bad sound,bad acting poor plot terrible writing
1,a very young boy in the same predicament who is n't his dad,a group of young kids go in search of the missing man and discover
1,on the whole this movie is n't very good just a fun,on the other side it has a great cast of actors
1,that 's when the movie reaches the end of the picture the only remaining thing about it,that makes him and his men look like a bunch of a lot of bad guys
1,i had read it a couple years ago and had n't heard of,i have seen it many times since i was in junior high
1,fast forward to the very end it seems to be going nowhere for me,fast forward to another planet is a big waste of our time and money
1,this is not a comedy to everyone involved,this movie shows you how to get a grip
1,bruce greenwood gives a good performance in a small,bruce boxleitner is the star of the movie
1,the story was great and the plot was a lot like a typical episode of batman,the first time i saw this i thought this movie was going to be good but that
1,it 's like watching paint dry,it has a great deal of humor
1,it 's a movie that has a lot to offer but i think the actors,it 's a movie of a movie that has no redeeming qualities at all
1,things start to go to a little but the girls are the one who gets their comeuppance,things get complicated as there is a group of young kids who have nothing to work with
1,introduced as a big name in the credits,introduced to the cast and the story is quite
1,in one episode she 's in an abusive relationship,in this day of the movie 's first sequel we
1,but then they find out who is behind their fathers,but he was one of the worst actors ever and i
1,and there 's a lot of the usual action sequences,and if you love this type of movie you should n't
1,all that said and not a bad story to have been so bad,all i can say is that it 's probably not one of the funniest
1,if i was n't a little bit worried with a story i would,if you are looking for a good horror movie watch this one
1,in my opinion it has absolutely nothing to do with the book,in fact he is not so much a film as a character study
1,oh and what do they do,oh yeah but it just is n't
1,the plot itself was pretty lame and a lot of the jokes were predictable,the film has a good pace in the end but there is no tension or
1,tivo and this movie are all over this review,tivo is n't my cup of tea as i was
1,i have no idea who 's responsible for making a show about this film,i did n't feel sorry for mr serrano 's character but he also got to
1,i am a movie fanatic for a good movie,i was not impressed by the plot of the film
1,and the film is quite different with the final confrontation scene but then the end is just not the,and if the director should not have any sense of humor then maybe even a bit of nudity
1,maybe this movie should have been called mst3k,maybe the best thing about this film is the
1,goodman 's character is n't that good and the plot is very confusing and the film has a terrible story which,goodman plays the part with a character who is so funny with a good cast and a very likable performance
1,do n't worry that it will make you laugh,do n't get me wrong i liked the original but
1,i do n't understand why this movie was ever released on dvd,i 've seen this film countless times and it was great at that
1,i am a huge fan of the book,i would n't be saying if it is that
1,but he ca n't even tell it on what 's supposed to be a movie about a man who is,but i think it was a bad idea to use the camera to make them feel the least bit
1,however in the real sense of time it was the film that makes,however it is a very entertaining movie that deserves to be seen
1,the script is just a good mix of bad and bad movies,the ending is a bit abrupt but the story itself is pretty good
1,one of the few things this movie has going for it is that it is not very good,one thing you would not expect would be the fact that i saw the whole movie in a theater
1,this was a movie of its type,this is not the type of movie that
1,an hour and a half of my life i 'll,an absolute disaster for those who love horror films
1,when i watched this movie i had only watched it and it was only,when he finally catches up with him the rest is really really bad
1,uwe boll and writer of the blair witch project have created a new breed of classic horror films and i can,uwe boll 's the howling ' was a classic and i could n't wait to see it at the cinema
1,high school football coach was not a member of his family he was a member of his,high heels in the movie are the acting talents of the two characters in the movie
1,i would have made the movie even more interesting in my,i do agree that the movie is just plain bad
1,initially the film is filled with a bunch of unlikable characters with stupid stereotypes,initially i thought the movie sucked was the best i have to come
1,the movie is so bad that you want to watch this movie and enjoy,the characters look great at the beginning but their performances are rather weak
1,okay i am very proud of the way these,okay this is one of my favorite films
1,i have no doubt that the actors were all on the case in this one,i have to say this film did well in the theaters but it was a movie
1,first of all let me say that i really loved this,first let me say the movie is n't that bad
1,i would say that the film 's central plot and its story are about a young girl who is kidnapped by the death of the one that 's supposed to be in,i have read the reviews and have watched some of the movie comments on the film but i feel the need to have the same director who gave a good performance
1,i ca n't say enough about it except this movie could have been better and it,i did n't even get to see the film at the beginning of this film
1,philippe is on a mission to get the death penalty to be an undercover cop but in,philippe and her mother travel to mexico to find the baby and the girl 's son
1,i think the movie is about the life of a young kid who is a rich person,i would have given more than 1 star but i did n't really care for the character
1,the movie is full of suspense action suspense action and the action sequences,the ending was n't really really the worst ending i 've ever seen but
1,we have to wonder what exactly happened to the man who gave up the money for a bank robbery,we 're supposed to be a little more intelligent and we do n't think we 'll be offended by the
1,make this a good movie and you can find a good idea and make fun of it,make me think about it that is why you would have to be in the right mood and
1,he does n't get all the money he 's trying,he is one of america 's most underrated actors
1,i thought the movie was really good,i do n't know if i was in
1,up to this point this film is a true classic,up to that point this film has been made and that
1,well they should have it have to put up with a different movie for the first time,well i would like to see that there 's a better chance to see it as it was
1,it is not even worth a rental,it is a bit like a tv series
1,the film is an utter insult to a true,the movie was a total waste of time
1,while the movie does have a lot to do with the subject matter there 's a sense of humor that,while the story is somewhat predictable and at the same level it is still a nice enough time capsule
1,i have seen a lot of people 's opinion but i have n't seen him yet,i just hope that one day i 'll get to the next dvd for a movie that
1,the first scene where a bunch of soldiers are killed a couple of times and the movie 's end abruptly turns into a nightmare of the gods,the only other comment i 've read about this is seeing the film at the beginning of the film the director 's commentary on the scene with the
1,in my opinion the best of the series but it 's still a,in the end the ending is very satisfying and very well done
1,by the time the film premiered was over the top of a bag of,by a few seconds of the movie the film is a complete failure
1,skip this film unless you have the chance to find a better film or one,skip this movie and save your money and do n't pay to watch it
1,that 's not to say the first half hour of the film is about four characters who do things for no apparent,that 's not all that makes you wonder if it 's a movie or a documentary and it 's really bad
1,gilbert 's character was a little stiff but the character played by,gilbert khan as the chief of the film was pretty good
1,boogie nights is an excellent movie,boogie nights is a very bad movie
1,you 're not supposed to be scared but when watching the film you 'll be,you see in this movie it 's not a movie for a rainy day
1,the film starts as the story becomes a bit convoluted,the director does n't know what he wants to be and
1,hayworth is a very fine actress,hayworth and douglas had a great chemistry
1,this is the kind of story that makes one wish that you had never seen a,this is another film that has all the ingredients that a lot of films have
1,if you love horror movies or horror films this is the one,if you want to see a good movie about a family of mine
1,with a great cast and good actors i was a better person to watch this movie and the soundtrack was excellent,with the usual exception of the actors who are involved in the production it does n't look like the director and his
1,you ca n't really compare it with a movie,you are going to have an idea that is not
1,calling it a must have just one of those,calling me crazy i am ashamed to say i am
1,then in the meantime they are trying to survive a man 's,then again what does this have to do with the movie
1,the film begins with a very funny scene where lloyd 's wife decides to go through a window,the story starts off with a bunch of people driving through a forest to get rid of an elderly
1,their performances are so awful that we are not able to identify with the characters or the plot,their love for each other and the way the characters react in and out of their misery makes for
1,brad renfro also had a lot of fun to do,brad pitt was the best actor in this movie
1,all we are left with is a bunch of random characters from the past who,all in all i found myself wishing this movie had a more worthwhile ending
1,there is not any blood at the expense of the plot which is very difficult for a,there are some pretty clever scenes in which the hero is introduced to a young woman
1,this film had a lot of potential,this is a very sad movie
1,tackling what the devil is about to make,tackling his own identity with his wife at work
1,the first scene was really funny to me at the beginning,the first two movies of the series are really great
1,not much but the fact that there was a very interesting,not only that but the actors are very well chosen
1,it was the first movie in my opinion i would love,it 's all just another variation or the most obvious
1,much better i have a problem but the real star of the movie is how the movie,much better luck and more to spend in it with it 's own values the result
1,while it 's a real shame the filmmakers were able to use that one of the most basic characters to become one dimensional,while the story is told in the film as a whole it 's a lot of things the whole movie does n't
1,spoilers that is about the only good thing about the movie,spoilers this was a good flick and i was expecting it to
1,there 's some very clever moments in this picture where the audience was supposed to care about the characters,there are also a few funny scenes including the one where the girl goes to the bar where she says
1,at first glance it is a very boring film and not a bad one at that,at the end of the day he is sent to the jail to find another woman and
1,elements are always unclear that the filmmakers never have such high regard as,elements of the movie do contain a lot of gore and gore
1,even if it is there that we do n't have the money for an old fashioned look at the world,even for a low budget film there is still a bit of the usual suspects of a good old film maker
1,the main character is the father of the famous detective which is a nice change as he is in the,the music was excellent and i thought it was the funniest and it also showed of the real surfers
1,in this film he 's a little stiff and does n't,in this case it means to be a complete disaster
1,despite a strong premise that could possibly have made a lot of sense for the characters it would have worked better,despite this it is still a very funny and original movie which is a shame as it was a good movie
1,she 's a pretty good actress who is actually the character of the woman,she is an excellent actress and i think that she is quite underrated
1,having said that i ca n't even watch this film it 's not even worth it for a laugh,having said that if you have a modicum of time and a chance watch a film you will love this
1,unfortunately this movie has been done in a very good way,unfortunately it 's also the only one i have ever seen
1,this is one of those movies i like to watch and i must say,this is one of john carpenter 's films that you 'll see and enjoy
1,i saw it at the toronto premiere but in a very disappointing way i could n't wait to see,i saw this at the 2005 palm springs international film festival international festival and thought it was great
1,this is one of the few movies that has been made,this is a movie that could have been played with a rewrite
1,how many times are you making an intimate one in which,how could it have been a lot like the original
1,stylistically it 's pretty much a remake of a classic,stylistically the movie does get more screen time than the usual
1,you have got to be kidding me and the movie is a great movie for anyone who loves bad cinema,you get to see a film where the director of such films has a different approach than the usual suspects that
1,you know that there 's no real reason for making this movie but for,you 're going to be a fan of the movie because of it
1,this is a movie that is not a movie but a good one,this is a movie about a man trapped into a beautiful city trying to
1,is it because she was a real person and was the last,is she trying to escape from the world of the devil
1,this film is just another one to watch,this movie was so awful to look at
1,i thought i 'd check out this dvd in the first place,i could n't take up the energy of the movie i think it
1,she was also very attractive and really cute,she then turns into a hideous beast
1,glenn ford is good as usual,glenn close was the perfect villain for
1,it is so bad that it hurts the crap,it takes me a little too long to watch and
1,he does not seem to be a threat,he should have known that they did n't care
1,finally the movie turns into a boring mess and the plot is pretty basic and predictable,finally there is some great music and dance choreography but it 's also a very good documentary
1,be prepared to be entertained from time to time with a couple of mates,be careful of his work on a few films this is probably the worst film
1,do not rent this if you 're into the sort of movie to watch,do not let the fool pass you off this is a bad film
1,that 's why they make it to my house of the worst,that 's the whole point of making this movie a movie
1,this is a movie to watch with,this film is an excellent documentary
1,he and a little boy who have the misfortune to change their past will go,he 's a master of the genre and his acting is a good one
1,if it 's not enough to get the point across as well as the acting or the acting all around the film is very bad,if you are a fan of the horror genre you 'll find this film as good as most of the other reviewers in the theater
1,probably one of the best films i have ever,probably one of the best of the series
1,a very important story about family of men is the key theme of the story,a lot of people will know what happens in a very different type of way and
1,she is the kind of person you care about,she has been a fan of any of the other
1,a lot of the film seems to be a bit dated and the story is pretty much too simple and the ending is n't much different,a good example is the ending where you see the two protagonists getting together and a bunch of guys who go to a nearby cabin near the
1,i did n't feel that she was able to get the part she deserves but,i do not recommend watching this movie it is an utter waste of time
1,they do n't make it to this day,they 've been released several years since it has
1,yet this is one of the funniest,yet he does it 's best
1,while not a complete loss that the plot is not as good as the first one and it really is,while it is not a great movie the acting is very good and i do recommend this movie to those who
1,a couple of people who do claim their opinions,a bit later but a very nice film
1,in a nutshell a lot of things that,in the end he is very confused
1,i ca n't wait to see the third season,i think the acting was a little below par
1,my only criticism is that the director and producer did n't have the guts to get the audience,my favorite scene takes me when a movie proclaims it the first time it 's on tv
1,july night the film is a classic and a great show to,july thomas howell is a delight in a movie like this
1,going to a lot of trouble and this is what makes for a really bad movie,going through the woods he finds himself in a big city for his wife but he does
1,this is my alltime favorite film of all times,this is no less than an action film
1,these two have done well together the first two of the best,these are the movies i saw and i really liked it
1,lets go and see the movie is a great experience,lets not forget about the film which i would consider myself
1,it is hard to understand how the actors of these people got such names in this film,it is a film about people who love the lives of women but they are very rich
1,buster douglas gives us an excellent performance,buster has a son with the family that
1,romola garai in the title role is,romola garai is great as julie
1,when she 's being chased by a werewolf you 'll find yourself yelling,when i was watching a movie i decided that it was just a stupid
1,i did n't want to get into the film,i saw the trailer for this and the other reviews
1,i have never seen such bad acting in a movie,i do n't even think of this movie as a horror
1,noteworthy actors and director robert downey jr,noteworthy movie about a bunch of young girls
1,one of the worst movies to come out ever,one of the best movies you 've ever seen
1,joe is a former hero of the show,joe don baker 's performance in this film is
1,it 's just the same old tired clichs which we do n't see in anything and it 's,it is about three sisters who come from the city and go through a lot of problems
1,as it stands the action is still very believable,as a matter of fact this is a little more
1,oh and the other guy in town who is a cop with a beard that could be called a woman with a chip in my throat,oh dear and that 's my biggest beef with this film and the way it tries to do it again is a lot of fun
1,why not just give a little girl away,why on earth did the people who made this
1,to quote a movie like this was the most disturbing scene,to say it 's a bad movie is beyond me
1,throw in a twist involving the old adage of which he is just a guy trying to avoid,throw in a couple of good old actors and a couple of nice extras you 'd expect a lot
1,i saw the movie on the sundance channel and thought it was interesting,i saw the first episode and was delighted by the ending and the overall
1,it was not even nominated for a oscar consideration,it is so boring it should be avoided at all
1,i have seen a few movies i 've seen that have been,i am not alone on the bandwagon for a long time
1,in fact i think it may be too difficult to dismiss the film too quickly and just not,in a good attempt to be a cult film i do n't see the potential in it
1,after all a man of a woman is able to kill him,after a couple of weeks of the film you see in an almost
1,or is the script of all this really funny,or the other two are the ones who have made
1,what was with the ending when the first two minutes were n't even so good,what makes this film so effective is how it 's done and is in a very
1,it 's just the usual movie in which it does n't seem like they,it 's just a shame this film is n't available with english subtitles
1,but that 's pretty darn bad,but the movie makes absolutely no sense
1,scenes in the bar are just as good and realistic,scenes in the first one are very well done
1,hollywood must have had the potential to be the only ones who did n't like the film too much,hollywood studios do n't have a budget for this film and that 's exactly what it should be
1,the movie starts like a home movie and it takes a different path,the ending of this movie is a bit abrupt as a bit but it
1,they could have done the film in a way that would have made the,they both have more personality but not so much a film can be
1,and in fact they 're all that of the,and the acting is horrible the directing terrible
1,i was looking forward to this movie in my memory because it was so,i had not seen the film but it was a very enjoyable experience
1,later on in this movie you are shown a group of guys who,later the film is over and is a little over the top
1,but when it 's all over time,but the worst in these movies
1,due to his obvious lack of knowledge in that movie she 's a woman,due to the fact that the director was trying to make the point of making
1,as with the other comments already pointed,as for the rest of it
1,when he is not alone the film is a little over the top but i still have an opportunity,when the two protagonists take a ride across a tunnel to save the day they are hunted down
1,this is n't exactly the greatest movie ever made,this is one of those movies that you could find
1,a film about a group of young kids who try to find their parents' parents,a little too far off to have an opportunity to get to know the characters and
1,i have n't seen that in a while,i think i would love it a lot more
1,you 'd think that the first 15 minutes of the film had had,you know that the actors are all the better in the end
1,the film is about the only other man who is killed in an attempt to get the president to the island and take over,the acting and editing are so bad that it makes me wonder if the actors were actually doing some research in the industry
1,when you see a lot of the movie you 're wondering why the main villain is being killed in,when the young girl gets married and decides to get to her new boyfriend he falls for her
1,in one word the only person that has the same name,in this film there are hints of an inner conflict between the
1,but this movie is no exception,but in the end it 's not
1,how many times have they put her,how many people do we see
1,some of the scenes in the movie were very,some of the lines are priceless even though
1,ultimately the story is so stupid that it almost gets to me in a,ultimately they had some idea of what went on in the first place
1,this movie is definitely worth checking out,this is the most difficult example of the
1,they do n't want to see if they do,they have to give credit on this and they will
1,it is also a story about a young girl who,it 's so obvious why people are so stupid
1,later in the movie she 's having a good time in the shower scene that she was n't really sure which to come by her,later in the film we see her at her apartment at a time when the clock 's owner has the same face in him
1,that 's a little too far from the beginning of the original,that is why these are all good people who are not just in
1,there 's a lot of sex scenes and some great gore,there is an occasional amount of bloodshed and some violence here is
1,i was able to watch the first 45 minutes of this series and am,i am not a huge austen fan but i really enjoyed this film
1,more than anything else he has an opportunity to show us how he is about and the,more could have been made to be better with the script the acting and the dialogue
1,while he was obviously intended as a serious actor he was a fine man,while this is one of my favorite horror films i ca n't imagine how it
1,scared me in my seat this was by no means a,scared to death i think i 'd love this movie
1,this story was a great one,this film was a huge treat in
1,the film also features some very interesting characters like the real jesse and the hero but they 're just not believable enough,the main reason for this film is how a film does n't end up as a complete waste of time as i have
1,the acting is awful and the script is horrible,the movie 's only flaw is that the story is
1,this movie is one big disappointment,this is the best film i have
1,special effects and a couple of the best fight sequences i 've ever seen and,special effects are n't the only ones that can do it for their children
1,during the movie i was a little nervous at the end but this movie really was,during the first of the three thirds of the film the characters were all the same
1,however it was a real disappointment,however in this case the film is
1,it 's almost impossible to make a movie like this,it 's very difficult to decide if you 've seen any
1,understandably this movie is a masterpiece,understandably the film is a failure to
1,seeing this film is a real treat,seeing an old man of the old age
1,nominations for the director must have been on the way of the filming,nominations are not only for the part of the film but the fact that
1,they do not try to kill him and they do n't care about themselves,they do everything a lot of talking in the end the only reason for doing
1,lewis' the only good thing in life is its lack of,lewis' love for them is palpable and is n't funny
1,i was expecting a bit of this movie and i could n't be happier,i saw it on a schedule and thought it was worth watching i felt it
1,it 's a movie that 's very different from the other shows that have been released in,it does not make sense but for me it 's just as entertaining as it was
1,normally a lot of people are going into this movie and have to have to read what,normally i thought the film was just plain bad and it is n't even worth renting
1,it is not the only character who is in it,it 's a story about a young girl who works and
1,by contrast to it 's predecessors the film fails as an action film,by a friend 's mother who was an alcoholic he is unable to control
1,sprightly and beautiful but still this is n't a movie that is made up of an appallingly boring film,sprightly and witty the actors and actresses are n't even able to deliver a single redeemable performance in their roles
1,and i really do not feel this movie could be better as i should have known that it would be as a bad movie,and as i said earlier they did n't have to take a lot of things like this movie to tell the tale of a boy
1,710 the only good thing about this movie was that it was so bad and it was not even good enough to make a movie worth,710 and this is what makes it so good it makes it a great film and not even the great fritz lang can make it
1,there are several scenes which could have been edited at least for me,there was a little bit of nudity and nudity throughout the movie
1,alan alda is good as a man who,alan rickman is excellent as the lead
1,produced with a sense of humour that is the story of the film 's success it also,produced with a very similar message this film does n't seem to work but it does
1,allen plays the villain who 's a cop in disguise who is a young guy but he,allen 's character 's life was more than likely to be the focus of his son
1,the movie has two different actors that have to do the script by james earl jones,the movie is about a young kid who lives with his mother after having sex
1,my favorite character was to see the first movie i thought so maybe my favorite is a,my friend and i were all watching this show religiously and i did n't watch it
1,while i have never heard of the movie i cannot understand why a lot of the people here,while i am not alone in the world the films have become a bit over the top
1,a young lady who is married to her daughter but a young woman decides to go to the house and get a,a few people like myself do n't think about how much of a waste of money for the cast and crew
1,i love the soundtrack in the movie,i think the acting and directing is bad
1,but there are a few redeeming factors but the,but it 's just not a good movie
1,if the film does n't have to come to the right conclusion it may be a bit biased,if you 've not yet seen this film you 'll feel it has been done by a bunch of
1,i thought i would get to see the first three movies,i would n't want to see the sequel to the film
1,that was just as good as i 've seen in a long long,that would be an improvement to a movie for the whole family
1,i was very impressed at the end when watching the movie the first time it 's,i love movies that were more enjoyable and entertaining but this is the most overrated
1,from a few good sources and a few of the best scenes you will,from what we are seeing we can see where the movie is set
1,while i do not understand why this movie did not receive any award nominations it was not only the first but i liked it,while this movie was released shortly later in the uk it is an original and original film that i will watch for years
1,the story line was n't all bad and the acting was terrible,the director did a good job of showing the film as a true
1,i do n't want to spoil this one,i did n't want to give any spoilers as
1,they were so poorly done as to be impossible and the story of what the original was doing yo deeds,they do n't seem to have much of their lines to begin the plot but the acting is so good as
1,the movie is set in the 1950 's and with its stark atmosphere as a film and at the time,the film starts on a train to be the first of a trilogy that was filmed in a very very small
1,this film has all the elements of a good movie the main theme is very unique,this is the funniest of it all because it makes me cry because i want more than
1,more than a few words and a few other scenes of the story of the film is a little contrived and it just does n't make sense the acting is awful and the plot is not all that bad,more than i can say with a lot of people who know this movie was made on dvd and they are all too fond of what they had and how the filmmakers thought that there are some great actors in
1,i am a huge fan of the original and i did like that film,i would suggest this film to anyone who has an interest in film history and
1,so if you were an open minded person you might,so this film should be called a comedy classic
1,it was funny seeing him trying to get,it 's really just a poor script
1,much of the dialogue is the worst of this film,much like these guys have an ulterior motive of the same
1,rarely have you seen this film,rarely have i been more impressed about
1,third is the fact he 's the only one that makes this one interesting and,third it 's a real shame that you could n't have a better story
1,definitely a good idea but not a masterpiece,definitely not as good as the earlier episodes
1,as for the film its only redeeming factor is that it takes itself very seriously to be very good,as with the story of a couple of the girls who run the same old school the film has the
1,this movie is a must see for anyone,this is another example of how many movies you
1,hitch 's character has developed a strong and caring,hitch is in a class of his own
1,for those who have n't seen it yet give it a try,for a film that is the story of the murderous serial killer on
1,this movie is an insult to the genius of the genre as much as i like,this film had some potential to work with but there 's not much here for that
1,though i'm not very sure to have this i do n't care about the character of the two protagonists,though it is not a good movie it will probably be a mistake for people who do n't like a
1,caan has a small part as his father 's girlfriend and,caan is the only good actor in the entire film
1,they do not want to take out and get them into trouble,they were n't even good enough to have a great cast
1,you 're not a big fan of the story line and the acting,you 're not going to miss the whole thing but i guess i'm not
1,but the problem is it makes the,but this film should be banned
1,i saw this film in the us back in 2001 and i was n't,i really want to say that this movie has no real qualities whatsoever
1,as if the writer could have done it better then this film,as an adult i could n't even find it anywhere to be an
1,for the first half hour of the movie the film falls apart from the start,for instance the characters are all onedimensional and the movie is supposed to be funny
1,it has been done for tv with so many,it 's a great performance by john goodman
1,because if anyone has the patience to do better than this piece of trash i ca,because this film was one of the finest i 've seen in my entire life
1,the acting and direction are excellent,the movie is based on a play
1,there are some funny moments but no one can,there is a little bit of humour though
1,if you are not a fan of the genre then you should check this out,if you 're the type of person who can see the world around him and the
1,this movie is about a guy and a,this would be an insult to anyone
1,this movie is a great example of what could have,this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,that is what happened but the movie,that is n't even worth mentioning
1,brenda blethyn does a fantastic job as a woman who,brenda vaccaro is absolutely gorgeous and a lovely actress
1,as i watched the movie i was reminded of the tv commercials but this was an example of how a good actor and a good script can,as the years passed by the movie the movie itself was a bit too long and i found the humor to be somewhat refreshing and enjoyable
1,i do n't remember so many people from the past like this one,i could not believe how hard the story line of this movie was
1,it is an insult to anyone that loves the movie,it was a complete waste of time and money
1,fortunately the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars out of 10 is because the movie is a complete mess,fortunately the director has to work on the task of making a film that is not even in his own midtwenties
1,as a former fan of british tv series i was able to see the new series as,as with most sequels he 's not a lovable heroine who just has one thankless character
1,so the first time he was about ten people were killed and he was the girl in a car accident,so many of you may say that it was just the movie that makes it unsuitable but in a way that
1,kudos to the director for making the most of what was going,kudos to anyone who has a soft spot to do that
1,the first 30 of the movie is a bit predictable but with an unusually creepy ending in the middle end it 's hard to tell whether some of the characters,the first 30 minutes i was expecting an excellent film i would watch it over and over again i could n't watch but it still managed to entertain people
1,on the surface he goes to a bar with a woman and her friend who just happens to know who is behind the scenes,on that level this is the worst film i have ever seen the acting is awful the dialogue is a joke the acting is horrible
1,maybe i just got to the end,maybe it 's the best performance that has
1,this movie is an absolute hoot,this is the type of movie that
1,he did n't even know it until the end but he,he has an excellent talent but the way he does
1,with no luck in life he becomes a real hero a good guy and a good cop,with her and her friends and they 're all in the audience to see what she is doing
1,but if the film is n't so bad it is good,but as is usual in this movie the script makes sense not
1,to be honest i am glad that i have seen the first film,to make a movie where the actors and actresses try to get some good
1,the movie is a little slow but that 's how it works,the actors were all excellent for a film of this vintage
1,the script was written in the same breath as the acting of the two leads,the first two scenes were promising to me the whole movie was just the same way
1,recently i read a comment about how it would be a great movie,recently i went in search of the movie the most famous and was awarded
1,it is a beautiful story told in the first of the,it is a beautiful little movie which makes you think
1,all the other actors seem to be on this,all in all its a really good movie
1,he has been given the opportunity to become a success for the whole film,he 's one of those who ca n't get his hands on this one
1,by the end you will have figured out who it was for,by now i do n't get to see it coming apart
1,the plot is a little thin and predictable,the first 15 minutes are pretty bad
1,bodies are not a big problem though,bodies are not always very common in the
1,jack palance and the late robert duvall are a real treat to,jack 's life is not about a group of two friends
1,i 've always been a fan of hers and this episode is not for,i had to watch this film because it is so bad its bad
1,the ending is a bit abrupt but that 's pretty much all the people say it is,the film is very good but the actors are good and the plot is quite engaging
1,you can see the end of the,you 'll be glad you did
1,i just did n't think it was worth that i could be,i could not understand why they did n't get that movie
1,are you really trying to tell him about his wife 's death,are the cops in the movie or in this case or the people
1,if you want to see a real good movie this one is for you,if you 're looking for a classic adventure film you do n't want to get
1,the film has many points in this movie that are not explained in,the film is so bad that there is nothing wrong with that
1,of course that 's the real problem but the film is a complete disappointment,of course the only reason i could watch this movie is to see a few
1,go see that this is the last of a trilogy of the tv series series,go see something else but instead of a remake of this one it is n't so
1,the movie starts with a guy who 's only been about to take care of a group of teenagers in,the script is quite simple and the characters are well defined and are not just a bunch of people
1,this is a great show in every sense of the,this is the most disturbing of all of them
1,a group of friends are trapped in a remote mine shelter,a few more people are in a coma with the help of
1,if you want to see a really bad film see a film which is more,if you 're going to try to understand this movie it 's very entertaining
1,characters are portrayed well and there are so,characters are supposed to be the characters
1,people with the most common sense have not,people have a problem with the movie
1,this was probably the only film where he,this is a bad thing about it
1,one of the best horror films ever,one can see how the first three men
1,his character is just so unlikable in its portrayal of him that i ca n't believe how this movie is ever produced and his name is a,his father has never really been seen and was killed by a werewolf and is in fact all that he knows of himself in the process
1,i am also impressed by the fact that there are no more scenes than that,i could n't believe they could n't afford more movies about a girl who had to
1,the main theme of the movie is the fact that it is a very long film and that,the movie does have a couple scenes which are so bad they could make it more entertaining
1,15 years later the film is not so good to watch as the original the second story was n't the only one,15 years later it would be a nice thing to have to take a look at them and make it clear that the
1,gwyneth paltrow gives a fine performance as the conflicted wife who has the courage to marry her and,gwyneth paltrow is a great actress and she was so good to see her in a movie
1,so if you think you have seen the movie you will be in for the ride,so much of the dialogue is n't funny and there are a few gags thrown into the
1,it 's a good movie that has a decent cast and if,it was so bad that it was impossible to sit through
1,i'm a big fan of the book but,i'm going to get to the end
1,i did n't even get a chance to see this movie on cable but i am not much a fan,i am a huge fan of his work as well as the actor in the title of the story
1,the ending was pretty much a carbon copy of,the movie 's a good deal of tension
1,yet it is not only the fact that he,yet the film is still a nice film
1,kudos to the actors and the actors that all play their parts,kudos to a few actors for trying to bring something together to create
1,a man who 's on the right track at what he thinks is his wife is a true story of a married man,a little too much in the end this is n't just a movie it 's worth renting but you wo n't find it anywhere
1,get it out of your mind and,get ready to kill the woman
1,it is also a very funny movie,it 's a shame because the whole thing
1,men are not portrayed in the film,men are n't in their 30s but their
1,peter falk is good as usual in every way,peter o'toole plays a cop who comes back from prison
1,i 've been a fan of the original,i was very impressed with this movie
1,instead we have a bunch of actors who look good together,instead it 's a very silly film full of lame dialogue and
1,the director has a few ideas which are quite funny,the only redeeming quality is that the movie is a bit
1,they are so obviously trying to put themselves off a map and,they all are not very talented and are very very boring
1,surely not all that great and the movie,surely the story is n't the same
1,in fact if you have n't seen it you,in a way they do n't look good
1,this film has all the elements of a bad movie,this is a great film of a true talent
1,she also was pretty good at this movie,she plays a nice guy but she looks so
1,during their stay of a friend who 's been on to some kind of a crime,during the movie i had no idea why the characters were so hard to see
1,it 's one that is more enjoyable in its treatment of the more controversial,it is a bit of a stretch at the end of the film
1,it just feels like a parody of the genre,it is the same story but it does n't
1,look forward to seeing him in a better movie than this,look like it might have been made at the beginning of the
1,also this was one of the most successful horror films of the 90 's and 80 's,also if you can sit through the movie it 's as if a tv crew has had a
1,the story is simple and simple,the film begins with the man being
1,great acting by all the main characters,great to see the movie and you will
1,anybody should go and see this one,anybody else thinks this is what this film
1,the script is so simple you ca n't help but,the script also has a lot of sex scenes
1,they all look as though they 're making a run of the mill film,they are just trying to make something that they are trying to find success for
1,first we do n't get a feel sorry and a little,first of all i thought this movie was pretty funny
1,not to mention the first thing that happened and how the hell this was filmed,not in the good sense but it definitely was a fun ride to watch
1,but there are also many moments where the director tries to do nothing,but this is a movie that should have been titled for it
1,since the film 's title was a little misleading we had no idea whether or not i have an interest in the plot of this film,since that film is about a man who has his own problems and he is a little too infatuated with each other and a love story between
1,in fact the whole premise of the movie is quite funny for a movie that is just about a group of people who have no real problems with their jobs or,in a way he has a tendency to make it through the process and his character is n't too keen to accept it without spoiling the course of the movie
1,this is a great comedy but not as good as this first and,this is n't a film it is n't a waste of time
1,the movie has a decent ending with a cliffhanger in the movie and you,the director should not have put a little effort to make it interesting
1,however the movie was n't even good,however this movie 's a winner
1,obviously they 've made some of them and that he was the best in film,obviously the plot could n't have been used as a metaphor for the film to be
1,an insult to those who were able to watch this movie,an example that was made in the 1930s in 1980 it was
1,check it out for anyone who was interested,check out the rest of this movie
1,so it 's not the worst,so many of them were good but
1,i am a huge david fincher fan and this one is a real treat to watch,i was really impressed with this film and it 's a shame that the story line is
1,even with a supposed budget of about a week or two,even though the story is not very good either the acting and
1,elizabeth perkins plays the daughter of the first woman with a little knowledge of the past,elizabeth shue as always is one of his best in the title role in a movie where
1,then again this movie has some good action sequences but the movie,then a new kid decides you can make a good movie
1,i was really surprised by the acting and the acting,i had n't actually heard of it and i do n't
1,the ending is n't too clever as,the ending is a bit contrived
1,it is a very moving and enjoyable film,it is a shame it is still on the
1,at least you 've seen that many times better than the movie,at the very least the film is so bad it 's good even
1,not to mention the fact that he did n't have a great deal of talent in character,not even a bad name can happen i do n't think this would have been more
1,written by a talented director and a director and some great actors i found this tolerable to be a bad movie,written in the first few minutes of the film you know that it is a good film it is not just the
1,rip off the cast are good and the cast is great,rip the cast the actors who were the main character
1,it makes you want a man to do his stuff,it has been my all time favorite movie ever
1,on the other side it just seems to be that,on the other hand it 's an excellent movie
1,so it would have been a lot,so i would n't say it
1,the movie starts with the same character and,the plot is simple but not interesting
1,but the movie is not so bad,but this is an awesome movie
1,emma 's character is very very believable the story has its charms,emma 's performance is so bad you would n't be able to laugh
1,the acting was ok but the script really lacked substance,the characters are n't very convincing but you feel their pain
1,bryce and his family move to the town to get them to,bryce and her brother are also the best in the film
1,i just wish to see it again,i do n't think so and i could
1,the first is the story of a young man named amir as a,the film also makes you feel for the characters in their lives
1,the main problem with this movie the acting that was very bad was the script,the film is an epic of the highest variety of the modern world war ii
1,but the script for this movie makes one wish that they,but the director has little of that to the genre
1,those in the cast and crew of the movie are not going to go into it,those are a few things but the one thing that bothered me about it was that it
1,i would like to see the original version of this film as a great series to,i love this movie even though i do n't like the way it 's used
1,the characters are believable and the story is interesting,the film is a comedy that is not about the
1,and of course it 's all quite good but for its budget this is a,and the movie is so terrible and so bad that it becomes unintentionally funny
1,strangely enough he was n't in the movie for his long and his performance here is very bad,strangely enough this episode shows how to make such a great show and to have the characters talk about
1,he 's a real man in a film,he makes no excuses to do so
1,i would be lying out to see a lot of the other reviewers have said that the show,i do n't know maybe this movie is too long for the masses with the right attitude
1,this was one of the worst movies of all times,this film has some very funny moments which is the biggest
1,joel everett 's role is not the greatest role that he would ever have ever appeared to play in this film,joel keith plays a somewhat neurotic and neurotic teenager in the middle of nowhere and we get to see an older actor
1,why the heck did the producers bother to make the sequel,why is it that the only way to make people interested is
1,the acting and direction is pretty lousy too,the only good part of this movie is how
1,keoma is one of the most original films of the last century and will never be remade,keoma was a movie in general as was a little risky to be made but the story is
1,one thing is this is a bit of an allout film,one thing that really does n't need to exist is the acting
1,for fans of the genre it may be the most satisfying aspect,for a film about a hitman who is a thief and the two
1,the story of a young girl who travels to the house of her husband 's lover played,the film follows a young boy who works in a mental capacity of a young boy
1,if you want to be a big fan of the original movie watch this movie,if you 've read the novel you will find you 'll see the ending of the
1,however the film is quite a complete mess,however the story is not as weak and the
1,some of the dialogue is stilted and it 's a bit silly because it does,some of the characters have a different feel than they are in the movie
1,but that 's all that is good about this,but the problem is it 's too bad
1,it 's a pretty bad movie that is quite funny as the,it 's really hard to understand why the movie was made
1,conversely this is the most beautiful film i have ever seen,conversely the story revolves around a group of college kids who are
1,quotes of the movie have no redeeming qualities about it,quotes of mouth and blood are never heard of the movie
1,but it 's still an enjoyable flick and i enjoyed,but then again i'm a big fan like this
1,laputa was nominated for a academy award for best motion picture for best picture director and director,laputa is a beautifully written story from the play it 's a simple little tale that has no
1,but the movie is n't all bad,but when there was the possibility of getting
1,on the surface side he has to choose between two men,on the night she meets a handsome girl named penelope in the
1,numerous people have been a complete idiot,numerous of the songs are performed as a
1,give this movie a shot if you are a christian,give up the acting is pretty much all round
1,but this is definitely the case with the poor people 's problems,but i do n't know the difference between the actors the two stars
1,the film is a complete waste of time and money,the story is a good one and the performances are great
1,maybe this was intentional to get an invitation,maybe he would make something like that
1,the acting and direction are top notch,the plot is that of an outsider and
1,donald biehn 's portrayal for his life of the movie is good and it 's hard to figure out why a,donald sutherland is a master of the craft in this movie a man with no conscience or a good hand
1,andrew jacobi is very good as the evil scientist who wants to help him find a way for his father to,andrew mclaglen does a superb job as a woman who comes to live to live with her aunt and mother
1,it 's like watching the film in the,it 's not even worth a watch
1,i think its one of the best films ever made,i had the privilege of attending it in a few weeks
1,gary busey plays a cop who is investigating an operation against a bunch of thugs,gary oldman stars as a young man who comes to find his wife who has lost
1,this is a movie you 'd want to own,this episode is a bit different from what i expected
1,the movie starts off with the kids,the film is just a mess
1,it really did n't quite deliver,it was a bit of a joke
1,hoyt dillman is very good and even a little too good as a bit of,hoyt yun grant did not work with all this material in the first film
1,intend to go for a big payoff,intend for some of the most famous parts
1,if it comes on the heels of the dvd i suggest you watch it with,if you 're looking for fun and the movie you 'll love this movie
1,also starring robert young christopher lambert and robert ryan,also it had to be the worst thing in the
1,ms ricci plays an aspiring reporter who takes her to her husband 's apartment,ms and a new boyfriend is a bit naive that there is a real deal
1,she is the only person who could have,she does not come to a conclusion
1,one thing to do that with the title was how many times in this movie you could see this film to a,one scene involves an angry man and his wife being tortured by his uncle that 's about it all as well
1,you do n't like this movie,you have to watch the whole movie
1,the ending is also the end of the movie,the story is simple and the movie moves slowly but
1,technically it 's a movie that is n't a bad bad movie,technically it would have been better if it had n't been a little
1,many of the scenes are very slow,many things are missing from this film
1,i saw this with my roommate and i have to be one of those,i have seen the first of the two films the best being in my lifetime
1,american graffiti is n't so bad it 's hard to believe this movie is a joke,american audiences will probably appreciate the finer approach to the american audiences as well as the characters
1,how the filmmakers and directors have managed to get out of these,how come the bad guys are n't even good in movies
1,the film was pretty accurate and the story kept me going,the movie begins with a young young boy who is the son
1,afterwards if i did i 'll just say that it will be my duty to a film like this,afterwards a lot of people who have watched is a bit of a jerk should have seen this movie
1,but this movie is a complete waste that i cannot recommend,but i was in my job and when she did i think
1,i just love the soundtrack and the fact that it is a film that was in the works of the actors that make,i do n't understand why anyone should like it or just have a movie like me in the middle of a row
1,our heroes are supposed to die but the film does,our heroine was killed by a man 's daughter
1,it is not even worth the money,it is one of those movies that should
1,as it turns out she 's been raped by the ghost,as for the ending which is the only reason it did n't
1,however the film has to be a lot of fun and a great time capsule,however a film that has no real sense of humor is the director 's intent
1,diane russell is excellent as the conflicted heroine in a small role,diane 's character gets into the situation with a very powerful but sensitive
1,the film has a very simple premise and is,the film is very funny and very funny
1,i was hoping i could get a chance to sit down and watch the film,i would n't have to rate a 0 but it did make me angry
1,jayne moore also plays a young teenager who tries,jayne moore is one of the main actresses
1,arthur 's character is a bit more interesting in the first one but,arthur lowe plays the lead character as he plays a young woman
1,it 's a shame that this movie was made by someone who does n't even know about it,it could never be the easiest movie of the year and the first three of the films the best
1,though i do agree that this is a great movie it just did n't matter,though it 's a bit heavyhanded and not really worth the time or effort i will
1,now that 's a really good move,now the movie looks very bad but it
1,and the movie was so good i did n't even realize it was a spoof,and it 's a great film especially on an important role in the story
1,who has this show to do,who are in charge of their ways
1,the acting is so bad it was laughable,the only good thing about this movie is that
1,think about it it 's the most hilarious comedy i 've ever seen,think a little bit in this film and we will not notice it
1,however they never seem to be able to keep their own lives so much as to take on it,however for anyone who is familiar with that kind of movie this film is probably the most entertaining one of
1,it is like a bunch of people who get to see this thing and get,it 's a great movie to watch and you know who the killer is
1,had this movie been done properly it could have been great,had this film been released theatrically in the last 20 years i
1,there 's a good reason why the movie works hard to categorize,there 's something to be desired about this movie it 's not that
1,all in all a great show for fans of,all that aside is really a good film
1,the only good thing though was the fact that the actors actually were n't there,the film is n't that great but the story is a little too convoluted
1,extensive and the film follows as one of those films where,extensive action is just not as interesting as it sounds
1,this film does n't have any of,this was a very good film
1,the film has a very interesting plot and a great cast,the first two episodes was the first episode i have seen so
1,almost as much of a disappointment as the movie itself and its message of the film is the,almost every aspect of it is great and i thought this movie to be an amazing idea
1,i have n't seen the original version,i 've only seen the first hour of
1,it 's not so much the movie 's story as the first and there is so much more in terms of its subject matter,it was a movie about the holocaust and in the same way that one of the major cities was so common with the japanese civil
1,another one of the movies i enjoyed was how the director wanted to be so hard to make fun of and,another example of the movie 's history was its ability to make the audience more uncomfortable in their own time
1,really bad movies from the 50 's this is n't really bad and is really not bad,really a great film with a very funny ending that i can see as a whole and a
1,i did not really get what she thought was her fault,i have read the books and thought the characters were a little
1,what made this so intriguing are the,what the heck was that about
1,using a very small cast to create a movie that has been so much in a few decades of engagement that it is almost impossible to accept,using the same director with the same name but the story of it was a very good one as it was made by a different director
1,theres the right amount of humor and suspense but it 's still a,theres a great cast of actors playing a game of their own
1,his wife and his friends are both killed and then they are forced,his performance is excellent and he does not disappoint as the actor
1,as a result the movie is a complete disaster,as for those who loved the book this movie is
1,no other than in the book the audience was asked to read what happened to the characters,no doubt the film had a good budget but that 's all you need for a movie
1,there 's nothing to be said about this film except it had a very good rating i,there was also a very good story about a very complicated relationship between the two men
1,i am in a minority where people are so disgusted by the way i find myself watching the entire movie,i was impressed with how bad and the movie was the director of the movie and i was surprised at how
1,i was impressed with this movie i did enjoy the film because the characters are so good and that,i love the fact that they are the ones who do n't do anything that can change them
1,at first it seems like the director was trying to convince us that he was the one and only,at first i thought i was just going to see the film but this movie was very boring
1,tim conway is a joy to watch,tim burton has created a masterpiece and while
1,the story of what we do n't know what is going on in the film in order for the movie to occur in a,the first one was about a guy who killed a woman on a cruise plane and was killed by a group of aliens
1,the first time i watched this movie was the last 30 minutes or so of what,the film is just one good shot and the other in a very flat manner
1,primarily this is a movie to be avoided at all cost,primarily as a vehicle for films about an alcoholic man and his
1,to quote it is a very funny film that 's funny and very funny,to get into the story with the two young boys who have nothing to do
1,ebert 's rating pg13 rating 410,ebert said they were the least responsible
1,the story does n't need that much to be found in,the acting was very good and the writing was superb
1,i do have to say it looks better than this,i really wanted to like the movie but there are some
1,everytime watching this movie it feels like something you 're getting into,everytime a couple of women are killed they just decide to stay on
1,in a movie that makes you laugh and,in this respect for the big time
1,damn good for a laugh at a laugh,damn it is n't a bad movie
1,when i heard of the film i was impressed by it and i really liked the first half of the movie but it was n't even that good or even interesting,when you are not a kid and you 'll be happy you 'll get the chance you 're not getting bored or just do n't care how to see a film that
1,i thought that the characters did not care less because they were so well established and were not in the,i think that if this film is made a little more subtle and realistic than i think it is
1,i had n't checked out the movie in other comments,i think that the movie is just a very good story
1,i saw this movie in theaters and enjoyed it a lot,i have never seen anything like this before but the first half
1,there are a number of great things,there are some very strong aspects
1,the plot is ridiculous and it 's impossible to suspend the disbelief or care about anyone involved,the movie itself is a mess and it 's all about a woman who falls asleep on her
1,i did n't care for either so much as i wanted,i 've never had a movie built up or down
1,supposed to be a spoof of the classic tv sitcom 'the twilight zone' was the worst movie i have ever seen but far far worse,supposed to be the most boring film it 's ever seen by the people who were n't watching a movie or film that is n't the
1,unlike a lot in recent years and it 's still a very enjoyable film,unlike in my first movie you know where you 're the next elwood says i
1,one thing i would do is the acting,one of the few movies i have seen i
1,those of us who have seen this movie have never,those were my very first experiences with this film
1,there 's also one of the best soundtracks of the last mimzy and the final shootout with the old ladies in this movie,there is only that there is no suspense and that makes up for the lack of action and lack of any suspense
1,one of the best in the history of film,one of the best movies i 've ever seen
1,his acting was superb as well as the rest of the cast,his father had an affair with her daughter which is an important point
1,what 's great about this film,what made it so good was that
1,i have heard the title the author and it 's a wonderful film to say the least,i saw this film when i was 11 and loved it for all the reasons that the movie
1,these two men are pretty good although i am not,these two films have a different feel to it
1,david is a great character actor,david lynch and david o selznick have
1,the characters are just so lame and the story that the viewer is,the director and producers have a very good idea with their characters
1,i do n't want to say anymore,i was surprised when i saw that
1,of course it is true that the people who are making it seem they do n't do that,of course the only reason he chose to do it is to make some kind of sense
1,a lot of the acting is not,a very funny and humorous film
1,quite simply put this show is one of the greatest horror movies,quite funny but the only real cohesion is its central theme
1,the film 's title is as good as it was the film makes no excuses for such a great score,the cast of all their names are a little iffy for their respective portrayals and they are given a chance to
1,usually i'm betting that the film has been so much of a joke for me,usually i like movies which i think so much fun and a little too clever
1,some of the scenes in the movie show are so fake,some of the action is pretty well choreographed and some of the
1,they do not seem to have a clue,they should have stayed in that category
1,the only one who has an obsession with the girl was the fact that the only one who was really good was the bad guy,the plot is simple to say the least and it makes some of the scenes look like they were just filmed on a small budget
1,i thought this movie could not be anything like what you 'd expect from a good story but it,i do n't know if the writers would have seen this a few years before the first one
1,worst of all if you do see the movie you,worst is a way to make an enjoyable movie
1,ok so there 's no plot,ok we 're not going to be
1,pitt has never played a better villain for a while but he 's really good here he gets a lot,pitt was in it for the rest of the movie but he was just as bad if not better
1,it is an important point to the entire story which is not entirely in this film,it does make us want to know how to handle a movie with a sense of hope
1,and the ending is so lame to me that even the dumbest film of its,and for the record it just did n't take anything away from the plot
1,i think it 's just a good movie i hope that someone will,i have not seen such a good film as i 've seen
1,there 's a bit of a twist ending in which the killer is revealed to be killed by an alligator who escapes from that of his wife and finds it,there are some very strong scenes but i ca n't recall them and the story of them is so stupid they are all very stupid not to mention they were a
1,there is a bit of a lot of nudity and gore in,there is nothing wrong with watching a movie about two people
1,we have n't seen any of these movies,we can see that a film with a better
1,utter nonsense but i have n't seen a single preview,utter unadulterated rubbish that 's probably only a few
1,indeed it 's the only good thing i have,indeed they have a lot of funny moments
1,probably this is the first movie that i have seen,probably the director should have had a better editor
1,the film follows the story of a man who is searching for his son a woman to be played by his,the only character worth mentioning to the film is that i did n't even know the characters at the time
1,did this mean little kid in the dark city at night was very different from,did it have a few seconds to make a good movie on the imdb
1,henry viii has no problems with this production,henry fonda is a joy to watch and the
1,but the movie is about as boring as it gets,but then we are asked for the final shot where his
1,it is so bad that it could cause a movie made as a parody for the screen,it 's just that bad and i did n't expect the movie to be as bad as it
1,i think it would be better for a few laughs but it 's still a comedy,i do n't understand why the people who wrote this crap are either a little disappointed or
1,rhonda mcshane is a joy to watch,rhonda fleming is the only one who does
1,it 's a very good movie and i recommend this movie for anyone wanting to spend the entire movie on a date,it 's an interesting story to get you believe in the characters that are supposed to be funny or the film works but
1,metropolis is not only about love but about the way in,metropolis is a film that should be seen by many
1,he is supposed to go on to win but a,he 's so good and he 's not funny
1,even the action scenes are not the most exciting thing on the big screen,even though the story is rather predictable it really has little going for it
1,drawing a copy of the novel is an insult to the first film,drawing her up as she does is just an interesting movie and has been
1,yet they should have done more damage,yet it 's so funny i just could
1,and i have to admit that there are some great actors in it which were n't the same as in,and the story is that the girl gets lost in a car accident and has some very interesting issues
1,when i watched it i knew what it was,when i was in a theater and i did n't
1,there 's a lot of gore in,there is a lot of action
1,the actors are n't bad and their actions,the only saving grace is the cinematography
1,he 's the best thing about it and this is not one of his best,he plays a character that is supposed to be a very good guy but it 's
1,the plot is a mess for kids,the movie opens with a young woman who
1,the first time i watched this i was not bored in the,the main actor is a talented actor who can be forgiven
1,what is the point of making the most of this,what i liked about this film is that it is based
1,unfortunately that did n't work because the story was so ridiculous it actually got a 3,unfortunately the movie takes some risks to get on and they all do nothing but stand alone
1,just to see the light touch of the scene where the girls in front of the camera were on the floor the car accident was done in a way that was n't funny,just as they make the story of the movie a big part of the film is that the director is a filmmaker and he 's able to make a great movie for everyone to
1,murphy seems to have a good deal to make but it 's hard to believe the film is made of a real threat on his life,murphy plays the role of john huston a successful businessman and his wife is a little too concerned with it he is a man who has been
1,it was n't even bad enough to be a waste of two hours of my,it 's a movie of some kind but it is not without the problems
1,the movie is a true story about a man who loves to hate it,the main character is a good guy and a lot of fun and interesting but
1,this is a very well done horror film with a very good soundtrack,this film is an insult to both the intelligence of the characters
1,he plays the kind of character in this one and you feel like he 's going to win an oscar for his portrayal of the character and the plot,he is just about as convincing as the rest of the family of a family and their kids do n't have much to do and the script calls them
1,more like a play in the book this film was directed by david,more than an hour i had a chance to see this film
1,after the initial success of a film this frothy piece of work i 've seen the,after that you see the movie that you 've ever seen in a horror movie
1,through a few flashbacks the film is a complete mess,through the opening credits and opening credits it seemed quite a
1,i do n't think the movie did so,i do n't know why but i was surprised
1,it is one of those films that you just,it has a good plot and great acting
1,with the exception of the first two thirds of the movie in that regard i was excited to see it 's,with all her usual talent there 's always a chance to be more than just a bunch of random idiots
1,this is a film which i enjoyed,this was the type of film that i
1,i could n't even get into this movie,i would like to see the sequel in a
1,al pacino stars as the evil killer hunter from the future to a secret agent 's secret agent,al pacino plays a good guy but not the kind of guy that just wants to be a hero
1,ferrell 's character is a little irritating and the character who 's always supposed to be a real,ferrell has a very good performance as a drunken thug at the end of a long monologue
1,another thing that really struck me was that this film would have been much more interesting,another one was an attempt to make the movie a success a snapshot of the original
1,and the story line was so stupid,and the rest of the cast is pretty
1,this is a pretty good movie,this is a very well acted film
1,the acting was superb the directing was excellent the script was great and the characters were so engaging and believable,the film is not just a simple documentary that is set in the united states where it is not a typical
1,sublimely the film was made and directed and produced by an excellent film composer like the director himself and the actors by john wayne and john wayne,sublimely speaking and often dull it is the fact that the entire cast are just trying to make a movie in which the actors are so bad they
1,no one was actually going to be the kind of person i would watch or heard about,no one 's a little perturbed by the end so i suppose the movie had the best of
1,dan aykroyd has an excellent performance as the villain who does n't look like,dan aykroyd is perfect as the father of the young and loving wife
1,who 's the boss in the movie,who would have made this a classic for
1,a very good film from the same director 's company,a lot of scenes are very good as well
1,as i said before the movie is pretty much a parody of the whole thing that i 've heard so far i ca n't help but laugh at it,as to the name of this film i think that the director was an ambitious writer but it is obvious that the director has not written a novel to the
1,the film 's title is misleading it was n't that easy,the film begins with a group of young men who are in
1,what makes it special are the people,what the best of the movie
1,it does n't get a good note of the quality,it was the only good thing about the movie
1,a man who had been a jerk on a,a little more exciting but not so much
1,in fact the only redeeming feature of the film is where some of the actors,in this case the writers should have made a sequel with a similar story
1,in a movie i would love to know that it was made as a movie i thought,in the end it is n't a bad movie but at least not as bad as the original
1,dames is a woman who loves to be happy with the life she has been experiencing,dames the movie opens with a woman 's head being strangled and the girl of the story
1,if they 're all the same can be said about the whole enterprise of the movie the ending will probably have a sense for what is going on in the series,if you want to watch an intelligent film on the western side with the english civil war do not expect much from this film than it is a very good movie about
1,this is not the case with me,this one is the worst of this
1,this movie has a few things you can say about this movie,this is the type of film where people feel a little uneasy and
1,but the movie is a bit boring,but this is still a really sad story
1,none of the characters seemed to know how to play characters or situations,none the less i felt that the whole thing was just pointless and pointless
1,his wife 's husband dies at the end when,his performance was pretty bad in this movie
1,it seems like every other scene was just a vehicle for the actors to show up at the movie 's camera the next,it 's the kind of thing that makes an interesting picture about people and the world is not a place to do
1,i have seen this movie many times and still laugh through it,i could go on and on about it but that would be enough
1,curse of the zombies is a great film for the kids and for those who,curse of the wererabbit is a masterpiece but not a good movie to watch
1,but i am so glad i had n't bothered i do n't want to give,but it is one of those so called and it is not even bad
1,i have yet to see another one and this will always be my favorite show,i would recommend this to anyone who wants to be able to get to see all
1,however it is still interesting how these two guys go to a new generation to be,however when the film is about to be the worst movie i have ever seen
1,it 's a movie that i could n't wait to see if there were any other,it seems like this one was made with some great actors some of the best
1,from there the film becomes a lot more fun and fun,from there he 's a real guy so he takes a few
1,it 's very good and it is so bad that i cannot say much about,it 's a great movie for you to see in the first five minutes
1,one of the biggest problems with this movie is it 's the lack of a plot,one more thing is that it 's not a horror movie it 's a bunch of other
1,there 's a few things going on here,there was one scene where he goes from a
1,i was hoping the whole thing had been just a bit of a stretch,i love the idea of the show as a whole not just one
1,throughout the rest of the story the film is very short,throughout her scenes there are no laughs whatsoever or so when a
1,the film is a lot less interesting then the sum of its parts,the only reason for the movie 's success is the presence of one of
1,carole landis plays the typical annoying girl who does n't wear the same outfit as she has,carole lombard is also very convincing and gives her character more depth than any other character can come
1,newly realized it 's a movie with the usual exception and a bit of nudity,newly shot is the story of an aging girl who lives in a small apartment
1,i do n't know if he had to make,i would n't have made the movie better
1,twelve years later she has never been a child and is n't only one of the best,twelve years earlier and his wife in the end realizes it is a murder by numbers
1,this is probably one of the most boring movies ever made,this movie has the same kind of thing it can be seen
1,another thing i noticed is that there was a little more effort than to make a feature movie that i,another example is that this is an action film with lots of sex scenes and some really good stunts
1,the acting is awful the editing is awful and the acting is bad,the story line is pretty basic and it 's really a pity that some
1,it 's the only one of the three,it 's just that it is n't that important
1,it was very enjoyable to watch this movie,it is a real treat to see the film
1,in a short run the camera is in an entirely different location,in short he is a pretty good actor and you can tell he
1,stephen is a very strong person,stephen chow is a good example of
1,captain john steed is the leader of a group of outlaws in the us who is responsible for a war,captain gadget has been released to prison to help a friend that will keep at the resort of one of his
1,by the time the movie ended we were n't even sure exactly what was,by the time you watch a movie you just wo n't care anymore
1,shirley moore stars as a young woman accused of murdering a wealthy girl to find an old lady who has taken her,shirley maclaine plays the husband from the beginning of one of the best films you might possibly find in your collection
1,the film 's main problem is that he has to be a very unlikable person who 's trying to get away,the director 's intent is to create an atmosphere on the audience so that it seems like it is n't
1,there were no real heroes or real people and the story,there 's a very good line between the two leads
1,i 've never seen a more romantic love between the two characters,i do n't mind any attempt at humor but a film that has
1,see the light and the beast the wind the legend and the lion,see it for yourself and you will not enjoy a good thing
1,and as the movie progressed it ended abruptly in the last 20 minutes,and why did n't i just go into the movie expecting nothing else to
1,i'm sure you 'd never have seen the man who killed him in,i'm a fan of these great films and i liked the acting
1,and i do n't mean it 's a bad,and of course they all were killed on
1,all of the action sequences are great and,all of this would be an insult
1,yet i did enjoy it immensely,yet for that reason the film would
1,i was very happy when it was released,i do n't know how it ended
1,the story is so stupid that even for a movie it 's not really interesting,the characters in my book are all very unlikable and i would n't consider myself more
1,they had been doing so many and i would n't be surprised if i do n't say anything about the movie that much was said,they have to give the actors credit for giving us a lot of fun and this movie is a perfect blend of black comedy and comedy
1,a must see for everyone who enjoys the idea of the original,a film that has some interesting characters to watch for a laugh and
1,so i decided that you would have,so do n't waste your time
1,they were very different from the other shows that the,they should have used some more time and more
1,the movie is also very well written and has a great story,the ending was so bad i had to watch the entire thing
1,the story is simple to begin with,the film opens with a bunch of young
1,its not funny it 's not funny but i thought it was really,its like watching the rushes of the original film from another guy
1,this is a story about a man who is obsessed with her,this is what the filmmakers think in that scene where the camera is
1,maybe it has been a mistake since i was in the service of watching this movie,maybe it was that the first time i saw this i missed the first two thirds of
1,rgv 's portrayal of the innocent is great,rgv is a great actor but he looks pretty
1,this movie is a complete mess of mine and not worth it,this was one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,it is one of those films that you can take the seat from your seat and beg for a big knife,it could have been interesting for me to say that the actors were all excellent but their characters seemed completely forced in
1,often they just do n't make sense,often a bit preachy but that 's pretty
1,the movie is n't that good but it 's worth seeing and i wo n't even say i 'd like to know,the story is not even good with this one and the script is very weak and is n't even remotely entertaining
1,as such this is a great show of the late '60s,as it was the series was very much more interesting than its
1,you have an idea that is very similar to the film it 's a horror anthology,you see all the people who have flown the earth to make the most better movies out
1,the whole movie is just a bunch of people,the music is n't as good as the sound score
1,the film 's title is pretty good at all,the only redeeming qualities here are the supporting cast
1,it is also nice to see a documentary that shows the struggle and determination of those who are the people and who we,it is not a movie that does n't take itself too serious and it is just so hard to accept the movie
1,it would be a shame that such a film has such,it makes you wish that more people would find them
1,consequently the filmmakers are just trying to make a statement about the,consequently it also is quite good to make a decent film
1,the script is a bit over the top but the story and the performances are really great,the only reason this movie was so good was that it was n't released in english and released
1,well this film was one of the best i 've seen i 've seen,well let 's just say that this movie is n't one of those
1,perhaps this is a really good movie,perhaps it 's just the writing of this
1,it 's the first time i think about the ending,it has everything a good example would have been
1,so the movie was a complete waste of time,so it has to be said that i was n't
1,glean from a very funny scene involving the fat man 's daughter i just felt that this movie was made at any age,glean from a lot of it and you can say it was one of those movies that you would never really get a chance
1,the story line is n't too bad,the main reason for this disaster is to
1,also the music was pretty good too,also it 's a movie that you will
1,this time he tries to be funny,this film is so poorly done
1,his acting abilities in this movie and his performance is quite good,his brother is killed by a woman in a car which she escapes
1,at the end she says to a stranger that,at least it was a pretty enjoyable movie
1,kathleen turner had a very similar role in the movie but her acting was not very good,kathleen barkin and william cameron jr give the most convincing performances here and they 're all good although
1,dum is in an element and a chance to see him,dum 's character 's personality and the plot line really are quite
1,this movie is one of those movies i have never seen so bad it has to be the worst movie i have ever seen,this is a good thing that the bbc have made in the past decades and it 's not the only one with the same amount
1,the acting as far as the male lead actors as they 're concerned are not really good but i found myself enjoying the movie,the film also feels like a cheap movie of a high school drama and in a way it fails to make the characters sympathetic enough
1,traditional american film critics and this movie is the definition of the genre it 's not,traditional and exciting and i can appreciate the film as it 's one of my favourites that
1,marion davies is perfect as the matriarch of the group and they keep in on her,marion 's character is played by eric roberts who also is the daughter of a young woman
1,i would like to see more of this,i saw the film in the first place of
1,his father is a doctor who is sent on board to find,his character played by a man is supposed to be funny
1,in all honesty this is not a comedy,in short it was the most satisfying moment in
1,this is another movie which is a classic,this is the first movie i have seen in
1,let 's not forget that i have no clue,let 's give it a ten star rating
1,bergman 's direction has been used for quite a while for the viewer but i ca n't believe,bergman and his two men make him the most sympathetic figure he ever met in the film
1,this is a story of an evil,this was one of the best
1,yeah i know that it will appeal to everyone in sight but i ca n't understand how it was made,yeah i do n't care if the film is bad or not but i can understand why so many films are
1,however after the first halfhour the film just goes downhill after the opening credits roll in which the,however when the movie came out the trailer the movie was about to come to a conclusion
1,this film made me a little uneasy at times,this time in the future a few years back in
1,people have the audacity of making a bad film,people who like movies like this one can relate to
1,he 's supposed to be a comedy but it 's just not enough,he was n't just the one i was going to have heard
1,i saw a screening of this film and it is so bad it is good,i thought the movie was great and i liked it a very very very very very
1,the script is a little stilted and the acting is so awful that i ca n't think of any good things about it,the movie 's story line is about the lives of the inhabitants of a family and reconciliation to be found in a community of
1,but he does n't make it like that,but what was that was all about
1,the film itself is a little dated in the extreme,the movie looks like it was shot on a train station
1,the only positive thing about this movie is that we can see how they all are,the plot is n't too good at least the acting in this was pretty good
1,everything in this film is just terrible,everything from here is a little heavyhanded and
1,the only problem with this film is its lack of depth and motivation or any other film,the whole film was so horrible and so stupid that i thought this is the worst of the
1,fx are a few examples of an early,fx and music are a bit overdone
1,and it was not for all tastes that were made,and in the process when the woman gets killed by someone
1,leading man with two daughters to a t was a great actor,leading to the death of his wife the husband 's wife in his
1,publicity is the type of movie that makes no excuses and has a huge reputation for all its shortcomings,publicity of course is that he could have used a better job to have some better actors for some of
1,it does have its faults that are n't funny,it was just another movie where i would go on
1,a woman who is so upset is that the mother 's father is killed by the ghost,a group of friends go to an abandoned cabin to investigate the planet and find the earth in
1,posey is a very good actress,posey also delivers her best performance
1,i 've always enjoyed it for me and i have to,i am ashamed of myself when i saw this film
1,a great deal of the dialogue is just as funny as the first,a lot of people seem to disagree that the acting is terrible
1,i 've always been a fan base myself,i have a feeling of contempt for the filmmakers
1,although the film has been edited and shot in the middle of the film it is still an enjoyable watch and a wonderful film,although a lot of movies seem a little over rated in some cases or some of the worst scripts in history i have n't seen
1,on the other hand i would have liked to have given the film 1000000,on all accounts i do not recommend this movie to anyone that loves horror movie
1,in other words he did n't have a lot of talent and talent for,in the movie there 's a little mystery going on in the movie
1,i have never been a big fan of the original,i would n't bother to tell you the truth
1,after reading several other reviews in his summary he 's a teenager at first and he is n't exactly a gay male,after an hour of torture and the wedding i had just arrived in the theater and it seemed a little rushed
1,it 's an odd premise but it 's a very simple film with the occasional sex scenes that made it a,it was a good idea that it had the same premise and that the characters are n't fleshed in either
1,i'm afraid i have a hard time figuring out how,i'm sorry but for my mind this is the worst
1,the story is so bad it 's unbelievable,the movie opens with the meeting of a man
1,to me one of the best films of the decade,to sum it up this movie was so awful so bad
1,therefore it 's really hard to tell which it was,therefore he is not a coward and this is a real
1,if it was a comedy or a parody of the genre it might have worked better as a short story,if this film had come off as a good action movie then the producers would have to have had an iota
1,unfortunately i 've been warned with the story,unfortunately the film lacks substance for that
1,yet this film has a good score and it is worth it,yet it 's so good that i could easily have taken a shower
1,as the credits rolled this was the first of the three films the movie has,as for the rest of the cast they just seem not to have made up for
1,while at the time when i was about 12 i 'd been waiting for a movie to get on my nerves,while this film has a few faults and its a bit cheesy it is still one of argento 's most beloved films
1,i do believe that many viewers would have thought the ending would be much,i could n't believe this was a tv film but i did it
1,he has to be one of the funniest films since he and his cronies have a,he 's trying to get rid of the old man who is a good guy
1,score and the score it 's a,score 4 stars out of 10
1,with the exception of the director 's direction the film was really a big disappointment,with a more recent look and a better script and directing it 's an enjoyable little
1,a few days later it is a great deal,a good cast is wasted in this movie
1,the director should n't have been able to make a good movie on all fronts,the actors are excellent as they have their chemistry as they come and go
1,the film does n't do that much with that it 's a bit of a stretch though,the director of this documentary has the right sense of humor the script is so witty and the
1,alice 's father is a true artist,alice the oldest boy was killed and the
1,it 's a pity that they made a sequel to this one,it 's a pity that most of you think that you are not
1,1956 is no longer the greatest of all movies,1956 is the most famous film that i can remember
1,by that point we all come across a movie with a long drawnout,by the time the story starts the film is a complete failure
1,when you consider this as a movie you do not watch the film till the end credits roll up to your own,when he is confronted by a man and his son his friends decide to get his son back at the airport
1,i was impressed and excited as to how to get the full enjoyment of the film to have a little plot,i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto international film festival and i loved it it is very enjoyable at the very
1,just because the whole idea that this is true is the way it was made,just as many things have been said and done by the director 's own camera work
1,however after watching the movie a few times you will feel sorry for the actors who are,however as you 'd expect the plot is more complex than the characters in the book
1,i have to admit that i did n't feel for the actors at all,i am a lifelong fan of this movie and i have a suspicion that there
1,all this is done in a very very dark way,all of the actors and actresses did one thing
1,fonda and his two buddies play their part very effectively and with their presence and likability,fonda is excellent as the tough guy who seems to have been rejected by the police and
1,i have to say this is one thing that is so boring,i love this movie even though it does show its story
1,powell and sullivan is superb and they do an excellent performance,powell 's character is so good that he 's given an opportunity
1,the only thing that makes me feel was to laugh at how dumb the movie was,the plot is that the director does n't want his imagination and it 's a lot more
1,after the war and the first war film that,after the movie they were going to die
1,as for her being a little more than a bit of a bitch i think that,as a matter of fact it is n't the first time you see the film
1,all of it is in one place but one cannot be faulted,all in all i 'd recommend this to any fan of any fan
1,in addition to that many people have commented on this story that is n't,in the end this film was the worst film i 've ever seen
1,as a matter of fact one of my friends,as it stands it still gets a lot better after
1,the movie starts when in real life we learn,the plot is interesting the costumes are good
1,of course the whole thing is shot in one location and filmed,of course the story 's characters and the acting were all fairly good
1,it is also a film that i enjoyed more than one occasion,it could be a little more subtle than any of those i 've
1,nonetheless he did it with a lot of people with the exception of a very talented director to be a good,nonetheless the movie is really quite boring and it has a very slow ending with no resolution and no plot
1,i think the filmmakers would have used the story as it would make an episode more interesting if it,i did have a soft spot for this and i am still a big fan of the show
1,one of the best movies i 've ever seen,one thing was that in the book there were many
1,i 've always thought this movie was a,i love the characters and their characters
1,it is a complete waste of time,it 's really bad because they are so
1,since he 's a jerk or an artist he knows the answer,since it was released and released on video i found it to be
1,plain boring and boring movie which is,plain good acting by everyone involved
1,the movie is based on an historical event of the same,the characters are all interesting and the acting is flawless
1,but that 's a minor flaw in this movie,but for a long time it really gets a real
1,i do think it 's a little too sentimental but for my money,i really liked this movie but i found it a bit confusing
1,usually we see an attractive couple of actors who are very convincing at being very,usually i just thought that the director had just a few things going on
1,this is a pretty bad movie to watch at some points,this is a film i have n't watched as seen in the
1,based around him and he is not so well known to begin it also does n't work but in this case he 's a big,based on the life of a young woman the film is a bit too short but for a horror thriller it 's well done
1,the film is very long drawn out and does n't seem to have,the film takes a bizarre turn from the start to the end
1,it is a bit long for this film and a bit too much to think about,it 's not the worst movie ever made but it 's still a lot of fun
1,i do n't understand why it is so bad because it 's a good little action flick with lots of action suspense and a plot,i have to admit that i'm betting if that 's true he 's so bad he has not made it on his way through the movie
1,picture is an action thriller with plenty of action but the rest,picture this one does n't make much sense of the book
1,maybe if the story was n't so simple it did n't have any surprises,maybe she should go into some type of role or perhaps she might not be
1,oh and the music was very good and the music was excellent,oh my god what the f 's got the most annoying movie i
1,so many of us have n't seen this movie yet,so i guess the problem is that the movie does n't
1,this could have been a much better movie if a few things were left out,this movie is an insult to all of us who are not interested in a movie
1,comical but not in the right way,comical moments like the old woman getting shot
1,the plot and plot are all a lot better than the movie,the script is not very original and the acting is terrible
1,but then again he has a great sense of humor and this show has its moments that,but the story in my opinion the best of course the movie is n't the same
1,unfortunately the film has the same charm as a few of the other films which the film is still a little overlong but still it is enjoyable,unfortunately it is a very different kind of film the kind of films that have been made at the time and that makes it more enjoyable as well
1,whatever i do n't believe is the,whatever you do see the movie
1,though the story has some interesting twists the dialogue is so lame that i could n't help it,though not the best i have seen to date it is definitely one of the finest of all time
1,man on earth has become a cult classic in many ways including the aforementioned,man this film is the real worst of all that it is that bad
1,before i get a hold of a film about a serial killer and the snowman i thought it was a bad movie,before they continue with it it becomes a little bit silly when it first is released theatrically on a whim and a couple
1,it is a very moving film,it 's also an interesting story and
1,the film is set in the united states which is quite a feat,the acting is bad except for the fact that all the actors are pretty
1,of course it 's a big problem,of course there are several elements but this
1,so what a waste of time,so he is in the army and
1,this is a movie that has been,this was just a horrible movie
1,thankfully it does n't come close to being a good movie and,thankfully the acting is quite good but the writing is awful
1,this film has some funny parts but one,this is n't even a b movie
1,i was lucky enough to have watched this movie,i have n't laughed so hard since bestiality and i
1,against the odds the director chose to make a film with a budget of about it,against the backdrop of the movie the plot is quite intriguing and the acting was solid
1,if you want to get away with the movie 's original language is not,if you love good movies this is definitely not one you should watch
1,another great scene is his wife and then the two guys go out and find,another thing that is n't in the movie is the music by robert englund
1,this is a movie that i would recommend and as it is the only one that comes close to being a,this one was about a couple of guys who are invited to a mental institution and try to find love
1,the director 's name is very clear,the script is weak and the acting is
1,why did he want to kill her,why is there an opportunity to have such
1,my advice is to skip this one,my advice watch it to find one
1,and i thought it was a really bad movie,and if anyone has n't seen it you wo n't
1,this is not a typical movie that i thought it was so poorly written and acted that there,this film has so many twists and turns that its the only good thing about this movie
1,and then the camera zooms on,and there 's a great cast of
1,driving home is a movie about love romance and love,driving along with a few things is just bad
1,on the plus side the characters are likable and believable,on a side note i could see why some of those
1,basically there 's plenty of time in which this is not a movie,basically it 's not an excuse to watch it alone and you wo n't
1,then i saw the previews at the end and thought it,then they come back in the middle of the desert
1,i saw the trailer and i was expecting to see it all the way through,i was very excited at the ending but i had to watch this film to find
1,i do n't know if i could have,i could n't have been more wrong
1,although the original was a good movie the original was not very original,although the film is quite a masterpiece the story is fairly interesting and its
1,i did not like this show because it was so bad,i 've seen a lot of movies in my life
1,this is the story of a woman who,this movie is not a perfect film
1,and it is a bit of an,and he 's a great artist
1,it seems that a couple of people have been infected because this,it 's also a very enjoyable movie that i think of
1,we get to see the two sides who have been separated by their son to the point that their daughter died,we 're told that she has to be the killer but she 's a woman who is supposed to kill someone with
1,that was pretty much the whole point of the film,that 's the movie that you 'll watch in the first
1,a woman with a name she is the first person,a good idea to give the movie its inspiration
1,the movie starts the movie of a group of teens trying to save a car crash in,the movie 's first half hour is just dull as the story of the story unfolds
1,i 've been looking for this movie since the beginning of the movie,i would not even bother watching the movie the way they did
1,but for the first 30 minutes i was n't ready what the hell was there,but when he arrives the film loses some steam and is in the background
1,his performance in a film made by a group of,his friend does n't seem to be in it
1,the main character is in his prime and it 's not for everyone who wants to see them,the story follows a man named larry who has inherited many people who have been killed and the two
1,i do n't want anyone to go to a movie like this because it is not so,i do n't know much about his work for this movie but he was in it
1,they are not funny and are not,they were not really that funny or they
1,well i was expecting the best and that is the first,well it has a fair plot and some interesting characters
1,with the exception of the two leads and a couple of supporting players this film 's plot is n't that important either,with the help from the two men on the train it 's a pity that you ca n't go into a movie like
1,the music is wonderful and you can relate to what the music was like to hear from the era that was made,the plot is a little farfetched but there is a lot of great action scenes and the final showdown with the main character
1,i was hoping the film would get better but it was only worth seeing,i would have preferred more from the filmmakers because it was just too bad
1,if you have seen the movie i do n't think they are making a film,if you want to see a movie you 'll watch with you and enjoy this
1,the director should stick with the director,the film is an insult to my eyes
1,the plot is so simple that it makes you think you could make a movie,the story follows an important story of how a man of war could go
1,her son played by david niven is not just an,her mother is n't happy to know the truth
1,some have said that you will want,some of the scenes are funny
1,take a look at the acting in the,take the time to see this movie
1,a woman who has a miscarriage for her own life and tries to save the life of her father,a lot of people have complained about the plot to see the film but there are no surprises or any
1,all it 's time is how it is n't so easy to believe that the actors did a,all these actors were in a movie that i did not recognize and they were n't bad
1,this is definitely the most powerful film in the collection of the,this is the one thing that makes a movie even worse
1,i was so disappointed that i could n't stop watching the series,i really enjoyed the acting and the directing of this movie
1,the only redeeming feature of this movie is the soundtrack,the movie is not that good but a lot of people
1,we do n't see him in the role of,we do not get to see the characters
1,florinda is a little naive but not a total loser,florinda sivan 's masterpiece is an amazing piece of art
1,2 the story is about the adventures of a,2 of 10 and that 's about it
1,this is one of the worst movie movies i have seen in,this would be a film for the young kids to enjoy
1,everything about this movie is bad,everything in a movie about a young
1,he seems to have an obligation in the film to make a character study and he is just plain boring,he was the perfect foil for the title role that the movie had to be made with great actors
1,born in the middle east this is a very good thing but that the director did n't,born in the uk it would have made a better movie like this to have been
1,michel legrand is the perfect actor who can be proud of his work as a filmmaker,michel vaughn as a doctor who was trying to solve the mystery by the crime boss is
1,this time it 's in the film,this is where all the shortcomings of the
1,this film is a total waste of time,this is a pretty good film it 's pretty
1,if you have n't seen this movie i strongly recommend watching it,if you really want to see some funny stuff you must see a
1,widmark 's portrayal of the man who seems to,widmark in the movie is an excellent actor
1,while this is n't exactly a true story in which it is presented and it makes the movie even more fun it is the same as the,while the movie is a little slow the whole movie seems like a bad copy of the original and i guess i had n't seen it
1,the characters are all believable and the story is well written but the main flaw with this film is how they,the first scene that makes me laugh was the song with the dancing of the song sung by george kelly
1,i am still searching for my face in the theater,i have seen a lot of movies but in this movie
1,the plot is very simple and the acting is very poor,the acting is not great but the characters are very good
1,some say the movie has a little twist ending,some of the scenes are just not worth mentioning
1,one of these shows is just to see and then it 's more of a documentary than an,one can only hope that the next one will not be a cult film in the future
1,for those who do not like this movie do n't read the book if,for starters i was surprised it was n't as good as that first
1,going to a lot of trouble,going to the big screen with a
1,those were the only exceptions of the movie,those who have n't read this might have seen
1,the film starts to feel as though a bunch of,the movie was a good one at the time
1,just do n't expect the same kind of humor a great,just look for the good old acting or bad acting
1,yes that 's all i have to say,yes and i 've seen some really bad movies
1,long before it 's all done up there 's a bunch of people who have no clue why they want to make a movie,long before i could n't figure out how this film could possibly have been a success i 've watched it in several directions
1,i thought i would be able to watch this as soon as i read the other comments,i would not go into detail and spoil the movie for you which is not a spoiler but
1,vann the film has a wonderful deal of humor and is a perfect mix of comedy and drama,vann also plays the role of a doctor who has a good idea of himself and his friends and
1,the first time around for a very good reason the movie was made and i could feel the need to warn others about the story itself,the story is very simple and makes a great movie and is worth seeing even for those that like the music but to be entertained i ca
1,i have n't seen the last broadcast,i have n't read any of the other
1,scares arise from the plot and i ca n't imagine that much the film has so many,scares are not a dime for anyone in the audience as it 's all of them
1,it is also a shame that most of the actors in this film are either,it was a real challenge to watch a film and not a good one
1,some of the supporting cast are very much in top form,some of the things are really good and the movie just does
1,lewis is a great actor and he gives a great performance and is also very believable and believable,lewis milestone who also directed the film in the sense of a script a young lady who was involved
1,she has no reason to go to war and if she did n't have any other choice he has,she 's a pretty woman with her own hair and looks as if she 's in the background
1,i do n't have a clue what he is thinking to be,i was expecting a lot more from this movie and i really liked
1,if you are a fan of the series check out the other parts of the series,if you 're going to make a good movie then go ahead and take it
1,i do n't know that i was able to obtain more than a few words of but,i thought the acting was great and i thought it was the best performance on television
1,the director is a master of the classic style and the acting is superb,the acting is n't very bad although it is a bad thing that some of
1,i'm glad that they were allowed to make this one,i'm not even a little uneasy about this movie
1,drama is n't always a good thing to start with but this is a good movie,drama the story of the young man who had to do a dirty goose trip into a
1,it is also a film to watch if you have the opportunity to,it is the only movie that i have ever seen of this
1,well done for the good and bad movie i give this movie a 410,well you 'll have to watch this movie for all to think it is funny
1,in the case of the film i was a little confused,in a way this film had an interesting plot line
1,or maybe a more coherent performance would have made it much better,or not to be a little more subtle as a comedy
1,they had just done that in spite of the quality of the acting,they have n't made the same mistakes and the same applies to a story
1,for me there was a lot of potential,for me this is a beautiful film
1,recent movies were not meant to be a masterpiece but that is n't necessarily a thing,recent years of the film 's release and the last mimzy is a film with little more
1,april allyson is not a great heroine,april allyson is a revelation for a person
1,just do n't expect any of the jokes in it,just for those that like this show that 's a big
1,it is not a bad movie,it could have been a lot funnier
1,believe it or not i liked the way it was in this film,believe me it is a waste of the actors 's names of our time
1,other than that the film is very good,other than that it was a complete disaster
1,you do n't see any of them,you can tell the actors were trying to
1,this was the worst movie i have,this is a pretty funny movie
1,i'm pretty sure that most of the acting is bad,i'm gonna write more and more about the characters because i
1,i have seen the first two episodes and i do agree with them in some very different context,i have n't seen any of these movies but there is something about this that 's not all that
1,i did n't see how it was made to take a breath to it,i do n't think the writers cared too much about what they 're attempting and
1,this is definitely a movie to watch and i recommend that you watch it with a open mind and,this is the story of the president of the united states to be called the evil in vietnam
1,i would have loved to know what to do if i wanted to watch a movie on tv but there were few good ones,i think that the director of this movie was a genius to watch with the lights of the camera to make us care for the
1,i think most people would be happier and i have a lot of,i have to mention that this is the best anime game ever
1,the first half hour of the movie is pretty dull,the acting in my opinion was good as well i was
1,all the characters are good enough but their acting talent was a real asset,all the way through i was not surprised how much the music sucked
1,bugs 's labyrinth is a truly bizarre psychological thriller about how the man was,bugs bunny in a cameo appearance is a perfect addition to the genre
1,inside your own life in the first place the film starts as one of the worst movies,inside of a few times he 's not a very bad actor just a bit stiff
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen,this film was made for tv and it shows that
1,and i was so impressed when i watched this movie,and the story is so boring that its not even funny
1,parker posey is a bit more subtle than she usually is,parker and a group of thieves that are on their honeymoon in
1,and of course the film has some similarities to those of,and the ending really is very bad as a movie
1,the characters are so interesting and so,the main characters are the same
1,as i said this is a movie i wish for more reasons for it and that,as far as i can get through i 'll never ever watch this movie again
1,my favorite episode though is that it is a true example of a sitcom that is,my favorite wife was a very very sweet woman she has made me relate to
1,it is also a film that shows how to shoot a few feet,it would be hard to imagine a movie to make a good film
1,no matter what it is and you do not know,no one wants to be in a different way
1,rent this movie and enjoy the film in your own way,rent this if you have to see a movie or two from
1,i saw a clip of the film at the toronto international film festival in the late eighties and had heard it was not going to be one of many great movies the story is as follows that has been changed but that i can think of a better movie if,i do n't know what a person who likes films this way the bad and the ugly but i just do n't understand how this movie ever made me think it did n't have a chance to be a comedy but instead it 's a complete waste of time
1,kathy bates and barbara parkins provide excellent support as well as they are in the audience 's favorite movie,kathy fiennes and barbara hershey are just wonderful in this movie as one of yo 's best roles
1,flex and company are both a very different entities,flex and others are the same but the same is
1,it was just stupid i mean that the movie actually makes the film watchable,it really is a shame it only lasted for six minutes and the movie could
1,gee the acting is awful and the special effects are terrible,gee the title does contain some kind of a plot twist
1,i 've seen this movie and it was pretty good,i think that 's the way it got going to hell
1,recently i 've been looking for a film on television to watch for a few nights,recently the show goes with all the usual clichs of the original movies that are just as
1,i ca n't understand how much i enjoyed it so much,i was in a trance that could have done more damage on
1,he is able to get a good deal of trouble to get his hands up to him,he and his cronies are in the movie and they are all in love with each other
1,for the record this film was a disappointment,for those of you who want to see a
1,this was n't a great movie but it was very entertaining and it is,this would have to be the best movie that i have ever seen
1,there are some good points to be found in the film,there were a few moments which were very funny but this show
1,i have n't seen the original and i think it was n't as,i have to admit that i do n't like a good movie
1,this film should not be seen because it is a,this film could have had a lot of laughs
1,it 's just as though the film is set in a new mexico city and the people in the town get involved in this movie,it 's so obvious that the film is n't really funny and the only one is that good in the first place the acting was bad
1,there 's plenty of blood a la la a few,there was nothing funny about these type of movies
1,was it possible to take the story at any,was n't the movie a bit more serious
1,if you like movies you have no idea what this movie is,if you like the movie this is definitely what the best directors do
1,i do n't really believe the hype would describe a film,i have nothing against the movie and this is certainly the dumbest
1,as it was i was not impressed i was looking forward to a few of the other reviews and it was almost impossible to,as far as the acting goes the movie is a bit off kilter but it has all the elements of a great movie
1,the only redeeming feature of the movie was the cinematography,the acting is horrible the characters are awful and the plot
1,it does n't really have that much of anything that is good about it,it 's a real treat for the younger actors to come out of the ordinary
1,on the other hand it was very bad and the plot just plain stupid,on the other hand the film has nothing new to this production nor does it
1,unfortunately it 's still a very good movie,unfortunately it seems as if they are trying too
1,i did n't like that movie but was just a little bit too late,i had never heard about that one of the other reviewers who were so disappointed
1,it 's about a bunch of teenagers who get involved on a big,it 's not just the movie itself that is n't very funny
1,i do not understand the plot and the way i am in this movie,i have just bought the soundtrack for this film and was very impressed
1,even though we have the first 2 seasons of the series a series of episodes of,even if you like a movie with a few twists you wo n't be disappointed
1,there 's one great scene about the whole film,there 's a lot of nudity that is n't all
1,good luck to see a film like this,good story bad casting and the lack of a
1,but in the case of this movie it is the kind of,but i think that 's why the story is so predictable
1,sure there was a very interesting theme,sure it is the best in the world
1,it was so bad that it was n't very funny,it 's a pretty boring show that makes a mockery of
1,the script is pretty good but is not quite,the film is not for kids but it is worth
1,i think that there were the usual flaws to make a character 's character a martyr of sorts,i love how i saw this movie when the first time i saw it it scared me in my
1,he just did n't have it,he 's a little too tough too
1,the film opens up a bit long and it does n't seem a tad contrived but at the end it 's not enough to make this so,the movie is not as good as you would find in some of these films but it is definitely one of the funniest in my life
1,they all come up for the last and last of their escapades but they 're all,they do n't need to talk about what it means to make it a good movie
1,an excellent actor in the film and a good movie maker,an excellent example of what a good cast do they are doing
1,after i saw this i thought it was a,after all this film is a perfect movie
1,then we see him in a big car accident,then we have two sisters living as well as each
1,it takes some time for the viewer to suspend disbelief as well,it is n't that the filmmakers have no idea about the characters and
1,the first half of the film is just a vehicle for the action,the characters are not well developed although not particularly good is the acting by
1,dee snider is one of the worst actors i have ever seen,dee snider is a real star and is very good in his role
1,in the first episode the actors are not really,in short this movie 's a total disappointment
1,is this supposed to be a comedy about a woman who,is there anything that can take me into watching this
1,surviving in the present with that one is a huge bore,surviving on a high note of how the director 's career should
1,katharine alley and his young daughter are the stars i do n't know,katharine 's husband is one of the most beautiful and beautiful actors ever put
1,the movie follows the life of a young woman trying to cope with her son and father of some,the film has an interesting premise that the director had no idea what it was supposed to be
1,will the world save the day of the year,will you see any of this film or have it
1,and it really does n't make sense,and i have no problem with the fact
1,that was not even hinted at him at all that he had been able to get,that was one of the things i loved about the film that i loved it
1,now it 's an interesting idea and a good deal of fun,now i would n't be surprised if she said she is n't
1,that was the problem with the movie,that 's how this is going to be
1,and it does n't work because the director does n't seem to have enough time,and the story of a man trying to find a family and his wife
1,altogether though it has been done for a better life,altogether the movie is a bit too slow at times
1,just like the original you can see what the director of photography should like and he does n't have a clear vision or a flair,just as the plot was the only thing that kept me interested and the story was so stupid that it was n't even funny
1,this is a very bad movie that is so bad that you just cant laugh at any of it,this is a movie about how a young teenager named patty can become the first person to do the right
1,on the way to the airport i was a little puzzled about the movie but at the same time i did think that the movie was going to be great,on the other hand i can only assume that the writer made the mistake of having a bad script after the first twenty mins or so of the movie
1,there is nothing more that is true,there are only 3 films out there with
1,it 's a pretty bad thriller but it 's just so boring,it does have a certain edge to it that is not the reason
1,still i have a copy of my own and my favourite movie is the one where the director,still the film is a very good example of how a film is not to be forgotten
1,another thing the music in this movie is very similar to the film the film is also,another thing i can say is that the whole thing was so bad in every way
1,the cast did so much in their roles i was surprised that they did not have,the only reason that this movie has been released is because of the subject matter
1,on a trip to the small town in the city the world is plagued by a mysterious virus and some of the best,on that level of luck it might be an excellent film if not more than a little stagy but its just as good
1,or when the two girls are chasing the guy they 've killed the entire time,or the fact that this is a movie that you have n't seen in anything else
1,war of the worlds is a very good entry in my opinion in the end when i 've seen a,war of the sith is a movie that should 've won awards for best special effects and the other
1,man is it really something that was n't funny,man this is the only movie i have seen where
1,i have to say that i have a problem with the film and it is so bad,i think the only reason why this show is in the end is because it has been cancelled
1,okay it has all the potential for a good film,okay maybe this was meant as a horror movie but for
1,so this is a very poor film,so what do they really do if you
1,this one really should have been a good movie,this is not a typical horror movie that is not
1,despite what a very long time it has to do with the one the first two thirds is the best,despite some problems that make the film extremely boring and generally the action scenes seem to be very very contrived but
1,it has so much potential and the only thing that makes it watchable is the fact that you can see every episode where,it is like the writers of the film were reading this script in the book so they said it was a movie
1,the acting and the dialogue are horrible to the point where they are completely annoying,the script was so bad i actually felt embarrassed for the actors who were at the
1,the ending of the movie is very well done,the only reason why i watched this film was because
1,but the film does not have any story,but i do recall it 's a real stinker
1,the only reason why i watched this movie is because at the,the cast of the movie has to be a lot better
1,believe me i would 've had this movie,believe me i would n't bother going through this
1,although you are in the same room as that is the case in this film,although this movie is a bit of a thriller its certainly not one of the better
1,the script is a complete disgrace,the only reason i went into the
1,tequila is a story about three young guys who are,tequila was the worst thing ever committed to film
1,great acting and a great script,great job is n't all of the
1,i love his character played by a very young robert duvall,i have n't even seen this at the beginning of the movie
1,i was lucky enough to see the movie and i never felt so bad for it,i was surprised to find myself saying on the radio show so this film should have been
1,reportedly he is not only as a child he does n't do anything,reportedly the movie is so bad that it can be hard to believe that
1,a young woman 's love with a young woman in a family home,a good movie that is not even bad on a sunday night
1,one of the best things about this film is how it deals with the problems of the american people,one of my favourite scenes in this one however is when they are talking about the death of a kid
1,insert the title of the film with some very,insert the same amount of humor and pathos
1,i just want to give this movie a 3 because of its technical flaws,i thought the character of lilly was a bit too unlikable and i would n't
1,then he is a little girl in the beginning when he,then there 's this one which has a great ending
1,although i have a strong opinion of the film it 's still very interesting,although we have not been a big fan of musicals i have always enjoyed this
1,it has all been set in the united states and,it 's not that i really like the movie
1,it is like the producers got together from behind the camera lens,it had its moments but was not really an original story
1,for that reason the movie did n't even try to be funny enough to make,for a few scenes i would have liked to have just seen the film
1,they 're so very much of an excuse for a lot of scenes with scenes of the hero,they were all so bad that they would ruin this crap as it has a great deal
1,how can someone please do n't let a fool get the title,how to make a film out of the story is n't necessarily a
1,this film is a must watch,this movie was so bad i could
1,la the bad guy who is always at the end of the movie is just plain awful,la and behold the main character who was in the first movie was a young man in a
1,sandra bullock is a fine actress who can do much,sandra bernhard is a real star in this movie
1,it was so bad i was begging my friends to watch this one,it 's almost impossible to watch a film without sacrificing your patience to the
1,but i ca n't complain that this was the only decent,but in the movie 's a great deal of time
1,on a side note i had to see a sequel that does n't,on my personal level i would highly recommend anyone watch this movie
1,without doubt the most exciting film ever made,without spoiling all the great quotes the movie was
1,overall the movie is a good movie,overall a decent movie especially to the last
1,my favorite character was the one in which she was in the hospital with her father at a local bar and who then has the same scene,my favorite is the scene of the film the last nail and the scene where he is supposed to be a man and his father but is so
1,almost as if the makers had decided to create a good movie and decided to try and make some good movies,almost every character is a stereotype of a family member and the son of a man who wants to become a father
1,unlike other films i have n't seen this in such a long time and it has been almost,unlike most of the movies they were made during the 1930 's it was quite well done
1,i was looking at the dvd and a number of scenes that showed me that there would be a,i was also impressed with the movie for the first time in its original release in the seventies
1,there is a great deal of humor and some great music,there is n't a whole lot of blood there is some pretty
1,and if you 're interested in a character like i do you will have to see it to find out,and if anyone who likes movies is the worst of all then is in the same genre as the first one
1,in fact i have to say to many other users that it,in this film he is the best person in the movie
1,the acting is good as well,the characters that were in this story
1,this movie is like a home movie,this show is the worst show of the
1,i have watched this film for the first time i loved it so much i was so scared so i have to see it,i do n't think anyone is entitled to it so much in terms of the fact that the movie is n't very scary
1,he 's not only the most annoying of the,he did not want to make a sequel
1,it 's not even unintentionally accurate the viewer just sits in disbelief that he was going to die and he was so stupid that i could n't help but laugh and laugh,it 's a story about a bunch of teens who go to their destination and are invited to investigate a house and then to escape their dreams from a haunted house
1,i'm a big fan of musicals with a few exceptions,i'm glad to have a chance to see it again
1,maybe the worst is the acting and directing but this is one of the better ones,maybe this film has a great deal of humor or a laugh track on the way
1,the movie 's premise was very thin and the story line was weak,the movie had a lot of things going on for a story
1,first of all i have no interest in the characters and story which means nothing,first of all is it is obvious that this is an early talkie film
1,the only redeeming feature of this movie is the fact that,the acting is superb and the writing is very believable
1,looking forward to seeing him in this movie,looking to resurrect a woman who is supposed to
1,also the film takes itself seriously as a very good and funny satire on its message of life,also the characters do n't know what they were going to do when they were on the beach or
1,the film has an unusual and unique look,the film is quite different from the earlier film
1,when the two young actors are killed in one scene it 's not as though,when the movie is over you 're in for a rough ride to you
1,perhaps that would be interesting to say the least because the movie is just bad enough,perhaps she is a little too much too far and too much of a threat to me
1,the film was so much more a comedy that it could have had a much much higher,the film is a complete failure to watch but i would have given it 2 stars
1,make up a little bit of this,make it a very realistic movie that is
1,i love this movie the first it was the first film i saw from,i could n't believe it had n't been so bad in that film
1,i 've seen this series as well as it 's predecessor,i 've seen some of her other stuff in which there is
1,i saw this movie on the sundance channel and it is a shame that it had only the last 20,i think the fact that the movie did n't even have so many problems is not even worth it
1,fatty is a fine and very interesting figure,fatty bakula is a very interesting choice for all
1,there were a couple of funny moments but that made it an enjoyable experience,there are so many great lines in this film that i was surprised to hear
1,i was hoping to see more of the kind of work of the great garth marenghi but the movie would never end soon,i am not an expert who just like the music and i am not listening to it i have read it and do you
1,ok so i ca n't help but compare to the first movie,ok i know that there are some great movies that are so bad
1,i have nothing more to say because it 's just so bad the script makes it sound like there are several other movies out there that are n't so much better than that,i do n't really believe that he was supposed to be dead and it was n't until the very end of the film that he really did n't know how to get out of
1,how can she go after the girl she has never,how does a man from the future react with
1,however this is the one that can bring back the message of the movie as it has many points but it is a very good film and in the end it is worth seeing,however the only thing that keeps me watching is the acting the plot is so bad and the plot is so ridiculous and so lame it 's impossible to care for anyone involved
1,if you can manage to get it into that you wo n't want to watch this trash,if you 're going to make a movie about the evils of religion or history of its subject
1,despite being so bad i thought this would be pretty fun with the right,despite the rather sluggish nature of the story the acting is pretty bad
1,everything i have heard about this movie,everything seems to go on and on and
1,of course i do n't think i 'll be able to suspend the disbelief but as i am bothering to give the audience a good,of the whole film i could n't have done more with this story and all i know of it was made on a shoestring
1,i'm not going for the same reasons,i'm not saying there 's no story at
1,these include the most famous scene of the movie which is one of the great,these scenes in particular make you jump in your seat during the entire movie
1,those that have read the book were n't really expecting this to be as good as the book,those who have seen the original series have a lot of time to come to the story
1,all of the women are beautiful,all in all a must see for
1,kaye has no idea about the fact that he,kaye is also a real jerk for me
1,the plot has been done by some of the characters in the past but then we get,the plot was a little thin but the movie is good as the plot moves forward
1,there 's no real suspense and no tension to any of these scenes,there are plenty of movies that are really bad with awful special effects and
1,and it 's not that the movie is bad,and that was the reason why i did n't like
1,i would highly recommend the movie to the fans to be honest and if you have n't yet you 'll be,i do n't really care how anyone can make a better movie but in this case this is the worst
1,his character is just as much of an experiment as in the book,his portrayal of his father is that his father is an evil man and
1,early on that he had his own family at a school meeting he knew nothing about the story,early on he is asked by the doctor who had the money to make a movie so let alone
1,we get a glimpse into a bunch of people in the middle of nowhere one day and then they are forced,we never heard of him and he begins to suspect he 's going to get a life of his own
1,the acting by the whole cast is terrible,the film seems very good with it but the
1,it is about a man who was born but his brother died in a time that was n't,it was so bad i just wanted to slap myself up and then get hooked to it
1,the movie is n't for everyone,the film is a visual experience on
1,darkly this is the one of the best movies i 've made this summer,darkly he is also given his character and the plot is so contrived and boring
1,you 're supposed to be a bit of a fan of the genre,you know it all just to end up being a bunch of things that
1,the director and writers of the novel also manage to make a movie,the characters seem shallow they have a little of an annoying script
1,of the other films of this period are the ones they do,of course he is still a hero and the same man who had
1,at least in spite of the fact that the plot is somewhat interesting the,at least the first 30 minutes of this movie are really well directed
1,the acting was good as we all know from the beginning i thought that the movie was,the film was shot in black and white with the exception of the very early seventies
1,also the ending is not all that good but it was a very good movie,also the movie looks like the first movie made by a cheap tv crew
1,this movie is a must see,this is n't a bad movie but
1,simplicity is what makes this film so good,simplicity is a major flaw when we see in
1,also the characters seemed to be in an old age group of,also the movie has one good thing to it the acting
1,the movie is filled with the usual array of sex scenes that should make you laugh at the violence,the film is a bit of an hour long but it 's a little more fun to watch
1,even as far as i'm concerned you would n't want to watch it for yourself,even for some good reasons a little bit of a lot of people have to sit
1,if you 're looking for some sort of adventure film i recommend you check out the original,if that is the case then you have the idea of a serial killer stalking people who have
1,being so impressed by the fact that they are actually trying to get out of,being a huge fan of the original was my favourite movie of all time
1,a lot of the scenes are just not enough and there are,a very well made film that really does n't need to
1,what you could do with an interesting cast was not necessarily the problem but this was all a big disappointment,what we get to get is something in the movie that does not make it good to make you think that
1,still she 's not exactly a bad actress in the role of the woman in her early years but she did n't,still it is one of those movies that is so funny you 'll think a movie like this should be released
1,let me start by saying that i have not seen this,let 's see what the characters do in the end
1,into the plot is as predictable as it sounds and does n't seem to,into the world of the film the movie was made for the screen
1,i ca n't believe i 've actually watched the whole movie and i do,i was very bored and i saw the film and was quite surprised
1,although there is a great deal of talent and the film,although he is a great talent he has no talent
1,actually it is an enjoyable film but it 's not really a horror movie it 's a total waste of talent,actually the story is about a young woman who tries desperately to save her mother but it seems that everyone is the
1,mitchum is the ultimate hero but he 's a very bad director,mitchum 's character seemed a bit too cocky to be a comedy star
1,aside from some great visuals there are no great sequences and no way out redeem them all,aside from this i think that it should be a film that is meant to be a classic
1,upon arrival she meets her cousin and they start to lose interest,upon arrival in the morning he begins to lose his job
1,what can he do when he 's talking about that man and how much he,what i saw was a bunch of people who could barely see their roles
1,i ca n't understand the difference between the story and,i really hope this movie gets a wide release
1,liev howard as a man who gets to play a,liev schreiber is good as the timid old man
1,their acting was just plain awful,their performances are great and this is
1,i have never seen such a film since i was young i was very disappointed with the director,i was looking for a movie with subtitles that could have been so bad i would have to sit
1,he is a good actor but the film looks like a bunch of friends are trying to be a little different,he plays a straight man who 's a jerk who has n't been driven by a man who has been in prison
1,and of course this is not what happens but it does,and the ending of this film was just as stupid
1,nothing more than a series of skits for the audience to get in,nothing special just is n't it a film that will appeal to the fans
1,so when you can watch the movie the,so what 's the point of this
1,granted she was a good choice for herself in the first movie but the fact that the character of the movie was in the film just was n't likable enough,granted the plot is n't the same to the same standard but the story is n't really original it 's not as simple or interesting as it could 've used
1,seriously this movie is a stinker that makes,seriously that 's not saying too much
1,there is a sense of dread at the beginning that the audience sees as the main attraction is as they go through,there is a way to keep us awake but in a very satisfying way it just makes a good horror movie
1,besides this being his very early and short career his own career is a bit of an easy task of his work,besides the fact that the script is based upon actual events the film is about a young boy named erik who has to
1,the music is a mixture of two different moods and it shows it to the audience it is a bit jarring in places,the film is set out to explore the aftermath of what happens between the two and there is an underlying reality in which the
1,in the first of the three bourne 's episodes of this show the characters,in many ways it is a very well written and well acted drama
1,he has a very good voice,he makes the film even more interesting
1,but the worst movie of the year it has a good,but the whole thing is n't really bad just bad
1,when i went to this movie and it was n't too bad i did n't even know where,when i say the acting was so good that the audience laughed like that at a theater
1,an american film that 's not afraid,an excellent and very interesting film
1,the plot was so lame they were all just too predictable and not believable enough to carry it,the whole thing was a complete waste of time but at least that was pretty common ground
1,leslie nielsen plays detective jack wilson a former cop who is arrested with,leslie nielsen is one of the most appealing actors i 've seen
1,this was one of the worst movies made up in the 90 's,this movie has everything you love about horror movies like horror flicks and horror
1,now the only one that really really made me think to make a movie that had me thinking was that it was made in the us,now that i have read the book i will never be confused by the ending but i will have to say something like the story is n't
1,to see this film i would highly recommend seeing it for the first fifteen minutes in the film that i,to be honest it 's hard to make this into a movie with any real plot and no action
1,in the end she does not have any of,in this film it 's just plain dumb
1,he has a lot of sex in,he was not a real artist
1,it takes a different direction for an action film,it would have been better if i had n't seen
1,the story is quite straightforward and the characters are so believable and very believable,the movie has a really creepy story of how the grinch has been the hero
1,i could n't wait to see the whole thing,i do n't know if that 's why this movie
1,this was an excellent film to watch and enjoy at first glance,this was really the last movie i saw in a theater of this
1,the acting by this is very good especially considering that i saw it at least a quarter and so was the second time around,the first 15 minutes in this film are very interesting as we learn a lot about how the us and how we go to an
1,it had the power of being a masterpiece,it is a complete waste of time
1,and i think that you 've really really got an oscar,and as such it really takes itself seriously and does n't make
1,he has a great sense of humor,he gets the girl in trouble
1,we had a lot of people who did n't get the chance to watch this,we all know that the film 's biggest advantage is to be an accurate movie and
1,this was probably the stupidest sequel i 've seen in a long time,this is a good documentary and one of the better films that i have
1,and why could the director have a camera that just is n't believable enough to be interesting,and in the case of the director he should not be the person to make them feel like
1,anything this film had ever had been made,anything in this movie is worth seeing on tv
1,however it still gets more serious and better,however a lot of us was treated to a
1,the director must have just watched a few weeks with the two girls in the movie,the only reason it got a 2 for me is because i had a chance to view
1,90 minutes into the flick it just becomes apparent that there is nothing going on,90 minutes into the movie i was really looking for my brain and i could see
1,sea to kill the man and it is not,sea commander 2 goes on to bigger things
1,a lot of the other comments on this movie,a good actor was wasted in this film
1,puta is a very interesting movie,puta 's score is as bland as
1,i think it 's the best animated series of alltime 90s,i think they had a bit of a budget for their work
1,it is the story of a rich man who was in his job,it was not funny nor anything it seemed to be a joke like in
1,this is my favorite show ever,this is definitely a movie you can
1,but this movie is a must for any one who,but i have no idea what to do here
1,she was n't a total wuss,she is very good as always
1,colbert is the only one who has to face in his mind as the story unfolds,colbert as her character is so beautiful that she ca n't sing as her character
1,the only reason i went to see this movie was,the whole story is a bit of a joke
1,also there 's a reason for making a bad movie about an evil cop in the form of a zombie and an,also a few laughs at some of the jokes in the film are really cheesy and the acting is pretty bad
1,in one moment this movie takes a while for you to take the plunge down memory lane,in fact if it 's a remake and it will be available on dvd in the us
1,yes there was one great part but the,yes the plot is n't bad either
1,it is a film that i would recommend to all ages,it would be an enjoyable film for the most part of the
1,the story revolves around a young couple who get the death,the movie opens with the girl being kidnapped by one of the
1,overall this movie is n't a bad film as it 's not very good in a sense that most of the other movies seem to be in comparison,overall i do n't really find the way i felt it was to get any of the plot from the book or the characters or the actors
1,when the movie is released i saw the movie at that time and thought that it sounded great and it got better and,when you 're talking about it you 're going to enjoy the film that 's the whole point of watching this movie
1,as a fan of a good book it is one of the best and most interesting films,as a viewer who did n't get this movie it 's a complete waste of my life
1,reluctant the film has a bit of good luck to it 's own but that 's just it,reluctant to get the money of a bank ticket to the house he does n't work in his new
1,this movie is a complete mess that makes it hard to stomach the,this show is the most boring scene ever put on the screen
1,i saw it in the theater when it was released and that the story was not the only good part of the movie,i could only imagine that the people in this movie are n't trying too hard to make us laugh out loud with the words
1,interspersed with the worst editing the film is so boring it hurts me to say the least with,interspersed with a couple of characters you get a real sense of what the plot should be
1,for those who get into the story this movie is just like it has something to think about,for instance when the first scene is set up a bit and the story is a bunch of characters
1,it was a waste of time and money,it 's all about the acting and the writing
1,i could see it coming from the director because,i would not recommend this movie to anyone
1,a few people in town would find the movie very funny,a few years later it still gets the point across a certain
1,i could n't even watch this film because it was very poorly executed,i have read comments on that statement and i was shocked that when i
1,there were a couple of funny jokes but,there were many good points about it
1,this is a good film but it 's not as bad as it 's predecessor,this is one of the most enjoyable movies i have seen from the director in my
1,in this episode it 's the same movie that was on tv but i was,in fact the movie 's main drawback is that it has nothing to offer
1,understanding it is one of those movies,understanding why it 's so good
1,smith 's character is not a bad actor but he makes us laugh for a moment that he just keeps the character of himself in the audience right from the beginning,smith plays the role of his son in a great supporting role and his acting is so good and so convincing that it could have been much more if his character had
1,the director did a great job with this film,the plot is a bit hard to follow and a
1,surely the only redeeming feature of this production were,surely the film 's plot is pretty boring
1,all of them are either so boring or they could easily have been,all the elements of a good film are present in the film
1,it is not about the subject of the film,it is an excellent story with excellent characters
1,to be honest it was n't a good movie,to the producers and producers of the film you would
1,but he is the only one who thinks he loves the kid and the fact that he 's been around to be,but the most memorable scene in the whole film comes when it goes to show the true side of it all
1,looking at a lot more i like the movie and i liked it,looking at the way things change and do the characters and their relationships with
1,though the film is n't bad it is just awful,though the characters are all likable and the story is interesting
1,in the end this is just one of those movies where i would,in that film i could have done a lot with the script
1,the music was also good at least it was n't that good,the plot is simple and has a lot to it but the characters
1,patrick carrol jones plays the part of a lifetime leader to a small town who is trying,patrick dempsey who was n't in his early roles did n't seem to fit the line
1,i think the best thing about this movie is that she 's got a great deal of talent to make the story,i did n't think anything about this film was really really bad and so much that i could hardly believe this
1,the only good point was the song that was sung by the band in the background,the movie does n't have a lot to do with the original story but the acting is
1,it is as if it was written by a child as a joke,it 's just like someone 's dream and a bad film could have been
1,shepitko 's version is a bit much of a comedy but it does n't do much with the plot,shepitko makes one of several films that does n't seem to be very subtle and is very very very very
1,in the process he gets to be a real star but he did n't have anything to do,in the beginning of the movie he is a loner of a kind of corporate government but he was
1,one more thing to say was that all those things were a lot more interesting and i could go on for hours before,one can see what the director wanted to give us all in his head but we 're not supposed to be surprised
1,some people say there 's a few good points in the movie that are so bad i could n't make up my mind whether they were or not,some people have commented on that here because it shows us that the best way to go is the way in which they are shown in the movie
1,this was a real stinker for me,this was a really great film
1,in fact i think the show is quite good in comparison,in the end a truly ridiculous movie with a bad story and
1,so many times we get an endless,so what is it for me
1,how come a man out of business is a guy,how many people could have been a little better
1,the film 's plot is a little hard to follow and as long as,the first thing that i do n't like is to say the least
1,the plot is that they have some problems to say,the only reason why i did n't enjoy it
1,the movie is about a group of people who meet some very attractive,the film was shot independently and made a great deal of work
1,so i was n't a very impressed teenager with the exception of a few scenes but,so in summary i do n't care about the characters the plot was too unbelievable
1,i ca n't remember much about the plot because that 's how i felt about,i do n't think i could ever hear of any movie with this one
1,it is n't a bad movie but it also is great to see all the bad,it 's a shame that so many people in the audience will like this movie
1,i think that he was n't the worst actor of the,i was so glad that i was looking for it
1,the story was a bit of a letdown though the acting was,the main problem with this is that the plot is weak
1,the characters are also very annoying and it 's unbelievable that a man could have made a,the only good thing about the movie is the acting but i found myself nodding down
1,the first half is not all that good,the film does n't even try to be any
1,but this film is a good one for kids and if not all of this movie 's humor,but when the plot develops out of thin and logical it 's still pretty obvious that something was done
1,bela lugosi is also superb as the villain who has a great deal of charisma as his wife he,bela lugosi is one of the greatest actors of all time and that is where to begin with
1,icet 's character seems rather interesting than he 's playing and he 's given the benefit of his performance and that was only,icet looks as if he 's trying to imitate some of the most annoying characters in the cast of the same actors
1,john woo is n't even the good guy,john goodman 's character is just perfect
1,just remember the movie 's opening titles but it was a bit too much and was quite good too,just remember i was sitting in the cinema with a bunch of people at a local drivein joint and watched
1,if one is looking for a movie that is a complete waste of time and energy,if you have a modicum of humor andor you love the original you 'll love this movie
1,the plot is simple and predictable the writing is very bad,the plot is pretty lame but what does it have to do
1,i do believe it to be a spoof of some of the classic horror movies of the day the first movie in the series of the horror genre,i could go on in my life and i 'd recommend it and i would have a great time watching it i would have a good time
1,the first half of this film is n't very original,the acting in this film are very good too
1,the film is full of action but the film fails,the only person who knows where is the real killer
1,a bit of a good movie in general the,a movie that has a lot more laughs
1,mary steenburgen gives the best performance in the movie as the head of a mother,mary and the girl are just in a bad movie like the ones with the girls
1,it was just as though they were trying to get off the boat,it 's not as powerful if you are still looking for something different but
1,my son told me that he had been too much of a fan of that,my favourite scenes at the end where the father of mr is a kid
1,what 's really sad about this movie,what does it have to offer
1,it 's really really a bad movie,it is a film about a young woman
1,it is one of the most enjoyable,it 's a very bad film
1,i could n't tell if he was a good director or what it was,i would love to give up on that film i will have to see this
1,the characters have a depth and they really feel the need to make this,the main story involving a boy trying to find his father 's love
1,nancy allen as a waitress does not have one great performance,nancy 's performance is also as she 's a great actress
1,and if only we can accept the story of his father 's mother 's son in the,and the ending really surprised me as the whole thing is shot on a different level
1,kravaal is also the best thing about it,kravaal 's brother is the best way for him
1,what can i say about this movie,what i found very disappointing was that the
1,the characters are shallow and the film is,the script is quite simple as well
1,as the film takes place i thought the director was trying too hard to capture the atmosphere of it,as a matter of fact this movie does n't deserve for a movie ticket but i am compelled to write
1,this movie did n't have the same budget of a,this film was one of the funniest ever created
1,i think it 's really bad because it 's very well made and acted to be funny,i ca n't remember that one movie that has a very specific theme about the war of the
1,made for tv the film is set in a prison in a supermarket,made by a very attractive and very talented cast i found it difficult to
1,it is also a great movie in that it shows the different styles,it is a pity that this is a movie of some kind
1,you 'll feel a bit sorry for your parents who do n't want to,you 'll never feel sorry for this of any of the characters either
1,i am sure that he 's trying to do a lot of things in it but they should stick to it,i would love to be in any way i would like it to be more than just a comedy and i love
1,classic movie from director john waters the director,classic movie with lots of sex scenes
1,riding lessons are the best of the four films,riding around the house with a machete and a leg
1,the ending was pretty good but i think that,the film itself was directed by john ford
1,we do n't get the opportunity to see it,we see him in a cameo as well
1,some of the scenes are so ridiculous it was hard to follow the whole film,some of the performances are very good but i am not a big big fan of
1,it 's the same old crap that was released on the scifi channel and that is why,it does n't even look like any other film of the past decade but is so boring and
1,and the story is n't that good,and there is a difference between the two
1,kurosawa is known as the master of all the actors as a whole,kurosawa and his wife of a child of the time is in the film
1,i have heard that this movie is bad but the movie is so,i saw the unrated release of this film on a sunday evening
1,if you have a strong stomach with it and the people who have just arrived in,if you 're looking for a movie to watch and find out what to do
1,the story is a simple mix of clichs and stereotypes with a few surprises thrown together,the movie was not even a comedy as much as they are just about it
1,the only difference between the two movies is that,the ending is just a little too melodramatic
1,how can you say the same,how is there a chance to stop
1,a great scene for a woman,a few people have mentioned the story
1,where it belongs in the first season are,where was the music for the soundtrack
1,for instance i do n't mind a movie where the protagonist was n't a hero to me,for instance the scene where the camera is playing with a man who 's in the mirror was
1,all the performances are ok although there 's no real chemistry between this film and the characters are very boring,all these years the film was very much an attempt to capture the life of people who were involved with the
1,but i still do n't understand why this show does n't,but it just seems like a joke or a joke
1,has the movie been so much more entertaining,has the audience been able to see the film
1,i 've seen many episodes of this show,i love watching a lot of films and i
1,dr knox 's character is so unlikable,dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris
1,at first micheal tries to convince some of the others to be the father,at last i had no idea why they made it to the end
1,and that the only positive thing in the whole thing is that it did n't get a chance to be,and then he turns to the police officers and the police chief and police detective joe to shoot them
1,not only did it have a lot of,not a good thing for the plot
1,of course we have the basic premise that the main character in the movie is a real guy and you are left wondering where he can come from,of course it is an insult to the filmmakers in their own life when there is a way to spend time with a young woman which is not the
1,if you want to have a film with a great deal of laughs check out the old fashioned version,if the filmmakers intended it as a parody of the original the film would have been very well made but
1,on an island in paris where we meet the young daughter of the girl 's boyfriend,on paper that 's the only thing that keeps this film from being a complete disaster
1,i 've only heard of the last one of the two books that aired on the shelf,i have nothing against remakes but a lot of the other reviewers seem to say that you need
1,i would n't waste money on such a,i had a good time watching them
1,also the whole film was really bad,also the actors in the film also seem
1,when i first watched the show i thought that it was the funniest show ever,when i started watching this film the first time it was released in the states was
1,but i guess i 've seen a lot worse,but the most annoying thing about this film is the
1,reaching a bit over the top in my opinion a good idea of the great talent of a talented filmmaker,reaching for the final scene of two guys in the middle of an elevator on the front of the road
1,i love to think this movie is a masterpiece,i was looking for the dvd and it would be
1,the movie is a great movie with no plot,the movie was a little over the top but not
1,i was expecting more from this film the way it was shot was a real treat,i had to see the movie because there is absolutely no reason to watch it
1,the script is just ridiculous and it makes for one hell of a good movie,the film is full of funny action scenes and i 'll tell you a whole lot
1,the acting is horrible from the first half,the movie also contains a bit of sex between
1,i saw this when it was in big theaters,i am a big fan of the horror
1,then they decide to get a job and have to pay a ransom,then i would have been a bit surprised by the movie but i have
1,the movie has a great premise and some great actors,the film is a little dated with some scenes taken from
1,chucky is very funny and a really cool movie,chucky 's death is n't the same as that of
1,a lot of scenes were pretty well made,a lot of people in the audience seem to
1,and then they make a decision,and this was a major problem with
1,meet is the weakest part of the original,meet is one of several movies of one of
1,and the other characters are great and they do n't do anything,and when i was on the screen i was able to determine who
1,the film looks like the director wanted to make a documentary film but instead was a poor excuse to try and make it look like a movie,the movie also stars a cast of people playing themselves including the young girl who works in hollywood and who is the best known in the group
1,for some of the first half and so on,for me there is the usual scene in which one
1,one would think that a good actress would choose the two but this was,one can not find a good thing to be said about this movie
1,this movie was made to entertain some viewers in the cinema,this movie has a special effects and a good plot
1,an excellent movie that everyone knows,an extremely boring movie that is very
1,they both have an uncanny and funny movie,they were so stupid that they seemed embarrassed to
1,watch them in one sitting on a rainy sunday morning in the middle of the night and then see them again on screen,watch with the two sisters in an old house who looks for something more than anything other than a bunch of men
1,now it 's that i know the director has a camera and that,now we are shown as a bunch of friends with their heads
1,this is a real stinker and i have never seen a film that has such a good,this is a good movie and i can see why a film with a low budget
1,without any of the other performances of any of them you get to see a very very different kind of actor,without the aid of an american i would recommend watching the film with some sort of lyrical realism to it
1,despite its faults i would recommend anyone to avoid this film as the film,despite the talent of robert deniro the movie was a lot more fun
1,every other scene he does is a complete jerk,every line of dialog in this film is very funny
1,the acting is horrible and the acting in many cases,the film follows the same fate as a woman
1,in the same vein you could probably tell from the director ennio morricone that his film has,in fact i have to say that the whole thing was done in a different format
1,the only real drawback is the fact that they do not have a lot of things to say for,the story line really does n't seem to work out as planned but the plot is very interesting
1,toast of its own as an action movie it is a must see,toast was not only made for 1000000 but also it was made
1,highlights include his other two cents and his one major encounter with the famous man in his old lady 's house of the dead,highlights include spoilers a lot of this is the kind of movie this would be to be like that i ca n't imagine how anybody
1,some people will be in love with him so much he has been a huge fan of the original,some might complain that it is quite a bit more than a little of an insult to the intelligence of
1,the music score is a bit jarring,the movie is also extremely beautiful
1,however this is a real stinker,however the film is really really boring
1,a couple that are just plain weird,a must see if only for the sake
1,it is very hard to make fun,it really was a great movie
1,as for being a good movie i would n't recommend it,as a result the film fails at being too much to take
1,and that 's where his first mistake was,and he did n't care for the kid in
1,forget if the producers were making them like that,forget about that this movie is like a train wreck
1,the film is a great documentary of a man,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,yes he is a bad man,yes there is nothing wrong with that
1,i think that was the only reason i gave it,i do n't know how that 's even worse
1,the story is a series of flashbacks involving a family in an isolated apartment for the summer of chicago with an,the movie is about a group of people that have been living with a group of friends and their lives
1,and the music is the best thing for,and that was pretty darn the case
1,i thought this was a good movie,i ca n't really blame the actors for
1,this is one of the worst horror,this was a really bad movie
1,other than that there was a really bad script in there,other than that it 's just a waste of time
1,personally i think it 's a film that does n't try to look like an amateur film or have a,personally i would have been able to get to a point where this movie really was a big disappointment
1,this movie is just a waste of,this is a pretty stupid movie
1,skip it if it is available on dvd,skip this one if you are one of those
1,both films are also about a young girl who is attracted,both the leads are very good and are well acted
1,fans of the series should see this movie,fans of a great series are very familiar with
1,anyway i think the only negative point here has to do with the fact that the script by william l vincent is a very weak film,anyway you could n't have to put a film together in an old theater with this one as it should have at the time the movie was
1,exasperating and not really funny or clever,exasperating plot line that seems like an afterthought
1,by the way this movie was shot in a very low budget and the director obviously has no,by a coincidence that has been a problem to the audience it 's not worth the time
1,to be sure i was in my room when i saw this movie on tv the movie,to me the most important thing is this film 's production design is the high point
1,perhaps the best scene in the series occurs when the police commissioner played by john cassavetes 's character has the most important of the film as a means,perhaps the director wanted to make her happy and i doubt that if they were there for some reason this might have had a more enjoyable ending
1,the only reason i'm referring to this is that i have,the music is beautiful but the dancing is a joke
1,i was really looking forward to seeing the film,i was very impressed with the way the story unfolded
1,not that i would n't know where the movie was going but that is about it,not much else to say about this movie except for the fact that it is just about
1,the only difference is that the whole world is one gigantic and inhuman and greedy regime,the film does not try very hard to achieve its goal as a documentary on a whole
1,regardless i could 've written an essay on the director and cast it would be better,regardless of their lack of talent this is n't a movie to be viewed by everyone
1,it 's not an oscar contender and it may be a little too difficult but that is all i have to say,it is not that i love a movie that is so much as i love movies and the films that came out of
1,but i do n't want to go,but that is really the case
1,i'm sorry i had to write an article about this movie and it is so terrible it 's awful,i'm not a fan of the first three but i'm going to see a lot of movies and this one
1,the main villain 's life is so full of clichs which you will be thinking of a great movie as well,the film 's director is obviously just trying to recreate his work and that 's probably the only thing that makes it
1,check out the film on the jacket of your local,check out the story is not a typical formula
1,also if you 're a fan of either genre and the likes of this film the movie is worth watching,also the story does have a lot of problems in the plot the acting or just do n't work
1,i really want my money back or something like,i thought it was a pretty good movie
1,i 've seen this movie and it does n't have to be one of the best of the poirot films,i was really hoping it would be a classic but i 'd say that there was a lot of action in
1,now the story is very original but it 's too bad the movie lacks a coherent story,now i know that it was a bad movie but there have been many films that made me
1,of course that one has n't upgraded much in this movie since the beginning credits,of course he does n't know what to do and that is n't the same thing
1,as to why i would choose my review to be so good about,as for the rest it 's quite a nice change on film
1,the only positive note is the fact that the characters,the film is a little more fun to watch
1,burt lancaster 's portrayal of the american man is,burt reynolds is a bit of a wimp
1,i do n't really have anything else to do,i saw a screener of the movie in the early
1,however this is not one of her better movies,however the only good points the movie has got is
1,this is probably the best film i have ever seen,this one was so bad it made me wonder why they
1,also some of the characters were so,also the soundtrack is very good
1,i could n't help but think of some of the scenes that were filmed,i saw this film on tv recently and it was a pleasant surprise
1,travel to earth is one of the worst movies ever written for,travel to the us to get married from the us embassy
1,for all you guys out there who can watch this film will never watch one,for the first time in a while and that 's not a bad thing
1,in fact if the film did not go down to any of the actors involved in it making it work the,in fact the first movie was so badly made that i actually found myself wondering who this is aimed at
1,being in the middle of the movie i had the misfortune to turn,being in the film i was n't sure where it was going
1,and if you 're looking for something that you have a crush on it 'll never be a classic,and then she goes with her and is just about a young woman who gets a good amount of laughs
1,instead the actors appear as if the director has tried,instead of getting a lot of money out there
1,this was my first time viewing and i have been trying to figure out what i,this is n't a great movie for those who want to be entertained and entertained
1,sorry if you have not already a mcdonalds version or a few films like this,sorry to say that the cast is all very good for their respective parts
1,all in all a bad movie but a waste of time,all in all a waste of time for any fan of the
1,in the end the film is a very good one,in the movie he 's a real loser and the other
1,i do n't really understand why so many people are,i really do like the way the movie ends
1,we do n't know why they 're running the streets,we also had a bit more of the same kind of
1,it seems like one of the most expensive tv productions you 're likely to have seen,it 's a shame that the dvd release at imdb is better known for the fact that
1,the story revolves around a young couple trying to get their children together,the film does a good job of showing the two sides of their own
1,first let me say i was really looking forward to watching this film the first time i saw it,first off let me say that it is definitely a great movie and it is not a big budget production
1,all he is is not the same,all in all i would recommend this movie
1,anwar is not so funny and he also is,anwar is a little less serious than usual
1,as it seems he 's trying to get his hands on them,as a film it 's not worth the time to watch
1,the director and cast are excellent,the acting is so good it 's
1,for those who love to see the old west film this is,for a movie i 'd give up on imdb or imdb
1,damn it 's a really fun film that you should be glad,damn it 's not an accurate film it is just bad
1,i 've just finished watching this show as much as i did like it,i would highly recommend anyone to watch this film to find out who it is
1,yes i know that i ca n't,yes there are some nice gags
1,however the script is so awful that it is almost impossible to follow,however the film is also an enjoyable film to boot for its honesty
1,they 've had a few of our own lives,they had the nerve to go back in the past
1,it is a bit more complex in the way they handle the story but then it does and really keeps you watching,it 's a shame to see the sequel to the book and this movie really does nothing to dispel the atmosphere of the
1,the film itself is not about the war and war but the way in which the film is presented,the plot is ridiculous and unbelievable with no redeeming qualities whatsoever and i ca n't believe this movie was nominated
1,there are many things that are not bad about the film that make this one,there really was n't anything wrong with the script and the script was horrible
1,the actors are superb the characters are great and they all played the characters perfectly,the acting is n't terrible and it seems to be an attempt to duplicate the film
1,or why does this movie have to be made,or the fact that the actors are in the movie
1,in the end this movie is a classic,in addition the movie fails at the end which
1,it was so predictable that the acting was horrible,it 's a real shame that the story itself could
1,it has some cool parts but i just do n't think they are too good for,it is the first movie of the series where it 's the real first thing
1,oh and one of the best scenes of my childhood,oh i remember when this movie was released the only thing
1,and when it 's supposed to be a comedy it does n't really seem,and as far as we know the main characters are in the book
1,there are two things that are wrong i,there is a scene that shows promise
1,and this is just a film about how the director of this film has an affinity,and it 's so obvious that all the characters are just as bad as the actors on
1,and the last scene of the film is pretty well done the,and why did they have to do something with that movie
1,ultimately there 's an excellent sequence where the two lovebirds play it straight straight with a pair,ultimately the two leads and it 's all pretty obvious that this is a bad film
1,the actors are really good and it is hard to believe that in the early scene the film makers would have gotten a clue to a few people who were,the movie is full of funny moments and is a fun one to get into a movie where a lot of people do n't get scared or even entertained
1,all of the actors do an excellent job,all in all a very enjoyable movie
1,its not really a masterpiece but it is certainly a nice little,its just not bad enough to make me laugh or cry
1,this film is a very interesting piece of work that deserves to be appreciated by,this movie was so poorly written and the acting it just is n't good
1,how many times can we get in a movie,how do you feel about your inner condition
1,the movie is very bad even in the last fifteen minutes but it really is worth watching for the fact that it 's,the characters have to be the dumbest i have ever come across and they 've come out of nowhere near the last
1,his work of the world was a great touch,his performance reminds me a lot of the first one
1,nonetheless it 's an okay movie,nonetheless it was the biggest disappointment in
1,plant was not a bad movie it 's still a great and entertaining movie but the actors were bad,plant the movie with the same music was one of the most beautiful and enjoyable moments of our generation i
1,it takes the first three minutes of a life that will,it takes itself very serious and has a wonderful cast
1,i have always been to istanbul for some time but still the way i felt about it was good and i would love it to,i have read the book by stephen king 's first film which was the last of its initial lists of many years to come
1,i do n't think this will be ever,i thought this is a great show
1,on the other hand it seems like a documentary in a small budget,on this website it is a complete waste of time and energy
1,both movies feature the same name to a,both sides are at least the same
1,as you 'd expect to see the first one i liked the last three,as the story unfolds this film does n't make any sense and i just watched
1,you wo n't care about this one in the first place,you can also see the director 's talent behind his head and
1,george clooney is n't the typical action hero who gets a chance to get a little help,george eastman is n't the greatest character but he 's definitely worth mentioning as an actor
1,the movie was shot in the same manner and it shows how much money was,the acting is terrible except for a very bad performance by a young caan
1,crawford is the first wife of the three children and that he is a great actress,crawford is as usual but she is in it as her character does with the character 's
1,and it 's not a movie,and the movie was also a great
1,its about a group of teenagers who are searching for something different,its a very funny movie and a great one as well
1,that 's how i came to a point where it was,that was a good idea to make a good movie
1,but that just does n't happen,but what can i say about this
1,yet another movie about a bunch of young lovers who have the best luck for the night,yet it has to be one of the few films that i have seen where it takes a
1,that 's how i imagined a little bit of the plot and,that 's just as far as a horror film should have
1,like most horror flicks this one is n't worth watching,like a man who knows how to be a film about
1,the acting is pretty good but the story just drags,the only reason i have seen it is because there were
1,maybe a bit of a spoiler,maybe he did n't want to get
1,but i do recall that it is not a film,but that 's all the movie has to offer
1,could this ever be a spoof,could have been a bit more interesting
1,the movie is so funny it 's so funny and you really ca n't take it anymore,the story follows a boy called prot who has a heart attack and is now a computer whiz
1,i am sorry to say the least i would like to see it,i think it would be a bit more entertaining but that would be good
1,when a man calls himself a woman the two main characters are all very,when the world 's most beloved film is set in a rural landscape
1,jimmy durante plays a small part in,jimmy stewart is good as always
1,this film is a waste of time and energy,this could have been a more serious movie
1,some of the actors are good the dialogue is ok i give it a 1 and i recommend it to the people who made it,some are so very poor i was expecting skipping viewings i had wasted my time with the movie and then got it to end
1,the plot is pretty bad and the special effects are laughable but not the worst,the only thing that makes this movie a classic is it 's own one
1,lancaster who is the star of the film has nothing to do,lancaster and his mate were in fact in a similar way
1,high and even in the movie they are just plain stupid,high von trier is an excellent director and this has always been
1,while i do n't like the movie 's characters the movie does n't add much to the overall movie,while i loved the story and i felt the overall feel of the whole story was so stupid and the
1,have i had the privilege to get to the end of this movie,have you been impressed by a film with an extraordinary cast who did this
1,not to mention the fact that we had the same,not to mention that they are all pretty ordinary
1,in this movie he looks absolutely gorgeous and she is very,in a movie that made this movie an original one
1,he is the only person he knows from him and,he just is n't a great person at all
1,ten years ago i was still ready to see the movie,ten years later we all know that there are a lot of
1,is there something like the sopranos,is it a good way to get
1,why should he never get around to get back in the world,why was n't that the truth in the movie 's favor in which
1,it 's a shame that they did n't pay to see this movie but in,it 's very very funny but as i said this story was good enough
1,i would not recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in films about football and culture,i did n't feel that the director was aiming for the director to be able to make the
1,aside from the acting to the very bad screenplay the script is awful and amateurish,aside from that there was a lot of nudity which was actually very cool to hear
1,it is the kind of film that we can watch over and,it is n't an issue the movie is set in paris
1,lame film with some very cheap action scenes and some stupid action scenes,lame characters like the annoying blonde girl who was n't even in a film
1,i have n't laughed at this film ever since i last,i saw it at the vancouver film festival on tv
1,the film is full of suspense but also the,the acting direction and acting are top notch
1,all the actors are excellent the story is well,all three main female characters are equally beautiful
1,if you want to see how the two are going to do this then do so,if you want to see this film i strongly suggest that we would be able to see
1,perhaps the director should have had a larger budget to,perhaps that 's something different from the original story
1,if you want my advise watch the other,if you like horror movies you 'll love this
1,i could go on but i 'll stop them,i ca n't understand why but i'm inclined to give
1,i was hoping to enjoy this short lived but,i do n't know much about jesus christ
1,this is where it gets the better,this movie is a real treat
1,the main attraction is a little too much,the acting is terrible and is one to say
1,a real treat to see a guy who really is the greatest actor,a very enjoyable movie with great use of the usual gore effects
1,louis leno 's film is one big tease with his career which makes the film a lot more,louis kahn is just perfect and he 's very convincing as the main villain in the book
1,harvey keitel is great as the young man who has to rely on his work to survive,harvey keitel makes a wonderful performance and a very interesting character that does n't really fit in the
1,the only saving grace of the movie is the fact that the character is played by james,the only thing i did n't like about this movie were the effects and the costumes
1,however the movie is a complete waste of time,however this film also had some similarities to a film
1,the acting is great the music is great,the movie is about as bad as you can
1,it is a real shame that the film never,it was a waste of film and talent
1,this movie was not only good but in some ways,this is the story of a young woman who moves to
1,however it was just a bad movie,however as a big fan of his films
1,wes anderson is n't a bad movie maker at all and he tries to make something else out of the ordinary,wes walsh was a good choice for her role but this was probably the worst acting i have ever heard
1,i am a fan of musicals and the acting was so bad that the whole thing seemed,i 've been in a couple of high school kids and it was a nice change
1,i did not watch it till the end and i never had to fast forward,i was very impressed by the performance of peter ustinov and the director of the film
1,it is the best of the two,it 's a shame i never saw the
1,these characters never seem to understand or care or feel about,these are two very different cultures and the film does not have
1,i have n't seen the original so it did n't really matter if it was really,i had just sat there wondering whether i was watching a film or a thriller
1,all that is said about the movie is that he is not,all in all it was a waste of time and money
1,i did n't know what was being done but it would,i saw it with my wife and i loved it
1,he 's a quiet man and i am sure you,he is n't even the hero of the picture
1,on this level is the part with the kids and the mother and the,on the other hand there is a lot of violence in the plot
1,yeah i know there is no real point of the movie but this,yeah it 's just that the characters are n't developed at all
1,but it has a great deal of humor,but that is all i can remember about the
1,as far as i'm concerned with a little more money the film is more about the plight of its main,as a result of the first film i really felt that the film could have been much more entertaining
1,the whole cast is excellent with the exception of,the film starts off with an odd premise
1,and i love lucy and lucy and she 's not really the best part of her filmography,and then there 's the ending which i thought would soon be revealed by the dead
1,to be honest i found myself wishing someone would actually make a,to the point of the movie they are all so stupid
1,smart and witty are the ones that do remind me a little of,smart little girl who lives in her home is awakened and abused
1,i have watched this movie and i am fascinated,i have no idea how many movies i see but
1,however the film seems to have been made in a hurry in time and only occasionally with the plot development,however a movie i have seen in this country and yet i had to sit through the whole thing
1,the movie starts out slow and ends with no tension and the climax of the end credits was just too predictable to make for a dull and tedious ending,the plot is a bit silly and you do n't really care about any of the characters except the main character or the way that you get the sense that
1,there is a very strong scene in the movie,there are a few things that you get to see
1,yes some might find it offensive as well,yes i think a number of people are trying
1,she has to be so incredibly beautiful and so sweet that she becomes a dominant actress,she has the best acting job in the film although she was still very good
1,if you want to know about some of the plot you have to get a lot of laughs in it,if i were n't expecting a refund in my mouth my grandma would have the nerve to go to the beach
1,up until that point the movie is very good to be taken seriously,up there the film is not as boring as a sequel to the series
1,not because they were n't good at the same time,not only did this film have a plot it was a
1,in conclusion you can see a great cast of talented actors in their respective parts,in my opinion the best i can remember was his acting style and the script is
1,while i 've been wanting to see a film where the film makers were,while not an excellent one at that it would still be the film
1,in any event you will not see anything of any interest or interest,in fact the whole thing has so many holes in logic that it makes
1,and the ending was very good too,and the story is great and the characters
1,the film has a very funny cameo playing a part of the story that will lead to a climax,the characters are believable and there is a great chemistry between them as they come in from the book and
1,furlong gives a wonderful performance as the father who has trouble finding out he has no chance to be sent away for ransom,furlong is a little bit annoying and is too bland at times even when it turns out that he has a heart
1,maybe i 've been getting worse than i am,maybe they 'll never find out what this movie is
1,calling them a horror film is not to say that the movie is,calling for another example was that they were n't in their 30s
1,this movie made me laugh out loud,this one has no sense of reality and
1,two of a kind from the movie gunga din is one that is an homage to a man of sorts and a man 's life is in love with other men who seem,two stars in the film are the female lead character and a very attractive young woman who plays the role in a very well handled and convincing performance from a young girl
1,she is the only good part of the movie,she is an expert who 's afraid to leave to
1,juliette binoche is a fine actress and is so convincing as a woman that she can do,juliette binoche was excellent as a girl who has been living in the country for years
1,we were given a glimpse at what happened to people in the us when we did n't even think that there was a good reason to make,we can see how she could be in the film but in the end i ca n't see what it 's like to watch the movie
1,shame it 's not a good movie it is so bad that it makes me sad,shame they never even get out of the jail and they 'll soon be able to find
1,obviously the film 's biggest asset is to get a little,obviously it will be an oscar nomination for best picture
1,unfortunately it is not the worst of the,unfortunately it was still a good show
1,i have always enjoyed the show,i was expecting the movie to be
1,do n't misunderstand the fact that he has a lot of money he,do yourselves a favor read this and avoid it like the plague
1,i was surprised how many films made that i saw in a few years,i have seen it a few times and have a different memory than it did
1,believe me i wo n't go into the details of this movie,believe it or not this was a great movie that was so good
1,the film is set to a small town setting which is located with a very young woman,the movie is a true story of a young man who has an obsessive illness and his son
1,sometimes the viewer will see the truth that is the only thing,sometimes the plot goes on and on and on and on
1,they were n't even funny at any time,they just have no real reason to show us
1,it seems that a great actress could have chosen herself for her role in the movie,it does n't take a while to figure out whether its a drama or a drama but
1,this movie has been put into words from other sources such as i do have the patience to,this was a good episode but it does n't have to be very bad but is n't
1,now you 've got to make your skin crawl,now if not that i did n't like the way
1,the story is very similar to the original and with many twists and turns and it 's a pretty satisfying movie,the movie is so bad that you get to see this in the same theater as the last 15 seconds
1,cast is n't too bad it looks like they were trying too hard,cast are all very good and the movie is really well made
1,no one should be ashamed about this movie,no matter what she said and the only reason
1,the film also shows an interesting aspect of the story and,the acting is pretty poor and the script is predictable
1,mark ruffalo plays a good cop with the bad,mark wahlberg was perfect for what he could
1,while this is a bit of a stretch on the part of the director and the writers who,while the movie looks good on it 's own it 's still not the best movie ever
1,in a nutshell i ca n't believe they did make a film like this that is so bad,in fact the film is not so much a comedy a group of young adults a woman from one
1,underlying the story of the story unfolds with the story of the characters who have to choose a friendship with an older,underlying a lot of the scenes i found that it had to be done in an attempt to make some sense
1,it was a bit long and i,it was n't the first time
1,one of the most important movies ever made with good values good action sequences a strong plot and a great,one of the main strengths of the film was that it has a very unique approach to the genre
1,i 've never seen a movie in such a short time and in the same way of telling a tale,i think a lot of people were going to go into this film so it was okay to see
1,a man dressed as a hero is not a bad guy,a great performance from the leads especially schell the embodiment of the
1,i had n't seen this movie in my life since it was made and had not read the,i have a soft spot with the character 's attitude as he was in a serious situation
1,who was in charge of this and the next episode i was a bit skeptical when i saw this,who would forget about this movie but when it came out there was n't any character development in the story
1,it was like an episode of the simpsons series a very bad tv series,it also features a very beautiful woman who is gorgeous and her daughter
1,the story is about a man who kills a man who is not very,the story is very basic and i thought it was interesting to see
1,how much time have we been,how did the writers know how to
1,hr was a bit of a shock,hr 's the movie and the music that
1,one might ask what we have here,one of the most moving movies i 've
1,okay so why did you keep it and it was,okay let 's hope that this will get better
1,there is one thing but for the first half of the movie it 's the fact that the story makes no sense,there was an accident at which the main character has the ability to use his face for the benefit of his own life
1,there were a few things i did n't like about the movie but i was quite impressed by the acting performances,there is one scene that is worth a note of the two main actors and they have a great chemistry and their
1,we see it on a rainy night,we see him and then the woman in
1,for a film i was expecting more than the average rating,for instance in that era where there are two men that have
1,i have not read the book but it is clear that the,i love this movie and ca n't say enough about it
1,so i do n't think that there is a lot of great movies out,so he meets a bunch of people who are also a different person
1,this is the kind of movie which is not even funny and you might,this is n't bad either as they should have had it taken up
1,this movie is a very funny spoof of the first time i saw it i have,this movie is n't really any good but it still managed to be pretty good
1,however the movie really does have a couple of problems with it as far as plot holes were concerned it was a real surprise to see,however the film has more action on the action than a hollywood blockbuster flick and i was really disappointed that it would have been so good to
1,haunted house is a film that has the courage of a young child with a vengeance,haunted by a mysterious old woman he befriends a woman named missy a woman who 's been
1,had i been told this would be bad,had the film been shot as a film or
1,not the type of character that was in the middle,not sure if it was a bad movie or a bad
1,the main plot is very interesting and,the director is a master director
1,a couple of times i thought that it was a pretty good movie,a lot of people have claimed to be one of the most overrated actors
1,after that it is the first thing that happened to me,after seeing a movie i did n't have to watch this to
1,this film is a complete disappointment as the story unfolds and the characters are onedimensional and uninteresting,this film had the potential to be an early film of its time it is very good as
1,if you 're looking for a fun movie with a good concept,if you have ever read the book it would seem that you 've
1,the film is so slow that we,the film was just too good
1,the characters are not the least bit likable and the story line is not that great either,the movie also is about a love story between an old girl and a young man in a
1,i have read that in the movie he,i was really impressed by the story
1,no it is a complete waste of time and money,no more of anything but an intelligent and compelling tale of
1,you could tell the whole story would have been great in a good,you get it 's not a comedy but is a solid comedy
1,much of the dialogue is stilted the action is weak and the,much in the middle when the camera zooms through the film
1,while the film 's plot is somewhat original the story is fairly straightforward but is not,while he 's on his way through the movie she goes to see a movie
1,in a scene reminiscent of a classic comedy this is the best i,in my case if you are an american fan watch the movie
1,the film is just boring and boring,the music is good it was n't bad
1,balk was the first time that i saw the movie,balk that it 's too late for us to see it
1,the movie has a few things going for,the plot line is just so stupid
1,the only reason i gave it a 7 is because i have no idea how this movie is possible and the acting,the main characters are either a group of or in the end of the movie to find the meaning of life
1,the director should be sued and the,the plot was thin and stupid
1,i have seen this movie twice but it really is n't,i love it when i was watching some movie but at the
1,also in a few words that were made on the,also the actors are n't good at this point
1,only if you do n't take away from the story,only a few minutes of the movie are spent
1,the movie is not about a family of people trying to get married and go back to,the first time i watched the whole thing i could n't believe what was going on
1,it is about a couple who are n't very rich,it seemed that they were making something more original but this
1,the film 's direction is so slow that it is almost unbearable to watch,the story involves three couples whose lives are intertwined and are never explored
1,needless to say they are so bad that they are funny,needless to say the story is the main problem between the two
1,the acting is awful the plot is horrible the acting is worse than anything but what could have been,the film follows a group of men who go to california and a small inconvenience in the woods
1,it was made in the fifties with a very good script good cinematography and great performances,it 's about two young women who spend their time together from an old age in a
1,there were many things that i could n't get through this film and all of the actors were very good,there is n't enough of them in the entire film to make you care about the characters but the way this
1,i do wish they had n't made a movie with a little better music and a better story,i do n't know where to begin with one review of another review of this movie and a lot
1,in fact the entire film is an absolute stinker of a movie,in fact i would rather watch an episode of this show than watching
1,the first half of the film is also filmed with a very small budget,the acting is terrible and the movie feels like a cheap soap opera
1,the film opens with an excellent cast of young stars and a couple of good laughs,the film begins with a young woman being chased by a girl at her apartment
1,now this is a very simple and sad story of young boy who comes up with an elaborate,now he 's not a coward for the rest of the movie but he is very likable
1,but that was enough to overcome the negatives that make up the bulk of the film,but it is a very very good film and i think the story line in many ways
1,apparently they did n't like him at all but that is why he gets a,apparently all that in the film the story is a bit of a mess
1,if you have a chance to see it on dvd please give it a look,if you want to watch a movie that is worth catching out for your children this
1,from the opening moments of the end it 's very,from then on the film becomes a real treat
1,is there any better or worse film out there,is it a parody of the film 's premise
1,i was looking at the clock to see just how bad this movie was,i 've read a couple of reviews called the imdb on this page and it
1,the film begins on an enigmatic voyage to spain,the film had a lot of good things going on
1,a lot of the scenes are just plain weird and they do n't seem to get out of each other,a bit of everything was not a perfect choice for the film to be good but it does provide a good
1,oh and one can watch a bunch of movies which are often over a bit,oh and if you like a film that is so bad it 's good
1,the first movie is a real classic,the plot is very bad and the script
1,what i find interesting is that most of the,what do we have to do with him
1,to be honest my only complaint with this movie was that it is an action movie but it 's not,to say the least about the first two thirds were i have to admit it is n't a bad movie either
1,other than that this was a good film it was,other than that i have not seen this movie
1,i would rather watch it for those,i just saw this on tv
1,it really does n't matter the film 's effectiveness is a bit too long and it,it 's not bad it 's really good and not the first is the same
1,gives the viewer the opportunity to get to see it in a light,gives me a little time to write in the end but then you have
1,deol is a pretty bad actor and has no chemistry at all,deol was a nice choice and i hope he does it more effectively
1,so in my opinion this movie is a perfect movie,so he is also unable to afford and the man in
1,as a matter of fact the story lines are more interesting than anything that would,as far as i know it has nothing to say about any of this
1,the movie itself was pretty damn stupid in parts,the film is about a group of young girls who
1,wisely it is an enjoyable movie to watch,wisely it is the story of a man in
1,dickens did n't need to take a few steps into the movie,dickens 's direction is the best of all the actors playing the men
1,lau has a lot of potential and a little respect for him,lau 's character is so much to be seen so well that i
1,he should n't let the movie be,he had never been so convincing
1,of course the plot would n't be better spent a week off,of all the hitchcock movies of the late 1930 's this is one
1,only if you think the movie 's title is a bit too abrupt there is,only a few of my friends are so fond of seeing him in films
1,animation is not the best part of it,animation is used to describe the film 's atmosphere
1,i have never laughed so hard that i have to wonder why the guy in this,i ca n't help but laugh at how much of his films have been done
1,the film was a good one,the only good thing that i can
1,john woo and michael myers had no chance whatsoever with the original cast,john carradine is also good as the villain he is likable he really shines
1,francis ford coppola who had previously directed films for the camera and the film 's,francis ford coppola is so brilliant in the final cut that i was impressed
1,the acting as a whole was a bit weak compared to the,the acting is good especially the two leads of the film
1,it was a shame to see a movie such as this,it 's like a bunch of friends watching a movie
1,you 'll get your drift up in the end,you will see a lot of things going on and
1,she plays an orphan with a boyfriend like him,she plays the mother who is a bit too old
1,which is one of the great things about this great movie for me,which is why i'm glad to say that it 's worth to see it
1,and for god 's sake of the movie the movie is a complete rip,and i have to give the rest of the credit to the actors
1,the only real standout moment is when the two men are in one case after another and the other girls are n't in the house and they 're,the plot is simple but is n't that what it seems and there is a twist in the end that makes the movie a joy to watch
1,told me about a movie that i saw on a cable channel i knew that it was going,told me this is a movie that can go nowhere and i really ca n't believe it
1,but i can say the acting sucked,but for the most part it 's just
1,the only real complaints here are the characters are just,the plot involves two couples living a life together
1,but i do n't want to spoil them because frankly i do n't think it 's worth the time,but the movie is full of clichs and they just could n't take over and make us forget how they
1,when it happens the movie has to have a heart of gold,when this movie was released theatrically i thought it might be something special
1,his son is very well written and directed,his character is so believable that it is hard
1,perhaps a film about a man who lost his son and is not a hero,perhaps a little unfair though the movie 's plot has nothing new to say
1,i would n't even bother renting it,i saw an episode of this show in
1,and the film also has a very touching,and it does n't even make sense
1,the only thing good about the movie is that it does n't end up being,the film is a total embarrassment to the plot and the performances of actors
1,his character is the only character you can identify with,his mother is n't the least bit interested in the movie
1,some of the scenes are hilarious,some of the things are just so
1,most people seem to have seen it all,most of what i thought was the worst film
1,the film is a little too talky but it is a good time capsule,the acting was horrible and it was like watching a bunch of kids getting killed
1,i have not been a big fan,i thought it was pretty funny
1,what was more interesting is that it did,what a waste of talent and talent
1,but the story is really awful,but this is a movie with a
1,this has to be the worst film i 've ever seen this is the,this film was not a good idea and some of the special effects
1,a few moments are very funny though the main character is killed off in a completely unnecessary situation and does n't even get to get,a couple hours later we find some of the other actors including john saxon and his daughter that is the daughter of the daughter
1,anton 's brother and the son of a woman who are searching for,anton timberlake plays a man named benjamin who is n't very funny
1,it is an odd portrayal of what happens in the film,it seemed this film is about a young age in which they
1,production values are the high quality of the film which,production design acting editing script editing special effects etc
1,to me the movie makes us feel like you 're watching a real movie,to be fair i would n't have liked this film much better if i 'd
1,a man who knew he was a bad guy so this might be the last time i was born and i,a few people think it was a great movie and it certainly deserves better than most people in the world
1,it 's all quite interesting to watch the movie for the,it seems that the scriptwriters were making a new film
1,even though she is not quite as charismatic the character is always a pleasure to watch,even when a child like alexandre would be able to act like a normal person in a
1,the movie was really boring from start to finish,the main reason of this was that it was in
1,an interesting premise to this show is that while the characters,an interesting note of how the film is in color
1,the movie is very much a real documentary on a story of an aging person who moves to,the ending is as predictable as i 've heard of and the twist is a little slow
1,screenplay is a good idea but the acting is horrible at best and at one point the camera work becomes laughable,screenplay and direction are excellent and a whole lot of the scenes in the film are quite funny in this scene
1,i did n't get any sympathy in her character and so,i saw it once it did n't have to end
1,the script is also so bad that i have to wonder why so many things were missing such a bad,the film 's final showdown with a black tiger with his face is the only saving grace in both
1,overall i'm pretty sure it is n't a very,overall the film is a lot of fun
1,on my own personal opinion i had the feeling that i was watching some of the most interesting things of the story but,on some level it was a fun touch on the other side of the road and it 's not a total loss
1,i could understand why he 's supposed to be a serious hero in a film in which his family is,i ca n't understand why it did n't work but it was the best one i 've ever seen
1,all the characters in the movie are the most likable thing ever,all the actors who played the main part really were n't bad they
1,arthur lowe was a great character in this movie he did not play the lead character and was not given some,arthur conan doyle is a director who is not afraid to write his book but as far as i'm concerned
1,but it was a pretty funny episode,but in this movie i can feel that
1,for me this is a great film,for me it was a wonderful movie i
1,the only good thing about this movie is the fact that,the story of the mother being abducted by the devil
1,sister of dracula is one of the best movies on disc and in the end it,sister gertrude is not a character but she is not afraid to be a character
1,the director was able to create such an excellent performance,the director tries hard to make a movie about life but
1,the film 's plot concerns a young man who is forced by some old guy to find the perfect man for,the acting is very good and is n't just bad but it is worse than the worst i have seen
1,even so if this is not a great film a good thing to be told is a real stinker,even if you do n't have any doubts about the plot it 's very boring and the characters and situations
1,this is a great film for those interested in the craft in general the film noir has not been released on vhs,this film is very well written directed and acted and it was the best of this genre that was directed by paul haggis
1,earlier in the movie the only real character in,earlier on the film becomes quite a success
1,another reason that the film fails not for me is because it 's not so good it,another one which should be seen by anybody who likes to laugh at an old film
1,peters is the one in the movie who has her head,peters is a woman and a woman from the future
1,i do n't want to waste more,i thought it was pretty interesting
1,jean claude van zandt and paul lukas had great chemistry together to put on such a great movie,jean gabin is a delight to see with his performance in a role that 's more suited to the
1,she was a bit of a jerk who 's afraid,she is the first to die at the end
1,the movie is set to the present day of a prison,the story is about people trying to get away from their own
1,this was the case with that,this is probably the most important aspect
1,the movie is a real pleasure in the end,the ending was a perfect combination of action suspense and
1,the only real problem in this otherwise boring movie is the fact that it 's not funny and has a lot of problems,the first time i saw a trailer for this film i was shocked by the lack of anything else that this movie has on
1,much of it is spent as the events unfold but when the movie is over to you it 's a bit predictable,much of it 's success is that it 's made to be a classic of a film that would be a great movie
1,bo svenson is a talented actor who has the ability to show a little more,bo derek as the mother and the young maid are both excellent supporting characters
1,he is so funny that i ca n't be bothered by how he,he is also one of the most beloved villains in the world
1,but it did n't even seem like there,but there are other good points here
1,too bad it was n't made for tv,too many husbands who have never seen any of
1,other than that i do enjoy that film in general,other than that i really liked the scene where it was
1,this movie is an adaptation of a classic novel,this film has a couple of twists at the end
1,carey 's the informer was a film that was just awful to watch and i,carey and lewis as a married couple are just as memorable as the actors
1,i could n't help but wonder what happened,i did n't see the last episode
1,only one of the two films that made me,only the movie could have turned out better
1,although he is a good guy he is still a real star,although i am a fan of the old series and the tv series
1,after watching a few of the episodes i thought that i will never,after all i can only say if i did it i will
1,it is so bad that it boggles the mind from the viewer,it 's a story of what it 's like to be
1,it 's not the worst movie i 've ever seen,it 's a pretty good film to begin with
1,the story is about a group of people who get together from prison and their problems are,the first is that the film is not entirely devoid of any suspense suspense or tension
1,interestingly we are supposed to get to see what happened in the film 's part in the first place but that 's just a few words,interestingly enough the story of the movie is based upon that of the same name in the same movie and that of the book it came from
1,there may be spoilers ahead of the film that will help us understand the true nature of the characters,there are lots of scenes where the actors seem real and the camera work and lighting were very good and
1,the only reason i did n't give this movie a 1 is if someone who likes,the movie is so slow and plodding that i actually felt obligated to watch it
1,it 's a shame that there are more movies like this that have a lot,it has a very interesting and exciting ending that is not really a surprise
1,the movie 's message is n't even that of a film that is not just a thriller in the sense it is a,the film takes so long to build the film in the style of the book and the director has no idea what
1,the film is just one of the worst movies ever made,the film has all the elements of a classic movie
1,tweaked and watched this movie with a friend and a bottle of vodka,tweaked the ending of the movie and the credits i watched it and i
1,nothing else can make me laugh so hard,nothing really happens or is it any wonder that
1,much of the film takes place in the dark desert and the scenes that were supposed to shock is a little slow and slow,much better in most movies in its era and you are likely to be entertained by the fact that the characters are n't developed enough
1,the script does not have enough twists that you do n't have to,the movie is also about a man being kidnapped by a woman
1,she is married to a woman and she,she 's also pretty in the role
1,this movie could only have been good,this movie has a very good premise and
1,easy to tell and if you have,easy luck is a bad movie
1,they did n't get out of this world,they were n't given the opportunity to get rid
1,i was a little bit skeptical at the end but i was just bored enough to get through it,i 've seen this movie several times in an evening and it is n't a total waste of time
1,if it was n't for the good jokes the acting could have been better,if you want to make fun of an adult guy this movie was a must
1,this show has a couple of good,this film has no redeeming qualities
1,after seeing the film it was a very funny movie to watch,after the movie is over i feel as if there is no real
1,they had to be the dumbest actress ever to be made but the real world is so bad that,they should n't have gone out of the theater and the people who do n't have a clue
1,growing up in the united states of the united states in europe where they meet a young french man who takes over her and her,growing up in the early 20th century was the last year in the film a year in which he is discovered for his work
1,for those who love the series you will probably love them,for that matter i just wanted more of the character development
1,this is not one of my favorites but i 've,this movie was n't that bad to be seen
1,on the run the guy becomes a huge part of the film 's history in which he plays a young woman who,on the way we watch the first two episodes of the movie and we 're left wondering what is going on
1,i did not care about seeing this movie but it still managed to make me laugh,i was not sure whether i was watching a movie or a parody in a movie
1,as far as i know it might be a little more than i could chew and i do n't,as the movie opens there is a little bit of love to them as well as the film
1,they make this film look interesting,they have n't been very successful
1,the story was good but i was n't sure of what was going on,the director was obviously in love with the director 's girlfriend but they did an
1,this is the first time i see this film,this was a great movie for those who have been
1,and of course there is a lot of footage of animals in the background for the same movie,and the whole thing feels like the filmmakers were trying too hard to get their story to a little
1,this is the first film that makes,this was n't a bad movie
1,i ca n't recommend any of it,i saw this movie on an online flight
1,first of all it is n't scary it,first of all the actors are great
1,the acting is ok but the special effects of the movie are n't,the only thing this movie has going for it is the title
1,it is a little bit of a good thing to see that it is so bad and in the end is,it 's an interesting tale of the life of a woman in a world where she does n't come across
1,okay the only time i was able to see this movie,okay let 's not forget it 's an awful movie
1,although this is a bit dated it still works better way the way it was shot on and it was edited,although the film is set in a very modern era it 's still a nice movie that does n't have much to
1,that 's why you 'd want to see,that alone is my favorite of mine
1,loveable and exciting the movie is a very different and very different film,loveable young is a very good movie it 's a good movie to watch
1,in other words the acting was great,in short if you 're a fan of
1,this is what the director 's motivations are,this movie is so bad that you have to
1,my recommendation to all viewers who have,my rating 7 out of 5
1,i just ca n't believe the hype that they did like this movie,i saw it on the shelf with my girlfriend who was in it and
1,i do n't want to talk about the bad acting anymore,i would n't say that he has an eye but he has
1,looked as if one of the actors was the one who gave up the girl,looked like it was filmed by a bunch of mates on a small budget
1,one day after the movie came it was n't funny at all and the plot holes were,one of the best things about the movie is that the character development was so funny
1,i really want to know the movie,i would say that this movie was not
1,made with a script this ridicules the movie was written with no subtlety at all,made to be a big hit it 's not worth spending it for this
1,the film is not about racism or how we can,the first movie is a real pleasure to watch
1,a movie that would not make us feel like the real characters are being shown,a must see for any serious movie fan or anyone who loves good movies
1,the movie is about a girl in peril,the only reason it made the movie for me
1,how did they find the other one,how did the director and director have the
1,all it 's been done in the movie is an exercise in the dark,all in all but the best part was the beginning and the end
1,it is a shame that the story of the series never got started out until the last episode but,it 's a great little story that i can not say as i have a problem with that
1,910 stars from the director and editor,910 rated for graphic violence violence and sexual
1,much of this is due to the fact that there 's a lot more action and more action,much of the film takes place in the 1950 's when it 's a western film it 's almost
1,a must see a good movie but it is n't,a few times you can see some of you that will
1,this is one of the best movies of,this is a very well done film
1,it was also interesting to watch a film with the two guys in each other,it 's the first time i see this one that i can remember from the first
1,do not bother trying to be a bad film,do yourself a favor and watch an uncut video in
1,i'm sure it 'll be a little bit slow if there were more,i'm surprised that a movie like this will never get such a low rating
1,thanks to a cast of characters i do enjoy to get into,thanks to the movie makers the producers and writer must choose
1,this film was a lot of fun,this film is a complete rip off of
1,why did i love the film even more,why should this woman be given his powers to
1,it 's all very bad it is very good,it 's a shame that most of it 's audience
1,not even the funny ones are very funny or funny or funny,not one of those movies that i could not sit and watch
1,except that the movie is not that bad it 's just a waste of,except for a few scenes you see it is a pretty lame movie
1,it would be the one to get it and it is not,it seems as if they are going to have their own cards to
1,it seemed very similar to the other film,it 's not the first time it 's done
1,just before dawn of the dead and,just the right note for it
1,is it supposed to be that a film,is there a lot of time spent
1,tell of the story of the girl 's daughter the woman who has been murdered,tell a story of the dangers of life the way we are presented with
1,i could go on and on i did n't see it as much as the first it 's not the first,i just wish i could get a refund from a friend who would n't be a better movie like this
1,junior and his friends take an opportunity to get out of jail,junior hayden has no trouble believing that she is a werewolf
1,anyone who has any interest in a film with a sense of,anyone who has n't seen it do something about the plot
1,number two has a great performance at the end but it,number 2 is a bit more than one of them
1,to call in to that she was n't even the slightest bit to blame,to make matters worse the movie is n't a total waste of the talents i
1,i thought oh the last 30 minutes or so in the movie,i saw this film at least a quarter before the release
1,unfortunately i could n't understand what i saw when i first saw it,unfortunately it has no direction the acting is awful especially for those who are
1,as such it makes me cry when i finally found a vhs of this film,as soon as we learn that the man has been shot it takes a dump
1,brosnan as the young detective is played by,brosnan 's character is just a stereotype
1,the characters are so stupid and so stupid that they do not make the slightest bit of sense,the story is simple to say that this is a great movie and it shows how the original movie
1,instead of just letting 's see a little more time later,instead he plays a character who wants to get married
1,whoever thought it was a good idea to make another movie,whoever wrote this movie will never have the patience to learn to
1,a great actor like david morse and the rest of the cast was wonderful,a movie i have to rewatch to see what the hell is going to be
1,cynthia rothrock 's character is so wooden that i have to wonder if this movie was just meant to be a comedy in the style of the comedy,cynthia rothrock as mr tilney is the only decent actor in the movie though his role was a bit annoying and in that case there 's nothing wrong with
1,created by a very talented writer who is,created the first half of the movie
1,this is by no means a movie i have n't written on the,this is a movie from which i know i 've seen better
1,the ending was a bit contrived but in that film it was n't exactly the same,the movie takes an extremely serious approach in showing how the real world and family life can
1,what is this with the other actors,what i really think is that there were
1,do not expect to see it to be,do n't worry about the good guys
1,there may be a bit of the movie 's humor for the younger audience,there was absolutely no redeeming quality of the acting to be found in this movie
1,so many of them are so bad and i wonder how this film,so why does she choose to get back to the old west
1,the characters were real and the story of a young woman 's life of the future and how she deals with her own death and how important the world is as the movie progressed because there 's no way she can be,the plot line has been done well and i would say that i really was n't paying to read any of the other comments here i guess the writer had already done the same thing over and over again and again
1,there was not only a few songs but it 's the worst movie i 've ever watched and it is definitely the worst movie i 've ever seen,there is an occasional amount of violence in this movie which is the reason i was n't offended by the fact that it had some funny moments
1,it was a pretty good movie,it 's not that a film like
1,of course the movie has nothing in common to the plot or action,of course there is the girl of the village as i have never seen
1,also the film is n't a very dark movie though it,also the scenes in the hotel scene are hilarious though
1,i ca n't even remember how to write a review or comment on this,i have never laughed so hard at a horror or horror movie before
1,a movie of this ilk is the story of the first one to be a little more interesting and the acting is better,a few times you have to go see this movie as a curiosity piece for you to find some redeeming qualities to be a
1,much of the credit from the characters to the film was lost and,much better than this film was made by the director for it
1,not even that one can be done without a hint about,not for the faint hearted and breezy but it has a fair
1,there 's some great performances by the cast particularly the main characters and the main character who plays the role of the father and he is a,there are two stories of this series which are so poorly directed that i just wanted to comment on the lack of any meaningful plot structure
1,the acting is horrible and the actors are just bad,the main point where there is the scene at the end
1,penny was the most beautiful and talented person on the show and he was also the only show who had,penny and sonam are the kind of girls who do n't even know anything of what they 're doing
1,it is so bad it 's bad,it is not a film of a film
1,uncle john is a bit deranged but you do n't get to see that,uncle and the stranger is a film about a man who tries to save her
1,this is one of the best movies i have seen in years,this movie is the worst most disgusting thing you 'll ever see on
1,the plot was so bad that i had wasted 90 minutes of,the movie is an insult to the book of the book
1,but the most memorable aspect is that in this film we see a bunch of young women living at a castle,but this time you get a movie about the life in which these characters are not afraid to take care of them
1,i ca n't believe they did n't use a sparingly camera or two actors,i would like to say that my mother and i laughed but this film was
1,nudity is not always funny but the fact that the plot,nudity and violence are very bad in the first place
1,fatty 's attempt at humor is a,fatty the girl is very funny
1,you 're looking for a good movie or at least do n't have a lot of good points and,you can tell the director is making movies but the film is n't as dull as its predecessors
1,seriously you 'd want to see it again,seriously this is the best movie i have seen
1,i ca n't get enough of a movie in which there,i was not sure if the story was any good
1,the ending which is a little too contrived for me to remember the end is a bit abrupt,the first film which i 've always liked in the past but this one was just horrible
1,just look at this show it was n't even close to,just to be a good time capsule of the time
1,and i really loved the scene where a woman is lying in the bed in the middle of nowhere,and the only way that is good in this film is the way the movie takes place in the early
1,i saw this movie at the stockholm international,i would not have been watching it
1,now that does n't mean a film for a movie with a capital rating,now it will end the same way about the same time as the first film
1,instead of a film about a young girl named edna 's daughter mary her grandfather and her family and their friends and the mother 's,instead they got the idea of what they could find in the past and that was why this film has a lot to offer
1,the story is a little slow but in fact,the plot is very poor to begin with
1,instead i have n't yet seen any movie in my life,instead it is like a bunch of friends trying to be a
1,long before it is released the film is still in the public domain and has a lot of,long live it and the film is a great piece of work which is a great thing
1,i think that is true as much as it,i am a big fan of bad movies
1,yes the script is so poor that even the acting was pretty lame as was the writing and directing,yes and it 's all in line that is what i think is a very accurate account of the history
1,a few seconds later we see a very bad looking guy who 's obviously not a professional one,a very interesting and entertaining movie with many fine characters who are very believable in the story
1,the only thing worse than this was the fact that the whole story line was not just boring,the film has its charms which are pretty accurate for the story to begin as a whole
1,too bad it has no appeal it 's the best,too bad it did n't get released on video and in
1,big fat liar is one of the most underrated movies ever,big wednesday has a certain cast to perform and it does make
1,not only that i have n't seen many of these movies as well as many other movies of,not that i do not want to make a spoiler of this movie it 's really boring
1,the movie takes the viewer with very serious situations about the people of argentina and the struggles that are involved with the people who are there and what they are all about,the only reason i went into this film was because of the poor reviews on imdb and i was surprised by the rating given that it was one of the worst movies i
1,even the characters in the movie are more interesting than,even the scene where you are a movie theater
1,this is a movie of any importance and i have,this is the best comedy i have ever seen
1,what 's worse about it is that it was made,what is more interesting is how many times i have seen
1,she has a very small role as,she is a woman a girl
1,if this show is going to inspire the audience for a more serious time of entertainment it certainly is a must,if you want to make a decent movie you can tell you where you can get a few scenes of good dialogue
1,well what a waste of the talents,well this one really is n't
1,let this serve as a good example of the genre of filmmaking,let me tell you that i have n't read a book before i
1,like that movie this is one that has nothing to do with,like all of these movies and the plot is very entertaining
1,also the plot twists are so contrived it makes one wonder why there,also the plot seems to have taken place on a big city
1,i was looking at the video box and read the cover,i do n't think we 've seen the first film
1,younger and thinner in the first movie is n't a perfect little bit of fluff,younger brother the youngest sister who 's not always been interested in her family decides to
1,why is n't this a classic,why is there that is only one
1,sarah silverman is a delight as the film 's title and,sarah and her husband were on my own personal experiences
1,if you 're looking for something more sinister and intelligent this film is for,if you like watching movies with a good plot you will love this
1,probably a great idea for a film and the,probably a must see for all film fans
1,either this just seemed like the whole thing was made for kids but,either way the director has a sense of humor the first time
1,1010 the acting is awful all around,1010 it 's an insult to all involved
1,in my humble opinion this series should be made,in the first part he is arrested for the murder
1,try to enjoy it or just watch it you can tell you,try to see it at least once sometime to the end
1,i did n't see a single bullet or tail in the end but i did like,i had a lot of fun watching this movie but it was not worth seeing
1,in fact a good film to play a great movie,in my opinion this was a huge mistake in my opinion
1,the actors do very well with the material and the actors do well,the plot was not really a lot of holes in logic but it really
1,finally the movie itself has it 's own problems,finally the whole time is n't that big
1,it is a very beautiful film for those who want to see how a movie can,it 's a good example of the kind of bad movie that i saw recently
1,i'm not even sure that the makers of this film thought that it would really be so funny,i'm not an expert and the movie was one of the worst i have seen in my life
1,all those that have been in the theatre will,all in all a wonderful film to experience
1,in the end he 's really not the worst character in the world,in the movie it 's a very simple character study as well
1,even though the plot is about the same sort of movie as the,even if it is true it is just a waste of time
1,this is one of these shows of the era of american television,this movie was n't that good but it was pretty fun
1,milligan 's first effort is a movie with no plot no suspense no suspense and no plot,milligan 's film is full of surprises and the film has a very good ending to it
1,paying attention to the film 's success and for that it 's worth a look,paying homage to an actor who was so talented to watch and the first act of
1,it does a lot of things you can never forget about,it is not the story that i do n't know about the
1,considering the movie 's title it 's not a bad remake of the original which was good but not bad,considering the film 's subject matter it was an enjoyable movie as well as a solid cast of actors
1,instead you have an endless and unexciting scene where a man who is a pillar of himself who,instead they 're a bunch of losers dressed together and a guy dressed up at a party
1,and for a very long time there are many of the other things,and then i got my hands on the video of the movie
1,if you are interested in watching the movie i think it was a bit like a film,if the first half of the show is funny or even funny then it 's not
1,no matter how closely he is trying to make a documentary of himself,no wonder i rented this flick thinking that it would be a sequel but
1,i love movies from a different era than the usual crap movies like this are,i was so disgusted that i had read the book and was shocked by the ending
1,this film is no exception in its depiction of it the plot has a lot,this time it gets to be so stupid that it 's hard to find
1,the film is about one woman and his son in the end of a marriage,the film begins in the us where the government and the germans have a hard time
1,i was very lucky to find it at the cinema,i was a little surprised that it was a film that
1,while this is not a true story it 's very good,while the action sequences are quite interesting and are obviously filmed in
1,cut to some of the best scenes where a guy gets killed and goes nuts,cut to a few parts and some scenes with the other two guys are not the
1,here we have a movie which is based in the same caliber as the original,here 's your review you will find yourself a better film than this one
1,it 's the story of an alcoholic young woman,it does n't get any better than this
1,some of the other actors are good but the script is,some of the scenes are too long or too slow
1,it 's also very difficult to find a film where you have to wonder how that would be able to accomplish the story,it was a good idea for a thriller that was supposed to end in the very end of the film but when the end
1,every single person has the same sense of humor,every single scene was a joy to watch
1,doing n't know who the real culprit is but the fact,doing n't get it just for what it 's worth
1,someone who has been told by the director to see the film,someone was killed off by the bell of the murdered girl
1,mark 's character in this show has a lot of personality,mark hamill is also great in a cameo role of a villain
1,the main story about the story for the most part was the characters the relationships the plot of,the movie starts as a documentary of a book that is a bit different than the original
1,the film is not the best movie of it 's time,the story was about the man 's obsession with the man in
1,i have seen it over and over again,i would have enjoyed the character development and story
1,as for the rest of the production the film is an absolute masterpiece but not as good as the original,as for the plot holes there was only one point where this is a good thing the movie is really bad
1,there 's no doubt in this movie that i am not sure why the director wanted to use the lighting so fast,there 's even a small amount of nudity and some graphic sex scenes which make it an r rated horror flick
1,the plot of the movie was that an actor was hired by a reporter with a gun in a local warehouse,the director of course also has a knack for directing and visual effects which make it very good for the period of
1,yes that is the reason for this film,yes there is nothing to recommend this for everyone
1,i thought the movie was a lot funnier,i have a great deal of time to see
1,my only problem was that the director could have been just trying to get away from the original,my only gripes are that the movie is n't a complete piece of crap and it is only half
1,the film was made for the romanians and i did n't understand much about the film in the first place and i am,the characters are so realistic their character is not only a good actor who is in fact a real jerk in life
1,one night while browsing a car accident with a couple of guards and then in the,one could n't have been the same person who wrote a book in a book
1,in one scene the camera is in slow motion a scene where a bunch,in my opinion it 's pretty good and i do n't know why
1,i just love it for the acting,i think the main plot point of the
1,in fact that movie is just an action movie,in the end you will be pleasantly surprised
1,all those that have seen this show can appreciate it as they are so much of their time in their lives that they do n't know,all in all a very entertaining and well worth a 10 and i 'll give a 3 for anyone who wants to see this film
1,it really is one of those movies that you want to watch but it 's not that great,it 's not funny and it makes an interesting viewing experience but it is worth it at your heart
1,the actors are excellent and the supporting,the acting is bad all around
1,i have n't even laughed out loud at such a bad film,i saw the film several times and it 's very funny
1,what a shame that the filmmakers and,what is a guy doing so
1,this movie shows a good amount of,this was a really bad movie
1,even though he has n't done it it 's always worth the wait,even though it has aged a very good topic and a couple of laughs
1,it 's like the main character just wanted to punch her up so he got,it has a certain amount of potential which might have been much more enjoyable
1,i saw this as a sneak preview in the late eighties and was,i have to agree that the movie itself was not bad enough
1,you know that he was a genius and it was,you 're probably in the right hands for it
1,mcintire has the ability to play in an effective movie in the style of his films,mcintire is a great actor in a small role but it is a pity that his character
1,no one has a problem with the subject matter because it is so obvious that it 's,no doubt the writer is not even a little more than a little of a joke
1,and it 's not a good movie it has the,and the ending is just a bit too cheesy
1,we know he has a chance at making this one a bit,we 've been waiting to watch this film and you 'll see that
1,a little research to be said,a few people get the chance to
1,by the third scene in the movie i found myself asking questions,by the end of his career he did not know what was going
1,there are a couple of laughs throughout the film which make one laugh as it happens and it makes for a nice,there 's a lot of action and a few of the jokes are hilarious but the action sequences are completely unbelievable
1,when he finds his body there are still his other suitors as he struggles to understand that his mother is n't going to be,when i read the summary the poster said that someone thought it was another great idea to watch it it 's not bad
1,the whole idea of this film is that of the aforementioned and the bad guys,the movie 's message comes true when they are all a real human being
1,this was a movie where the characters would n't be left alone at the end to,this is probably what this film is a total waste of time as a rental
1,and it was so boring this is,and it is not very funny
1,i love that one scene where the two men in this movie,i do n't think it would have been a good film
1,it had me hooked but i do not think it 's really that simple,it 's like watching a bad movie about a guy who is so stupid that
1,i'm glad i bought this movie and i do n't,i'm not even going to go into the story
1,now the story itself is about two people who are searching for each other and each other is a,now if anyone has had anything better to do then maybe it will become a little too long
1,you ca n't tell what happened to him,you see the story unfold with the same exact
1,now this should never have worked,now it 's a great film and
1,actually this movie is one of the best you can ever seen,actually there is the fact that this movie was filmed in the west
1,none of it is the worst of the bunch,none of the characters is believable and the story 's
1,along with her mother are the two daughters and her father who has a very small part,along with the acting there were a lot of moments that could have been done as a bit
1,i 've seen better performances in this movie than many other people out there,i have not seen them since seeing the movie and i must say i had
1,it was a huge mistake of mine and was just as bad when it comes,it does n't matter if there is a sequel to or prequel to it
1,i 've been waiting for a movie of this godawful to be released on the scifi channel for several years,i 've read the script for this movie but i was n't expecting it to be a good movie
1,he is a complete dimwit with a heart but the whole time it,he is very good at playing the part of a tough guy
1,just to name a few and far between this is certainly a must see,just the sort of person who would never do a movie about this
1,trouble is that in all that she is in this movie she,trouble with the movie is that the characters are completely uninteresting
1,this film is a complete waste of time,this would have been good if there would be
1,i thought that the film is a lot more of a drama than i 'd have expected,i have to say though that i have been trying to find more to enjoy in this film
1,a good film by it 's director,a little more of a drama
1,otherwise i was n't expecting much from this,otherwise it 's a very poor movie
1,pressured by the two leads to the first season,pressured by another director to direct the picture and put
1,i could n't stop laughing and i would like to make the same mistake that he,i did n't think the filmmakers and director got anything from it for this movie
1,i was in college and that 's,i did n't care at all
1,something that could have been called good or bad and the first two were the funniest and probably one of the best,something that i 've seen in a long time with the name of the man from the first film and it did remind
1,would i have known that they are in a better movie,would n't have helped a little more money in the movie business
1,though the ending the movie was not the greatest part of this,though this version has a somewhat more conventional and interesting plot
1,in the first part of the movie the action is a bit thin,in fact the entire film looks like a cross between a real high school
1,if you want to get some laughs on your watch go check it out,if there was a message to us all i 'd say was the movie
1,okay the movie is a pretty dull mess with a bunch of actors who are pretty good,okay maybe he 'll take the time to write a review of his book on a film
1,your first experience in the history of filmmaking is to show us the world that is still alive and it has been made available in our local area,your typical 80 's slasher film like that does n't have the benefit of the original and it is hard to take up the whole film for a whole
1,anyway what is the deal with this movie,anyway i think this is what it was about
1,shue 's character is one of the best of all the great characters,shue is a woman whose love is taken by the other characters
1,she has done an excellent job directing a movie that,she is a beautiful actress with very great acting
1,some of the lines here are a little weak,some of the shots are just a few of the
1,i could have done without my wife,i think this film is worth a watch
1,such is the case with this movie,such a good concept for all the people
1,kagome 's husband 's daughter died after that of two months,kagome has a good life he 's a man who has his
1,the film is so poorly acted that it 's almost impossible,the movie takes place inside a house of san francisco
1,one that you will never forget is one great line,one thing i noticed most that was to do was that
1,it is a good movie to show as the film goes,it could also be a lot more interesting to watch
1,the music is great the soundtrack is excellent and the songs are great and,the whole story is so bad and stupid it 's hard to imagine
1,we have no idea of who is the killer of the film 's story and the story begins with the story of the two warring clans,we 've never been seen by this movie in my life so i'm not saying anything i have seen in a movie like the last
1,jodie loughlin is not bad but she is a bad,jodie milano is perfect as always with the character
1,the script has a lot of things in it with the exception of a bad guy who wants a woman to fight and,the story is so convoluted and full of holes that it is n't funny and does not make you laugh or cry
1,had it not been for a few moments that would have been shortened by the film 's end it could have been great,had he stayed for a movie that is n't going with it i would 've known that it was the most successful piece of
1,did he ever get to play on the piano,did i mention that she was the only one
1,now that i know what i did,now the only thing it had going for
1,it was very funny and i do n't really know where to start,it has an interesting story line and interesting plot twists in the end
1,almost every scene with this film was very funny and had a certain amount of action,almost all the plot devices are pretty bad and the ending is too predictable which i do
1,the story is interesting as is the setting,the whole film is a complete disaster
1,both of them are the ones who can be forgiven to be a little,both have some of the best actors i have seen in a film
1,so this is where the film starts to work,so much to the plot and the ending and the
1,jody 's love interest and the rest of the time they are the only to know their father and his daughter,jody is the best of the two and she was n't really a very good actress but still a great actress
1,the movie opens with a couple of the,the acting the special effects are excellent
1,i 've seen many movies but this film is definitely one of,i really enjoyed this film but i still remember it vividly
1,though that is a bit of a surprise and i really liked it so much that i could have sworn it,though this is a very dark idea a group of other people get killed and thrown in on the way
1,i was able to see this movie again in my mind when i thought this film was,i have seen this film as much as a child and was n't impressed by it
1,there are a few laughs to make but the only ones to be able to do,there are other movies about this group and some of them are good at it
1,motivations abound in this very well crafted movie,motivations like these guys are all about their problems
1,there is a whole new cast of actors that do n't seem to have,there are also plenty of movies about women who are so much different
1,this film just got the fk of approval from me and i think the movie was n't really a good idea,this is a movie that you can watch in its entirety or just want to see it and get the chance to
1,he is able to find his way to the island that the people he considers to be a,he 's also not an ordinary person he 's a man that wants to be a hero
1,karloff and matthau are two main actors in this film the cast of actors is n't good although the script is a bit weak,karloff plays a cop who 's trying to kill and kills his mother but when he becomes the one suspect of the man we find
1,likewise this film is really a total,likewise that was the best part
1,naraku was very believable as the villain,naraku should have known that his character is
1,it 's a really good movie,it takes a good story and story
1,1the idea is good but the acting is a lot better,1the acting is great but the story and the acting is very
1,mr and mrs otto 's daughter helen is a woman whose,mr bean as his dad is also a good choice
1,i could have taken a nap if they were trying to make more movies like this,i would definitely recommend this film to all who like to laugh at its ridiculousness
1,the film was pretty good but also the fact that the film was very,the actors are all pretty dull and the acting is just plain awful
1,it is not a total waste of time,it 's a little bit overdone as it is
1,sort of like i have been a fan of the original and was so scared to see and heard that you do,sort of a movie that you would think of watching it and then reminisce it was so much of a letdown
1,and it is n't a great movie because that 's what i did n't like,and that does n't help matters in my mind that i was a bit skeptical when
1,furthermore it makes us realize that the filmmakers do n't have a monopoly for the character or care as well,furthermore the main character is a loser of sorts who can solve the circumstances he has in a situation that will
1,and this movie really does remind me of something that i have seen over ten years,and in fact i have n't been very impressed with the story of the original series
1,if you want to know a little more about himherself then you will like them,if you liked the book you probably should have a little bit more attention to this
1,for this is a true treat for everyone involved and it 's an awesome film,for example it 's so stupid so lame and so bad it 's funny
1,but then the movie looses its edge,but the rest of the film is very
1,apparently it was n't made at all,apparently this film was a lot better than
1,sally is one of the very best of all time,sally kirkland looks great as it gets to do so the
1,some of the scenes in this film are hilarious,some people think that this is a very beautiful film
1,i think it 's a waste of time,i 've seen this movie over and over again
1,this is a very very bad movie,this movie does n't even get to do
1,joe don baker 's performance is perfect for a role as the crusty and egotistical young guy who does n't seem to get the girl,joe pesci does a fair job as a doctor who is the sole survivor who has to be his father who has a lot more to
1,but the film is a real downer from the opening scene that has nothing,but even a little bit of the same is true of the film
1,the acting is n't terrible either and whoever really thought to myself was a big mistake of the,the film is an utter failure as it goes on and on for the longest 85 years
1,i'm sure the writers do not even try to get them up and they 're supposed to be a comedy but this one fails miserably,i'm sure this guy will take the movie seriously as an example of what could happen on earth and it was so bad that i did
1,this is not the worst of my,this film is a must see
1,from the opening credits with the two main leads the story was weak it 's not very good to start with,from the first scene of events to the final scene with the final showdown between her and the baby and the girl
1,a great story by a writer who has no idea,a very good story with a very good plot
1,the acting was horrible the writing bad,the movie has a lot of action scenes
1,the ending is just the best in me and i have to say,the only difference is that she just did n't seem to care
1,carson is an annoying man and you 're a white guy who is not a happy person,carson plays a tough guy who gets the attention and then has his own problems but with no
1,when the guy says the title is supposed to be funny he 's like oh my god,when you get older and more experienced and more experienced you 're in the same room
1,the movie has an excellent score but,the acting and writing are excellent
1,stage fright is one of the best thrillers i have ever seen,stage fright movie that 's in the right place and you have seen
1,i was looking in the theatre and i found this movie to be absolutely awesome,i was very disappointed with the movie at the beginning of the movie because the characters
1,it is not even a movie,it is a great story a fine
1,the movie has some flaws of its own,the movie is not a typical action movie
1,but i would not want to watch it again in the cinema and i have nothing against it,but i would n't be surprised if this film really had to be seen in any other film class
1,slow pacing that you 'll never find in the,slow paced and with a lot of laughs
1,reportedly i missed something a bit like the original,reportedly the acting is n't a lot of fun to
1,what i saw is a good show,what a waste of my time and effort
1,some people get involved in the making of this movie,some say you should be ashamed that this movie is a
1,rivaled to his character and the story is the characters who are trying to get to the heart with what they want and do,rivaled by the great director george c scott and the aforementioned great cast of actors including ben chaplin john cassavetes john malkovich james coburn and
1,when she is finally rescued by her daughter who 's not a bit of a child she is a,when his wife tells him that he is pregnant they will be sent to the hospital for him
1,there are some good performances in this movie but that 's not a thing of this,there are also some fine actors in supporting roles and the characters are really interesting
1,as movie is a very interesting one,as in the book of kells is a
1,all in all i was a great film,all in all i would recommend this movie to
1,angie dickinson plays the main role,angie 's husband is n't an actress
1,the film starts out as an intriguing movie,the movie was made in the 1990s
1,for an hour and a half you can go through the pain,for fans of the original there is something that would make it so
1,goodbye to a lot of other movies of the same name is made for the screen,goodbye from what i saw he was a great actor in his early days and was n't
1,the whole movie has a bunch of annoying teens that you,the movie was very disappointing and was just plain stupid
1,the story of the president 's relationship is,the movie has been done to death
1,i would say the same about the,i thought the movie looked alright
1,as a fan of her and she 's been looking for this film on an lp and her acting talent i am,as if he was going to be a little more fun i would have liked the movie to begin his life
1,so the movie takes a serious twist,so why does n't she use her name
1,watch it if u have to choose the,watch him instead of the bad guy
1,it 's the kind of movie that you should n't expect much from a friend from the time or a family movie,it was a little sad to be on the show and had to watch it to find out what was going on
1,every scene was the first to get shot and the actors did n't seem to work for their parts,every time i hear the name to describe his character i will be happy about his character he does not
1,the movie is about the struggle between a man and his life,the story is about a man who works on a mission against his
1,even if he makes it a part of his life he can be very,even if you 're into the 80 's it 's just that bad
1,let me start by saying that this,let me get to the end
1,you will be surprised and appalled at the end and i really do n't think that anyone would want,you 'll not want to miss this one because it wo n't take any risks of the story
1,some of the things they 've mentioned above the fact that the script is n't the worst adaptation of the book i have ever heard but the fact that the,some of the shots are pretty bad particularly as the camera is slowly static and the lighting is poor and is very choppy but overall not for the squeamish
1,pretty much anything about the movie i was n't bored to death but this film just did n't cut me enough for me because i,pretty much all of them have a big mouth in it and that they are not so good at being the most popular ones
1,i 've been very disappointed at all but the film is quite good and it should be seen,i would like to see that in real life where it could be a bit more serious
1,we have a film that tackles the lives of children who live in their homes in an abandoned community shelter,we 're all so sad that we 've never heard of the camera before us and our hero is killed by
1,his wife is a doctor that loves to make the man,his character is a bit too stiff to be true
1,tall and handsome is the best film of the year,tall and old kids and dolls who are trying to make
1,naturally the film takes a turn of the,naturally he 's an eccentric little boy
1,by the end of the movie everything seems to be a big joke with all sorts of random,by the time the credits roll out and the film 's ending suggests it 's a surprise
1,it is very hard to watch a story of this movie and it is still,it seems the film makers have done a great job and are really funny
1,but when the first one came out i,but the movie 's not that bad
1,he is the master of his own life,he is a great director and writer
1,curse of the undead is actually the first,curse of a doubt a sequel and an original
1,i am not a fan of the books but if you,i think the movie is very much of a thriller
1,the ending is an insult to anyone who loves it,the film was released in the 1980s in 1995
1,neither were the kids nor the family 's relatives nor was it about them,neither of these two movies have a very good plot and very few characters
1,that 's why i ca n't say that i 've seen,that 's right this was a pretty well made movie
1,id never heard of a movie in my life but in my opinion the,id just want to watch a show with little kids in the beginning
1,even though i did not like it i do enjoy a,even if you 're looking for a good action flick
1,his films are a bit too funny but there is n't one good thing here,his performance is so poor that you 're left wondering when he really was acting as
1,sure it 's been shot as a series of scenes and,sure there are some pretty interesting characters in the movie
1,let him not take his clothes off or walk out,let it be the first thing you have you
1,it 's a film that should never have been watched for all you,it is a movie about the lives of four families who were born
1,a lot of his fans could probably think that this is a pretty good idea but then he has it,a couple of scenes of the story are n't quite as good to watch as most other movies have
1,just for a few minutes and then you 'll,just to make a movie out of you
1,i'm glad if it 's really a sequel to the original the exorcist is an enjoyable sequel,i'm not sure what was going on in this movie but they 're all just great
1,my advice would do you like this one,my advice avoid as many of the film 's
1,however they do not show much depth to his role and his portrayal of the world is far too old for the,however that would have been the point of the movie if he 'd been cast as his brother in the movie
1,she 's not quite as sexy with her mother,she is the perfect choice for her performance and her
1,it 's a little too long but as far as i know this guy has to be a little,it 's a story of what 's wrong a movie with some great music and a good message
1,is that supposed to be part of an audience 's,is it possible to say something much more about
1,the movie is a great story about a guy with a heart and a wife,the plot was a bit confusing and the ending was pretty abrupt but it could have
1,all the actors are perfect in this,all the actors and actresses should make the
1,so this movie was probably the most disappointing i 've ever seen but this was not one,so it was like i was hoping i 'd like to hear more about this movie
1,this is a good movie and should be forgotten by the public,this may be the most important part of the movie but the plot
1,i was n't surprised by this film,i think she was the worst thing about
1,i saw this movie as a child and loved it so much,i ca n't help but wonder why the makers were there for no
1,they have to fight for a couple of seconds so they,they all make their mark and their mother and sons
1,who has the problem with this,who could n't find him at the
1,michael rooker is a very underrated villain,michael ironside also has a cameo and his
1,i was lucky enough to see this film again and again,i thought that the film was quite good but it also did
1,theresa watts is wonderful and is n't quite convincing,theresa watts has a great cameo in it
1,and for a good film with the great soundtrack of the late 18th century the end credits and especially the,and then the story of characters and characters develop and evolve with each other for no reason at all
1,i really wanted to like this movie as there are moments in a movie about the life of an artist,i 've also seen the first film and then i 've been looking at my watch a lot better
1,since the film 's only two parts feature the last of the three entries they are all in,since the original has a very good cast they seem to have been involved in this movie
1,the film 's only redeeming factor is its lack of originality and,the movie looks like it was filmed in a studio studio
1,that was not enough to save for my,that is not saying it 's good
1,if you have n't seen this you will have the patience of watching it,if you like a good horror movie watch the movie and you 'll probably find
1,once i saw a preview in my mouth she was a real artist of a film,once again he is the only one who has the ability to be a part of the
1,the film is very boring and it seems to be a ripoff of a film,the script is so full of holes that one can only assume that this is a
1,i saw this show about 20 years ago,i just saw that the film was released at
1,he has no qualms about the existence of the law,he had the ability to do the film and he was
1,i have to say if you 're not a big fan of,i was surprised when i saw this film in the theater
1,a great actor to play the lead character is not a bad actor,a film that was a very good film for the late 1980 's but
1,the movie is about an american family,the film is n't very good
1,all the actors are so good,all the actors and actresses are in
1,not the best of these two but they just do n't get to the,not that i 've seen it all and it would still be good
1,and in an attempt to capitalize on the real world of the film itself,and the fact that there is no plot just does n't make sense
1,sid banderas is the standout actor in the movie,sid mclaglen is also great as the man who was
1,never once does this show stand on its own,never mind that it 's still as good as it
1,it seems like it was a spoof of the original film the same way i watched,it is a movie that you will not regret to watch but it also offers a glimpse
1,as a result the fact that it is n't a movie is one of the few,as a movie noir i have to wonder where i will give it a chance
1,but the film is so well made i really,but then there is the ending and ending
1,and if you love movies that have,and the film was just awful
1,religion is shown in a very realistic manner and we 're in the military that 's all you need to know and,religion 's life and the life of the human population and the world in iraq has become a metaphor for all
1,oh no it was so great,oh the big surprise that the show
1,and there 's only one word for,and what 's wrong with it
1,when this movie is n't funny it 's hilarious and has a great cast of actors but i was not,when i watch a film this unofficial film has a certain charm that is rare to say the least
1,one of the first things that i noticed on about the show,one has to say that this is a very bad movie
1,being a man 's wife is one of the funniest,being a fan of the genre i expected but it would
1,unfortunately it 's the movie 's main flaw because this is n't just a vehicle for that,unfortunately he has a very nice and easygoing face that he does n't know from her
1,the film is a little dated at times but i found myself watching the entire cast,the story of the boy in the beginning who also gets into a car accident
1,you see the film in a very simple manner and the director,you can really tell the difference between it as an adaptation
1,this is a movie for everyone who loves to love movies like when they are released in the middle of the desert like that,this would be a great movie to show off for the first ten minutes or so but there is not enough of it
1,one of the most annoying films to date and a good one,one of the great aspects of the film is that it was so
1,i think the best part of this film is when the young soldier comes to the village of the,i was not impressed with this film as i was so frustrated as to not have it seen
1,the only thing this film has going for it is that it is,the actors are all very funny and the story is interesting enough
1,her character is so bad she ca n't do what she wants to be a witch,her father has to leave the house and try to find some new way to do it
1,eric stoltz and his wife are also a great asset,eric stoltz was the only reason i watched it
1,maybe that should 've stayed with me a bit,maybe you 're watching a movie about the evils
1,as much as you know it and do n't expect,as for her acting she 's still very convincing
1,my friends and i went and saw this movie for the first time,my friend and i rented it so that they can be charitable
1,also the scenes where the girl and a woman are in a restaurant and,also if you do n't get the plot do n't get me wrong
1,i ca n't imagine how people think of this movie as a great movie,i really liked it and could not be further from the truth the movie had
1,with some exceptions and an interesting cast and you have the idea of that the acting is really awful,with a plot about a group of people who were attacked by their own the killer 's mother who they
1,the story line is great and the story keeps,the film is full of funny and fun
1,first in the end the main character is the killer who,first let 's talk about the story and the characters
1,i'm amazed that this did n't work,i'm a fan of the original story
1,also it 's the type of ending where all the action moves together at a pace,also in the case of the original film the characters were introduced as the characters of all
1,the only reason for this to have been,the characters were believable enough to carry
1,slovakia is more than a little dated at times,slovakia is not a movie it is just a bunch
1,bunuel 's direction is a bit uneven the camera pans down from a distance from the director 's pov in,bunuel 's script could have been very powerful but he is n't given enough clues that make it worthwhile
1,so what do you expect from a movie that has been done without a single camera work,so i have no idea if i did n't know it when i saw the trailer but it
1,if you want to see a good story that 's funny and funny go see it,if you do n't have a great time you have to see this film to see what
1,somehow the film is not as interesting as it was,somehow it 's just that there 's no payoff
1,also a few of the characters are n't too bad,also starring john hurt as dr the famous surgeon and as
1,it 's also a very clever one but the film is more than,it is an example of how awful and awful this movie is
1,the acting is great and the actors all have their own in it,the acting in this movie is horrible and the writing and editing is terrible
1,i would have to say i enjoyed this movie so much,i love a movie that shows that he could do this as
1,also if he did n't have that the whole film would have been a,also the scene in which the hero is in the car is priceless
1,but it seems that every scene has been stolen from a different story and is a must see,but it 's a very poor movie and it would have been better if the producers had been left
1,but in this case of the story it is just about a man who kills his wife and takes his son 's home,but as the film progresses you realize that there will never be a connection between the two and the other is that
1,ling bai is a great actress not to mention that she had a lot of screen presence,ling bainter is a very good actress as the film girl is n't much more than that
1,i really liked the fact that there were a few,i was also surprised at how low i was
1,johnny is a very funny guy i ca n't recall,johnny knoxville was great and so was her performance
1,the only time i saw this series was when i was so scared,the story follows the adventures of three children who have the same name and
1,avoid unless you 're bored with bad,avoid this one at all costs
1,the only saving grace of this film is that it has a great,the actors do n't really seem to know better than their counterparts
1,i did n't really expect much at all,i do n't know where the hell the story
1,one thing you know is a pretty cool and creepy film but not quite as good as expected,one thing you can say about this film is that it 's so bad that you could watch it
1,but even then there were no other elements of this film that could make me laugh i,but the fact that he was not able to make a movie is just plain awful
1,usually i think they 're a good movie,usually the movie was n't bad and i thought
1,since the end result is a complete waste of time,since it is one of a few of his films he
1,randy 's son who has a daughter and tries to get the truth on her dad is a real shame,randy richards is a real talent to watch especially as he is in a way that is not just his usual
1,i'm sorry but this is the worst kind,i'm not entirely surprised by the story
1,all in all a waste of time and money,all the actors who appear in are very very good
1,before the first five minutes of the movie there are some very funny scenes and some funny lines that make me laugh,before then i thought of this film as being just about a little kid it was a huge waste of time
1,there is a lot of the usual hollywood humour,there 's not even one memorable moment in this movie
1,if you can find it you do n't have anything else to waste,if you like movies and are intrigued by this movie this does n't bother
1,when the show is released you are given no idea and you will be surprised to see that,when this show came out i am a fan of hers and i think they will be the one
1,you can get away with a lot of money,you do n't even try to be objective
1,unfortunately it fails so hard that i was n't,unfortunately there 's no real explanation for that
1,bunny 's life is a very entertaining and original story that is very believable in its own way with excellent acting performances from the cast,bunny looks very nice but the film itself is pretty good with the exception of a good cast of characters that are well suited for their
1,the plot is a little predictable which is basically a series of episodes in the us,the acting was great especially for the kids who did not have to play the part
1,first of all i am an atheist who likes a movie about a woman who comes out,first the acting was poor the characters were terrible and there were no attempts at comedy
1,powerful movie in every way possible,powerful enough as they have a nice
1,even if you have some knowledge of,even the actors are not bad
1,we had an indepth storyline with that in all honesty,we are told that the only thing is the way they
1,is that all there really is,is he really the only one who
1,nicely filmed acted and edited on film this is,nicely acted and acted well written and acted
1,this film just is n't very funny,this episode is a complete disappointment as is
1,however i am the first person who is so disgusted about the story of,however the movie does n't even make a statement in the first place
1,never mind a movie about a young woman that,never even get a laugh at the jokes
1,i do not recommend this movie to anybody else,i have n't watched the film so you wo n't
1,although the film is very good it remains as an adaptation of the classic classic,although not that bad i still ca n't believe this movie was ever made
1,it is just a bit different and that 's what i felt,it 's not the worst film ever made but it is pretty entertaining
1,in fact the movie has been given a good deal of money,in fact i am glad that i wasted a couple of hours watching
1,the script is pretty good it is so bad even the actors do n't do that at all the actors are decent but the movie,the movie is about an airplane that could n't have been made without a nuclear weapons or a good white dragon with a beard
1,according to imdb reviewers have been raving to the critics for,according to what they do they have a big name
1,the plot is just plain stupid,the first time he returns to the
1,the characters are all very believable,the film was made to have a
1,luckily the film is not for the faint hearted viewer,luckily that was only due to the poor acting
1,the plot was not a good one,the film has one of the most unsettling
1,in a scene reminiscent of a movie of a man being decapitated alive is supposed to have the impact of what a normal horror film,in my opinion it is a pretty good movie that should appeal to all ages especially if you have a taste for the music
1,so in a very simple way,so many great ideas and situations that
1,luckily the two brothers are killed and are,luckily the movie is a big disappointment
1,the only good scene in the movie was when the guy with the mask had to take a bullet and his wife was sitting on,the film takes a long journey in the middle ages and we 're constantly reminded of the movie in a different kind of way
1,the music of the soundtrack is excellent,the music is a joke but the rest
1,i am ashamed to have read the book,i 've seen a lot of films on my
1,what does that happen to be the fact,what is the difference of the movie
1,wild and new york is a beautiful film and it 's,wild rebels that is supposed to be a little off
1,there are a few redeeming features but the director and actor have to do it again,there are several things to admire i can honestly say that i have seen this movie many
1,so if the filmmakers were in real life in the early 90 's there were a few words for the film that made this so funny,so do n't be fooled by the rating here because i did n't see it the acting it was the worst i have ever seen
1,as i said the film is a bit slow and drags,as if you have a sense of humor and love
1,it 's a lot more funny to see,it was the second movie i saw
1,the film is about two young adults who fall in love and are married in each and every one,the acting of the two leads seemed to have been done better by a couple of years ago since their
1,maybe not in the least the acting is a little weak and,maybe it would have had a bigger star in my opinion
1,if you 're going to make a movie about a killer snowman that has to be one of the,if the plot is really interesting then it 's pretty much just a little too predictable too long
1,the music is also very fine,the film 's only redeeming feature is
1,the only drawback i had with this,the characters are likable at best
1,most of the movie has already been made,most certainly the most exciting thing to do was
1,the film does not seem to work,the film is just plain boring
1,i have n't seen this movie since a few,i was a little confused about this film
1,much of the movie involves a couple of friends who were in for a fun movie,much more than an hour and a half it 's a pretty boring and uninteresting movie which
1,there were a lot of scenes that you 'll notice in many parts and while you do get some chuckles out,there may be many spoilers and the twist ending is so bad that even it can do justice to that
1,the film has a very similar message about it and the plot is that they just ca n't make up a lot of sense of a,the only thing that is n't the most interesting aspect of this film is the soundtrack which is used as the backdrop in the book
1,they all make the most of it,they do n't have much to do
1,julie kavner who plays the husband of a great director,julie is so good in this she just is n't believable
1,my favorite character is a doctor,my friend said this movie sucks
1,good luck to all those around me,good actors and a good cast that includes
1,if only the writers of this mess had a more intelligent intention at making the movie even better the,if you do n't like the first hour you need to watch this film on the big screen
1,in this film we see his old man 's hand,in a nutshell a story of two sisters on the run
1,if you are in need of a film like this and you do n't have anything to do to get it,if you watch the film you 'll notice the fact that the film is just a vehicle on the wall
1,stereotypes are the main characters are the two characters which is the only way to end the film,stereotypes are so bad that it 's hard to believe that a person actually makes an effort
1,but in this case it 's not the same as the first film,but the film did n't get the point across my dvd to watch
1,there was a very nice scene when the,there was not a dull story line
1,both were the only ones who were able to survive the death,both actors are not very good and the director seems rather to expose
1,exactly what i was expecting a great movie,exactly how this got a dvd release in 1982
1,however it was not so easy to like a movie that had some kind,however it is a bit too much like it 's a good example
1,the movie has a certain amount of time and place but the story has a lot,the movie is a mess but you 're never watching a film that is n't
1,this is an extremely powerful piece of work,this is the most difficult role in the entire
1,aaron carter who played the lead character does n't seem,aaron 's role is the worst of the bunch
1,on a scale budget that is n't as good as the first two films of,on the other hand the film also features a little too much of that
1,the film is a complete mess,the acting is terrible the story is
1,you do n't have to have the courage to understand,you have to get to know what the film 's creators
1,the film makes a very brief statement about what is going on in,the only thing worse is that it did n't get made up
1,one of the most annoying films i have ever seen,one of the most beautiful films ever made in the history
1,the director 's attempt was to create the mood that the film had,the film is a bit slow but that 's what made the movie so
1,the cast is also very good and,the film itself is a joke
1,extremities is a movie based on a play,extremities is a film that should n't go unnoticed
1,they did a very good job of portraying,they were trying to make us laugh
1,i do n't think she 's supposed to be a hero,i love the first and least of what was being a very
1,apparently it 's a bad sign when the director 's commentary on the title says,apparently the film was shot at a cheap budget but it did n't help
1,overall this is a great little film that deserves its rightful title,overall a very dull and disappointing film about nothing but a bunch of
1,it was so predictable at a time when the,it 's really a good movie for someone
1,let your curiosity to the next paragraph,let 's make the whole thing the plot
1,to sum up this movie you have to get,to me this one should get a 210
1,it 's all a bit too long and i do n't think anyone,it was a great experience to go ahead and watch this again
1,i have no doubt that there are a few good performances but i would prefer this one to,i have heard that they were good looking but i have a lot of expectations about it
1,he has a lot of problems and he does a few good things,he was so funny and that he did n't show up at his worst
1,ostensibly the film has a very nice and very intriguing story and the performances by all actors in a movie,ostensibly in my opinion this show is a prime example of what 's happening and what a great story
1,further the movie is very different in parts to all those other shows,further it was only a very interesting episode and that 's about it for
1,this movie has its place of the title of the original,this is the best film i have ever seen the acting was
1,valli is a bit of a geena davis wannabe,valli gives this film an excellent performance for the first
1,but if this were n't enough there was a lot of nudity,but the movie is n't so much of a problem that it really
1,as for the acting in the film they are both a real bore,as in these movies the plot line of course is n't too good the
1,this film is an example of why not to make movies like this,this is not a bad movie at all it is a little slow
1,would you have a better story or a more satisfying ending,would you do it tomorrow and this movie would definitely have been
1,the story of the film is a group of friends who decide to spend some money and find a way to get a big deal together,the only thing that can make me dislike this is the fact that its almost the exact opposite movie the acting of the whole cast is just
1,you can see what the story is like,you 're not talking of the film 's plot
1,the first half hour is a joke,the story is a little farfetched
1,in the process of the first two thirds are all about the story and they 're completely unsympathetic and that 's what is missing,in this version it was not a big hit on the planet and the success of the movie was n't made to go by to
1,for example when a young girl tries to escape she is strangled by the police who she 's chasing,for a moment before the ending i was shocked and shocked to say i was not expecting too much
1,they are so stupid to see it,they are trying to kill a couple of
1,when the film comes out and its the good way we do we are treated to a very nice score,when a person is trapped on a bed and with a large head of her body she says she is dying
1,the only reason this film is so bad is because i 've been watching another movies so i,the film is a bit of a shame because the film has no point to its plot
1,attendance and then there 's this movie which is really funny and i recommend you go see this,attendance the second movie was a great hit in the park on the waterfront in my opinion
1,their performances are not good either,their only concern is the fact that
1,another character is a man who was born to play himself as an actor he was a good actor,another thing that really is missing there was probably about 10 minutes when the director tried to make a good
1,cool movie that 's about the adventures of an africanamerican and his,cool film noir and its a big disappointment on the subject
1,there is a few funny moments in the movie,there 's also a bit of gratuitous sex
1,on the other hand this is pretty much a rip off of a good example of how a,on top of that there 's a bit of nudity and some nudity thrown into the air
1,alas the movie just did n't work,alas it fails on a few levels
1,so i do n't know anything about it,so many people in the world have to say
1,gregory peck is good in this movie,gregory peck plays an ordinary cop
1,where does the money lie and the rest,where are the guys who are the first and
1,i was very interested in the subject of watching,i think he was trying to be a little too
1,i have to say that this is one of those movies i would rate 10 out of 10 just because,i saw the movie tonight and i must say i liked that but that 's how it is handled
1,the only person i saw on the show was,the first film is really a good one
1,in the meantime he befriends a young lady and her friend and child to save it from being a little more fun,in fact the film was not only directed by the master of film but the film is about the story about the love
1,my favourite scenes were when a girl who was supposed to be sexy she was talking about the movie and said she,my dad 's son is a big fat liar who wants to kill his mom but not in the best way
1,this movie is about the real problems of the characters,this is an excellent movie for a rainy sunday afternoon
1,there was no real reason to see this film so the producers forgot that a movie,there is a reason why he gets a lot of credit for making this movie
1,but the director is trying to cram his story into a new movie that,but this really should be a warning sign in an otherwise disappointing movie
1,the music is a bit stilted and the story is very poor it is,the story line had a few twists but overall it was too slow
1,some of the scenes seem very contrived but i,some of the scenes were not as funny
1,amar keitel and matthew mcconaughey are excellent as the actors and they all deliver a believable screenplay that makes a great contrast to a,amar and pa are the first to be married but they all have to deal with their lives because they ca n't act
1,soon she gets away with him for her,soon enough you know what the movie is and
1,sh and a couple of things are funny to look,sh a movie that does n't have any substance
1,never before had i seen such bad things like this,never mind that i did n't like this movie but i
1,as for the rest of the film it 's,as a movie it 's a lot worse
1,rest of the cast is pretty good especially the lead character,rest of it is just not as bad as the worst of
1,we are treated to an entirely different story which we can relate into and not,we 're supposed to identify with the characters because their relationships are the same
1,everyone else can really make up for this,everyone else is so ugly and unbelievable
1,you get a sense that you can see how,you have no idea why it was made
1,in the past it is a beautiful love story but it still does,in the past few minutes there was a brief twist that really makes me
1,it 's all there is a plot,it 's a very bad movie
1,we are not going to get into the world 's slightest success,we all know what we 're talking about because we are a part
1,we have seen the movie before but it does n't work that way as i could not,we are left feeling like we were on the screen for a few months as we were supposed
1,with his name as an assassin,with the help of mr 's daughter
1,it is n't that the movie can be so bad they,it was the first time that i 've seen it
1,unlike most other shows that were in the late 1980 's and early,unlike some of the films he made this was a good one
1,the actors were great and the script was a solid touch of acting that would have been appreciated if not for that alone they were n't,the movie is an excellent film noir of the year of a film in which the protagonist of an unnamed tailor and his men meet
1,obviously the script and the acting skills is worse than the script,obviously they are trying to cram in some deeper and more interesting concepts
1,the actors are very good but i did not really see that i,the movie 's title character is a very interesting and sensitive one
1,one of the best movies ever made to see a film that is so funny and touching to watch,one of my favorites and the next year in my life i could tell a movie made me mad and
1,the acting and plot are very good at times,the film is set about the same time in the
1,overall i would rate this movie a zero,overall not a lot of the jokes were so
1,the story and characters are believable,the acting is terrible and the story
1,he just does n't have to be,he has a long time friend but he
1,spoilers below the plot is pretty predictable in places it makes no attempt,spoilers spoilers this is about as much a case as the characters
1,like all of shakespeare 's films we get to see some of the most amazing acting in films like the others the,like most of the other reviewers i found the character very believable the story unfolds and the story line is told
1,whoever decided that i was a real person i 'd never heard of one of the actors that played the mother in this film,whoever thought the film would have been a little better if it had been given the proper script and acting as a child 's play
1,for those who have n't read the book the story is not too deep,for an hour and a half of boring filler in the middle you 'll be
1,well worth the time you watch the first 20 or 30 minutes of this movie,well i did n't care about this movie but if i was you would n't be
1,any of these characters are given such depth that you do,any fan of john woo would 've made this movie
1,i'm a fan of all the old movies and was n't afraid to give this one a miss,i'm afraid he is n't a fan of his work and is just not good not that bad he
1,i think the reason behind this movie was that it could n't possibly be so bad,i would not hesitate to give it 1 stars but they are good for it
1,john malkovich as the cop and a pretty cool actor who has always a big part of the movie does n't,john goodman is one of the most talented people he ever made and he 's very funny as mr rochester
1,he did n't know it was n't a documentary or a very good one at that,he was a pretty boy who had n't even been given his life for some years but
1,when he is a child we are left with a sense of humor that is n't always going on as to what we are talking,when the two young women get together with the family they decide to take them in the night and run amok in the night
1,the film starts out interestingly and then turns into a zombie,the plot itself could have used a better director to make a
1,i was able to find a copy of her as a kid and i think the girl,i had never heard of another movie before i was so excited i saw this movie
1,the film is a bit slow though but the performances are not as,the acting from the leads was good and it worked for me
1,adrien brody is wonderful as his father,adrien brody plays her role in one of
1,i think a few days of this movie could n't be further from the truth,i love the original but i am biased that i will give this movie a chance
1,superb and a real treat in an otherwise funny film,superb performances in a movie of the highest caliber
1,mark wahlberg plays a man who loves to love,mark harmon 's performance was a great choice
1,whichever is the only reason i do n't watch this because of a bad director and a few other,whichever one in a movie that tries to portray a real event by the people who made it
1,there 's nothing in the way of explanation about any,there was some nice photography by the whole city
1,the movie is not the best of all,the whole idea was a little rushed
1,i would advise you to avoid this unless you,i have seen a few films so bad
1,and it just seemed so ridiculous and made,and the story was just so lame
1,well the movie does n't go as planned as a true story but it is not as,well it has nothing to say and i mean even the ending was n't very interesting
1,i was not even born and raised in the middle of the movie,i have seen most of them and have read that they are very similar
1,by the end of the first half of a,by the third time this film was released
1,i saw this movie in the theater in my hometown and was blown away by its gleeful stupidity,i 've been a huge fan of anime movies but lately this one was a huge mistake in the
1,one of the best movies ever,one that is definitely one to watch
1,for me a film about the evils of war or how much it affected,for some of the reason i gave that a 4 out of 10
1,an interesting plot but not a comedy,an example is for the boy to be
1,do n't waste your money on this movie,do n't bother to read the comments but see
1,they 're all about trying to keep their clothes,they do n't care the rest of them
1,simple plot twists that have been lost so much of the film since we 're,simple people like myself who have n't seen the show yet have a clue
1,the movie opens with the main character 's death of an,the acting was terrible the script poor and the story
1,however there is some truth the film 's message and a moral and,however the film takes its cues too far from the original novel
1,unwittingly he decides to take away the offer of the town,unwittingly the entire movie is over and you can see the end
1,the acting is terrible the directing horrible even the actors,the acting is good but the acting is terrible
1,however they do not have to do what they 're doing,however the acting is poor the special effects are poor and the
1,the director was n't going to be a very nice,the cast and actresses are a bunch of pros
1,the cast are n't that bad but that 's what made it so special,the acting is n't too bad at times but it did come together to create
1,if the movie was so bad i just do n't know it would be that bad,if a movie had been made about a young woman who is n't a teenager of course
1,second this film is a total waste of time,second it was a very good show that really got
1,fardeen khan is great as a man who is,fardeen khan is wonderful as the young stud
1,otherwise it 's not a total waste of film,otherwise the rest of the cast are also fine and
1,thank you and for some wonderful scenes of the film,thank goodness for this one i have to say it 's
1,this is the worst film of 2008,this was the first time and was still
1,c'mon ok i think it 's a big waste of time,c'mon so if you 're not an asian and want to see
1,and for the longest time i did n't find a copy of it to be,and if you do n't want to watch it you are n't missing anything
1,and for a few reasons i found this movie to be an awful,and i am just trying to find it on dvd every time
1,if you 're going to try this movie will not disappoint,if you 've seen the original movie you will find yourself asking
1,vood is a great show even the comic book is better than the other episodes,vood is the only person who gets into something he is no longer alive
1,i love the movie and the characters are very different,i would love to get to this site on a dvd
1,i really loved seeing the original frankenstein movie and i think this was his first sequel,i had n't seen this movie in years but i was n't impressed that it was n't
1,i would give this movie a 7 star rating but there 's still a few good things to say about this movie,i would advise you to watch this movie and watch it again on the scifi channel i will never tire of
1,is it a movie or a tribute to the old,is this the worst movie i have ever seen
1,there is an interesting and very very very strong story,there is a lot of action in it though
1,maybe she is trying to make a point of a better movie,maybe the story is good for the kids but not in a movie
1,there 's an element of this film that made me,there are times they are all over the place
1,and if you like it you can,and the ending was very anticlimatic
1,a must see for all young adults,a group of people try to locate the
1,me it 's not a bad movie,me just saw it yesterday and loved it
1,i think that it is one of,i was surprised in this film
1,there was no reason that we were able to see the movie,there are some very funny scenes and the end result is a hoot
1,morris gets to the bottom of all of his,morris is a fine actor in the film
1,for anyone who does n't like this film then you can do love this film,for those who have just finished and are looking for the film i have no idea
1,this is what makes movies movies such as the ones,this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,surprisingly the movie was n't funny in parts but it is not,surprisingly i 've seen quite a few films that are pretty good and
1,thankfully the story is really a complete bore,thankfully this film was n't made at all and
1,when you have read the novel that has to be seen to be believed,when this movie is being on tv it 's almost impossible to see the whole
1,how many times can i be,how does it manage to get a
1,an amazing movie about a true story and one of the most moving stories i 've ever seen,an excellent film that had the potential to be the first and only the greatest movie of the year
1,the plot has some pretty weak elements but there is plenty of action the movie,the characters are n't likable or likable and are n't fleshed out at all
1,and it also makes for some interesting action,and it 's all about the characters
1,110 rating 410 rated r for graphic violence strong language strong female language,110 rated r rated r for violence and profanity content and violence
1,of course it 's a good thing,of course when the movie ended i did
1,sheba has to do with this,sheba is the one who steals the
1,you wo n't want to watch this show and even want to talk about the ending and you 'll find yourself laughing at every character you 've ever met who you cant possibly remember but they are good,you 'll want to watch this because if you want to watch a good film with great acting and good directing and not having a good story or good acting and not even bad actors in the cast give
1,this is just a waste of time and money,this is the only film that can have made its
1,instead of just getting into the case with his friend he 's an,instead she does n't do a better job than in the book
1,3 the story is pretty predictable,3 it is very long in the
1,so if you have ever seen any of the other comments here,so the first half a half hour was n't even that bad
1,belushi gets a chance to help a friend who is forced to go to a,belushi makes a good villain as the head and the character is very likable
1,they should not have given this a movie the extra 10,they had been making the same mistake twice as i have read
1,in this case the film opens with an aging female protagonist and a woman who decide to make a fool out of themselves,in a brief scene the movie goes on a bit too long with a voiceover narration that is n't worth praising but in one
1,for the most part the music was excellent,for that matter alone it 's a bit disconcerting
1,the director does a nice job of making a movie that is,the story line is n't exactly a good one at that
1,a lot of the dialog is just plain bad,a lot more to the film is the plot of
1,the only way to keep you from watching this trash was that it was a huge waste of time,the whole film is set to a climax that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie
1,the story is n't really any more about these two guys and their differences,the whole plot line is ridiculous and is n't interesting in some parts
1,the story is quite interesting with the help of his wife who seems to be the only person in the entire movie who is a total outcast,the characters were believable and the story was a bit thin but i really feel that there 's a lot of interesting work in the story
1,however in the movie we get to see his character 's character 's reaction,however it does have a few moments which is why they are all so boring
1,i think if someone is going to show it to them the,i ca n't think of a worse film worse than this
1,on the other hand the film looks quite a bit like a typical hollywood production but the characters,on the other hand the performances are good at best and it 's not even that great
1,the movie is full of action and action,the acting is n't all that funny
1,in a way this film has its moments to make it a,in fact i think that this film is one of many
1,movies were so stupid and pathetic that i decided to watch them,movies that make no sense to anyone but have a feeling in the
1,i had a lot of fun watching it,i have been on a trip through europe and
1,or if you can find a copy on the shelf,or maybe you 're too stupid to admit how much the
1,i 've seen worse from start to finish and i was expecting to be moved at the start of the movie,i am so upset to learn that the movie would be so good as a sequel to that of the original
1,naturally you know it 's a bad movie but it 's not so bad it 's good,naturally the film has a few faults and some of the scenes where we are talking about a
1,the story starts out pretty slowly but then we follow two friends who have problems that have been developed in a dysfunctional way by the other members of the,the whole point of the film is that it 's a little confusing and it shows the whole story as it takes place in the first world war
1,most of the action takes place in a lake and the movie is not about,most viewers will find it uncommon for the viewer to see and hear them
1,as far as a horror movie it 's pretty good,as to who the killer is in the book i have
1,this is a movie you could watch for you to do,this film makes a statement that i would have thought i 'd
1,this movie is really really just bad and i think it has the worst,this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,what a great film it 's,what i like about a classic is
1,to me they were really all too stupid to be the hero and were the most unlikable character,to be sure of this movie they 've made a very bad movie in which the main character says
1,unfortunately he does not get to the point and,unfortunately this film is not one of those
1,it 's like it 's a lot of fun,it 's a shame since this movie is not
1,mr and mrs have a crush that 's so full of energy you have to,mr moto who is also in it and the movie was a total disappointment
1,director paul mazursky has crafted a story that has its flaws and the actors of a great film are always excellent,director william cameron menzies has a very small cast with the camera and the camera moves at the camera and the shots
1,perhaps i 've already seen him in his movies,perhaps a better version of the story is a bit
1,2 the plot is simple as is the direction,2 the story is really bad as a story is
1,it is so bad that it 's not even funny,it was the only good performance in a small part and
1,the plot was so bad that it could 've,the script is so weak it becomes comical
1,this is the third movie that i,this is my favourite movie ever
1,gaynor is an american who does not like to dance and,gaynor 's character and the film have an interesting plot
1,matthew broderick and michael keaton are excellent in this film but,matthew mcconaughey is a great actor and makes it interesting
1,but it is not worth it,but the only thing that kept me
1,soon a young man named carl is sent by an army agent to locate his wife 's wedding in the mountains of his death,soon the movie goes with a bunch of guys and the director does an ok job of showing us more than it is
1,however i really did n't find it entertaining at all,however if you are going to make a horror movie about
1,the movie had a lot of potential and the actors could have pulled a better cast in it,the film is quite short and the plot twists are so obvious and poorly handled that we 've seen
1,for some reason i felt that he was trying to find the killer,for a film about the dangers of a man who loves a person who
1,yes he gets a little hokey but the fact that he plays one of the great characters and the character is not really a real,yes i know there is no point in this movie but if you watch it you wo n't have to go through your brain
1,the film is a very dark but very interesting experience and the ending as,the whole point of this documentary is the same as i said before
1,but if your like an adult you should check out the film for yourself,but it 's too much a good way to pass a time to time
1,confess it 's not that bad but at least it makes some sense,confess to the fact that it 's not even worth seeing because it is
1,on this site a very interesting movie is given in it 's own way the film is one of my favorites,on a technical note it 's quite nice to see the actors portraying some of what is in the future
1,the script by david martin is a joke and the ending is,the music is good the editing excellent the costumes are perfect
1,somehow the story is rather weak and i felt that this was,somehow the story has some nice twists and turns to it
1,the first half of this film is an interesting piece of film,the main plot is pretty bad the script is predictable and the script
1,robert redford is an extraordinary actor and he,robert redford 's character is a caricature
1,involuntarily this movie is a must see,involuntarily speaking of his acting talent she 's
1,in the opening scene a lot of people go out of the theater and are trying to make a good movie,in the movie a man who was responsible for a murder on the street was trying to get to the bank and
1,for one thing the film is full of clichs,for anyone else i have read the book and seen
1,in the end we learn more about the man and his son in this movie,in the end there are numerous scenes that are so badly filmed that it seems to
1,as usual i could have lived and i could make more sense,as the film progresses we follow a series of events that are addressed
1,so do yourself a favor and rent it,so when this was made available to us it
1,that scene was probably in the beginning when the main villain was,that 's why it was not available on dvd for free
1,a little of a great start but it 's not the kind of film that has been repeated for all the other reviewers,a few minutes into the film the viewer feels as if someone just sat right on the bed and switched out of the movie
1,but the movie has a lot of problems,but when the first scene is about to play
1,curiously it is the best show ever on television,curiously he does n't do any serious tasks at all
1,first of all i have the feeling that,first off it just makes no sense
1,this film is so bad it 's embarrassing,this is one for the whole family
1,it 's like that was made with a camcorder,it 's almost impossible to believe that someone would make
1,it does n't have the depth of the plot and,it 's like he did n't know about him
1,tim robbins as the father is great,tim curry is a great actor and is
1,however the main attraction in this episode is the character of the young boy played by tom,however i thought it was one of the worst horror movies ever made on my dvr
1,so i would n't mind the ending to a film but it,so when i first saw this movie i was very sceptical
1,the acting was horrible and the direction was so poor,the film itself had me in tears and tears
1,the story concerns a man named sandy,the plot is a complete mess
1,the director is trying to get the film out of the way,the film is about a man who kills his wife and gets away
1,we are all a part of this film so do n't we have to pay attention to our lives for the next hour,we learn that he is a man and then he goes for some sort of redemption which is n't only due to his actions
1,unfortunately there are no redeeming qualities in this flick,unfortunately the film seems to have a great deal of
1,in the end the movie never rises above any other,in this one he was n't quite that much of a
1,a few other films are made on some kind of pc and they are n't even a good b,a few times a bit of one is still waiting for a good film to work at night
1,it 's one of those shows that are actually quite humorous,it 's a pity that the director did n't have to make
1,the plot is simple and you can tell the difference between the 2 is so good,the acting is n't as good or better than the other bad movies like this
1,this is an interesting story of a woman and her two,this is a great documentary for all lovers of cinema
1,he 's never seen and he seems to,he was just not that much different
1,his character is also an interesting character and,his role here is n't even convincing
1,as the movie reaches a high point in its head of it 's two main characters is the first,as for the script well this was the kind of movie that was made with a few words and the
1,all the characters were likable likable and i thought the movie was,all right it was like a tv series or the movie
1,goya has not just been so upset with his daughter and in that time and age she feels,goya is no slouch of this man that was in fact the one i wanted to watch
1,manages to avoid at the cost of the movie,manages to get a few good laughs from this one
1,i was expecting something better from a movie to be shot,i did n't know what to expect when i saw it
1,please do not waste your time and your money and you 'll get this movie,please do n't waste your time watching this movie if you like that one
1,nine hours later when the movie started it 's not even really bad,nine years after they have been born with a big house he does n't
1,and it 's really a pity that all the sequels have a huge number of people,and the plot is just a little bit confusing but for the most part the movie is
1,the story line has been told the most obvious and is not quite an issue as the film portrays is so boring,the story revolves around the relationship between her mother and her daughter with the same woman as the mother 's son
1,yeah there are some great moments in this episode but it 's just a bit,yeah i'm not a fan of it or am it really a horror movie
1,however if they had to take a few more rewrites to give an interesting story and a rewrite of the script in which they would,however the film has very little to say except for the first 15 minutes the film is just a bunch of random random characters
1,an insult to the whole cast is the,an excellent cast and a solid cast
1,i 've never seen a film like this before,i think i could write a better movie
1,there have been a number of comments about how to describe the film as if a,there 's a lot of the usual horror stuff that is being covered at all
1,but he did a lot of research of this,but that 's just the way it is
1,i could have had a sense of what it,i do n't recall the name of it
1,i do wish that she could be a little too infatuated with the character she is,i just wish i could pick up the volume and get my hands on video
1,it 's a nice surprise to see a movie that has nothing to recommend,it seems that the actors from the show have their own unique talent
1,definitely the funniest episode of the show ever,definitely worth it if you want a good scare
1,i was looking forward to watching this,i ca n't even believe this is a
1,well it has its own funny moments the story was interesting and had great characters and,well i do n't remember much about this movie it was not funny at all
1,of course you get to see the man who was supposed to be a woman because he knew she was not a very,of course this is one of those movies that actually had a certain amount of potential and was n't at all good
1,ultimately he 's a very human character in,ultimately the characters are not developed well
1,more importantly this is not your everyday movie and a good one,more than enough to make a good movie is a little confusing
1,we have to wait there in the end as we see her and of,we all know it all the best in the history of our minds
1,have they ever seen such a beautiful thing,have n't we got an item in the way
1,the movie is just like the first film,the story line is not really bad and its
1,do they really matter what a stupid person you may,do not be fooled by the film 's rating
1,it 's hard to imagine a movie like this to be a bad movie,it 's not as though it 's a remake of the movie the original play
1,an excellent film with a great cast and a truly exceptional supporting cast,an interesting and intriguing story of an orphan that is brought to life by
1,the plot is that an outsider is born in a remote village where people are trapped in,the acting was good in the first 15 minutes but the storyline was not very good
1,it was a very funny movie,it 's not a big budget movie
1,also the fact that it is in the film is not a compliment to the,also the film is so boring that i actually feel embarrassed for the writer
1,at least they could be good in,at least for some of it
1,the plot is not all that bad and the acting is pretty good,the movie opens with a couple of scenes that make you wonder how all
1,but this is one of the more disturbing things of the show,but if you 're looking for good horror you 'll not like this
1,common the same year the film is set during its own run time and the,common sense to this film is that the writers could n't have made it
1,this film is a waste of 90 minutes of my life,this story was so bad that was so bad that i thought
1,a man raised by her parents and the only other person,a good film if you want a good horror film
1,this film is a must for anyone looking for something different to a western,this one has to be the worst most amateurish piece of crap i 've ever
1,the plot is weak the dialogue is terrible and the plot,the film also stars peter o'toole as the title character
1,if there is a flaw in this movie is n't the direction,if you 're looking for something like an actual movie i do n't
1,the film is a complete failure not to mention its a little bit slow and boring,the plot of this movie is quite simple but the performances of the leads is n't all
1,and for a few other minutes to be killed,and what a wonderful movie to see it
1,apart from the acting this movie is not so much of a surprise that i did n't find a way to,apart from a few moments i liked the characters and their chemistry the characters all developed a very believable dimension
1,why did n't any character development not only,why would you want to be entertained
1,in the last few weeks of our country 's life we 're led into thinking that the,in the first five minutes i was n't convinced i was in trouble of watching this
1,this movie is very much a rip off of his earlier works,this movie is about a young girl named seita who is trying to
1,if you want to watch a good action movie do n't bother renting this,if you 're a fan of the comic book or just a fan of the
1,the film takes a very interesting turn and turns it back down,the movie is full of clichs and the acting is terrible
1,and the plot is a little convoluted and has many twists,and in this film this is not a film for those of
1,still he was able to get to the truth that the man was the father of the son,still this is a very fun movie not as good as the original in its own right
1,betty zuniga was pretty funny but she did n't even try to,betty kudrow plays a young daughter who comes across her home
1,the film has some excellent actors but it is very well acted and has very good performances,the acting is superb but the film is quite slow with all the things you want to know
1,it 's like a big budget,it is an amazing little film that
1,befriended by a few people and the movie seems a little out of place but,befriended by all of the other characters i 've seen from the previous two
1,clearly i was looking for a few scenes that would make this film a success,clearly the filmmakers and producers decided to do an interview in the first place and the
1,except my mother and i have watched it over and over again,except for the opening titles the director was obviously a director
1,erika eleniak 's character is as strong and strong as any other actor,erika is an innocent woman living on a widowed planet with her husband
1,this film is a perfect example of why this is n't,this is definitely one of the best and best documentaries of a
1,the film is n't really anything but it 's worth watching,the only one that should have been made was the fact that
1,but i really do n't like this movie,but then the rest of the crew are all
1,elias 's performance in his other films is superb in this movie,elias koteas was excellent as the sheriff and the supporting cast are great
1,good idea but it is n't,good acting great direction and wonderful direction
1,it was a great job for him to come back to this movie and make it,it is n't that the acting is bad but this is not one of them
1,sure there is little to this but that is not a good thing,sure enough a little girl is a young woman but also an ardent friend
1,my friend said this movie is a masterpiece and the fact,my advice is to find a copy of this one
1,it is an odd piece of art,it would seem a bit unfair to make
1,the story was so predictable and the acting was horrendous,the movie is about the rise of the rich boy in
1,he has been given the assignment by an unknown cast of characters and a story that is a little too long,he was supposed to be the father with some people in it and also why did the people he chose
1,it 's like watching a train wreck and it 's a real stretch for the whole thing and it 's a great deal of fun,it 's a great mystery with some very funny scenes with the two brothers being whipped by a bunch of guys from the woods
1,moreover i am a fan of the work,moreover it 's not the best action film i
1,the film is a true story about a,the film is not a complete disaster
1,all of my favorites for the film are the very end which was one of the few movies i saw and the movie was very bad,all this was done to make a good film and the fact that i had a great time watching it was just fun and made me think
1,overall it seemed like the production value was too high for a low budget production,overall it is a good movie and it 's just amazing how they put such great
1,we are not supposed to be horrified by it the whole time,we do find ourselves being told of the man who killed his mother
1,i am amazed to see that there is a lot of,i was shocked at the amount of praise involved here
1,charisma is not the case with the movie,charisma and timing make this film enjoyable and memorable
1,sending your own conclusions or leave,sending the audience the movie is very
1,i think that the producers should be ashamed,i saw this movie with my children and they
1,the film is a real stinker that i could n't take anymore,the acting was good with the entire cast and the acting is pretty
1,john huston also stars as a psychiatrist from texas,john krasinski did a good job with a character that
1,this show just did n't make up for,this show was really awful even worse
1,at the end of the movie the audience becomes increasingly confused that the film should never end,at first this movie is a masterpiece but also very realistic as well and in the end a
1,however this is a minor flaw,however that 's the way we feel
1,with his wife in the family she decides to help her and her family,with his own little brother he 's been a bit too old for this part
1,what a waste of talent and talent,what is wrong with the movie
1,as for the film itself this is an extremely low budget film that should be released in any form of a video store for years,as it turns out the film is n't a total rip off of a horror movie the first and most important but in the end the
1,the script is about the family of young adults who live in a big mansion,the film begins the same but it has the same sort of dark atmosphere that made
1,directed by a great screenwriter and a very strong cast,directed at the first five years in the film festival this
1,unlike in many other films i have been looking for a classic movie that is,unlike the others i think this is the most realistic film you will see
1,why would a person be the killer to a man who,why was it such an emotional choice for everyone involved
1,the acting was n't bad but it was,the story line is good as well
1,anyway i did find this movie to be like a bad comedy,anyway this is a good movie to watch in one way or another
1,but i have to disagree with the other comment that there are some people in the theater,but if you 're not a fan of the book this is a movie for you
1,howard hughes is also excellent in the role,howard hughes was a great leading lady
1,we get a glimpse of the main,we all get to see this
1,the film is set in paris with the beautiful barbara stanwyck as a young,the movie has to make an excellent statement of how important things change
1,the cast did n't really add much to the story and i was impressed,the story is about a bunch of young girls who go to america and meet
1,absolutely awful is the acting of the,absolutely terrible script and poor editing
1,like i said the movie was just boring and was the only real,like the first one the story line does have a good message
1,heart is a very good show,heart warming is n't all that bad
1,i had hoped that the filmmakers and director could improve them more than anything would suggest,i was surprised that she 's able to get away with her role in that time
1,2 the actors were in the background,2 a good story of two sisters who
1,unfortunately i had my doubts about the movie and its very low key of some of its shortcomings,unfortunately the whole thing is like a train wreck where it 's just the same old same old and
1,my suggestion is that you can see this film in a different light,my suggestion for a great movie for me to recommend this flick to me
1,directed by a very beautiful writer and actress and directed by robert ryan,directed by john ford and directed by the wonderful edward l cahn this is
1,there is not one thing that can come close,there is nothing inherently funny in the film
1,for a start of this movie 's life he 's a teenager but he seems to be a,for one exception there 's a little bit of a lot of action to satisfy the characters
1,if that 's the case here 's what they would like to give credit to all this and then it 'll make a movie,if they wanted to make a movie about what they were doing in the movie i would just have to be subjected to the ones
1,this film is so bad it is funny as hell,this movie was one of the most popular tv shows from
1,no one can deny the obvious and obvious danger of this movie and it 's not as good as,no matter what you watch the movie it 's a joy that you 'll have a good time
1,they are both excellent and i ca n't imagine how,they are all in a rut of the kind
1,wes craven also makes one of those films that can be compared,wes craven has a new look at how it is possible
1,life lesson for the next day is,life has become an instant classic
1,watching this and the fact that the cast are not so good and their performances is also very convincing considering the talent they portray here,watching this movie i was shocked that the film was made at all and i do not believe that a film of the sort would be
1,i was n't sure about the movie 's lack of plot twists but this was,i was hoping it would be as good a time as the first one
1,to me this is what the director wanted to do with the story,to me it 's a great family movie with a few laughs but you
1,it could have been so good,it does n't even matter if you
1,are also there to make a sequel,are those who are n't in the right
1,what is the difference between the actors and the actors,what was more amazing was that the script was not developed
1,they all have two different roles,they 're all the same old same
1,let 's be honest we can only watch this movie and i hope they will continue to rerelease it to see more of this movie,let me count the ways that the character of lenny is portrayed so eloquently that there is no story and characters to be understood
1,i am also impressed with the fact that this one was shot in,i was shocked by the story and the actors for this production
1,tatiana lake 's performance is very nice as the young sister of this young family,tatiana is as usual a character as she has a gift to her husband
1,i really did n't care about the characters they were supposed to be in their first film but then we have to be one of my favorites and i,i ca n't really believe any movie is made as the worst of them or even a sequel as a director is n't the worst in film history
1,it has a lot of potential to,it was just a poor movie
1,this was one of the worst movies i 've ever seen,this is not the worst piece i 've ever seen
1,i love it so much that i have seen it on tv in the states,i am a huge fan of the original movie and that was a good idea to
1,how could they possibly have put the name to them,how can these people say they know it 's the right
1,the story of a woman 's life in london and the life of,the story is told very well and it is n't the story
1,indeed the two men are just not as good and evil as the,indeed the movie makes you feel like you are from the beginning
1,unlike most of the previous reviewers i thought the movie was a mess,unlike the other movies that were made in the 80 's the movie is
1,that 's a pity because it was a great movie with,that 's where all the shortcomings come in the plot
1,in a scene a group of people are fighting against them and it,in fact they did n't know what to do with the plot
1,how can a film in its first,how does it make me laugh
1,goldie is one of the first movies that i have seen so far and it 's hard for me to say,goldie hawn in this film was a delight to watch the way she plays and does n't give it anything to do
1,anyway i would have preferred to see more of the original cast members and crew,anyway in the end it is just one of those movies that really is worth the
1,this should 've been a good movie,this is a great show because it 's
1,read a book for some of the same characters as you watch the movie,read a biography of the story you are in for a good ride
1,on the other hand it has to be the funniest film i have ever scene to a film,on the whole this is one of the greatest shows i have ever seen and i 've never seen
1,it is not a movie like this but it 's not as much as a movie,it also has a very good cast of characters that make you care about them because the
1,do n't waste your time with the movie for some bucks,do n't bother the acting in this movie is not bad
1,she 's in the house as she is the best friend in a bar,she did n't have enough money to keep her interested in his role as the
1,if you 've not read the book you 'll know what the movie,if that does n't happen then we 're not all the same
1,i did n't find the acting of the character to be particularly convincing and the actors in the film do n't seem to know how important the acting,i was hoping this movie was going to be an insult to the intelligence that was coming in for making such a film but it failed miserably
1,burt reynolds in the role did n't seem to be trying too hard to be an actor,burt reynolds plays the villain who plays the father on one hand and he gets away
1,venom 's character is an interesting one,venom is n't always the case
1,even for a movie called the last few days i,even the most ardent fans will have this film
1,it 's hard to say that this guy has anything that 's ever,it was a very interesting story and the director seemed to work
1,syndrome is a movie of an acquired taste it has to,syndrome is a good movie but is n't that good
1,sort of a remake of the novel that made the original,sort of like the first meeting of the main protagonist
1,how about making a great movie,how could they not have made this
1,on a scale of 1 to 1 i gave up on this movie,on second visit he meets a woman who works in a supermarket
1,tony todd as the chief and the young man has the same ability to look as if he were n't the,tony curtis who played the mother who is so funny in the film as being annoying is a complete jerk
1,they did so much better with the original,they both have a big secret agent
1,the acting is bad but the plot is so predictable that i almost forgot the plot holes that it,the movie is not about a man who is in the army and his wife is very shy
1,there 's even not much of a plot to speak of,there was not enough money to explore this film for me as
1,i have the impression that the makers of this,i thought the script was weak and boring
1,he makes me feel as though he 'd been on a mission to be an extra in the film industry,he is a little shy and his father is one of the most powerful characters of the 90 's and his
1,it 's really funny for the younger generation,it also features an amazing soundtrack featuring a great
1,so what if it was n't,so the first film has a good
1,it was one of those films that you,it was also a very moving show
1,although a very important role in this series is the part she is played in the same scene her performance,although the story is not entirely a problem the characters of their parts seem to come from different backgrounds
1,for all of those movies i was very surprised at the low ratings for this movie,for instance when a young woman tries to leave him dead she gets his comeuppance
1,it was very funny and really made you laugh,it is a shame that the director and writer chose
1,but the only thing it seems to be,but this is a really bad movie
1,to give up the rest of the story is just plain lame,to be a movie like this the best thing is that i do
1,presenting it to a person who is a little afraid to use his own knowledge of his life,presenting the world 's finest and its strongest moments are that it seems to be a spoof of sorts
1,however it is a very interesting film and an excellent film that,however for its viewers who can identify between the two movies
1,several of the scenes are so much better than that of the original,several people have to be a big fan of any horror flicks and this
1,coaches and gentlemen were not allowed to do this but it seems they 're not a big,coaches are always very good and i really hope they are all good friends and families
1,with the movie that was made in germany the film still works as the film,with all the misery of her first film she is a woman who has a sexual
1,it 's one of those films that you want to watch and then watch and laugh at,it is about the only character that is the main character and the two leading ladies
1,although the film has some of its own elements of the novel you have to remember that the ending is a bit contrived and not particularly shocking,although there were some pretty decent performances in the movie that were pretty good the first time i felt she was a part of me i felt cheated
1,the story follows a little boy who works in the field of the city,the story is n't too bad it 's not believable enough or clever
1,also the story of the book is very different,also the acting is terrible the dialog is awful the
1,i was so excited to see the first film and i did not watch that many of these actors,i was really impressed by this film which was probably meant to cash to in a good book
1,could i get my hands on this,could be a good idea for the movie
1,there were a few funny moments of humor and some funny moments that i did not see,there are no other actors in this film that have been put together in the roles
1,the only one i saw i enjoyed was the end where the guy was on a train,the story itself is just as well done as its predecessor and it is well done
1,choosing the two main characters in the series is to make,choosing the film with a lot more plot and characters
1,so in fact i am a fan of david lynch 's and,so why did this movie even look like the first two
1,halfway through the movie you realize that this has happened to her and she soon,halfway through the film he is forced to confront himself as an action star
1,basically you might not think about the fact that,basically all in all not a bad remake
1,as an added bonus note i do n't want to see the rest of it in the film theaters on this site,as for the movie 's faults its a little confusing as a whole i think it is not the worst film
1,instead of being a bit of a jerk i think she is very convincing,instead of being a bad movie this is a terrible terrible film that should n't
1,to see how the movie could possibly be seen by the way would have been a much more accurate and compelling movie about a group of,to make matters worse the film 's plot is too thin and the characters too much the plot is too thin to be fully coherent
1,the main problem with this episode is that it makes the film unnecessarily boring with the annoying,the plot has so many twists and turns that you do n't care about the characters
1,and for my money it made me squirm,and when it was n't a great movie it
1,it 's a very nice idea that there should be a sequel to this movie,it 's a shame they had more talent in their career and they all made an
1,a lot of the story is not very funny,a movie about a true love story is about the
1,i'm glad i did get to see the end of the film,i'm sorry for the actors and crew who have the right choice and
1,just to keep a straight face to the end,just because the film could be a bit scary i
1,the plot is simple the actors are not convincing the characters are all onedimensional and they do not seem to get out of the story,the actors are so bad they should have won their hearts award but even they had trouble adjusting to the big deal at this point and
1,since the original series is a bit farfetched in places but the first part is very different to the others in which the characters,since the beginning was so horrible i could not help i delighted to go through that part of how to write a movie
1,i think i was a little bit surprised by the fact that the story of a young man who is so,i 've seen the first of this series but i could n't get into the first movie of the film
1,i really wanted to know how that changed the story,i have heard of the dvd 's but this movie does
1,as for all that the acting is superb,as a result of a very good performance of
1,i am a fan of the genre for many years,i am a big fan of the original so i was
1,however in this case the movie is pretty good the cast is excellent and they try to make this a real,however it is not only the funniest acting performance by all of the cast but also the very excellent performances
1,really the movie is an embarrassment to the intelligence of all people,really one of the great movies to watch but i did n't think
1,this film is the most accurate film ever made because it was so bad,this film was a bit disappointing and could n't have been made in any way
1,also i was quite impressed with it and the story i saw,also the scenes where two people are killed and they are talking about
1,meat loaf gives me an extra time,meat loaf is a wonderful piece on the
1,it is all about the same thing as i 've done a thousand times with the original play and that of the original version,it 's almost like a bunch of the other characters are just sitting around watching this movie because it 's not scary not even worth
1,there is a great score and some truly memorable images in this film,there are a few things i 've seen in my life that you can
1,but i do n't understand how he is trying to,but it was a nice little movie to watch
1,all the main characters are not so likable as i could,all i can say is this movie is n't funny
1,i 've heard some negative comments but i did n't want to miss the first one,i would never give it a high score but if you 're not a diehard fan of
1,seems as if this was meant to be a good film but was n't that good or interesting,seems to me it 's more than just a drama and the characters are completely different from other films
1,ariel and her father are the only ones,ariel gets caught up in the investigation
1,still it is a great movie,still it 's a movie to give
1,i was looking forward to seeing this movie,i have to agree with the comments that say
1,this was a very bad movie,this film also features an excellent story
1,there is an attempt to explore the relationship of a girl by the end of the movie,there are so many holes in this movie that it hurts me to tears at them
1,this is probably one of the worst films i 've ever seen,this was the first film i 'd ever walked out of
1,i have never watched the movie but i was not bored at the time,i think it 's an interesting movie that it 's funny and the way its
1,and this is a classic comedy,and the story is great as is
1,and if you do not want to know and enjoy this movie,and then a lot of the jokes are funny so there 's nothing
1,i am sure that the film makers had n't done the book,i was really disappointed to see what happens to the characters
1,so it 's not all good,so it 's a bit long but
1,then when she meets up with one of her girlfriends he decides to go on the run after the other boys who are trying to kill,then again it just seems to be a bunch of people trying to get out of the building and go back to america 's past
1,however i do n't know how anyone could possibly enjoy a good action movie,however it 's so bad and so badly made that you ca n't even be
1,so this movie is one of the great mysteries,so the whole concept of the film is very good
1,well i was in fact it was a bit cheesy,well this is a film that is not even worth seeing
1,but i am glad she did not give her to the role of,but the film is so bad that it is not even fun
1,this is a story of some of the greatest known characters in history,this is the first film on the card that i have owned for my
1,because the script and the characters make no sense,because the only one that does that is the whole
1,if you were a kid this movie would really make you laugh,if you know anything is a bit of an exercise and you 're
1,unlike most reviewers it 's hard to believe this movie is a comedy or just an allout thriller,unlike other films of this type it is a shame that the movie is n't really a bad movie
1,the film begins out with the girl being murdered by the monster but in an odd scene the movie descends into a zombie with,the cast of all is not bad for the most part but i would n't mind seeing this film in my local library
1,answer to a very good movie,answer to that question would be a
1,back then we have to wait for a movie to go on a good date to find it,back in the 1980s this was a very bad film but the one in the dark was the original
1,it 's not even all it does,it 's not worth your time
1,i saw this film in a theater theater where,i was in the military watching this movie
1,in the end though it is difficult,in fact the movie has a lot of
1,the script is quite engaging and the plot twists are very good,the plot involves one of the most beautiful women of all time and
1,how come they ca n't be allowed,how the hell is this film going to
1,taskin and his mother 's wife are also the two sons,taskin does not even have an affinity for the family
1,the ending of the film is a joke for me it feels like a film school play,the story follows a lot of the events the people and the problems of the people in this
1,only the movie is a joke but is worth renting,only in the end we see the end of the movie
1,a good idea for a movie about a man trying to find his brother is a good thing that is n't,a group of young children are kidnapped by a group of bikers who get picked out and a man who is n't
1,i do n't mind a great movie but i 've seen the first three films i 've seen,i 've never seen a film that looks like a cross between the past and 'the old west
1,it is about two people who go to,it was just a waste of time
1,his character had some good acting skills but in the end,his character does n't really know what they are doing
1,end spoilers ahead i 'll tell you why,end of spoilers and a few others have done
1,the movie is n't that good it was n't even scary,the script was so full of clichs that i almost fell asleep
1,worst thing about this movie is the performance of the girl who is the main character of the movie and is just a bit bland,worst of all there is the fact that there is a bit more of a story in the plot and characters that it 's based on
1,he is the only actor that can act and he 's very convincing especially since he is,he has a daughter and they 're all the ones who seem to be in trouble
1,they 're a bit of a threat to the viewer 's intelligence,they should have taken us more and more to a place
1,rude and boring that was just plain annoying,rude and disgusting the only good thing the series
1,the main problem is the ending which is quite frankly good,the movie is about the journey between two people and it really
1,despite the fact that the main characters in the series were the only ones who were willing to go,despite this is the most obvious aspect of the film the plot is pretty good to the makers
1,both were very funny and i enjoyed this show so much,both men are very believable and they are very good actors and
1,if anything you do n't like it in this one though because it is the story of,if you know where you 're going then you 'll have no place to watch this
1,happy gilmore of his family is his brother in the world 's oldest,happy gilmore is a really fun film about a mysterious and murderous woman who
1,on the other hand this was an awful movie,on top of that the movie 's a complete mess
1,however this movie is not that good,however it never made much sense
1,fred astaire 's role in the movie is as bad as it gets from,fred gwynne is a man who works wonders on his new zealand heritage
1,the first two were the one of the worst films i 've,the plot is very thin and the ending is so bad
1,sure it was very funny but it was n't,sure the film is dated and the characters are n't
1,the film has some nice shots and an effective soundtrack including the,the cast were n't that stupid the story did n't work
1,i have to agree with the other commentators that the cast is a complete mess,i saw a glimpse of the film on the tv guide and found it in a
1,i would have liked to see the movie again,i think that it would have been a mistake if
1,bambi 's final showdown with the giant robot is just a,bambi 's father is a man who 's a child
1,well they 're trying to escape from the police station,well that 's how you can see this movie
1,the plot was very interesting a must see,the acting was great the plot of the first
1,the movie is an extremely bad piece of garbage from the beginning,the only reason to watch this film is because you 're not so
1,with his performance i felt sorry for him,with only a few exceptions the movie is pretty
1,this film was so awful it was so bad that it would be an embarrassment,this movie has its faults but it 's not the worst in this genre
1,but the movie is so bad that,but that is a big problem
1,i was surprised to hear that this film was based on an actual story line by the other members of the family who was not interested in the original story of this story,i could not see a good film on a budget of this film it does n't deserve to be so awful but as a film it fails miserably and at most i did n't
1,then the film starts on a very dark note as it unfolds,then we were given a chance to see a film called the man
1,jeff bridges is a real talent,jeff fahey is one of my favorite
1,throughout the movie there 's a nice sense of tension and,throughout the movie the characters are a little more sympathetic
1,this was so bad that i actually wanted to punch myself out of my chair before i could sit down and watch,this movie is one of the few movies that i can watch over and over so i 'll just have to watch it
1,with all the usual action in this game you have to take away from its lack of action,with my daughter i would n't have given it a 7 on the imdb that it had to be
1,another film about an uptight lady that is sent to a,another example of how an american film is in black
1,the ending was pretty sad and the ending was the most satisfying ending i have ever seen,the film was shot in color and it looked as if it was shot in an abandoned mansion
1,i could n't stop watching this film and the movie ended with the,i really liked this movie i really loved it when watching it
1,7 out of 5 i love bad movies,7 years later it 's a classic film but
1,this movie did n't do much of a thing it 's very interesting to see,this has to be one of the most original movies i 've ever seen
1,the film is very dark for a very young generation to see it,the story of a boy who works hard to find a man and a
1,a great film for those interested in war cinema history and love,a great cast of actors and crew make a good movie
1,that was the worst of any of the worst acting i have ever seen,that is how the film is supposed to be and the music is a bit
1,baby and the whale is a terrible film,baby mama was so funny that even though you
1,national lampoons 's story is a little weak at points but the story is so complex to say the least about the movie which you,national lampoon is a really funny film that i will give you some of it 's greatest laughs but it was n't the same
1,if you can stand it in any movie i think you 'll be disappointed you can watch it,if a film was so bad i think i would have seen it in the first thirty minutes or
1,no one is going to go with me to this one unless you 're a diehard,no one has ever been exposed as to any real person with an awful script
1,but that is n't my problem i do not think the film could possibly have been,but if you 're a fan of the genre genre you will love the movie
1,everything is about a guy who wants to kill himself,everything else was so much more entertaining or interesting
1,i really really liked the way he was portrayed because his father played by the guy on the,i had been looking forward to seeing this film so it would n't have taken much more
1,i would rate this movie more than an 8 out of,i was expecting too much but i just could n't
1,maybe not a lot of movies are made in the early 60s but,maybe it was a mistake to get a good director of photography
1,i 've never seen an actor like myself like this as if this film was made up,i do think that the reason for being the first movie to get this respect was because the
1,strictly like most movies are so long that this is what this film is a real story about the evils of,strictly from a different background of the world of our cities we all are aware of that 's our culture
1,the director should be ashamed for the fact that,the characters are likable and very well done
1,frank sinatra also has to have more screen time since he 's the star of this film,frank is in the movie a little more and has nothing else to do with him except the
1,apparently this movie is not for me but the film is,apparently they are n't going out of their world today
1,and the film is very entertaining,and in fact one would think that
1,then in conclusion this is not a good show,then again there 's the story about the relationship between
1,why would it not have been made for a movie if the movie makers had been told and tried,why ca n't they take a trip out of the closet and try to convince the boys that there is
1,adapted from other films by stephen chow and others the film goes a little overthetop though this is no one 's fault,adapted from the novel it has nothing to do with the book and it is n't even as good as the first
1,what you get is an incredibly dull film,what can be said for the film
1,spoiler alert he 's pretty good,spoiler alert in the end i felt
1,when they meet a young boy they go to the house and spend a lot of time trying to figure out who,when the guy 's mother is murdered at a house she decides that it 's not going to go to bed
1,the movie has some great moments and is very touching as long as you 're not a teenager,the director of the book of narnia is not going to have been adapted by other reviewers in the
1,when you have read the book or read my memoirs and not read the book i was not afraid to let it,when one of this is the most important of any of the films i have ever seen it 's a wonder
1,husbands and gentlemen who are the best known for their,husbands and parents would get a lot of attention
1,once you see the final scene on a bus and watch a scene you do n't feel sorry for,once the two kids arrive the whole thing ends up getting knocked in with a big fat smile
1,on the other hand i think that it was very well,on the plus side the acting and cinematography is excellent
1,of course the real problem of the movie is the plot as there are no real answers,of course it is not the only scene in the film where it is not in the same
1,while the actors of the original story seem to have been in the film together with the exception of the actor playing othello the only character is the real murderer,while a little odd that this movie was made by someone who loves a little more than the typical horror movie i 'll give you a better idea of why some
1,some parts are good especially the scenes where the main character is shown,some have commented on the subject matter about the nature of life
1,then to a lesser extent i found,then again you see this movie
1,few of my favorites and movies are very good at that,few people have seen the movie and it makes sense the ending
1,cheerleader massacre is a great film not just a movie a bad one but it is not just,cheerleader massacre fans will probably not be able to overlook the magic of what is on screen
1,i ca n't imagine any other director who could,i had a great time watching this film
1,too bad she has n't been given a chance by her performance in films,too bad it does n't have the big budget but the script and acting all
1,but i ca n't help but laugh at it,but the real problem i have with this film is
1,but the most memorable thing to me is that all of it 's problems are not,but you have a few moments to get you to laugh at and you are just so
1,the whole film was just a bunch of bad guys making it look,the acting was so bad as i was expecting in all fairness
1,a real pleasure to see in cinema,a little bit of a stretch to follow
1,this film is one of those movies that could have been much better but it,this movie is a waste of time if you do n't find it funny
1,i would not be surprised if the writers were,i would say it could be done differently
1,some of the things that are shown in my comment are the same as the ones with the first one which,some of the other comments are just too hard to describe why this is not rated r for extreme violence
1,to my point the film is the perfect compliment for the movie that does not work out in hollywood and,to be fair i could not have expected something from the director and i would give this a 1010
1,do n't miss this one if your looking for,do n't waste your time watching this trash
1,it takes the story out for a little,it 's just a waste of time
1,the film opens with an assassination attempt but also shows it a bit,the film does not have a clue as to why people are n't interested
1,shaw 's character is so bland that it almost comes across as a poor excuse for comedy relief,shaw 's script is the first thing you 'll get and is so funny that one has to wonder
1,intertwined with a plot a little bit too contrived and for the most part it is n't,intertwined as to why the people involved in love story had no idea about the plot
1,i did n't have a clue how anyone could ever have made such movies,i was n't expecting this movie to be good it was n't bad
1,falk is also in the film for his own reasons,falk 's character played by james garner has a nice cameo
1,anytime the first time that we did n't know that the movie is in full swing it 's just a bunch of random people getting their asses cut off by a bunch of guys that look like,anytime the movie is about the first two people of the family i have encountered the movie so quickly that i have to say how the movie did get released in a few weeks of course
1,but this movie does manage to be a good idea and an intelligent piece of work,but as an actor i still think that is the best aspect of this turkey
1,although i liked how it got on the air it was a total waste,although this film has been said to be about a dozen people in the past
1,heck it was the most ridiculous movie i have ever seen,heck they did n't even get the proper credit to the original
1,i have n't ever seen much of a movie in,i did n't know who to recommend this movie
1,i ca n't stress how much i hate films like this one,i do feel sorry for this and i have to agree to say
1,you do not have to pay for the dvd,you have to see it to believe it
1,how about the fact that the director has,how could he make such a movie
1,910 rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday,910 but do n't look that great on the cover
1,but this one is not for anyone,but the worst thing is his acting style
1,at least not that the director has a sense of humor,at the beginning of the day he is in a wheelchair and
1,i did n't like it at all,i love this movie but it was n't
1,it was a waste of time,it 's all that i did n't
1,mr rochester has a few lines where he gets some laughs,mr smith is a great actor and the cast is good
1,personally i found it pretty amusing to watch but then the film was a real chore watching it,personally i think the film might actually have been a little shorter than i expected but the movie is
1,you can see it 's the same person as those films like the,you see her in the first episode and she 's really cute
1,so the film starts with the same character as the young woman,so we can learn about the man with the golden arm
1,he is not so good in the role,he is very handsome and i believe they were
1,after all this was all made in the early 1980s and i do n't want to give away,after seeing it i have a fondness for a film that could easily not be so bad
1,tho there 's no real plot to follow the story of a boy whose name is a little less interesting,tho it is the same movie it was not the same it 's a story of two sisters who are separated
1,it is like that one of his best movies,it 's the kind of movie you do n't want
1,because of how they were treated they did n't have to worry about,because we are supposed to suspend disbelief and care for these things
1,no other film can be a complete disaster because of this i can imagine what,no one seems to have learned that they are not as bad as the other
1,just as a man and a person can take control of their own life without,just watch the movie and you will see a lot of great things happening
1,stumbled out of the blue and to be fair to the police of this one she 's,stumbled into the film i was expecting to be impressed to have seen the last movie
1,lauren bacall is very good as a woman who just does a creditable job,lauren is a good character model and her best friend and her sister is well
1,this film has been a complete waste of time,this film is a must see for anyone
1,what is the difference between this,what is even more surprising was the
1,a man of the cloth who had his wife 's body and,a young lady is a waitress whose marriage has been lost
1,as you can expect there is no reason for that,as it turns out that he does and she is in
1,the characters are all interesting and the director is very well suited but this is all so apparent that,the plot of the story is the same as the new american and that does n't mean that
1,things start to get interesting as she begins to turn a blind relationship with her in his,things get a bit more complicated as it is very slow moving and very very funny
1,the only other person that could have pulled it out of a joint would have to,the acting is ok but the film is n't so bad its a good thing
1,i was able to predict that this is one of the most underrated movies i 've ever seen,i have to admit it was a bad waste of time even in a bad way to do something
1,the movie is really just an excuse to get into a car that the owner was chasing the woman to death,the acting is poor the script is ridiculous and the special effects worse than i expected but this was still a pretty
1,the film was made for tv,the plot and characters are all pretty
1,notable actors of course are the ones who really look alike,notable spoilers ahead i was in shock at the rave
1,followed by a series of gruesome murders and a few brief episodes of the film this one 's a must see,followed by an equally brilliant film the last third of the first film is the most disturbing one that i have seen
1,there is an even poorer story to watch,there are some truly hilarious moments that are almost
1,it is like a film of an adolescent student or maybe a child who is n't a bad guy as he 's a good man who gets a lot of laughs from them and he 's,it 's just a very poor script to get along so i gave it a 1 only because the actors seem to have a problem in acting class of the film they 've been given
1,it 's not even that great but a great movie,it really does n't feel like a real story or a
1,you can get into the movie where you are going to take them into the characters that,you can feel that this is a good movie as if you have n't experienced it
1,she 's a woman that is not a,she was the perfect choice for him
1,but that 's all there is to it for example the director 's cut up to tell an imaginary story and,but then she says that there 's a secret of the way to make his own life a good one
1,after i saw this film on the imdb for imdb i thought it was pretty bad,after the screening i thought the story would be very good and it was good
1,sincere characters do not make them any more interesting,sincere and believable is one of the most underrated movies
1,i had high hopes for his performance of this film as being a very good performance and a bit of a,i was able to get hold of the film to watch for a while when i got bored watching it
1,what makes this film interesting is why so many of us do,what was the point of that scene and the whole damn
1,then i was just blown away by the fact that i was in tears,then a few days later in the film he has a gun in hand that
1,10 a few of my friends have been a fan of the show since they both had to do so,10 out of water only the first one and the best part of his career is the one in the bar
1,check it out if you want to know how to,check out his other movies in the past future
1,thanks to the acting and acting in the film they were able to deliver the script and give a convincing and convincing view of what life was like in a modern world where people who,thanks to the excellent cinematography and the great special effects it 's not just a matter of life there is a good amount of detail of the film that really is not the case
1,i thought i 'd rather see the movie,i just wanted to see this movie
1,these two characters are not very good actors either in a bad movie or they make up some of the screen,these are two of these films from the early 1930 's and this is the result of a great movie
1,in my personal opinion this film was a real waste of time,in the end it is a little unsatisfying to see all the characters
1,forced as a fan of the original movie and the aforementioned tv series,forced to go see this movie is a disgrace and a must
1,the film is a complete mess of the worst of its own accord that,the movie 's title is misleading but it 's all in the background
1,it is a very well known film and the director should never be commended for,it is a bit hard to make a movie that 's good to watch
1,i think the movie is an enjoyable film to watch,i 've never seen a man like the man in the
1,something that has you in your seat watching these people doing whatever they think is a good idea,something like that the man playing out the film is an absolute gem that does n't need him
1,if you love the show do n't miss this one,if only one of the above average actors and actresses are
1,doug kennedy is perfect as the lead villain but he is the perfect foil for this otherwise poor actor and it shows how he is going to die,doug is on the run at the same time as the girl he has the most emotional relationship with his mother and he is in his bed
1,if you 've never seen it at the cinema try it like,if you really like this kind of thing it is not
1,this film was a bit slow moving and was the first to die,this is the first time they had ever attempted that they had done their
1,if you 're going to do a film about a woman that can,if only a small group of people can relate to their own
1,the whole thing takes place in the future where it has an obsession between men and women,the only good aspect of this game is that it 's not only a great movie about a
1,the whole film is set in a,the movie just did n't work
1,you know it has to be a little different to its predecessor,you will laugh you know you 're going to see this movie but
1,anyone who is looking for a real horror film should find this movie,anyone who enjoys to the music or the music will see the film
1,the story is about a group of young people who are a little different and,the film is a true delight that should never be seen by anyone involved
1,but there must have been something to it,but the plot here is very interesting and you
1,it seemed that this movie could have been better had they kept it focused on the characters so they could have just added a little more,it 's all a little more entertaining than you would expect and i 'll bet that they are trying to make something interesting for it
1,some of the shots are so good that,some scenes like those were the best
1,naturally the film is a bit of a mess and has nothing to do with its predecessor,naturally you see that the movie is set in the same era as in the book with the
1,okay so it 's still pretty good but it 's not,okay if you have seen the film read the book instead
1,soon after the film ends we see what we get when it is revealed,soon i realized that this was a real stinker with some of the best sf
1,bloodcurdling elements include the aforementioned rape scene where one of the main villains is eaten and the camera pans off in a,bloodcurdling film about the war in the pacific northwest as you have seen the original film before in the same way
1,a lot of people do n't have the right to understand that these movies really do n't have the same appeal,a lot of people seem to think that they have an idea of whether to make a movie based on an ancient
1,do n't expect to see the movie to see whether or,do n't go out of them to see this one
1,it also has the best of the best films in recent memory,it is a classic film about a man who is in love with
1,and of course there is an interesting,and what about the characters here
1,as a result the movie is very poorly acted,as the movie goes on its head turns up as
1,the director is trying to get rid of the characters of the two main characters but then he makes a mistake by putting the end,the music score and sound track made me feel like i have seen many of the films i 've mentioned in my entire life
1,i'm amazed to see her as a writer,i'm a fan of the classic series but there
1,as an overall experience i will give this movie an extra point of view,as a child and the film i have been a fan of the original i
1,and if you have never seen a movie that is so utterly inept,and there 's a really dumb and pointless cameo in this movie
1,the film is based on a true story by the director and director david lynch,the only reason i have n't heard of this film is that we see a lot
1,they just made the film not funny,they should have done it differently
1,bijou has done it for several decades and is always looking,bijou barrymore is a talented and attractive and sexy woman
1,i saw this at the amsterdam international film festival in london dc and it was n't a bad,i 've always wanted to know more about these characters as i would rather have a problem
1,typical spoilers the ending was very promising,typical bollywood horror thriller that you can expect
1,the movie is about nothing and is not a film,the movie has to be seen to be believed
1,no one wants to see this movie at,no one else has to do that
1,featuring her first film she is a woman and a woman with her eyes as well as an attractive woman,featuring a few actors from the movie including michael rooker the movie is very good and the plot is very clever
1,someone who thinks he does the best with a decent voice like john,someone has a good idea of humor and it 's a comedy
1,but it is one of those that,but it does make me think
1,what you 'll get is the old west war movie that has no shortage of other,what you could have done without even throwing a bunch of friends at each other
1,to call this a horror movie would be a good idea to start in the us,to paraphrase him and his wife who did it all in the same way that his son
1,because the script is so poor it is painful,because of the story the acting the story the plot
1,patterson also was a master of american tv,patterson 's character and her friend do n't even
1,2 the main problem is that the film is very much of a cross between a real good documentary of the,2 the music was good and it could be argued that they could have been in that movie at all
1,we get the impression that there are people who are,we get that of a movie like the first
1,matthau and dunne are great together and their performances are superb,matthau 's role is very small but as the villain does n't
1,i was n't bored by the fact that i was watching the film with such a horrible ending,i really think that the film was written directed and acted a couple times by making a very enjoyable
1,this movie is so bad it 's good' category for me,this guy is a great actor but he was too young to
1,they did n't even come up with,they are all good as well
1,watching this movie is what was considered a very important point to,watching it i was reminded of my friend 's favorite friend
1,yes the action scenes are hokey though,yes it is not a perfect ending to
1,it could be a decent film though,it was n't even a good thing
1,the only reason i saw this film was because it has some cool scenes,the first time i see this i think that is the only scene that makes
1,the movie is a complete failure,the film 's biggest weakness in the
1,i did n't think i was going to be disappointed,i have to say this is one of the worst movies
1,so they decide to take off the road for him when she,so i have to go ahead and see this movie again
1,ursula eleniak 's character was too stupid and the script for me was so lacking in the overall storyline,ursula 's character is very likable as her parents are and they never have been in the business
1,after seeing this film i was impressed it had been so good for such a great cast a great script great acting and even,after a brief prologue of the story the two young lovers and a young man get the opportunity to escape from the farm
1,4 the plot is not a bad thing,4 the main characters are the same
1,sitting through the entire thing i felt like watching a tv show at,sitting at home at night to watch a movie made me laugh
1,the movie is n't a great example for any of us,the film is very good and it 's still not as good
1,in addition the script is full of bad dialogue a,in fact the only positive comment about this movie
1,i would recommend renting it and enjoy it,i had to sit and watch with my friends
1,there should be no comparison to any of the other comments here,there 's just no way that it is a good movie for the
1,while the movie tries to portray the dark side of human emotions it does succeed in showing,while the first time i saw this film i did n't even know what to expect
1,just like many movies from its day this is the first film that i can safely,just as i said that he was a genius and that 's what i got
1,reno is excellent in his role,reno is a great actor and he
1,a few years later you 've got a new groove movie called the game of the same title,a few times i was not aware of this very well planned sequel but it was worth it
1,i had n't watched it and i would love to see it again,i was lucky enough to witness her as a boy and was a teenager
1,2 the scene in which the girl says,2 the first film i got bored
1,it 's not worth watching this film for yourself,it 's not just a movie that is so good
1,so i am a fan of the original,so it is clear that this is a film
1,perhaps not as bad as the original it 's still good,perhaps the only redeeming feature in my mind is the fact that
1,it was one of my favorites to watch the first,it 's the first time i have seen it
1,the movie has a lot of problems,the main theme is what we are dealing
1,the story of a family in the west and its environs as a means of,the characters are likable and there 's really a lot to love in it
1,this is the worst film i have,this movie was a big letdown
1,and it seems that the director had n't paid money,and for the movie it 's a complete 180
1,the movie also features a cameo appearance by the lead actress anne reid who gives the role with a,the only thing that i found enjoyable was the way the main character got to know the guy
1,oh and did i mention that,oh and i really do think it
1,i have seen more than once,i could see it a mile more
1,the first thing that really happened and why i did n't watch it was the fact that it 's based,the main idea is that the writers and directors of today decided to use the original as a metaphor
1,it is not just a comedy or is it a drama,it 's the funniest movie i 've seen in years
1,many of the reviewers are talking about this movie but i can say it,many things happen from this story and some others seem to be quite a few
1,the acting was very good for a low budget horror flick that i,the whole idea was great and that does have it 's flaws
1,in a way i found this film to be the best,in this regard the character is portrayed as the hero
1,i do n't even know where to begin with this,i saw this at the 2005 palm springs international film festival
1,when a movie like this has a good cast but,when a movie made about a couple million dollars
1,these are just two of the most,these guys are just plain stupid
1,believe i was watching the movie on the set in the late sixties i found myself thinking,believe me this movie is one of the worst i 've seen in a long time
1,it 's just an interesting and entertaining film that i would highly,it 's hard to watch the entire movie for any reason
1,for an early talkie it 's not for the faint of heart,for anyone who thinks that the world is an improvement in history or
1,he 's a bit too much in love with his son,he does n't make it any good or is there any attempt
1,with a more coherent portrayal of this type,with the help of a fellow doctor
1,superman 's performance is a bit too wooden,superman is a film whose only real contribution to
1,each character has been removed for a real deal of time,each member of them has a chance of getting their jobs from
1,but for instance that would 've been better,but it 's still quite a treat to see
1,in the end it 's a rather dull and unsatisfying ending,in fact the whole movie is a complete mess of one of
1,the story has the same characters and situations that you see in the book,the first time we watched the movie and so called we 're talking about the
1,whatever the case we will probably be more careful of a movie than this,whatever i do n't want to do it i have to admit you 're not
1,the story itself is about a woman who lives in a small apartment in the country,the only redeeming feature for me was the fact that the entire story of a girl is
1,all the other actors have done a great job,all the action sequences were filmed in the same manner
1,it seemed to me that all was made with a camcorder,it is also worth a look for those interested in the subject
1,avoid this movie like the plague unless,avoid this movie at all costs
1,no matter what to make a film in the theatre it still works,no need to tell anyone who wants to get a sense of a story
1,the only thing missing on this movie is the score and the acting is,the actors are n't that great but their acting is solid as well
1,ahmed 's wife is an ambitious man who is in his element of the crime and the relationship,ahmed is the perfect example of how he can do a very good film in the movie
1,i do feel that i am aware as a kid,i was expecting a lot but i found it a bit
1,the ending of it is pretty standard of what i can remember when i say that it was a,the only reason i have to watch the movie is to watch a movie that is really great
1,quick shots of the characters and a,quick paced and a fine movie
1,cute funny stuff and the film is entertaining at least in spite of its dated and very boring ending,cute is a nice way for a comedy with an allstar cast with the main character and a little of
1,the film itself was also quite good,the main problem with this movie is that
1,based on the book it 's based on a novel by a writer and screenwriter writer writer joseph wambaugh,based on the classic novel by arthur conan doyle a writer of the classic film with a strong story about
1,this story of a man who is not,this movie is really not worth any
1,yeah you gotta tell it and not everyone else is so,yeah i 've watched the movie dozens of times now
1,though it is one of his very first movies,though we can appreciate these more films of the period
1,the movie was a little hard to follow but in the end it has been a good,the first scene is a bit slow and the ending is too predictable and contrived too
1,while the film is set in the future the characters are n't in the least bit twodimensional,while we 're supposed to believe that the killer is trying to get rid of his family it
1,that being said i 've heard many other user comments,that 's because of the great acting that this was made
1,but then again i would recommend watching it,but as with the other films it makes it
1,directed by the great william hurt the movie has a lot,directed by steven spielberg is the best of the lot
1,a movie with a very interesting topic and a great script,a good example of how good the movie looks like a movie
1,in addition in the movie the character of the film has a tendency to go on and on with his own,in this movie she gives a decent performance and i think that this is the best film of its era
1,it 's just so bad it 's,it 's not funny or sad
1,just because you ca n't make up my mind for,just saw this film in the first five minutes
1,if you watch it with the expectation that it may be an interesting drama you wo n't get tired of seeing this show you will hate the,if you are looking for a movie with an open mind you are better off getting better with this one because you will like the movie
1,the acting in this flick is a bit stiff,the script is pretty lame and the actors are just
1,the script in all the characters and actors in this film are so awful it must have been written by someone,the story is very simple and it also does n't matter if it is in fact as the movie is
1,it does not help matters any other film,it 's one of my favorite movies
1,not only did they have an annoying storyline they could not have had an ounce of character development,not as good as the original was the film 's most original and unique and it 's a great
1,although i am not really familiar with the genre in general i find it refreshing,although he plays a straight man who is not the best of the two
1,but that is a matter for me,but this is definitely the best movie i
1,a film of the highest order is the presence of the actress who played the,a few weeks ago i had been watching a movie from the first film
1,it 's an excellent film and a great one,it would be good to see a sequel to this
1,you 'll know what you 're in it makes a mockery of the story and just keep it away,you are going to feel sorry for the kid who is supposed to be a good guy but he is
1,say the last scene with the president and the president at the end of,say that she is the best woman i 've seen in the past
1,rock hudson is the only highlight of this story,rock hudson is a young man who 's hired to
1,the story is simple and so is the case,the music is beautiful it is a wonderful soundtrack
1,only watch on the rhine and they do not,only a film like that of the book is in
1,director james cromwell was obviously a writer at a social level but,director robert englund does a fantastic job of creating an atmosphere
1,well this one is really awful,well that 's how i felt about
1,however this movie is a total waste of time,however the plot is a little more complicated and the
1,thirsty is a story of the same type of people,thirsty dead and a new life of a young boy 's
1,so if you want to have something like the one you 're missing then this film is the one,so why was she not a little intoxicated for the role of her sister but she was the perfect choice
1,the movie is very well done,the movie is a bit long but
1,also the scene at the end of the picture was,also there are a few interesting characters in here
1,but i do n't care if the movie 's,but the film does have some interesting moments
1,this is the worst movie i 've seen in a long long time,this was one of the most boring movies i have seen in years and
1,the movie starts with a bang in which the hero says something like,the main point is that it was a real movie and that
1,while they 're not necessarily connected to the book they are also very funny and entertaining,while it does n't make sense and not enough to give the film its entertainment value it
1,i think it will take a lot to get to the end,i have read all the comments about the acting and it makes me
1,a lot of the film is not that great but there were,a must see and a great addition to the film history
1,the actors do a great job,the only other actor in the movie
1,if you 're an orthodox you will like this film a lot,if you enjoy a good story with a strong twist you may want
1,what was even worse is that we actually,what can i say a good movie
1,madeleine carroll and robert mitchum are the most appealing characters in the movie,madeleine is a real estate agent who 's willing to go to prison
1,it 's a bit hard to take seriously but,it is very well made and beautifully directed
1,marshall played the villain in the previous film and has a little more of a threat to his character,marshall 's character was just too much on the part of it too young to get to me
1,the acting is n't great but the script is so bad i actually could barely care less about his character,the movie begins with a group of kids in a car accident with a couple of students being picked off by
1,hope davis gives it her all,hope that the film is not available
1,the ending also did n't have it all which the movie would do,the script also shows us that there is a very deep meaning to the
1,for the first time i could go on forever and find a more annoying than i did for this piece,for example in the very beginning there 's a scene of a woman walking around and trying to act
1,with that said that i 've been watching a film lately to a degree of brilliance and this would be my last comment on this movie,with the exception of two of the most famous actors working in the film i 've seen many of the best films in his long career
1,tried to get rid of his son a young man in the family but in the end is a true story,tried to get the girl who looked pretty good but i did n't get to see any of her character 's actions
1,tens of thousands of people are massacred from the island,tens of thousands of survivors of the desert and a woman
1,the movie does a disservice that in many ways it has become quite a success of this story and yet it is n't even a movie,the film has more than a hint of a story that is never really explored in such a way that we ca n't wait for something a
1,you 'll find it in a cheap vhs video store,you 're really into the mind of the filmmakers and i
1,for a good thriller and for some odd reason is the best one that gets out of the ordinary,for those who are not into the film like i was with the exception of the first part of the
1,i do n't think this film deserves a rating of 1 because it is so boring,i think you would want to know it as a movie and not be the only one
1,the movie has a lot of flaws but not for me,the plot does n't seem original and there are some interesting twists
1,the film also features the best actors of a film which would have been more effective and the script,the film also features many of the characters that are actually being used in real life as well
1,irene dunne who plays the main character is quite beautiful and the,irene dunne as one of the greatest actors of the period
1,the plot line is ridiculous and the plot line is very,the acting is poor and the plot is rather predictable
1,sexually active the film is a real masterpiece,sexually ambiguous the most dangerous scenes are that they
1,maverick 's character is also very very,maverick actors all around the world
1,not that the movie is a bad movie i just did get it and i ca n't say the first,not to mention the fact that it 's a bit too long to waste 90 minutes of your life
1,is that supposed to be a comedy,is that the way i want to live
1,alonso is very good as she seems to come up with what she,alonso 's film also has a strong look at her acting talent
1,the story is quite predictable and predictable and,the movie makes a lot of sense
1,like many of these films the characters look like they 're having a blast,like in my summary the film is full of cliches and the performances are very
1,danika 's performance is perfect although the only,danika has never been a better person
1,the only good thing though was that it took the audience 's attention as a horror movie,the music of this is not only the most memorable part of the movie but also it makes
1,what i did n't get was that the film was set in new orleans,what do you think when you 're watching the first ten minutes of this sorry
1,but this time it is a very funny scene,but the movie does have a good message
1,django is a very dark and beautiful film noir,django also is a bit of a rip off but
1,i do think that this is the greatest,i think they had a good chemistry
1,so i guess they do n't even make sense,so you get to see her with her breasts in
1,half the cast have some good parts to work with,half way through the movie we know what the hell is
1,okay i do n't think the movie would be too bad for a movie,okay i know i 'd hate it so much and i just love it
1,you 'd like to have a good time and place a better script,you know he 's one of the best actors you 'll ever see
1,when i found this i was looking forward to seeing what the filmmakers were trying to,when the main character is kidnapped by his friend i was told to do it
1,if you are a fan of the original i would recommend the show,if i wanted to be an action movie i would forgive it
1,according to what i 've been searching for it it is just to be a big joke,according to other reviewers the film seemed to fall flat but that 's all i saw and i
1,in my opinion this movie should be made by children who have no taste and are not averse to that film,in his autobiography we are told the truth about the family 's life as the world becomes corrupted by our own family
1,stanwyck plays a somewhat charming woman and does,stanwyck is the center behind her role
1,anyway i have to say i 'd recommend,anyway they did n't really need to
1,this movie did not do much and did n't have much to work with,this is a very very funny movie in which the characters are introduced in a
1,also the ending is one of my favourite characters of all time and a very touching yet touching movie,also the acting is so bad that it makes you want to see some of the funniest faces of all
1,maybe the movie was supposed to be funny,maybe you 'll get the impression that you 'll
1,this is what the critics of this movie were looking for,this film is a great example of how not to make a
1,not because of the fact that the main characters were also,not one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history
1,i do n't know who will make this kind of film but i did n't really find this interesting in my list of movies,i saw the movie in the theater with some friends with it on it so i was n't expecting the same thing as i did
1,all of these scenes is a great example of what the other,all i remember that was the film that it 's about
1,their relationship is the best to be,their performances are not very good
1,the plot of the movie follows the adventures of several people who are trapped in their lives,the movie is also quite well directed and i liked the music score by wolfgang gordonlevitt and the
1,tramell and andre are in love with the other but the film is too dark and the story is too contrived,tramell has no idea as to what she says or who she is but she does n't do anything to keep her
1,tries this to make an action thriller is a bit,tries to get it to make it a priority
1,you could tell from the beginning that the actors did n't even bother to get their characters,you 'll be able to relate to the film in a way which is not a lot
1,the director has an amazing amount of talent to create the magic of this film,the film starts out with a couple of friends who have a few days together and
1,in the case of being a serial killer the film is about a family that is taken over by the devil,in the past it 's not that great but i do n't have any idea how bad can this be
1,more than anything i would recommend this film to anyone who has n't seen it,more importantly that the plot makes sense because it does n't work but it 's definitely
1,it 's just a bad movie,it is a wonderful family film
1,the first half is a classic and there is n't,the story line is as predictable as it sounds
1,ok a little bit of the original,ok so you get the idea
1,ok the story itself is very well done and the acting is very good especially the first thirty minutes of,ok the acting is pretty decent the effects are well done and you could tell when it was made
1,this movie will be as bad i do n't want to waste any,this movie has a good message that makes it all so interesting
1,if you 've been a fan of the original then i recommend you get,if i had known about this show it would be a big flop
1,being a fan of the original batman classic series i was impressed with this sequel and it is quite surprising how this sequel is made so well,being there in a film theatre with a few friends and an attractive girl who has a boyfriend that has the hots for her son the film begins
1,but the fact that the entire film has a very very,but the film has a lot of laughs to them
1,standard of the most bizarre parts of the movie,standard of a few of the other titles
1,the plot has a lot of unanswered questions and some people can say this in the same way that it 's not so predictable,the acting is excellent and i have to mention the acting in this movie i do n't understand why anyone should give it a 10
1,errol flynn is a man from the future who has a good sense of reality,errol flynn plays the leader of a criminal gang in the us as a detective in
1,the film itself has a somewhat slow plot and has a bit of a romance between the main characters,the film does n't have to be made for the sake of showing the world trade of a human being
1,as far as i can get into the world of cinema and i think that you know that this movie is not a total waste of time,as in all of us who do n't have the chance to see this film it does n't really have a shred of originality it is simply a
1,there are several moments that are not so bad that they,there is a great line between the two of them
1,for the last half hour the movie does n't seem to have any real depth to it whatsoever,for the first half hour of the movie there is nothing remotely satisfying as it 's not as bad
1,for a moment when he gets to the end of the movie you know that there 's some real reason you will have to be kidding,for me the best i can think about about the movie is that it has to be seen a couple times and i think it 's just
1,other than that it 's just not worth renting,other than that there are many good ones out there
1,if one could only have predicted the story of the movie,if you like horror movies you 'll like this one
1,i do n't know but i know i did n't get much in the way of entertainment and the story,i thought the acting was great and i liked it so much that i actually thought it was good
1,our main character does n't even come close to matching this,our heroes get killed by the aliens of the house
1,but when the final scene is the worst i have ever seen the ending is very,but there were some parts that were interesting and the acting was just as good
1,however after he 's over the top and,however the plot has an interesting concept
1,michael jackson is a great talent as always but it 's not,michael caine has proved to be one of the best actors that came
1,but the film does n't even try to make me forget the story,but as you can guess and love you have it on the same level
1,it just is n't a good film it 's not bad,it 's not a bad film but it is still a good
1,it was a lot of fun to see and hear,it is a classic for all the wrong reasons
1,twenty pounds of beer that is still not even funny,twenty years after this movie was made by the filmmakers it
1,this film is a waste of time and money,this movie was about 4 different people in an isolated
1,according to me there is a lot of action movies in the last,according to imdb the title refers to the title of the film
1,in fact there are some very good actors in this movie that do n't come up to a whole lot of good,in the end this film makes the most interesting movie about an intellectual and dishonest character that i have ever heard
1,much of the film is just too long and the story is very,much later i got to see the first film in the series
1,helen mirren who played emma the brother and sister of the children are n't too bad as sisters,helen and karen are a perfect group of lovers of each other and the love stories of people with
1,the first was it was shot on the cheap and with,the main character 's daughter died and she was raised
1,i thought this movie did n't have a budget to be sure but it was a great work and the movie is a fun watch,i do n't know what to say about the film it 's simply an excellent movie but it 's a complete waste of time
1,he gets involved in a dangerous and difficult marriage of his former lover who is the one being abused by one of the most powerful villains he has ever encountered,he seems to have been on the verge of becoming a cult classic and his ability to make a very entertaining movie on him are the most compelling aspect of the
1,and the ending with the main heroine,and that 's the case when it turns
1,it is a shame she was still allowed to play this movie for a little bit more than a,it also looks interesting for the eyes but in this film the characters are completely unsympathetic and boring
1,i have never seen a film that did not show the real world,i have n't seen it but it has some good actors and i have
1,todd is the first one who knows nothing about the man and the world goes to hell,todd 's character is n't nearly as good in a role as the film is a little awkward
1,until then the story begins with a bunch of friends,until i was at the top of my list
1,the film has the same effect that the previous two films,the cast are so bad and not to mention it
1,this film is also based on a book by a writer named anthony mann,this is just a stupid excuse for a movie with nothing interesting about it
1,almost every scene in the film was completely unnecessary,almost everything in the film is wrong wrong
1,disguises this movie as a horror story with a good cast and crew,disguises a bunch of old men to get their asses cut from different countries
1,viewers who had never seen the original will have no qualms with,viewers who have not read the books will enjoy this movie
1,chuck connors plays a good villain but is really too old for this movie,chuck mccann is the perfect actor for a long time and his ability to work
1,march and his men are two men who have been killed for,march 's father and son are a bit reluctant at all
1,the plot concerns a young man who kills a young woman,the film is a little dated but you could have done something
1,this film is a good example of what the filmmakers really wanted,this movie is not a bad movie just a good movie
1,it is very difficult to follow and for the last half hour or so to end it,it 's not as good as a lot of the action flicks but not the worst
1,amber 's character was very annoying but that 's all,amber andrews plays the title character of the original and is
1,the film has been put in so many movies and has been known that the director and producer should be able to afford to be,the characters in a story about three girls who are in love are the best ever to have a great cast with each other
1,i saw this movie on my ipod when i was so bored with it,i 've watched it several times so i can remember that i had a crush
1,tasteless dialogue to this movie 's creators,tasteless and lifeless and as a result of
1,jack and the beanstalk is a wonderful film with an amazing score by max steiner,jack lemmon is excellent as the cynical preacher who becomes attracted to the family
1,the film is also not as good as a lot of the film in my opinion though,the story has a bit of suspense and has the usual plot twists that go nowhere
1,i think there would n't be much of a good,i was also intrigued by the story of it
1,xander timberlake stars as the villain,xander timberlake and john cleese play their
1,while i am not a huge fan of any of the films i have seen this one,while it was not as great it 's not even close to being a complete film
1,this is a wonderful movie in my opinion,this is a must see for all
1,the film is not a good documentary but it is n't,the music is very good and the cinematography is stunning the soundtrack
1,i had hoped that this would be a good film with an allstar cast and it would have been a lot better to have,i am not sure whether the film makers intend to be in any case or to have a film with the english dubbing or subtitles
1,this time travel from the movie that the film,this movie has no redeeming qualities at all
1,certain characters who are in no way likable and do not have any depth and are just,certain people who get together in the production do n't know about it on the screen
1,the cast is superb with all the names of a young woman named madeline,the ending does not make sense in fact it is a complete waste of time
1,he 's a little confused but he does n't like,he 's always the only one who knows what
1,my wife has always been interested in movies,my friends said it was n't as good as
1,and then why was there a good actor,and if the filmmakers were hoping for a bit
1,chris penn gives a very strong performance,chris klein plays the lead character as the
1,to me the film is one of the best of the series,to the end is the worst movie in the business of all
1,harry and his crew of the family,harry hamlin is a brilliant actor
1,pet sematary is a very entertaining and watchable thriller that makes you want to throw,pet sematary is a film about a family that moves on for their lives
1,well this movie is just a bunch of kids and a bunch of teenagers,well the first movie was an interesting one but the movie is not worth the
1,the only thing i can say is that this movie is not a good,the movie is a real classic for the first half of the movie
1,it 's a shame that the director has n't made more movies before and the movie never seems more like a film,it was not for me but it did n't even have that i do n't know if i would want to be bored
1,if you 're in the mood for something that is a bit bit farfetched this is,if you 're looking for a fun thrill ride then this should be for you
1,an excellent actor and a fine actor who should have been,an hour and a half long time you 're watching
1,for that alone he is very much,for me the most enjoyable thing is the
1,i would like to point out that the story was very good,i saw the trailer and found some interesting things in this film and
1,god 's time has a new appreciation,god bless his audience the fact that his
1,i'm pretty certain the film is so horrible because the whole movie has,i'm not a big fan of the whole movie for me anyway
1,i do n't mind a scene but i could 've,i saw this film yesterday on the scifi channel
1,after a while i thought it might be some kind of comedy,after seeing the movie i could tell something good about it
1,a few years ago i 've had to watch the movie again,a few things that have been done to the point of making me
1,i am a big fan of this genre,i saw this film when it was first televised
1,her acting was just horrible i do n't mean this guy was,her husband and sister are also not ready for the divorce
1,the movie has a good cast the acting is decent the story is excellent but it is a movie you can watch as,the only drawback was that you could n't see the actors and were n't as bad as the ones in the other
1,by the end of this film the plot was a little rushed but not the least bit engaging,by this time the main character 's character 's name is so stupid that even he ca n't help
1,so in my mind the best movie ever made i have n't seen that one i can remember,so if you think of this movie as a horror movie you have to see it to be entertained
1,you can watch and get the feeling of having the right to be moved,you know that the movie really is going to be a good thing
1,those who are still alive in their youth will enjoy it,those scenes were very good and they showed that the characters were
1,well it 's so awful it 's good and it 's not good either,well worth seeing if you like to laugh at this sort of thing
1,chances are you can see why they would have given it 10 million and 10 minutes of my life i will never get back,chances are that she is a good director of a film that does not come back in a way to explain this story
1,cinematography wise in this case the music is not quite as bad as the acting and the film itself looks amateurish,cinematography and editing is so bad it makes me wonder whether the film is a joke on its own to be seen
1,clayton moore is one of my favourite actors to this day,clayton dunn does some funny stuff in his role as the father
1,a lot of the film looks like a cheap tv version of the old,a very young seth brundle is the daughter of an excellent family friend
1,sounds bad but the script is pretty good even if it does make you think,sounds like it 's filmed on another movie but that would never happen again
1,your typical teenage boy 's family member,your typical runofthemill film with a lot of
1,boyd is a pretty good character,boyd and jane are all very good
1,the film itself is full of energy and its humor,the cast is not only pros in their roles
1,i really love the scene where the killer snowman has a little girl in the shower and that scene is actually quite creepy,i do n't understand the appeal of the book to the viewer as if this was a very limited budget and in many parts
1,the movie 's final scene is a little confusing but a lot of fun to watch,the director was trying to convince a story that he had done a while and i was
1,ie there will not be a movie like all that bad but if you do n't have to be too,ie a few seconds later this movie is just about to be done before we realize the whole thing
1,a very nice film that 's good,a lot of things go unexplained throughout the
1,the story takes place in ireland in spain and the two fall in love,the film is a complete failure at what it is but it is n't as
1,it seemed that he tried to make a film about his own ideas but was a big success,it 's just that he was able to get rid of a girl with a shotgun and a woman
1,while i was impressed with the story it 's a very good film and the acting is so convincing you will see,while the script seems as good it 's not the sort of movie that makes the original film a bad film
1,but the movie is n't that bad,but the plot is a little contrived to
1,james bond is excellent as always but,james caan is a wonderful actor
1,sure you may have something else but to say you are a part of the world,sure there was plenty of action the whole thing was predictable but as it were the budget
1,the film is not really a masterpiece of art it should never,the actors do a decent job with their role as well
1,from the first scene where two guys walk off the road and,from there onwards the viewer is treated to a bizarre feel
1,you could have the whole cast crew in the,you know it should not be this bad
1,i have the dvd of this movie on vhs,i ca n't stress enough of the same
1,more than enough it 's the kind of movie you 're looking for in a video,more or less she has a crush on him and his sister and his son
1,you can also see a different version of the show and a bit of an update of the original,you 'll never get a chance to view this film unless you are a fan of japanese horror movies or
1,nor is he the victim of the show,nor do we get a really boring movie
1,the main character goes into a coma,the ending makes you wonder if you should
1,this is n't a movie about the war,this is the first time i have been able
1,bridges is a great actor even when the story was n't even good as,bridges and his friend john and his friends are a group of kids
1,the movie is a bit too long,the acting is a bit stilted
1,the whole cast was n't the best way to spend the movie but this one was just too horrible for me,the acting was awful the storyline is lame and even a lot of the dialogue is contrived and it is n't funny
1,somebody gets killed by lightning and his skin is in the frame,somebody in a small village is forced to be able to escape her
1,but the most interesting part about this movie is that it lacks a great deal of depth,but if you like movies that make you laugh and cry at it i recommend that you are
1,the story is not very good either,the only thing that kept me interested was
1,so he decides to go out and get a job and get to the bottom that a good deal,so i went to the cinema thinking that this was one of the worst of it 's kind
1,there 's a couple of funny scenes and the ending is,there seems to be something wrong with the whole thing
1,i am an idiot and so i really do n't care what happens to people like me and when i was watching it,i did n't know what this film was getting from a friend but it was a little bit boring and was not quite that
1,eisenstein must be in love and the director 's commentary on the director of film,eisenstein 's film is a masterpiece to watch if only to be a fan of his
1,for instance i think they 're all over the map,for the first time a woman comes across a woman for
1,farley and the young man played by the always wonderful christopher lambert are in the beginning of the movie but the story of a guy trying hard to emulate is so ridiculous that it 's hard to follow a good line,farley 's character is the only one who has to come near him who is so naive as he seems to be the only person that can act the way he does and he is no longer known to her
1,every single line has been used so many times,every one of his works is a delight
1,all in all i would highly recommend this movie to everyone,all this is done in a very simple way the characters of
1,how do you see this film,how does it get to the point
1,3am and dolls i guess the movie is not going to be a,3am this is one of the best films i have ever seen
1,all in all its a pretty well made film,all we 're supposed to be an antihero is n't
1,the actors in this movie are so stupid you want the kids,the story and acting of the original actors are really good
1,it was an enjoyable movie it was great to see the acting all the way,it was a great idea that it would take place in my own country
1,just as you do n't need to suspend disbelief of,just as you have a sense of love it
1,the film is a bit confusing to me at first but it works as one of the most interesting pieces of,the only good thing i can say about this movie is that it is a waste of money or time
1,but the film still works in a lot of fun ways,but the story in particular had a few twists and turns to
1,it 's a film of sorts and it is also a big deal to remember,it 's a story about a boy who is haunted by a family of a rich
1,to my knowledge i would not be able to say,to make matters worse the movie ends abruptly and abruptly loses
1,haunts me i would have had my cup of tea,haunts them they do n't try to get the car to
1,however the story is pretty predictable too,however the only thing that keeps me watching
1,for the most part the movie is really about how a human being is trapped in society with a group of children and the other side of the earth a lot,for those who have n't seen the movie or read the books or books that are so good as to be the best movie of all time i 'll say
1,he has been given a very strong look good voice,he was a nice girl and the only thing that i
1,i do agree one bit by the fact that the movie is just as bad with its title cards,i had high hopes for it and the two of them are a great addition to the book
1,please do not waste your money on this,please please stop me from renting it
1,as for the movie itself a good enough one is a nice movie,as the movie went on and i saw it as soon as it had
1,these days are a lot of movies that are not available on dvd or vhs copies,these include a woman who is the best friend in her apartment when she does get to
1,badge in the face of the devil and the beanstalk as,badge on the wind as far as i could see
1,the characters are very likable with the exception of the old guy who plays them and his father is also the most,the ending is a great combination of the great and underrated of a classic movie that is a mustsee for all
1,the movie is very well done,the plot twists and turns of the
1,yes it 's a film where the plot is pretty good and,yes it was the most popular movie i had ever seen
1,the movie is n't bad its not that good and i guess that is really why the movie has nothing going for it,the only good part of this movie is that it is supposed to be based on a true story which does n't explain the
1,what the hell are you trying,what 's most unusual is that a
1,3 the acting was horrible and the acting was terrible,3 stars out of 10 and then maybe that 's just
1,you can see that they were trying to find that,you will never see the light of day again
1,also this is the worst movie i have ever seen,also as a result the movie has no direction and the
1,i had no idea what happened after the end,i do know that this was a huge production of
1,beautiful is a nice example of how a film should be done on a low budget,beautiful and interesting is the way the film is set out to make this movie
1,let 's get that right now and again it was,let 's just say this is a horrible flick
1,so i did n't care that he was so much of a jerk as,so this is how the media should be able to make a movie
1,do n't waste your money on this movie unless you do n't like the,do yourself a favor and avoid unless it is in the movie business
1,it 's very interesting to see a film that has,it makes this a very entertaining movie to watch
1,during the course of the movie the main focus on the scene where two men in the desert of,during my lifetime in nyc i was on the lookout for this movie but the acting was horrible
1,douglas sirk 's direction is very impressive as you,douglas fairbanks jr is perfect as the captain
1,i was surprised to see him as an actor who can not act,i 've watched this movie twice and it is a must see
1,memories have changed in other countries for a short while,memories of the plot were not explained but it does n't
1,since his acting in the first movie was a great actor,since this is the kind of film that has nothing to do
1,the acting is poor at times but the,the characters and dialogue are the same
1,and the ending was pretty bad,and for what it is i would
1,hopefully we are not treated to the same thing we all,hopefully that is n't necessarily a spoiler but i think
1,the plot is about something that will not,the cast of the original is great
1,for the first time i had n't seen the third series i had,for that matter it was probably a mistake of a decent film
1,i thought that the movie was a little too slow but i found it a little bit too difficult to sit,i ca n't think of anything more to say but that was one of the great things about the movie
1,you 've never heard of the movie before,you 're the best of this kind
1,i really do n't remember any of this,i have no clue if they are a little
1,i did enjoy a good portion of the film but i found it to be rather boring the acting was terrible even as in it 's the film and the plot and the acting were weak i was not amused when the,i do not see the actors in this turkey they do n't make a lot of money but it is just a little too easy to understand the plot and i did not like how they went for making this film
1,oh yeah and i was n't,oh no do not watch this if
1,the story is about a group of people in,the music was excellent it was all good
1,i saw it at a theatre in,i thought this was pretty funny
1,excellent performances and an exceptional story,excellent performances especially from the two leads
1,as the two meet up with their own son he becomes the hero and they,as soon as the film starts there is a big twist between the characters
1,the film is so much of an attempt to shock the viewer,the film is very well done with all of his characters
1,there are some very good songs,there are a few problems with the
1,for all of you people who know they are going to see a new,for some of its comments you have to wonder who the killer is
1,how could anybody think that this movie was a bad ripoff,how can you have a movie that actually has a lot of
1,i saw this film at the 2005 international film,i was surprised how this movie was made
1,it is about the power of the,it 's a pretty good thriller
1,while the plot of the film is interesting it 's a bit of an adventure,while this is a bit more interesting than a typical thriller i do n't think that
1,it 's not bad it 's just bad,it 's not just an action film it is
1,wendigo is also an interesting film as well as one of the most unique dramas,wendigo was a very bad movie i had to turn up for the first time because
1,this is my favorite film of all time,this movie is a disgrace to the intelligence of
1,spoiler alert this is the one film i have,spoiler ahead this is a really good film
1,the movie is a little too slow and dull but that 's enough to recommend it,the only thing that made this movie was the acting from everyone involved in the making of
1,in my opinion i can safely say this is a great episode,in one scene the police officers are killed at the end of the
1,the film also suffers from its lack of,the acting in the movie was terrible
1,the movie is about a man who is a little more than a child,the movie is not a comedy and should be avoided by the masses
1,transitions are the most important thing in life and it 's all that it is not only for a young man who 's only a member of the community or people that live in the city,transitions with his father is not always interesting because it is the story of two men living in a very normal society while the kids try to be different and different from the ones that are on
1,i saw this movie for my own reasons and that 's all i can say because it is a great movie,i saw this on cable in the late 1970 's and have been wanting to share some other elements but still the
1,i am not sure how people got to see,i have seen better acting in a film
1,the whole premise has a very nice premise it has some cool twists and turns but the story was too predictable and i ca n't think of anything more entertaining than,the story line is about a young girl named anna who has a heart attack to make her family to be a part of the partition of their own family
1,the story of the mother 's relationship with her daughter is so beautiful that you want to care less about the main character 's life,the only real complaint is the way i 've been in a movie theater in a country or the other movies from the past
1,first of all i would rather say that a better film was made at the end of the film,first of all i do n't think the actors really needed more in the film other than to show it
1,this film is a very well done film from the 80 's,this has been done as the most popular movie but that movie is
1,he has a small time of time,he and his wife are n't so good
1,finding an exit from that time he 's left behind the desk,finding out the truth is that people are going on a long voyage
1,the plot is so ridiculous i could not help but smile,the story line is simple and the acting is terrible
1,in fact it is almost as though the movie makers had a little too much time and just did not fit in the script,in the original film they would have had their chance to play a little more like a more interesting film but if they are to
1,secondly there 's another character who is a little too much to handle and has the most convincing,secondly in this case the movie fails and that 's a bit too long for the film
1,after the sunset we are talking about the death of one of,after this movie they were a lot better to take it
1,all in all not the best film ever made but this one is a definite masterpiece,all is all of it is not as much a drama as a lot of the other
1,wow this movie is about a young girl who 's being kidnapped by a woman that has been abused by her mother and has been forced,wow that 's what it 's a good movie but if you 've read the book you can see the story as the film progresses
1,the only person who is in this movie is the one who 's been in love with a good girl,the movie itself makes me think that there 's no need to be able to create a sequel into a movie
1,the actors are not in this film,the film is so much better and the
1,if you 're like me and not have a heart you 'll,if you like bad acting then you wo n't like it
1,i have never seen a worse film,i think you 'd have to be a
1,none of the actors are particularly good and the movie is just,none of them do anything except itit 's not very funny
1,if you 're looking for a good movie to watch it should definitely be your airwaves,if you want to know what to do with a story of two people who are willing
1,but if you 're interested at home in a warehouse with nothing to do but you do n't,but the best thing about this movie is it was the biggest waste of time of it
1,i would give this movie a 1 because it 's,i would like to add to more or more
1,i do n't want to spoil the ending,i could only see this if it were n't
1,a very well done film by all the cast including,a great movie for everyone who loves good movies
1,the story was so weak and had some stupid points to go along with it,the cast does a good job in the movie but the film is not particularly good
1,anyway i could n't get my head on one of those cheap scifi,anyway this is one of the worst films i have ever seen
1,it is a story about two young girls,it 's one heck of a ride
1,nevertheless he was a bit of a loser,nevertheless a few of the scenes make sense at
1,michael madsen has a small part as the cop in this film,michael dudikoff is in this but what we have here is a rather
1,thank a few of the greatest shows of all time and one of the,thank god i 've never seen this movie as bad as i could
1,while we learn that these two are the two of us and the world we are dealing in a,while i am not a massive fan of john lennon movies i still thought the director was great
1,of course this is what the filmmakers did not read and that it was n't really necessary to be the same,of course it 's a pity that no one else could actually say that this film was so bad it might have
1,the film 's biggest problem is that the film is n't very original at the very least and is quite obviously a little rushed at the time,the first thing i did was that the whole point of being a comedy with a stupid storyline and a ridiculous plot line makes it impossible for me
1,visually it was n't really good not to be seen,visually it is not only due to the fact that it
1,you have two friends who is not even an old man,you know it 's the best way to describe it
1,i saw this as a kid as,i am sorry he was n't
1,3 how dare this film be a good comedy,3 the movie was a bit of a mess it
1,it takes a very low budget horror flick with good,it is a very well made and funny movie
1,eastwood is a very good actor,eastwood 's acting was so bad that
1,after the first five minutes i thought it would take forever to get me to sit through it i missed it and it was really,after the war on the police station it became clear that the entire population of them had been forced up in the same place
1,now the first time i have seen it i do n't know how it 's going to end,now i 've seen a lot of action and it is pretty hard to take anything seriously out of
1,except one that was so terrible,except for a few moments that would
1,his character is a bit cranky,his brother has a son who is
1,it 's a great story about a woman,it 's not for the squeamish either
1,her father is a teenager of a man 's love and,her only real strength is to stay at the hotel
1,i think that a lot of people have done a better job of this film than i thought they could get,i think that if you can understand the plot you will feel you get the feeling that most of the film was
1,the main character is a very unlikable,the plot is a bit weak
1,take it with the wind and watch it,take a look at it for what it may
1,not only do you know it does n't end but what it means to,not as bad as the first one but it is the best one
1,the acting in this film is awful as it plays out like an,the script is n't bad either although the cast did n't help
1,ever since this movie was made,ever since when the movie 's title
1,likewise a bunch of teens that run out of steam have been kidnapped for their honeymoon,likewise i think he 'd have had more fun with the two stooges as he 's more
1,other than that it 's a nice watch and it 's one,other reviewers have commented on the film 's lack of depth
1,the plot is that a couple who are n't going to have to,the movie is just so bad i was laughing my eyes off
1,very few films have been so bad and so poorly,very much worth watching and certainly worth checking out
1,this is one of those films that you can watch with a smile like it 's a bit over,this is a great film which has a wonderful message but is just not enough to justify it
1,shot at the airport in the desert this is another beautiful film which shows what we need a movie,shot the movie with such a lack of funds it gives us insights to reflect the characters and what it
1,having seen the trailer and having a conversation between the two men i was expecting the same kind to be a,having read the book i must say that if it were n't for the actors involved i could n't help
1,when they try they make it funny but they ca n't even save the film,when the film is over it seems to work in this movie which is the case
1,you know they are a couple of hours of your life,you know when you hear the name of the movie
1,and when one of the characters is the father,and the plot is all over the place
1,the music was fantastic and the dancing was very awesome,the director has made a couple of films that should have
1,it 's a shame that this film did n't get a wider release from me and not because of the fact that it did n't make any sense,it 's a pity because she did n't have a chance to do a movie about the life of the child and she was the father 's daughter
1,85 years later my friend has never seen her in anything else in the film except that this film is,85 minutes after the last hour i thought i was watching something interesting and a bit of a mystery
1,either he was just afraid of doing his or the film,either way it makes you wish you would be a star wars
1,sf is a classic that 's really a great mix,sf is the best one in the entire film
1,the only thing this movie has going for it is when it 's released on dvd,the only reason this movie was made is because the plot and storyline are weak
1,it 's a great movie if you think a film that is as good as it gets,it also shows us some of her scenes with a young child being tortured by someone who is
1,at the same time it seems to have taken a long way to make it into a movie,at this time i was really surprised by what i saw but i could have sworn it was a
1,dat is n't one of them,dat love and a life is an
1,hormones of the human spirit are so common and well developed as to be fully integrated,hormones and women in the film have a nice touch of acting to help them
1,even a few minutes later the film is a long lost treasure on the head,even though there are a couple of things i really liked this movie is very much
1,this movie would have been better to make but,this movie was not to mention the acting
1,in one way she acts in a way of showing her breasts her face and her face in her eyes,in a world of desperation and desperation the filmmakers have to have a great chemistry with the audience that will probably
1,an interesting story with a very interesting plot line and a few of the actors,an insult to all involved but i am giving a damn about the film
1,one must take a shower scene after watching,one of the worst of the series
1,there is absolutely no reason to watch the movie because it 's just,there is a lot of blood and sexual references in this film
1,thus the film has a great cast including robert young john gielgud and michael douglas,thus the viewer is treated to a good amount of action but that does not make
1,the story line is pretty good,the characters in this movie should never
1,i did n't think that there was one,i just finished watching it on video
1,donald sutherland is very good as is the rest of the supporting cast,donald sutherland is a good actor but not enough to hold on to his
1,the ending was so abrupt that you 'll see it being more than just a bad remake of,the film itself is a visual medium and the characters and events have some very interesting qualities
1,and then the final scene comes to an end where we do not see him getting beaten up the rest,and this is a pretty accurate film with a couple of exceptions and a few scenes that make sense
1,the only thing worth remembering is that it is n't a comedy and is very,the ending was a bit abrupt and the ending left much to be desired
1,i would have known better the casting and editing is firstrate,i ca n't believe how the writers of this show did a
1,marlon brando in particular is a good man and his performance is perfect,marlon brando plays the tough guy but the whole script is terrible
1,sometimes it has no redeeming feature,sometimes it was a bit of a
1,the movie was also shot and edited with a handheld camera,the main problem in this movie is its lack of suspense
1,for a long time it just made you think the characters were the worst,for me the only thing that has been done here was the ending as the
1,sinatra was an actress who had not been the character actor,sinatra and bacall are both wonderful together in their roles
1,this one was not for everyone,this movie was a waste of time
1,terribly bad bad bad film from a director who 's trying to be funny and fails miserably at making it all a comedy,terribly written and directed in the first of three scenes are the usual and almost endless glimpses of the first two films which the
1,the film has a few twists to go on and on but the end of this movie is completely predictable,the only reason for watching a film is that it 's a good thing and it 's not the first time
1,and when the movie ends you feel bad,and the story line is quite good
1,one of the worst of the series involves the two heroes who just ca n't stand to kill the man who 's being chased by his parents and the son they are killed,one of the reasons i have never heard of this is that it was released in 1980 the director admitted the audience was a very sensitive fan of the book for this particular film
1,i'm glad it will be made,i'm a huge fan of this movie
1,you have to take the movie seriously,you have not done anything for yourself
1,good luck but not a good one,good luck by the guy he has done
1,besides the cast are all excellent,besides the fact that you have no
1,i saw it again after hearing about it on the tube when i was about 13 it is a very good movie,i 've seen this film over and over again and am a sucker for the original version of jane austen 's excellent adventure
1,the film 's main drawback of the film is that it is not an easy one to watch,the director has created a wonderful film about the hardships of war and how life is about war
1,the plot is pretty simple the characters are n't developed and the story is just a mess,the cast is also wonderful and is quite entertaining and you can see a difference between the two
1,through the years we learn that the real world is an extraterrestrial in,through the movie the camera moves to the scene of the film
1,one thing the acting was that the story itself was,one of the best films i 've ever seen
1,its hard to believe a film made to work on such an event that is n't in any way,its not so bad that my mouth and my mouth just got my teeth bleed at the film
1,the plot is very simple and the characters,the main attraction of the film is the performance
1,a young woman and a son decide to,a very very very good film indeed
1,some of the performances of the actors were pretty impressive,some of the best ever heard of a good movie but
1,in the movie he gets to go on a,in fact it was n't all pretty bad
1,one of the most important things about the movie is,one of the greatest examples ever made me watch
1,surprisingly i have the same feeling that this movie is a great deal of laughs,surprisingly this show really made me feel like watching people 's reactions on each other
1,the only one who is able to act at this point is the woman,the film is a lot of fun to watch as is the story
1,the plot of this film was very predictable,the plot is not so simple as the plot
1,according to the imdb comment is about a couple of women who,according to this dvd it is not even worth a rental
1,not the worst of the summer or even worse but it was,not a bad movie in general but still a decent movie
1,walt allen has some great talent in movies but he plays a character like the one in,walt is an interesting story in which the story is a bit too easy to follow
1,he 's got the worst acting performance and he can get a bit annoying,he 's an idiot in the whole movie and is an important talent of a
1,i really enjoyed this film and i love it,i was surprised that this could have been a classic
1,recommendation do n't waste your time on this film do not waste,recommendation i have to write a few lines about this movie
1,i love it as much as i did,i 've been looking for this film since i
1,this time it should be in the top ten,this is a film that is really bad
1,these are a bunch of clichs that you 'll recognize to see them die on their own,these films have been filmed dozens are made available only for tv to be released theatrically
1,he 's so charming he does n't want to go to the police,he 's not a typical guy with a taste of humor who has a
1,i was n't so sure about this movie because it was a comedy,i did n't really see the original version of the movie because of all
1,at first it is a real good movie that the director could afford to be able to make and then make,at one point in the film he 's given a chance but he does n't do that much to save his life
1,the director is constantly unable to tell him the value of,the film is also very well directed and beautifully crafted
1,but in a different direction this is one of the most moving films in cinematic history,but what i got was a rather predictable and confusing story about a group of young people
1,i would definitely recommend it as a movie,i love horror films and this was one of
1,he has been in the habit of playing an american game in the city where the film takes place in the past decade,he is a pretty cool guy and he does n't have to deal with the fact that he does n't want himself but he
1,it was n't a good movie and i would n't,it just does not fit the screen for me
1,samuels 's character is an interesting character and the movie itself is very interesting,samuels plays in the film as one of the most important characters ever
1,for me the best thing in this film was the fact that it was directed by robert ryan,for the whole family it was a lot better then the movie and i was so surprised to see
1,by the way i do like a scene with a,by a chance the two men are the two
1,the film was a very interesting experience but was not enough to save it from being too preachy and pointless and it is n't particularly,the script is a little thin but it 's a story about a woman that gets married by a young woman in the beginning
1,yes it is not very realistic that the majority of the movie seems to go on and on but it does n't,yes i do n't like the sound of a lot of the other people who did n't like it but at least not
1,as a matter of fact the acting was atrocious,as in films like this and so to see something
1,several times and then the movie becomes too boring and repetitive,several people on the board do a good job of expressing the
1,the plot is about four men who,the movie is a bit silly
1,i am a huge fan of the first and only slightly obscure film but,i think it would have been nice to see more of these two
1,watch all the way to get this done and,watch it and you 'll understand the plot
1,at that same time the movie gets old,at least the writers have the audacity to show
1,in the end i felt it was a great story with all of a sudden snappy ending,in the first half of the film the viewer gets an idea of what was going on and
1,this movie was made for the sake of,this movie should be called the jackal
1,several of the scenes were a little long and the music was n't very exciting either,several times in this movie the characters have been drawn to the screen and their characters are
1,i do n't know how it ended,i do n't know why she 's been
1,the movie follows up to it being in the same vein as the first films,the only thing that makes this movie work was its lack of acting talent
1,oliver platt 's character is a stereotype,oliver stone is not a bad actor at
1,as for the supporting actors in this film i think they would get involved in a bigger,as soon as the film started i was expecting much from it it was the worst
1,a great show that will keep you guessing,a very interesting plot twist for the whole picture
1,some scenes were shot in a bit of the style of the actors in this show that make it hard,some might think that this film is a masterpiece in terms of substance but it is still worth watching
1,when it comes to grading it in the final seconds of its running time its just a poor excuse for a thriller,when the main story unfolds the action becomes the first to be discovered by the same man who made me think what is
1,a very funny and very touching satire on the nature of the subject matter,a lot of people have commented that the film is quite dated but not as
1,i did not know about the movie i was expecting much from the movie,i would have liked to see a better adaptation of a classic version of the
1,all in all a complete disappointment,all these scenes are the same
1,a young man returns home to save his family,a young woman who 's not a whore
1,every time you get it on tv you have no qualms at all at all,every time i watch it it will be at the bottom of my lungs
1,it 's just a shame that it does not get the recognition it deserved,it was a great story line for a good guy but i have a lot
1,one of the best of them all,one scene is in a shootout where she
1,the cast are very good too,the film is a real treat to
1,the script is a little bit contrived,the director obviously had a lot of money
1,this movie shows us the effects of the people 's life and its strengths to make,this was one of the worst movies i have seen in a long long time
1,nevertheless the film is an interesting look at two teenage,nevertheless this one has a strong sense of humor
1,ivan is the most convincing of all,ivan was one of the worst and worst
1,this is no exception no one who,this film really deserves a 910
1,apparently the film was made into a feature as he has no choice for,apparently they were just getting away with it so they can be excused
1,like in the film the plot revolves around an ancient artifact in the middle of nowhere,like a little boy and a girl i know there is a woman that loves a movie
1,not a good film a very good concept,not one to be taken seriously but i do
1,vivek oberoi was the best and funniest actor in the cast,vivek oberoi gives a brilliant performance as a young actor as well
1,the film also has a few funny moments,the only good parts are when the main guy
1,he had a good role in the cast,he was very likable as a boy to make
1,it just does n't work and i found that i could n't believe i was able,it 's all about the family and their interactions with each other the same way
1,with some exceptions and the occasional mannered use of a few scenes to add more to the film than the sum of eye candy this is a,with some of the worst actors i 've ever seen there 's a good cast that includes christopher walken christopher walken donald pleasence and bill murray
1,does not contain spoilers so the film is n't really bad and the,does anyone know where i can get past this film so far
1,in the opening segment is a dream story of two girls in their early 20s years,in a world where the human race would be more dangerous than the us and not in
1,there have been many comments about the movie but what i do remember about this movie is that it was very low,there are a few nice touches to make but the real problems with this series are the bad and bad acting
1,the movie is a very entertaining film,the whole movie is just too silly to
1,and in one shot it makes the viewer wish that the film would have made its impact in the hands,and that is n't to say that the rest of the cast is n't as bad as they were
1,richie and his friend try to make the best out of the others as they get to the island,richie lee plays one of the most despicable characters who can come up with a great idea but they do
1,it 's the ultimate fault of the movie though that i ca n't really say the least bit of what it 's is about as it 's one of the most entertaining films i 've ever,it may actually have been more of a curiosity show than any episode of the series but the writers had a certain twist that they did n't need to do so in a new way
1,barely a minute of its time the film was n't made,barely even remotely scary the story was so much better
1,released in the philippines i was surprised at how much,released as an example and not a good one
1,all in all it is very well,all in all an okay movie
1,first the script is n't too bad and the actors do n't seem to,first and foremost is it a comedy that i never got into it
1,bland plot and plot twists do n't make sense,bland and the film is filled with flashbacks from other
1,but as a movie i would say that the movie was shot in a very cheap way and the effects are so fake that i can hardly hear the word on the cover of it,but this movie is so incredibly awful that i was not surprised by the film i was watching it on my own i do so and if i could do it again i would be tempted
1,otherwise i have this movie to add to my collection of bad films,otherwise it was a good idea to get past the point and i do
1,one is this one of a good movie,one of my favorite things about this movie is
1,and if it were n't for the fact that a film like this would put it to shame i 'd have to be ashamed,and if you 're looking for a good movie that was made for a while watch it but do n't waste your time
1,the acting is terrible the plot is weak but it 's fun to watch and it 's not,the movie is also a total joke about friendship love sex and the need for a lot
1,dick tracy plays the role that is very likable,dick foran 's acting in this movie is a little
1,tougher than any other films i have seen in my life i 've seen them,tougher than the first film but the real star is in the final scene
1,this is a bad movie in the extreme,this is a very bad movie and i'm surprised
1,there were two parts of this movie that,there is no mention of the story
1,if you like watching movies you can enjoy this,if you do you 'll not care much
1,and when his wife dies her friend,and what is with the acting
1,sometimes you get a bit of a chuckle as a child and i would like,sometimes it looks like a tv show but it 's still worth a look
1,the only good thing about the movie is the presence of james woods,the movie just seemed to get me wrong the director was not interested in
1,dreadful acting poor story wooden writing and stupid acting make this a real stinker,dreadful editing poor script awful dialog and a poor ending that 's just as bad
1,there is absolutely no mention of his performance in,there were some nice sequences in the movie
1,if the plot is really a little contrived i would rather see another episode that had,if it was on tv i could just be looking for a few good actors
1,while the film may work well in the us the only other film that i can think of is that i can find the subtitles to be funny and entertaining for the whole,while this film has some similarities to the classic film it is a bit hard to understand what happened during the film and when we saw it it is not a film
1,they do n't know what it 's about,they 're also a great director and a very
1,first of all i do n't believe this is,first the movie was shot in new york
1,this movie did n't have much to do with the book as the book and the movie itself did not make,this would have been the most interesting film about the holocaust of the west in its depiction of the conflict
1,but the story is so complex so that the two main characters share some really interesting moments,but even the most ardent of fans of the show have a knack for getting the money to
1,i could have been more cooperative by a more,i thought it was a pretty good movie
1,proceeds to go to the movies for the rest of the,proceeds for the good of all of it 's characters
1,and what did she do in this episode,and the only problem it has is the fact
1,what is the matter with that,what i did have to do was
1,you see the film at a theater where the characters are so onedimensional that it makes,you will get the feeling i was going to be there to see this movie
1,although they are in a very good place this film has a very funny plot and an interesting story,although i do n't really understand his character i think it 's an excellent story line that does n't work
1,when they 're not trying to make a joke they 're the main character,when she realizes she is being murdered by one of her girlfriends she is kidnapped
1,there 's an odd scene where some of a couple in the desert are walking and chased out of a truck,there is also some sort of weird tension between the two characters but there really is nothing to talk about
1,america 's first experience was so bad it actually,america has been in the past 50 years
1,his brother 's son is a complete wuss and a complete waste of time,his character is the worst of the bunch and it is so difficult that you
1,i would n't have to watch the movie again in the cinema,i really did n't have any idea of what happened next after this
1,he is a great actor but he does n't do much of the role,he is a young man who is trying to find his father but he does
1,this was a very bad attempt at something so badly made,this film has the potential to be the first time the filmmakers
1,then i watched a little of his movies and thought they were just good but he,then the film switches gears of a new generation with the same characters as well
1,in one scene a woman stabs some blood and she gets to watch another car,in the film it 's a pity that it is so difficult that it is not
1,this is the kind of film we do not see in our modern cinema and i do n't see how you could spend money on the garbage,this show is just a bit stupid for all who know the same thing to the movie when he said he would n't be too fond of himself
1,it 's a shame that this film will not win a second oscar it deserves to be seen with the most out of ten for,it 's hard to believe the difference between his character the first and the second one and the second he sees in his eyes
1,this is a movie that deserves to be seen by anyone who is a fan of the art of,this episode is the one that stands out with all the kids and shows how people would enjoy
1,do not read the book if it 's not a good movie,do you know how to make a horror movie or horror movie or
1,i think this was a great idea but it is n't as big as other movies of it,i do n't know why but this film has some good parts and the ending is so cool that
1,the film is about the journey of some friends,the script also does contain the usual clichs of the
1,check out the cast and the characters,check out the film 's title and the
1,secondly this is n't the story of a young man with a gun and a beard,secondly i would not have given them much to the film but the two main actors in
1,the acting is n't bad and the script,the acting is not terrible at all
1,its a shame that this movie was never released in the us,its only an hour of pure unadulterated fun to see it 's not
1,the only thing about this movie that,the acting is very pretty awful
1,a good film with some strong actors in the cast a good script and,a bit of trivia for me as is the case with the original
1,if anything you 'd have much better to see a movie,if you are a fan of the genre you may be disappointed
1,it 's hard to say who would be good in,it has absolutely no redeeming factors or a baffle
1,at one point during the day of the movie you get it you can hear,at times the film is a very boring movie about a woman who has a very
1,begins this movie with the same name as this movie,begins with an extremely funny opening involving two old ladies walking
1,you have to wonder why it was so good in every sense of the word,you know what i mean the characters are good but the storyline is so dull you
1,the main problem with this movie was that it was,the acting from the actors is atrocious at best
1,unlike a lot of the book this one was very different and not a complete surprise,unlike another reviewer this is the story of a girl who has been cheating on her life
1,i have seen better acting on youtube,i really enjoyed the ending i thought the
1,i do n't know who was who killed the director and the producer was so bad,i have to wonder if it 's the best way of life in a movie
1,plot twists were the characters in this movie but in the end,plot wise this film is the worst i have ever seen
1,but this movie was a very poor attempt at humor,but that 's not what is so stupid about this film
1,you get two things you do n't like or care about,you can tell there 's a lot of people trying to make
1,the cast is very good but the script was really awful,the first film has been set to direct an epic series and
1,i do n't remember this one being as good as i could have imagined and i really enjoy it,i do not even feel the need to give it a score of 2 but it 's just an excellent
1,the acting was n't that bad although i liked some of the actors,the film has a lot to say about the characters and they 're in
1,this movie is a mustsee for all,this was a very enjoyable surprise
1,i'm surprised this is n't rated,i'm a big fan of the first
1,lance henriksen looks like a cross between the two,lance henriksen plays a reporter with a penchant for tolerance
1,hard boiled and the black lagoon is a film that is a,hard to say but this film is n't a great one
1,heath ledger gives a stellar performance,heath ledger is a bit of an
1,i love the music and it does not disappoint,i have seen better acting but this one was so
1,europa is a good show that deserves more recognition,europa is an excellent film for the whole family and
1,a few other things i liked about this,a great actor in a great role
1,well i could n't take it as a teenager and watched it twice as the film had its title in 1979,well the story is simple enough to get a hold of the movie on a rainy day with an allstar cast and
1,that 's why this film is so good it makes it enjoyable,that was my personal point for me to think that in this movie
1,she is the first woman that comes off the island with a heart,she meets and falls of his mother and he begins to fall for each
1,do n't be fooled by the critics in the box of the comments posted this review on imdb on a forum of the,do not get me wrong i liked the first two films but after an hour i had never heard of it before
1,first off in the middle of the film he is a jerk,first the story was predictable and it just left the audience wanting more
1,do n't get me wrong i like,do n't listen to the critics
1,lucio fulci 's original film 'the battleship potemkin made,lucio fulci is a film that is better
1,stanley kubrick has made a fine film about a young woman who has,stanley tucci is perfect as a slimy young boy of the day
1,this film should have won the academy award,this movie is definitely one of the best of
1,what i found in the movie was a good story and some good acting,what is even more disturbing is the fact that the director is obviously trying to
1,i saw that movie and did n't understand much of it,i think it 's the fact that you have to read a
1,even the actors did a wonderful job,even the actors are good too
1,oh i know he is going to be one of the top 50 actors,oh dear god you 're going to do n't waste your time with this movie
1,you can watch this movie without the expectation of the director,you will be in for a rough ride as well but this
1,apparently it is a matter of fact that i was not surprised when i heard about the box,apparently he is a big brother and it turns out that he is a great man in the past
1,will she be able to get out of,will we be there that you should
1,however the film also suffers from an attempt to make the film,however the plot is quite convoluted and so is the acting
1,the plot itself is a bit thin but the plot and characters are very good,the story was not as complex as the first it was written by an old man
1,it 's a shame that they did n't waste,it is also a movie like the matrix
1,i do n't know who 's who but i was,i do n't think that 's it 's fault
1,again if you want to have a fun evening of fun in the end,again in my review one that makes it more worthwhile than i did
1,an example of his talent is the performance of paul giamatti as his,an example is when the killer 's daughter is on the rampage
1,contrary to most films i 've seen i will watch this film,contrary to the film 's title the movie is a perfect example of
1,werner herzog also makes a very memorable cameo of the first film,werner herzog 's score is a delight and is the only saving grace
1,she had the same strength to be had,she 's also in for her good looks
1,starting out with a bang in the middle of nowhere this movie is a total mess from the beginning,starting it a time in which an american boy gets into a job when the police force the fbi agent
1,if i was a big fan of the first two films i would love it,if this movie had a chance to live on the shelf i would n't have had
1,we 're talking about the real life of a group of people and they are able to get a bunch of,we had an interesting plot line with a bit of the same old stuff being played over and over again
1,if it had been a comedy the first movie it would have taken a little more serious is about life,if you 're looking for a good film with the actors you 'd better be able to find something more interesting
1,bogey 's performance is n't the best at the,bogey and his wife are the perfect pair
1,this would 've been much much better without it,this film does not have the power that most of
1,so you could have fun with the characters if this was a horror film,so it goes on and off and the film seems to have been made as
1,the only good acting performance i can recall in this movie is the one,the story line is not as interesting as it is supposed to be
1,everybody else in the production is a joy,everybody in the theater is a caricature of their
1,here is a story that could have been so much better,here is the story of a man who is trying to solve
1,i think this one should 've been made available on cable as well,i was expecting a good movie and if it had n't come up i
1,the music score are excellent as is the soundtrack,the acting is bad the script lacks any interest whatsoever
1,what is this a movie about what the director of a project could do without the money,what makes the story work is the fact that this is supposed to be a movie
1,for the most part the acting is n't bad either,for starters the whole movie was about a bunch of people
1,also the scene where she is in her room is hilarious,also starring john candy as a young girl who is supposed to
1,davis was a perfect choice to show the world she grew up in and was very very beautiful,davis makes the most of this film but the viewer is n't sure whether to or both have n't
1,they even had me rolling in with the tv,they were so annoying and stupid and that when i
1,actually it 's a great film and a worthy example of,actually there are no good points for the film either
1,he was also on the way in,he was not afraid to leave
1,anyway i ca n't believe that this movie is made,anyway they were both excellent actors in this movie
1,portrayals of the main characters as well as the characters do n't help,portrayals of the various characters in the film are quite believable even if you
1,the film is quite obviously the first film,the script was a very bad mess
1,after watching this i realized that i had to watch it on tv,after the bad acting you ca n't really say it was made for tv
1,nice photography but it just goes on and,nice to see such a funny film
1,his wife is the daughter of one of the best women out there,his acting career is a fine example of how he can act so believably
1,it has been one of the most popular films of,it 's also the funniest thing in the movie
1,it 's not all that good but i think it 's a very good movie if it were done so good,it makes it impossible to see the point of view or the need to be more of a threat that a man
1,i'm still trying to find the soundtrack,i'm glad that i did n't get more
1,the acting in this movie is really good though not very good,the story has a similar plot with characters that are so stupid you
1,can you believe that this has a certain kind of humor,can a man who has a child in the house should be
1,one of the worst pieces of art i have ever seen,one of the worst i have ever seen a movie about a
1,watch the first half that is more fun,watch out of the original instead of the dark
1,if there were a couple of laughs there was a way where this movie was going to get,if you 've ever played ff7 i would love to watch a good movie like this one
1,izo 's the thing was the worst of the movie,izo is not an action movie it takes place in a
1,the story itself was ok but the characters were so boring with no motivation or motivation,the only redeeming factor of the film is the music score by michael j moore
1,and it was really hard to understand who was the villain,and in the case of a film about a young man you
1,i am surprised that the film did n't get a theatrical release in a us version,i do not think that the director 's intention for this movie was any better than a
1,in the movie she 's on the trail to find,in this case it 's not a big film
1,one can only hope they have it a new release for christmas but if this is a movie we might have,one thing that is funny is that it never made me laugh even when the plot was n't even interesting
1,taj crowe is a real star who is given his role as a man he could,taj was so stupid that he had a lot of potential and a great cast
1,if you love horror genre you 're not the one to miss,if i were to make movies i would choose to watch this movie
1,i ca n't believe that the movie was ever made,i think the film has a lot better production values on
1,though the acting was pretty good the acting was very good and the acting was so great it is amazing,though this film has a bit of a dark atmosphere of the movie the atmosphere and atmosphere are well executed
1,the first half of its three hour running time is about as exciting as it gets,the film is very well made and has many great scenes but it 's not even so
1,you can also find a new wave in it and it 's all over the place as the film is about,you get to watch the original lion king movie and the other one that i had hoped it would have been
1,spoilers ahead the plot revolves around a guy who goes out to kill a woman who is killed by her boyfriend for revenge,spoilers ahead i saw the film with my roommate but it was a waste and i can only say this is a better film
1,sadly they do n't make the same mistake as the one and,sadly it is not a classic but a very funny movie
1,but i can only assume that if i was a teenager this would have been a great movie to take the movie seriously but it is still an entertaining movie,but as a viewer that is a little unfair for this type of movie the movie has some good scenes such as the little girl 's pregnancy with the woman who
1,after an early death scene divorces a child of a woman 's daughter on a train to her home,after a few brief viewings in the film you see the movie and i feel the pain of the story
1,unfortunately he has the best role in this movie as he is a young man,unfortunately the film did not feature a score by the end of the movie
1,the movie takes a great deal of life to make a good movie,the only way to see it is to have it in an open mind
1,the only reason i rented this was because the trailer,the director 's commentary on this one is great
1,walter matthau gives a stellar performance in her portrayal of her and in her role in the film i was n't expecting her,walter huston is perfect as a cop and i hope to get the chance to see him perform a good performance again
1,the film was filmed on one location the interior and special effects,the movie is set in paris as one of the main characters in
1,despite the fact that there is nothing that will do the film justice to any one of this film the audience is treated to the fact that,despite all this a bad movie i could watch it over the next 100 years and now that 's what i think it should have been
1,it 's a good film to look at and the way you get to see it all the time,it seems like a bunch of high school kids who were trying to make a new school play to spend
1,under the circumstances of the movie we get to love it and will see it as,under the guidance of a young boy with a severe brain tumor and an arm
1,i have to confess that this movie was not to be missed and the acting,i could understand why anyone could care less about the characters then the plot
1,that is the most obvious aspect of the,that said the movie is pretty funny
1,disappointment the film has some good points to it that are very well done,disappointment for its release the story and acting in the beginning are n't bad at
1,this movie is about a guy named larry who comes,this one has the potential to be a masterpiece
1,late at night on the streets of paris a couple of men have been invited to work for a wealthy businesswoman,late night television is a good example of how the world 's biggest asset will be remembered in this movie
1,yes the film is about the same,yes this movie really is stupid
1,i 've seen a few of these movies,i was a little irritated of it
1,610 i mean the movie was very entertaining as a movie that i thought it was very good,610 rated r for strong language sexual references some violence some profanity some profanity some profanity and some brief
1,in the case of the evil dead man who is the only person who has to go to the bathroom,in the original version i was able to predict the story of the movie in a matter of seconds
1,i saw this movie for the first time after viewing it,i was also very glad she said the movie is n't all
1,and in all honesty you have to,and what 's up with that
1,oh and you 're supposed to believe this,oh god and you get my drift
1,even though the story is about a man who goes,even the movie would be a bit too predictable
1,one of the many comments of how many people,one of the many great shows ever made
1,yes it 's supposed to make you feel,yes you have a movie called it
1,unfortunately this movie fails badly in the way of making some viewers,unfortunately this film does seem to go nowhere for anyone involved
1,the story is based on an actual incident that involves a,the film is shot beautifully and edited with a camera
1,the characters are interesting and they work together very well,the only thing that could have done with this one is
1,the movie begins with a bunch of random girls walking around a table talking about their dying friends who are talking,the film follows the story of a young boy who has been kidnapped and killed by a very brutal accident
1,i saw this film at your local rental in a preview,i have never heard that 's been said so much
1,if you want to read the book and think that i could see all i know about this movie,if you 're looking for a good horror movie with some decent gore scenes and plenty of action and some
1,i do n't think i 've ever seen,i would have given it zero stars
1,throughout his career it seemed like a big mistake at that time,throughout the movie the story of a woman and wife who move across
1,overall i 'd say this is a bad movie,overall it 's not too bad to be a bad
1,there is also a great deal of humor in,there are some moments that were quite funny
1,this is a movie that is full of clichs,this was the second and final outing of a trilogy
1,the acting was pretty bad and i really did n't know why she was n't given a chance to develop the story,the film is a very funny and funny comedy with a message that makes you think that the story is not going to
1,by the end of the film it 's hard to say whether i wanted to see,by the time i was in the cinema i was n't impressed with anything new
1,worst of all is that he has to spend too much time talking about how,worst of all is not the movie but in the same year 's war
1,they could have done something more with more,they 're not even close to that
1,nonetheless this film is a perfect example for all,nonetheless there are several moments of suspense and a lot
1,the first half of the film is also quite interesting in the last third of his life,the movie is a real treat for me because it is the story about how it should be
1,he then decides to stay and he will kill her from which he is,he makes up for a good script with a good script and some very cool
1,whether i liked the movie or not it was the most boring and stupid movie i 've ever seen,whether or not it was a good movie or not but this one is so bad it has to be
1,another thing that really makes this movie so memorable is the music,another problem with the film is that it 's too dull to be
1,one of my best parts is the scene where alex,one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,this is one film that is just plain dull,this is a movie that you can watch with your
1,watch it again to understand what it is going to end,watch it with no expectations you wo n't be disappointed
1,this is the sort of film that is so utterly laughable that it is hard to forget the plot and acting,this movie is n't worth watching and it is better than i expected a movie which i felt compelled to write about
1,furthermore it 's a great film because it features a good cast,furthermore this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen but
1,i ca n't see it enough,i had read reviews that claimed i
1,the movie is so stupid that i actually laughed out loud at the horrible acting,the acting is bad as they try to be too bad but they 're too good
1,case we get one film which has n't aged,case was the film the producer had to write about
1,for example they all had to have to work on a new mission,for the first time in the series the last broadcast to a real life
1,and that is not what i wanted to tell about,and it makes it easier for them to show more than
1,and the scene is pretty funny,and for some time there is not
1,then when a man who thinks that he would be a,then there was a couple that i found very interesting
1,i saw a screener release of this film on the sundance movie fest and it has been hailed,i have to go see this movie again for the first time in time to see it
1,but the acting is just bad,but the most interesting thing about this
1,a young woman who comes in a mental hospital and is confronted with drugs is a,a few months later he 's still a bit of a jerk to the eye
1,the story of the movie is just so much of a family film,the director is trying to give it a good deal of atmosphere but it
1,lee 's father and her boyfriend 's father who have an affair that is n't even as,lee is at his best as the film 's hapless antihero with a heart of gold
1,first off it has its flaws and some great acting,first of all i must mention that this was the first
1,too bad the movie fails in that respect,too good they did n't even bother to take
1,it 's a story of love and death and death and redemption,it also shows that we never find a way to make a difference
1,so in my opinion the film was a total waste of time,so the film opens when his friend goes down with his father in
1,although i had the privilege of viewing the movie i felt,although the story is predictable it still does n't work
1,if you want to see a great movie in my book do n't watch this movie,if you 're thinking about renting the original and are interested in the first film you will
1,then there are the usual plot inconsistencies that do n't make much sense though but in this instance the story makes sense,then when the main character comes to life with a new life he is just as much as the main actor
1,the only reason i watched this film was because the,the main characters are n't all that attractive either
1,have the people responsible for this mess,have to get into my collection of films
1,i love it the best is the way where this movie gets,i do n't like to watch it in a few places
1,as a child who loves her and wants to be in the movie,as a matter of fact he has to have a good life
1,sniper island is n't bad as the movie does n't seem to be,sniper 3 is pretty good it 's not as bad as some good cgi
1,this is a film that should do n't hesitate,this was just an awful horrible boring movie
1,unfortunately he fails to deliver the goods with his characters and,unfortunately i 've always loved this film in my memory
1,if you want to watch a movie that is supposed to be good you will be disappointed,if your going to watch a movie that is better than the one you 're likely to see
1,war is the story of the same thing which is a lot,war crimes and crime are a real deal in this film
1,in addition to all his faults the film never lets you forget that we,in this case they 're all so good as to be so funny
1,alec guinness is superb as a villain,alec guiness has been on a lot of
1,filmed by a group of college student this is a very,filmed on video it was made a long time ago
1,not only because of the film 's reputation in some ways but also because of the way the characters are portrayed as the story unfolds,not sure whether there are other reasons why the whole movie is so horrible it 's a little too long to be taken seriously
1,in short it is a little dated but it is very hard to follow,in this episode they are in the same league as they had in the first
1,that 's all a great deal of time and it 's all,that 's about as interesting as that 's the movie 's
1,i have n't seen any of his earlier work,i really hope i never found this show on tv
1,the film is set in the united,the movie was directed and edited
1,otherwise that 's a pretty bad thing,otherwise this film was horrible and i have
1,rather than a serious and more interesting film in the tradition of a more realistic,rather than the usual formula of a good film this one 's pretty dull
1,there is a reason for that to have been made for tv,there is absolutely no logic whatsoever and it 's just plain stupid to
1,the movie is about a group of people who go,the film is so bad it 's almost comical
1,i love it when it 's not as good as in the,i 've never seen such a bad thing in my life
1,contrary to the above mentioned reviews i saw a few of the posters,contrary to what i 've read this review was a bit misleading
1,what makes this film worth seeing is the excellent,what was wrong with that one at all
1,the whole movie is a complete package of people 's lives,the movie is really a good family drama that shows us how
1,this has nothing that has any of them,this film is a very enjoyable thriller
1,the whole idea of the film is that the characters themselves are not in the movie and if there can be a character in them i do n't know why so many people think it is bad,the film starts off with an extended flashback sequence and in the end of the movie it 's clear that it 's an attempt to make a documentary of itself in which it was filmed independently it would
1,the acting was atrocious the script was awful and,the music was n't really that good either
1,and that the actors are all in it,and i 've always been fond of the original
1,this is a movie for you to see,this film is a very entertaining and good show
1,then there 's the story that was n't even funny as the story of,then the story moves into the real world and it becomes very important
1,most movies of the era include one,most of the performances are excellent
1,the story is a lot less engaging to watch it 's a good idea,the first half hour has an ok plot and the acting is pretty good but
1,i love the way that the story unfolds,i saw the movie and it was a great
1,a man who is a little paranoid and a little bit,a very interesting plot twist and a very good soundtrack
1,the film opens with his young daughter and her son,the story of two of them is very similar to those
1,to paraphrase a few people the director and crew make a good mention that this is a very poor movie,to be sure i have seen this movie and i think it 's a shame to learn that it has absolutely
1,there is a lot of humor in it and some good laughs,there is a lot of the stuff that happens to be a little
1,and if you have n't heard of it the plot is not so stupid as you may have expected,and the film is a total washout on the box office as a whole with the only redeeming qualities of
1,the music and dance numbers in the,the music and music is excellent
1,this one does n't work because as far as i'm concerned the director has,this film has one of the most beautiful sequences i have ever seen
1,in short this is a mustsee,in my opinion it is a good
1,bruce willis does not fit well with the rest of the cast in this film,bruce willis has no idea how to kill a girl but i guess it would have
1,especially the two leads which are not the best performances in this film which they,especially the scene where he dances with them and their mother and his wife
1,by the way it was all done by,by all means this is no masterpiece
1,once i finished watching it you just kept wondering,once again this is the kind of film a movie
1,basically it is an enjoyable movie,basically it 's a bad movie but
1,as it stands there it just is n't,as far as i know it 's a good
1,it 's not that you are supposed to get some sort of sympathy for the story,it also stars helen mirren as an english actress who has a lot of talent as a
1,there 's no plot no character development not the least bit,there are a bunch of funny moments but there is no reason
1,i was expecting from the director to go down the toilet and see the first two,i have not seen anything in any other films before and that 's pretty bad
1,however this is a movie i would love to point,however for that the film is so poorly done
1,my rating was high and the acting was n't that bad,my friends and i went to see this movie because it came
1,as a movie it has that the most ardent film noir i 've ever seen,as far as i am concerned i saw this film and had nothing to do with
1,the music is so good it 's,the acting and writing are bad
1,i do n't have much to say,i could go on and on
1,why was the story of the original novel,why did i watch the whole thing
1,solondz made a movie with a great cast,solondz and his crew do an injustice to the
1,every episode every episode every episode of the series are about one man 's struggle about the death of a,every shot and camera work is so vivid it feels like the actors were in the film for more
1,there 's a little to love in this movie however that is,there was one scene that was so bad it was hilarious
1,gosh i ca n't understand why the film was so bad its funny to say the least,gosh i have n't got a film with so many great lines but a movie that can make
1,i ca n't even begin to describe how bad this movie is,i have n't seen that kind of thing in a movie and it
1,the only redeeming factor in this movie is that it is so difficult to understand who really is who 's making,the acting is bad from the very beginning to the acting i ca n't see how this got ever funded
1,if you have not seen this movie you 're bound to see it,if you 're expecting a serious film to be a good idea of the
1,about the only reason i gave this film 2 stars is because,about halfway through it has no relation of interest at all
1,another problem i had with this was the fact that it was n't,another character called the first movie was a good guy named leroy
1,or even worse yet this is just a bad movie,or maybe the fact that the director is a fan of
1,supported by his performance that was a bit part was the,supported by the usual suspects on the subject of homosexuality
1,he does n't really fit into the whole thing he 's just a stereotype,he gets a clue to what to do next and not his own
1,she has been so upset to see the light,she is the perfect woman and she is one of
1,this movie has a nice cast with,this movie is an interesting story
1,a film of a film which is not only a good movie about a man in the streets,a group of people with a bunch of friends go out of their house and their family are killed
1,it was a big letdown to watch,it 's all about a very small town
1,do n't get me wrong i love lucy in a lot of other films but it 's,do n't worry to me about the film and that 's why it 's rated r
1,this is a very good show,this is the most disgusting piece of
1,crawford seems to be an actress but her acting was quite atrocious and did n't get it at least,crawford 's performance is just right up there with the likes of edward everett horton and james caan
1,this film was one of several great ones that i 've seen,this movie was a great disappointment and i am still trying to understand
1,and the ending was a bit too long,and it was n't a great movie
1,tom selleck is good in the film,tom 's life is very entertaining
1,they had been hired to try their luck with this movie and it was just plain,they all seem to be getting away with all the evidence they have to do
1,it 's a shame that most movies are n't bad or bad,it has nothing more then a story for the viewer who wants to
1,how can you have such a bad movie,how the heck did the director and producer put
1,joe dante does a great job playing the father of the rich man and he 's quite convincing as,joe don baker in his film debut and a small budget by john ford has always been good
1,this film was released in 1995 when released on dvd it has nothing to do with the first film,this was one of several rare movies that had me hooked when i went to college and i still have
1,a group of scientists have a secret admirer and some of the people who are responsible for murder have been killed,a couple of weeks later she is rescued and sent to an orphanage in which a group of men find out that
1,for example a movie with the right mix of drama and fantasy is not what,for example in the end we meet a couple of guys on a train
1,matrix was the most interesting film to ever,matrix is a classic of its own
1,it is a film that has all the elements that would bring back the best of that kind of movie,it 's a shame that the film does not have the benefit of being shown as a serious film
1,subjected to a few years later we meet his mother who lives,subjected to another film the only one that i could watch
1,vivid and exciting in a way it 's not only a comedy but also a love story a,vivid to say the least is the best way to spend a moment of time and money
1,this movie was not that good,this was one of my favorites
1,the script is good it 's all about all the problems with each episode,the film is about a woman who 's only the mother is an actress and
1,people who can identify with each other 's lives in a small village will probably recognise some people will be,people who are interested in movies are n't always going to be looking for a whole lot of fun
1,for a film that was set in the south america i was able to see the original and its unique,for all i love this movie it 's not the best horror movie ever and that is a shame because the
1,hopefully i 'll watch more of these films but i'm sure the makers,hopefully she can find a good guy but she has it all
1,all the actors are so awful i do n't understand why,all right the film is a mess and a must
1,the only difference was to take the characters from their own life,the film is so bad it looks as if the director ran into
1,whatever it 's it takes place in the united states that looks like the people in this film and they are on the,whatever this story is trying to go through it 's all that it 's a great idea to make up a movie
1,but there are several problems with the movie which are just plain bad,but if you 're not into the fence you wo n't be disappointed
1,get it to you 're the best i know,get it to the end with the guy on screen
1,so if you can find it you 're wrong you 're right,so why does it look like the director of the film was a
1,barbara stanwyck is a revelation but her life is never really explored in her life,barbara steele is a standout in the film 's most famous role as the manipulative young
1,this film is a great fun movie,this is my all time favorite movie
1,while the original version of this was released theatrically on dvd in the uk the film was much better the second time around,while the actors were n't all too bad to look at and the acting was pretty good and i really liked it
1,with it they are given a chance to do what they do best,with the usual suspects this film has some of the nastiest most controversial dialogue
1,having read the novel on which the film was based was faithful to this movie i think the writer,having a very good idea about the movie it 's quite simply the worst i have ever seen
1,i would rate it highly higher but i was pleasantly surprised,i 've seen a couple of episodes that are good and that
1,the movie 's soundtrack is n't all that bad but the soundtrack and music are pretty poor,the only thing i did n't like it was for a guy who was just annoying and stupid
1,i had a good time watching a few minutes of the film in the beginning of that particular day,i would recommend seeing a lot of films that have not been produced and are very well done
1,even though this is n't exactly the case that it has a little more,even the actors were bad and they did n't even make one movie
1,spanky is a little more believable and it 's easy for him to see the man who is the main character of the movie or that she can act,spanky has never been on the set and sets a new standard for himself as he 's a big time gal and it is his duty to his character to
1,it is n't even a movie,it 's a shame that the director
1,this film was about 3 people in different situations and how they are supposed to be a good family member and,this time i was in the marines and the characters and the movie had to get better with each passing
1,i am a fan of the original story,i was also impressed with the lack of character
1,well they 're all so stupid that they just seem,well this was a very poor attempt at something
1,probably this was a good idea at that moment,probably the worst film i 've seen in a few
1,this is probably the worst of any movie that came out since it was made and then by the end of the show you know,this is a film which was made on a shoestring budget and i am not a big fan of the work of the director
1,the movie also features one of the most moving characters ever,the plot of a story that develops and tries to create a
1,however if you have a masochistic sense,however it is still very good
1,werner fields 's film is an excellent film,werner potente plays a very fetching and likable character
1,the movie does n't have a happy ending because it is so bad it has the audience in tears,the first time i have seen this it can actually be described as being one of the best movies of
1,this film is a complete waste of time and money,this is a movie that should be remembered for many of
1,i did not find myself thinking of watching it and was shocked when it ended in the middle of the night i,i think it is a shame they made this show to a new generation and so forth for the big fans
1,such as this is a lot of it has so little screen time to sustain,such as the other films mentioned this one is not bad but still not very interesting
1,the film is a complete mess with some of the most memorable dialogue,the movie is n't even as entertaining as it should have been
1,lysette is a good actress but not bad,lysette 's son is the one who has just
1,many of the people involved were pretty good but the one in the film was the one who had the good,many things get underway though and that was a nice touch to be had in those who liked the movie
1,loose change of the film has been the easiest and it was a little hard to find a,loose ends is an engaging film about a young married couple who go out of their world
1,reno and pressburger have always been a very funny couple who has to choose to watch the show and they are very likable in,reno has never met an attractive woman and is forced to do a good job with her and she does n't want her
1,i had n't heard of the movie until the very last scene,i really like the fact that they show how they are
1,as with many previous films of that genre i was very,as a result it 's also a very poor show
1,when she was a little over the top but i did n't get it when it came out,when it came down to the time invested in the script it 's a joke to all
1,since this movie was a remake of the book of the title it does have the potential to be a classic with a good plot a good script,since i know the director does n't need to be a film it just comes as no surprise that i had never thought this would be funny
1,i'm glad it was in it i would n't have missed a few hours of this movie,i'm surprised that the producers have not seen such films in the past and that they were made
1,it 's about a bunch of people with jobs who live together to try and make money to escape,it 's just an awesome and funny film that is not only the best of it 's genre
1,everyone knows it was a real movie,everyone else should be embarrassed with their intelligence
1,ranked r stars for violence the gore and profanity,ranked on dvd i must concede if the film had
1,it 's one of those movies that you see as,it was a good film that kept my attention
1,so we do n't even know who 's to blame him,so the film is very good the only one who has a
1,i am glad i can give it a 0,i love it when the characters are in love and
1,but i 've been in the same predicament as the people who reviewed this movie so the story is not very original,but what we get instead is a simple idea of an aging young woman named anna who wants to live in a large
1,i do n't have much else to say for the plot,i do n't know what it is but the film is not
1,we 're not sure what this guy has been doing lately,we have all seen this film from the same time period
1,lucy silverstone is just so annoying,lucy is as good as the main
1,i would n't be surprised if someone could possibly replace it,i was hoping to see it but it could n't be that
1,a good cast of talented actors from all round,a real classic movie with the great music score and
1,al pacino has his best moments but the real star of the film is his performance as a boy,al pacino 's character is supposed to be good but the role in this movie is just awful
1,it was n't a bad film,it 's not really a bad movie
1,most of the film is about a young,most of us are the same age
1,yes he 's trying to do it,yes it 's a great movie but i
1,for an independent director 's movie it was a,for some reason this is a good movie
1,this is an excellent story line and an excellent musical score,this movie was made by a group of young teenagers who were
1,i ca n't wait to see how,i thought this movie was great
1,jan and paul were also funny,jan and the other tenants are so
1,the story is based on a true story which is about an orphan that has been raised to death by another man,the only reason i could see this film was because of the acting i was surprised to find it being so boring it
1,her son has a boyfriend but the two,her mother played and is so cute
1,when you watch the movie you have the impression the director wanted to get,when it comes to acting this story is so bad it 's embarrassing
1,they have a new job in the past,they do n't show us how the whole film
1,i saw this film in a small town in a small suburb on cable,i love this movie when it comes out in the united states and i have
1,this is a movie that everyone should see and i,this was the worst film i have ever seen
1,his character seems to have an obsession with him,his friend and wife decide to go to jail to
1,unless you do not like this movie and the film is a masterpiece you wo,unless this is true and that there might have been something interesting to do
1,what 's the point of getting the girl to get in the movie,what is worse is that this story gets a 3 out of 10
1,seeing this film is like a typical hollywood version of the,seeing it on tv will remind me of the film
1,it is as though the actors did n't realize there was more in this movie than most people,it 's a bit slow moving but the end result is a bit too melodramatic for me
1,it 's not even that bad,it is also very difficult to imagine
1,and i really do n't care if they were trying,and there are two great actors in this film
1,having seen the trailer for his work this movie is just another adaptation of the classic,having read the other comments on this movie i think it is a great film
1,black and white is the story of two kids and their son who has to live in,black snake moan from other countries and is in the film as a very human being
1,he had been on the trail of the new wave of,he 's a great actor as always because of that
1,ringwald 's character is the central figure in the film,ringwald and her friend are in the house who has a
1,he 's an old person who lives with his son who was the first to die hard,he is one of the funniest actors of all time and it 's hard to imagine how he
1,is there any other movie that does n't,is this a drama to begin with
1,powell is the real deal though,powell plays a good actor and this
1,as the two brothers come to life and their relationship with the young woman he,as for my own point of view it 's quite a bit more subtle
1,must have been a bit too unkind to my tastes,must have been a major problem to make the movie
1,a great cast of actors should be required,a great cast that includes the cast are the
1,as a huge fan of the series my roommate and i were laughing when i heard that,as for the plot it sucks and it 's not the worst movie of all time
1,the film begins at about 30 minutes and i just do n't think,the actors are all top notch and the performances are well done
1,however it is a good movie,however i found the movie to be
1,the story line was weak the acting was mediocre,the acting was ok but i would say that it
1,the plot is simple at best,the plot is pretty weak though
1,reporter david is a bit more interesting but he does n't seem to be the,reporter jack and ted do a great job and the movie is very funny
1,george lucas has made a great film but he seems to do n't even want to make,george clooney looks great and you are really looking for a good guy like bruce lee
1,character development is all that it is an interesting and very moving movie,character development is the norm for the story the plot is interesting for a
1,she 's a man who is supposed to be a witch,she is married to the other woman who has not a clue
1,sane and not a bad idea is the fact that the only real drawback in this movie is the presence to a rather unlikable lead,sane characters are introduced in a very sympathetic role as the young woman who has been kidnapped as a child for the past twenty years
1,though this film is a bit too long for the viewer it was a disappointment because the film is also quite boring and the performances are just awful,though we get no insight into the world and the world it portrays the life of this girl the film has all in one or two other characters
1,the ending was very weak and i do n't know what it is,the plot does not really need to be explained and the plot is simple
1,this is not a good film,this is one of the best of
1,do yourself a favor and skip this one,do n't expect to be there to watch it
1,spongebob in all of his other senses of the,spongebob is a great show with great acting
1,it 's a movie about a bunch of young men who get together and get picked up by a gang of poachers that are,it is very good and it really helps make you think that you 'll find something in this movie that is not bad
1,i could n't have had it in any way possible,i think the main problem with the show is the way
1,it has everything about the movie that keeps the audience attention throughout the film,it 's not even the bad acting it 's made by the worst movie out
1,this film is so bad it 's good,this could not have been a great film
1,apart from some nice photography shots of his past which also had nothing to do with the story there is no way that anyone can,apart from the acting from the whole cast it 's a waste of time watching this film i could not stop thinking about it
1,in this case it was a waste of time,in many ways this film feels like it was shot
1,let the other two films come out of hollywood,let my curiosity down to the viewer who will be
1,5 the scene when the girl walks into the night after a car crash which is very hard to get through,5 out of three bad movie and the only reason i gave this film a 1 instead it 's that a lot
1,that was probably a big mistake when a young guy named a boy who 's got a few hundred,that said that is how many who feel like he 's going to have a very good time
1,do n't watch it with the right buttons and,do yourself a favor and buy the disc
1,but it is one of those movies that makes you think,but i do n't think anyone who has a better sense of
1,there is absolutely no sense of reality or atmosphere in what the characters are saying,there is n't enough action to be realistic but in the end it 's a fun
1,as a result i am glad i can find a better life of the film,as i have read the book i was left feeling very disappointed and disappointed when i
1,lack of any semblance of any of the above or the first two installments to get the,lack of funds or the talent that they did with these actors in the first film
1,dialog is not as bad as i said it is n't,dialog in the film has a very interesting feel to it
1,the plot is very very poor,the only thing in this movie that
1,that was the only reason i gave it a chance,that 's right a bit part in the beginning
1,although this movie does not really do justice there are a few scenes where they do n't look anything like the rest of the movie,although the plot is not the main character in the plot i do n't like many the film 's main characters in their motivations
1,or perhaps it 's not that bad as the bad guys or the bad guy or,or is he just trying to get out of his head to find a cure
1,because of what he does he has a very good family and a good,because it was shot in the same place as a film called scarface
1,hollywood has done this great and influential version of the same novel but,hollywood 's greatest films are the ones the two of them were
1,i do n't think i'm too much of a good thing,i think this movie was so bad it was funny
1,i saw this movie on tv and,i really liked the story line
1,i do n't know but it was just great fun,i think this is the worst movie ever made
1,so this has got to be the most ridiculous pile of garbage i 've ever seen and i 've seen all of the bad ones that are,so when you watch this on tv you may be disappointed by the story but it still gets a lot more entertaining than it should ever
1,the actors do what they do best but the script is just as bad as the ones i 've seen,the only thing i would say is that the film makers and producers did n't know who made this film a
1,his work is n't only as a vehicle to be a comedy but he manages to deliver some great acting in the part,his portrayal of life has led a strong relationship between him and his father who also makes one of his own very own choices
1,unless you think the premise sounds like a documentary about the people who wrote all the,unless i saw the first one it would have seemed like someone was getting drunk
1,the main characters are not believable but the story,the plot is pretty weak and very simple
1,the movie is pretty funny but not very scary in its own right and the jokes,the acting was terrible in a movie about the mummy 's death of the killer
1,apply for all those with some extra points to this,apply as for the film it has its moments
1,the film was shot with a very,the story line is just awful
1,also the acting is poor the directing is awful and the directing,also the movie does n't have a whole lot of action
1,and i 've heard that the writer of this film is going to,and the movie does n't try to be anything less than that
1,but i do admit that this is a,but what is there to say here
1,little edie is one of those movies that will make no sense in the world of films,little edie is a wonderful movie it has it 's moments but it 's also a bit of
1,all in all a good movie and,all of the characters are good
1,reggie and his gang have their problems and the two begin to unravel the mystery but they do not know that,reggie the movie does n't have to be so bad it 's good i really ca n't wait for the next starbuck
1,i do n't think you would ever see such a bad film if,i would rather watch more explicit violence and violence than the original
1,must have a very high rating for,must have been a big one
1,it is a shame the film is never released in dvd release because it shows,it 's a nice movie to watch on a rainy evening and it 's not even
1,that is one of the best things,that 's a good movie though
1,then again the story is not bad and i do n't think,then the camera zooms out of a window to find it
1,i think it was a nice touch of time and the movie could have been a lot better,i have a soft spot for this show and i like the show so much i love it
1,this movie was an embarrassment to anyone,this was a very good movie
1,i would have given a 0 i 'd,i just ca n't believe this movie
1,the whole film is about a man trying to come in and get to see her get married because that 's what,the film is set in a small town where it 's a very difficult subject to explore the world of dreams
1,all of these movies have very similar characters and a good plot line,all in all this movie is so bad that its a shame they did
1,they do n't need to know that there is n't much to talk about but instead of having a great time watching it just the,they are not able to make a movie like the one with that and the story is so good and the acting is bad
1,this show was so bad it was comical,this movie had a very bad plot line the
1,oh yeah this was a good flick,oh yes this film was n't a great
1,if you love watching people emote with the whole family you wo n't want to watch this garbage,if there ever were a movie where the actors were so obviously involved they would have had the chance
1,what i think is that i ca n't see a good idea in a movie,what we get the picture is a bunch of hippies who go from being forced into
1,it is a pity the movie did n't get a theatrical release or,it 's an interesting and realistic experience and the ending is great
1,with such a great cast and a great cast the story is n't just about as much of,with the exception of the two sisters at the same time their friendship develops between the two
1,bad acting bad acting all around bad camera work and poor,bad acting and a plot that would make you laugh
1,this is one of the better action movies,this movie is about a bunch of people who
1,to make an account to what is a story,to me this is a very good movie
1,the characters are likable the script is so great and the dialogue is so clever that we get to see the movie,the main character is n't that bad but he does n't know how to make his way out of him and how he
1,she 's pretty but the fact is she did n't seem,she is a beautiful lady and is a real witch
1,karisma raines plays the role of david niven,karisma kapoor and james coburn are also good in
1,like the character of a bitch and a bunch of kids,like all of these three films this is a complete mess and
1,the first thing that i really liked about this movie is that it seemed to be the one that went from there and i think this kind of thing is the reason why it is so good,the film was made for children and for their fans who were very very moved by the end of the film which will be revealed by the viewers in that the movie is a bit of an extended
1,this movie is not the least bit of a joke,this film is about the battle between two worlds
1,the movie is a total waste of time and money,the movie opens with a woman who is trying to seduce
1,she does n't seem to have a clue of what this is supposed to,she was very good at a job in her part as the daughter
1,however if you 're a fan of action movies such as,however the movie is a good enough and fun ride
1,this is the best example of film making,this movie is a waste of film
1,utterly unbelievable for the most part but i guess the director was trying,utterly unconvincing and predictable and not quite as compelling as the others
1,this movie has a great cast that it was,this movie has a good deal of atmosphere that is
1,i do n't mind the many flaws in the production design of,i really like the movie and will never ever see again
1,later i got my drift to a movie which seemed completely out of focus,later there is a bit of sex in the movie which is also very graphic
1,team should not be blamed and it has to take place in an american city where,team is the center of the game and they both had a very funny chemistry
1,although there are a few problems a great story a few twists and turns of interest are n't missing,although i was surprised that it had a very high rating i felt very high for this movie
1,this film made me cry when the main character spoke the truth,this is an example of how to make a good movie
1,definitely not for the faint hearted heart,definitely not for the fainthearted though
1,she does nothing to get her and her body language is also pretty good in her,she 's in my own opinion of all the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,uzumaki is another one of those films that i saw as a child in my own,uzumaki is a movie that is filled with laughs and it 's not even funny
1,my recommendation to you to skip it do n't read it in the first place that it 's probably not,my advise to any friend of mine was that this movie is a complete waste of time and money
1,spoiler spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead i went into it expecting that there were a few good action scenes but i found,spoiler alert the ending is a bit abrupt but at least the rest of the movie is watchable and interesting
1,i do n't understand what a spoiler this is a bad,i was not surprised that i actually saw this movie
1,it 's about a young girl who works on a brothel in the country as a child and a little boy,it is as if someone in the director thinks it is n't bad it does n't do well with the movie
1,the plot was simple but i thought that this is going to be a bad horror,the only redeeming feature of the show besides is the presence of the main characters
1,one scene in particular that is very touching to see at the beginning in the beginning,one of the best movies about the holocaust and not in a movie about a subject that
1,the movie has an excellent ensemble cast as if as they were on the stage,the film does contain elements of the movie that the audience would find interesting
1,that 's what they did with him to make the movie but i think they were trying hard to make a good movie,that 's all this movie has on the way as a person who loves a little of this movie and i think the film
1,and the acting is all excellent,and that was the point it 's
1,another thing you know is the way he tries his best to get his wife to the house of the dead,another reason why this film is worth watching is the incredible performance by george peppard the director of photography of his early
1,however after this we can see his character in more movies of this movie,however the film just looks as if it 's a real life movie
1,among all the other bad movies this one 's a mess,among the reasons why this film did n't appeal to me was
1,i would rate it as a 10 for those who do have to watch,i am a huge believer in movies but this one is a travesty
1,klapisch 's character is so irritating that i think he 's the kind of people who really ca n't seem to get away from it,klapisch was the most prolific character of the series but he still manages to be a little more interesting at times and the film is a
1,however in addition to that it 's a good thing that the film itself is a,however this film is an insult to both the fans that would n't appreciate it
1,it 's very much a film about a girl who has become possessed by other people and gets,it has the same effect from the first film and that 's about the best it gets
1,this was an excellent and interesting film,this movie is so incredibly terrible you ca
1,i am not alone here and i do n't know if,i was n't impressed but i did enjoy it anyway
1,i thought the movie was really good,i was n't impressed in its plot and
1,shelly winters is the only saving grace in this film,shelly winters is a revelation of the highest caliber of all
1,so i was looking for some sort,so what 's wrong with that
1,belmondo is a very good director,belmondo has to play his part as
1,that was so much more than a few years ago,that 's the question and it is a real treat to
1,it is a movie that i will give it a 1010 for,it 's not even worth seeing if you 're interested in seeing the
1,if you like a little slow moving horror film i strongly recommend that you watch one,if you liked the other movies of the same kind you should see the movie
1,some of the things that are really missing were so much,some of the acting was horrible even in that scene
1,i think it 's a great movie,i love the way they do
1,what i found interesting was that the movie was,what a waste of money it 's not
1,i did n't really care for any of them,i think that 's why he is n't funny at
1,the music is beautiful and the music score is superb,the acting was good the storyline had its moments
1,neither the film nor the fact that it had anything to do with a book or it is a very bad movie,neither the main problem with the film are that the main character is the father played by one of her friends who are
1,let me say it again and again for all of the comments on the imdb database,let me explain it the movie 's main premise of the movie was that it was n't
1,although there are some great moments there is very little to this movie which is a shame,although this movie is a little slow at times i will say that it really makes one wonder
1,and the film is a bit dull,and for all those who love that show
1,one of my favourite characters is the son 's daughter,one of my favorite movies was the last minute of the
1,it also was a great documentary,it does n't make the transition to
1,bottom line this movie is an excellent piece of work,bottom line this movie had a lot of problems
1,this is probably the worst film i,this is a good horror film
1,not only do they do that they are the right people for,not just a bad story but a poor acting and script
1,nearly every film in this series is a masterpiece,nearly every single scene is a complete disaster
1,he 's an intelligent man but is a very good film for all his,he also gets the girl right and she gets a little too much
1,even the special effects used the sets were pretty good but,even the actors in this film are n't very memorable
1,following this film you can see how many people in the audience,following the title of this documentary there are two different themes
1,sometimes it 's just as good as the rest of the world,sometimes you will be wondering if the people who made the movie know
1,as usual it is not a comedy,as soon as we begin to see the
1,if you 're a fan of the first film you 'll probably hate this one,if you have not seen the movie you might find it a little disappointing to say
1,he just does n't make that movie 's character,he is a good actor but it has no depth
1,while i had read the book it was a total downer to watch,while the movie is very funny it is also pretty fun and very funny
1,it 's like watching something that would have been funny to,it 's not a bad film it 's simply horrible
1,if that were true then they were so much better then they could have imagined,if you can make up your own mind about the film it 's worth a watch
1,i had never heard of this until it was released on video,i think it 's one of the first films i would see in
1,these films are a good way of conveying the lives of the characters but in,these films are all very fun but the movie never gets off the ground
1,then i got some of the worst acting i 've ever heard,then you are looking for a new film with a lot of good
1,i am not surprised that this movie is made,i have seen the first movie with this one and
1,i do n't see much of these people on tv but they,i think the film does succeed so deeply in its audience
1,s direction of a film like it,s is a really bad movie
1,many of the actors seemed rather forced with the exception of the script,many of the songs of this movie were quite good to listen
1,the movie is a mishmash of action sequences to fill the gap that makes them seem more like the ones and the main character 's character,the script is just too clever and ridiculous and the film is not even worth renting for all the bad reviews about it so far
1,maybe we need a little more of,maybe they are missing their appeal
1,it 's like being held captive by two friends of other classmates in a different school,it 's a great film and i would recommend it to any fan of any of those
1,the acting is not bad but that 's ok,the movie was a total waste of time and i
1,the plot was just silly and predictable,the only problem here is that it is
1,i'm not going to go into anything here to say it was funny or,i'm just trying to get this movie straight back to my local days
1,the main characters were just a bunch of kids who are n't going to be there,the film follows the adventures of a man and his family and a love affair
1,i think that in the end this film has,i do n't recall the movie at all
1,things like the lion king 1 the movie has a lot,things get worse when the father tries to kill her
1,the story is about a couple of the best actors in cinema history,the story begins with a woman discovering her inner life and her father and
1,at least we do n't have to watch the next episode and you 'll know what to expect,at first zach seems as though he 's been dreaming with her husband and he decides to kill her
1,the plot involves the first of four couples who have to deal with the consequences,the plot does not make sense but the acting could 've saved this one
1,the film seems to have been made to have a story that could have been a lot better and it could have been told much more well by the filmmakers,the director who created the first film in the film has absolutely no idea what this is supposed to be a sequel of it 's own the first thing you 'll
1,i was surprised to see that the director wanted us to believe something,i am not sure about my wife but if i could have seen more
1,the director is so good in the end that it just becomes a tad tiresome but it 's just a nice surprise,the movie is a real treat to watch especially in the last ten minutes which is an insult for all involved
1,at other times a friend says the name is a little too much to me,at no time did he really like the idea he did in the movie
1,but the movie never got boring at all,but this has to be the worst movie of
1,children of course had their own problems as they have to cope with the problems with the parents and the people,children are not permitted to watch their own version so you can tell that they are missing in the film
1,synthesizers are used to describe the scenes and the camera angles are so,synthesizers that do n't work at all and are not all bad
1,please do n't waste your money on this pile of garbage and watch it as you 'll find it to be extremely boring,please do n't let that pass you to think it is good it 's a great movie with plenty of laughs and laughs
1,not a good movie but it 's a fun one to watch because of its great story,not a classic as an adult movie about a boy and his friends who have to be killed
1,there is the obligatory scene where a young woman 's mother walks out from,there 's nothing wrong with the actors but it is also very entertaining
1,it 's a shame that the filmmakers,it would seem a bit long
1,if you do n't understand them as i can in fact do n't,if this film does have the right director to be in the right place
1,i'm not even trying to tell you anything about it until i saw this as an extra movie,i'm pretty much a fan of the original the characters were pretty good and all the actors made an
1,catherine zeta 's acting is excellent,catherine zeta is an awful actress
1,i was surprised and entertained and i was very surprised with the portrayal of this movie,i ca n't remember much about the movie i watched it in a theater and that is
1,none of the characters were likable and not believable,none of the actors are given much better performances
1,the story is about how things can be achieved in many ways,the only reason this movie gets to be a 1 is 1 and
1,it 's a really nice movie that everyone should see,it 's so bad that it actually goes on
1,i could go on and on about it i was,i really ca n't see it in my view
1,but the rest of the performances is terrible,but the worst thing about it is that it
1,does n't they make any serious mistakes,does n't this movie have to be
1,a film about some of the most beautiful,a great performance from the lead actress
1,the actors were obviously in love with this one and it just did n't work,the only saving grace is the acting and it 's not a good film
1,unlike other posters that have seen this film i can safely say that the best part is when it has,unlike those i 've heard of it the second one i saw that i 've seen a lot better
1,the actors are also good in the lead roles,the characters are well developed and it 's easy to
1,richard gere is very good as always in this movie he has his role as an,richard gere is a good actor and i think he was good in this film
1,this film will make me angry,this is one of the most awful
1,it was a huge waste of time,it 's a shame that there are more
1,come on why would i like to have to see it again,come on we all know what we really like to say
1,with its brazen script and direction he maintains a sense of realism,with this being said he was a little bit more serious as the
1,which is the best thing in this movie,which makes sense the fact that a film with
1,and the film does deliver in one sense that is a lot of fun,and then when the movie finally picks up to a tragic climax i felt that
1,but it 's so bad the film has no plot or atmosphere,but the movie is n't bad it is just plain poor
1,where are the filmmakers even making it a comedy,where do you get the chance to miss the opportunity
1,this movie is a total disgrace to all involved,this is my favorite film of all time
1,it was great to see him perform a character,it 's not even so bad it 's bad it
1,i do n't think that the actors were good,i was lucky enough to have seen it and i
1,the acting is very good in my opinion but the plot is not too bad and there are some holes in the movie like,the whole movie was shot in a beautiful location which would have been an interesting film if it had been a lot better
1,jason biggs is not convincing as the lead in it though,jason 's wife is the real star of this movie
1,probably my favorite in this movie was the one that is supposed,probably because there is nothing to be gained on the screen
1,there are some truly memorable parts that make you laugh but,there is a lot of action and a good ending
1,so why was he able to make him do it,so in fact that 's how the movie ends
1,within the first scene the film shifts into flashback,within the first twenty minutes there is an extended sequence
1,hesitates to be a good movie,hesitates that we 're supposed to feel
1,polite in this role is a film that should be released and to dvd,polite to be a hero but it is a good movie about people who have
1,actually what 's good about this movie,actually this does n't make the movie better
1,give a good idea of what you might find in your life,give them a chance to get rid of a group of a bunch
1,it 's just an interesting plot idea that could have been better,it 's very difficult to follow why this is a movie and not
1,it is a shame they have all done the same with it and they,it is a very difficult thing to accomplish with a film like this
1,it is about the lives of men and women and women with their children at the end of their lives and their mutual desire to overcome,it would probably make sense if i saw the first two hours and that of the movie and how well it felt it was n't
1,i could see the director on a different type of person who could get into this film with an original idea,i have n't read the book since it is the only film available but it must have been better to do
1,i have no interest in watching the whole,i do n't think that is true
1,all in all a great movie for people who want to love a film you wo,all in all an excellent little film about love between a father and two men
1,the plot was so thin that the director wanted to make more sense but instead the film failed miserably,the film itself has some of the best moments of a story that could have been made anywhere with the
1,a real shame because the director has never really been in this film and his films are very boring,a movie about a group of people who have to be in a strange city together at the very age
1,remember the name of the title song,remember that the characters were too shallow or
1,this was the worst movie i have ever seen this one just did n't match up until the last 30,this was a good movie and i have to admit that i enjoyed it as much as i did
1,next the first episode of season three was the worst movie i saw,next time you see the same film it 's a pretty bad horror movie
1,we get to see the man in his room,we see the hero and his daughter as though it
1,there were a couple of times that i could n't take care of but was very entertaining when the first one started to finish,there are so many scenes where the movie has something you could have done have a lot more to say than the sum of its
1,and that was n't a bad thing,and this movie is really a real treat
1,the movie looks like the old twilight zone had done by the director 's and the,the movie does n't seem to be a very long way out of the ordinary
1,here we have the movie that 's what we get,here it 's not even the typical hollywood fluff
1,a lot of people have already commented on this film and,a good idea to make it a very good film
1,yes it 's a classic but it does,yes some have mentioned the ending but what does
1,it 's one of those movies where i actually liked this movie very much but i just wish it would end soon,it really has a feel of a story that makes me wonder why it is n't even mentioned in the first place
1,do you know what you 're doing,do n't be fooled if you have read
1,the story is a very basic idea that the movie makers are,the film is one that is as entertaining as the original
1,if one were to choose it for a second chance the movie is,if i had the option of seeing this movie the entire time
1,the film is very boring and boring too,the ending of the movie was just stupid
1,one of my favorite episodes ever,one of the most enjoyable movie about
1,i was n't really expecting much from the movie,i really loved the movie and thought provoking story is
1,the movie also has a lot of things going on around her at all,the whole film is set in a place in the woods where it becomes the
1,still it 's worth an 810,still it 's good to see people
1,that is where you see this film in,that does make sense of the story
1,after the war he commits a crime for his wife,after a few days you could see them both
1,and i love them so much,and if they are the same old
1,the film is set in a very small england of rajasthan in london during wwii,the film was obviously shot in color and that is the only flaw in which a
1,the acting was pretty atrocious especially from the characters,the ending of the movie leaves a little to be
1,this is a movie that i had to rewind on amc because i did n't pay attention to it as one of the first of the few,this is a movie that should be burned at the bottom of a barrel of the floor and is a movie that will make you sleep
1,here he goes on the hunt as a sort of old guy in disguise and with a little of the money of the hero he 's able,here we are shown in the movie with a man who has a crush on the world as a metaphor for the loss of his death
1,i thought it was pretty good,i thought it was a pretty good
1,i could go on and on but i did n't see the point of view of the story,i would not even classify a movie that could have been made of the first one but the acting
1,that is the problem with this movie it,that makes you think about the movie
1,a good film with good acting and great performances,a very good job for a film is that there
1,izzard plays an old friend of a successful pianist who,izzard 's performance is a classic as is he
1,the whole story line is contrived,the only thing i have ever mentioned
1,it would n't be nice to know the truth but if the film was n't so bad it 's funny,it is a pity that they have given us the same movie as it was and i thought this was the
1,i saw a clip of this in the store when the,i love this one and will always watch it again
1,hundstage is a great family film and,hundstage is a movie worth seeing
1,when it happens there is a plot that has some interesting twists or characters,when all i 've seen were done on dvd and i think i was watching
1,he 's got a nice cast and a decent story to it,he makes us realize that his real father is the man who was
1,nauseum in the first half of the movie the characters are so onedimensional,nauseum a little too infrequent for me but that 's all i did
1,i am glad that i did n't get it from the video library,i was hoping that the filmmakers would be able to get the message for
1,still the acting performances are not terrible,still if you want to waste 90 minutes
1,the story is so weak and the acting is just bad,the script is quite predictable and the plot line is not funny
1,it 's one of those films that you do n't want to miss and you 'll probably hate them as if you were n't,it has been mentioned several times that i will have to go through the movie and give you the chance to see again
1,holy old is the real deal of what it means,holy cow is a terrible movie for all ages
1,i ca n't remember the last time i laughed at the stupidity that a movie made about this stinker,i just saw this movie at the santa barbara film festival and it is not my absolute favorite
1,silly and predictable the worst kind of crap,silly and unbelievable it makes you cry like the
1,on the way she meets an attractive woman who happens a lot too much trouble and her husband has a secret admirer and the young wife,on the run from the scene we 're treated to three scenes of the first two minutes and a three hour litany of the movie
1,but the movie is n't really much better,but for some reason i felt that some of
1,rooney is the main reason to stay awake,rooney and his friends are not afraid to have
1,i am a big fan of the,i could never get my wish
1,what makes this movie great is it shows how things are always happening and why they did n't have that,what i have a real headache about this film is the way that i think that the people in the cinema
1,it is an enjoyable family tale that 's not to be missed,it is a good movie and the way it moves into the lives
1,the acting is ok but the script is poor,the only way i could get away from this film
1,see him as a young boy,see this in a theatre when your
1,heck the movie is a complete failure to follow the book by making it sound like a documentary about the real,heck it was like that you were just sitting back and walked right back into the middle of the movie
1,believe me or even me you 've already seen it and now i know a,believe me you will be so happy to see the film in the theatre
1,also the scene with the dog that was supposed to be the best part of the whole movie is not,also the scene where she 's supposed to be on a boat is a real highlight in the film
1,i would highly recommend this movie to anyone,i have to wonder where he went wrong with
1,the actors playing the main characters are also very believable and i think that they make the same mistake as the real,the plot is interesting but you ca n't deny anything about the plot because it is based on a true story
1,ok if you do think that this is,ok first off i was not disappointed
1,like the rest of the cast this was a very good episode,like many of the movies it was made in the 70s
1,the movie begins with a bang and a bunch of girls who are trying,the film was an excellent movie and a very entertaining one at that
1,wallis plays the part of a woman who is married and is the man with the,wallis grable is in this film and she does the typical trick in the movie
1,the script is n't the only reason to watch this film to believe that i,the film is not for kids and that is the case the film has
1,the music was excellent and the film was,the movie has a very bad start
1,i love the soundtrack the music of the music score etc,i could have made much more of this film than it was
1,for a film this film is a joke from start to finish there 's no way that there,for me it 's just as bad i can go watch this film over and over again
1,i saw this movie and thought wow this was one of,i do n't think that the movie is really funny
1,the first thing i noticed was that it was a complete waste of time it was obviously not an action movie,the movie 's a shame that the only person who knew the name of the movie would not be a hero
1,he has done a decent job in this movie as far as i'm concerned but you know he does n't need,he is supposed to be a very human character who 's always a pleasure and he was a real man
1,after viewing this film i am looking forward to the sequel to the great dictator,after having read the book i have n't seen it but i liked it quite much
1,i saw this movie at a friend,i do n't even know what to say
1,nevertheless the film 's narrative is more,nevertheless it 's an entertaining film
1,i have a feeling that there are no real people or actresses involved that have to be,i think there 's plenty of gore in it but this is just a stupid movie
1,sadly the ending does n't make up for the absence of the main plot as well,sadly he 's a good actor but he was wasted his time with his performance here
1,sure i would like to know a lot more of him but it was just that,sure it is a little predictable but at least i do n't know how much
1,1 i had a friend like him and i just wanted to watch a lot of good movies with a bit of humor and i was just hoping that there,1 for the first hour of his movies and you have to pay tribute to the fact that the movie has a very good cast which is very good
1,as far as i have seen the film i had to watch the entire thing,as a former i like the old man of all films as the director for this
1,although this is n't a great movie it certainly does not come across as,although this is not a good film it 's not at all good
1,if you are a fan of the book you will see a lot of things going on,if you watch this film on cable tv you will be able to get to the next thing
1,as such the film is about a dysfunctional family in a remote area,as a movie i would not waste the money on the ticket
1,it was also a waste of time and money,it 's the type of movie that i 'd rate
1,what was the point of this film,what makes this movie so enjoyable is the
1,mike myers as one of the main characters,mike leigh 's acting is a delight
1,it 's an interesting plot but not all the characters are developed as likable characters,it seemed as if the film was going to be an attempt to capitalize more on
1,i 've never seen a movie that is so bad,i think that the producers tried to create something more realistic
1,the story of four guys who get together in a car together together they are a lot better than the others that have the original plot twist,the plot is not all that scary it 's about a group of friends who have some sort of mental disorder and that 's their plan
1,mom the mother has never met a woman,mom and daughter are supposed to be very well
1,seems more like it was filmed with the same,seems like someone has a very low budget
1,what a waste of the celluloid talent and talent of,what can you do in a country like this
1,but the movie does a pretty good job of showing you how people are going to behave out of their daily lives as well,but when they have to go into this one to get a lot of laughs out there and i thought maybe the whole movie was
1,and the other characters are very likable and the story line is a bit weak,and the rest of the cast including david carradine james coburn and donald moffat
1,it is a bit of a shame that the,it 's just the same old old story
1,i love all the action movies that are so good,i have to admit to the obvious lack of respect on
1,everything that i 've said is that,everything about this movie looks cheap
1,i have seen several many of this but it is hard to find a story that takes you through it,i had the feeling that the movie makers had been trying to emulate it in a very good way
1,most of the scenes are just the ones that are not worth the time,most people think that you will love a movie that is supposed to be a
1,though it 's not that bad to say this is a good movie it fails at,though the movie has plenty of great action sequences the action moves through the film
1,their performance is good as the movie is n't quite as good as a big,their relationship was very convincing and the overall feel of this movie was great
1,the acting as i mentioned above was ok,the only one i 'd liked to mention is
1,in a sense it 's too bad,in the end it was all about the
1,regardless of the movie i thought it sounded good to watch because of the lack of budget and acting but i really wanted,regardless they should n't get paid to see a more realistic portrayal of their lives and their feelings of what they feel and love
1,anyone who wants to see a good movie will see this and the director is a master of this genre and,anyone who likes movies to try and make a point out to be in the mood for a bad movie
1,i have a friend who has been in prison for a long time and now he can see him,i did n't feel sorry for the people who gave the actors of this film and the performances i wanted
1,i did n't even like this movie when i saw the cover,i was very surprised at how much they loved the film
1,when she discovers her father dead she is a bit perplexed from the fact she 's not a woman,when they meet a beautiful man named felix and his mother 's father and father they come back home to
1,there is no real reason for the existence of,there really is n't anything more in it
1,no one in the film has any reason to care for her,no wonder we 're not shown this movie or not it 's just
1,but what 's this film like,but the film is n't even worth
1,also the acting was pretty average even,also the ending was too abrupt
1,this is a movie that will give you nightmares and will make you cry,this film is an insult to the intelligence that should have been made to make
1,possible spoilers the film follows a plot that is so bad that its laughable,possible spoilers ahead i saw the film in the theater and it is so good
1,the acting and dialog were just superb,the script is very simple the editing is
1,brown 's portrayal of the film was a major hit with all the stars and the supporting cast,brown 's mother is in the film for the most part but it is also an extra role to
1,john huston was the only one who could have a good role in the movie the,john frankenheimer is a great director as this movie is so good in this movie
1,even the scene where the killer 's father goes after,even then they 're both a little too stupid
1,the acting was n't bad though the plot was good,the acting was so horrible and that my wife and i
1,trying for a change in the film industry this,trying to convince him a lesson from god
1,i had to laugh at the ridiculousness of the film,i am so shocked that the director could not have gotten
1,ricci is a real lady of the family and a,ricci has been married to her mother at night
1,the movie is not about a love story or a drama,the only good things about it are the very attractive jennifer and
1,the story was so predictable and so predictable the characters were annoying and the plot was lame,the movie is full of flaws but the script is so boring it 's almost like the director
1,i do n't know why but the fact that most of the other reviewers did n't have a sense of humor to be made,i think the movie is about the struggle between a man 's and his death as a way of getting a love letter that has
1,but then we are left with a sense,but then the plot is very good
1,in a way this is a movie with no real reason,in all life i would love this movie to get a dvd
1,they have a lot of time when they get to know a real thing,they 're not funny but just do n't get me wrong about the story
1,not to mention he has a good reputation as a producer,not only is this movie not one of his most popular movies
1,get a copy and read the book,get that you are missing the point
1,deep inside is another of those movies that i have not seen,deep water is one of the most powerful films ever made
1,johnny knoxville is excellent as the bad guy and he does n't even deserve to be on screen,johnny and george do n't seem to be anything but a bunch of men who know little about the
1,the characters in the movie are very likable,the only way to give this a positive rating
1,but for some reason this is a great show for the family,but this is what i think about a film which is a great
1,an extra bonus for the acting talents that is used as an,an important premise about that and what the original was about
1,the script is not bad and it 's not a terrible,the characters were well developed and the performances were excellent
1,you could n't even think of an actor who plays his role in this show,you do n't need to see that there 's a problem with this movie
1,i did have it on tape in,i saw this movie on video
1,in my opinion the acting is terrible,in fact the only reason to see this
1,also i really do n't understand why he was n't given his,also as a movie it was a bit over the top
1,he does n't have to go to the bathroom,he has a small role and is so funny
1,but there is a great deal of nudity as,but that 's a bit of a rant
1,a must see for those who likes movies that are good,a woman 's death is a very good thing but not a
1,as the movie continues to end and end abruptly to the,as for the film it 's pretty easy to follow
1,sex scene at least had a purpose that is very very funny,sex is the only thing that made this great movie to watch and
1,the plot is ridiculous and it could have been more entertaining but the story is not as good,the characters and story are more than just a couple of things the movie is very interesting
1,when a film is a masterpiece they are all very funny,when this movie was made in the early 1970s it was an
1,if you want to see a very good thriller with an interesting premise,if you 're not a fan and have seen a little thriller you can
1,but the whole thing felt very rushed and there was not one interesting twist at all when the characters were left undeveloped and,but if i had been given more of a story and was just a little bit better i would have been there
1,because of the film 's quality of film production values i was left wondering what was,because of that she has n't really gotten a clue why it was her own
1,it would be a shame if it was written in a different way,it is a real pleasure to watch a great cast for this movie
1,melanie griffith was the only star in which she was nominated,melanie griffith plays the woman who is supposed to be gay
1,after a couple of weeks he is a rich and very young man,after the opening credits of the dvd you 'll find yourself singing
1,the actors all give up their lines to be funny while at,the director 's commentary is pretty much the easiest to describe
1,however if your a good fan of the series check out the,however it 's not the worst film i 've ever seen
1,even though we have a few scenes of this one that make up,even a great movie from the 80 's is a must see
1,move away from your friends but also you know that the end is the worst thing possible,move to the cinema if this was your first movie before and after the opening of a film
1,it would have helped that it had not ended and i,it was n't until they stopped making the first one
1,i ca n't believe i wasted money on this,i have to say that i was very impressed by
1,i ca n't even begin to describe the good points of this film,i have seen this film several times before i can remember that it was
1,the characters are all very very bad,the story is told in flashback with a
1,as if it were that easy,as for the actors who play the
1,the movie is a complete waste of film,the main characters are so poorly done that any
1,i ca n't recommend this movie enough,i think the film is a very different
1,it was a good idea to put it a real,it could have been more effective than it were
1,the whole film is a collection of clips from the first two films that are in a completely,the first time i saw the movie at the end i thought it was just so boring
1,one of my personal favourite movies,one of the best movies of all
1,more of a film in which a man becomes entangled,more like a psychological drama with a different approach
1,instead of being an obnoxious and lazy person we are left to,instead it 's the same thing happening in the first movie
1,this film is very much a masterpiece that is about the only thing missing a certain amount of talent and a lot of,this film is one of those films that should n't have been lost or a great one it was a wonderful movie
1,i thought this movie could be a spoof of the first,i would like to know where it is headed but i do
1,dwight ackland plays an excellent role as the villain and the movie is very entertaining despite the fact that he is not as funny and not a hero as,dwight ackland and the rest of the cast are excellent at the time and as the movie 's plot unfolds this is a really fun movie for you
1,in the end it was just too bad,in a scene where an old woman decides she
1,the movie is very good but not in the same league as the classics i thought it would be as well made,the director has made a good movie for all of us and that 's a great job to watch this documentary
1,as a director of this film i can safely say that it seems the director director and writer were a bit prejudiced of this movie,as i watch the film i have to wonder why we did n't get to see the original in the original language or the original version
1,i was really a big fan of the original bambi 2,i was able to determine the story of the movie which was
1,all the while this movie has its own share of suspense and mystery moments,all in all this is an incredibly bad movie that will be watched by everyone
1,amar the butler is in the movie for no discernible reason,amar is the most likable girl of the three but his eyes
1,but i still think the idea of this movie is,but in the end the movie never makes sense
1,if you like these movies or are not a fan of the genre you will be able to appreciate the movie,if you have not read the book you will find a book that contains a very strong and complex story and a
1,the plot concerns an evil man who finds a cure to a girl and decides he will get rid of,the only problem that this movie had on is that they could n't have made it so much better
1,the script is about a girl and her friends who are invited to go to a remote island,the director and director did an excellent job of bringing us back to the early 90 's
1,the only positive aspect of this film is the fact that it does contain a lot of,the film is about a young girl who finds herself in a coma with her dad
1,the acting is horrible and the film is awful,the film is a visual journey and one in a
1,errol flynn 's performance as the villain is brilliant,errol flynn and robert de niro were also a great
1,the film is a little slow,the movie is so predictable and boring
1,i think it was a great start to make a movie on how to act and then make a great movie to make you feel,i am sorry i have been on the lookout for my life in a movie i have n't seen in a very long time
1,this film had absolutely nothing to do,this is a film for everyone
1,rumors are that they are made aware,rumors that he may be able to find
1,the first half has a good idea and is,the script is so terrible it is laughable
1,what 's interesting about the film is that it is made up for one of the most beautiful women in the film business,what i liked most about this was that the entire thing is an excuse for the viewer to suspend disbelief to accept and feel
1,the only good thing about this movie is that it 's,the first episode is the most boring thing ever made
1,this film was made by some unknown director of photography and photography which is not only a good idea but is a great movie,this is my favorite movie of all time the godfather is an excellent adventure film that is not a masterpiece in the sense that it
1,her performance is not the least bit convincing,her father is a young man who is a
1,this movie is so bad i just could n't get,this movie has to have a very strong storyline
1,whilst he may be the only one in the film i felt his frustration towards,whilst the film is not very good at all it is definitely worth seeing
1,the music is quite haunting and it is an odd contrast between this and its classical surroundings,the movie 's main purpose is that the makers have made a better movie and is just a
1,the acting is not terrible but rather bad,the ending was so ridiculous that i do n't
1,see him as the hero and a couple,see the movie if you are a fan of
1,and the music is quite good,and of course there are the numerous
1,fragmentary and even the most boring,fragmentary but not worth viewing for the
1,not because of the fact that but it 's still a great movie to,not all of the above mentioned actors of the time in their roles
1,as a result of the filmmakers' life it does not go down to normal and the two boys are not happy to find,as the story begins the film builds to a finale that never really gets to anything approaching the conclusion of the movie
1,this is one of my favorite films to play,this was my first exposure for the dvd
1,but the real problem with it is that the actors are not,but i was really disappointed by its message that 's it
1,his character is in trouble with his life after he is a teenager,his character is so unlikable and yet is not a likable person who is
1,we have an indepth look at the world around us,we 're never more than one or two of our classmates
1,if you are a horror movie buff you should enjoy this movie,if not then you 'll see what i do n't get that far
1,the only reason this film was released is because of angelina jolie,the story of the original a great one is the best of the
1,that is the main problem of this movie the characters are n't,that is how we can get our opinions on this film
1,i saw this in the theater and said it was,i think the movie is n't a great movie
1,a real treat for a director for a movie,a few people who are familiar to me are pretty
1,this should be a great movie to show,this was a really nice movie and a fun
1,sorrow and love are all for everyone else,sorrow can only be so stupid to the audience
1,to me this is a movie for anyone interested in history and if this is what they are,to be sure if this movie has any redeeming feature it 's a very good horror film
1,i think that the first scene when the young boy is conversing to a woman is just a bad joke,i would say it is not very good to see the film to be released because it seems to be a
1,one can only hope that the bbc will come out with a show to show it 's still on tv,one of the worst movies i have ever watched is a remake of a nightmare of the dead people who have
1,linda darnell and robert taylor are very well cast in this movie,linda rothrock was good in the movie but it was only a few
1,i just wanted to show the story of a group of people who love the,i 've seen it all a million times and i still ca n't believe
1,it is n't even a movie,it 's very much a very beautiful
1,what i liked most about these movies i think they 've made it is a very funny and witty performance,what i got was that the film was released in the 1980s and the one who wrote the script was that
1,the film has a couple of great laughs,the film is a lot of fun
1,examples such as the one with a lot better actors,examples of the script are the acting and directing
1,some of the dialogue was just so bad it 's laughable,some of them are so funny i do n't think it sounds
1,i really wanted to like this movie,i do n't even try to get into
1,it does however make the film enjoyable and it 's not a typical hollywood movie or the plot it 's a movie,it is also difficult to understand why it is a film about the holocaust that is the subject of the war
1,it has the typical ingredients that are made to create an interesting story with lots of suspense a sense of,it also seemed interesting to note that it was a film about people who could have done some research
1,the main reason he does n't work is that his wife,the only thing you 'd think about is the plot
1,unfortunately they ca n't save their life on,unfortunately this movie was not even funny
1,sure the movie is a little slow at times but a little bit of a downer,sure it was good i was n't bored at the time i watched it at the cinema
1,kathleen turner is great as the mother of a beautiful husband and her husband who,kathleen burstyn and her best friends are the only real highlights of this movie
1,after all the hype is on the cover of my dvd collection of films i can tell is a bit disappointing,after all the rest of the movie is so lame it is a shame that some movies made in the us have
1,my guess of that kind of thing is it was,my favorite part of the movie is the ending
1,i have to assume that the makers of this mess were not paying,i do n't believe he was really that good as his dad
1,jack lemmon plays the part of the,jack webb was a brilliant actor
1,you will get a chance to watch this movie in the cinema and not in the cinema,you do n't need to know about the characters or sympathize with or care about them or at
1,the film begins with an interesting twist in a remote tunnel,the story is just an excuse to showcase the characters
1,whether he 's a former or not he is a genius in this role that is not a good idea,whether a character 's father is in love with his or her father 's life and how he tries to convince
1,the actors were very good and the writing was great,the film does have an attractive feel and a nice pace
1,you ca n't even make your own judgment at the,you will probably want my time back to buy
1,with the help of the young man the doctor 's wife in love and her father,with this film he would be a much better actor than he usually seems to be in
1,no it 's not that funny it 's just,no one is really impressed with the plot
1,season 3 are very good and will always be remembered on the original series as well,season 1 was a great series for me and it showed the end of my life
1,gray is the story of two men who,gray 's is another very good movie
1,the only time this movie makes it through is,the actors were pretty good but nothing special
1,i would like to see a little more of the fact that it would,i was lucky enough to have watched this one for quite a while
1,what really makes this stand out is the fact that it is n't the most expensive movie ever made,what we did n't see was how he would have been in the army and in the middle of the
1,the acting is awful from the leads who are the ones who made,the first thing i noticed is that the story is very predictable
1,this film has a special place where it 's all going for the big screen,this is one of his best movies i 've seen him in at the beginning of
1,there are plenty of funny moments that are n't at all,there were several problems that i had with the movie
1,it has more to do with the plot of his character and his way in,it was not only a film that i expected to get my hands on
1,it 's a very simple movie too i am not very happy about it but it is a film that 's so bad that it should almost be avoided because it was released in the,it is so much different the way they 're done with these three characters each episode of them is quite unique and not so much a drama that one would be hardpressed to understand
1,the story is very original and the acting is good,the film begins a bit slow but the ending feels the
1,instead of being a movie we get a lot,instead i was not impressed with it until
1,we see him in a car driving in a jeep with a car launcher and then a car crash which explodes him out of the water and his,we get a bit of an odd twist with the two guys that do n't seem very much like those two characters but that is not enough
1,that movie also made some points,that does n't matter as a result
1,and it 's all a bit unfair to understand,and the film is also quite good in a humorous
1,while they 're both a good story it is still a good film,while she was a bit over the top with an interesting look and an
1,if anything it could have taken a very serious approach to the book and it certainly is an improvement but in the end the ending feels very rushed,if you like films that are entertaining and even have a good message in common with bad films i urge you to be entertained at how bad this movie
1,after the first scene of the movie about the girl he says how to lose a guy but she ca n't get out of a,after a bit of luck i realized how much i love the movie but i did n't think this could be a great movie
1,marshall is an ambitious guy that 's always the best part and a good cop,marshall is n't as much to blame as the actors but also the music was also
1,maggie watson plays a young actress from another world she 's in a,maggie gyllenhaal and her two costars are a wasted and very few
1,the story is simple at best,the main character is a young girl
1,as for the film itself it is a must see,as a result the story is very well written
1,every character is one of my favorite characters and,every now and then a movie is on
1,plus the acting was good with an allstar cast,plus it just has a few redeeming factors
1,however if you 're looking for a real film then check,however the main character was the stereotypical and shallow woman
1,the script is also very good,the story involves some strange people living
1,the movie is an embarrassment to the intelligence of the human spirit of the society,the first thing that was funny about this film was the fact that it had no
1,i do n't remember what to expect from this film and i do n't know how anyone can,i really enjoyed this movie as it is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,adama takes the case to a close up in the woods he,adama has a small but loving role to be a hero
1,both a very funny and touching movie,both are the best actors i have ever
1,if you 're a huge fan of the genre you will like this movie,if you are a fan of the genre of the genre then this is the
1,in this movie you know it 's a movie so do n't expect a,in some ways this is a little too long to be taken seriously
1,on the other hand the plot is so bad that it,on the flip side it 's a pretty straightforward plot
1,while this film is not a perfect movie,while watching this i was very disappointed
1,watching the movie is the closest thing you 'll find in the,watching him do the whole thing for me is that bad
1,if you 're not a fan of the genre this is,if the script is the most important thing to do
1,in fact the movie had a lot of good,in a good way the acting is great
1,another thing i noticed is that the plot is really really bad,another thing to describe is that the actors were so stupid it seems
1,why did we have to do the catering and make such a good movie,why did he never get a chance to get it back in it
1,if it were on a big budget you should have it,if it has come out in the right place for over a
1,what we 're left with is one of the best shows ever made,what is even worse than a movie about a bunch of people who ca
1,plotwise we see that he 's on a mission to get the president of,plotwise i found the movie rather boring and boring in the last half
1,the movie begins with a couple of guys who were just trying to get a lot of money,the film also has some notable sequences including a scene featuring her son who is a man who does
1,hiding in a forest in one of his own,hiding from her job is to find her
1,perhaps they are just going on a rampage,perhaps if you 're a fan of this film
1,these scenes have very few exceptions and are quite amusing,these two guys are also very likable as well
1,while the story revolves around a character named krishna who 's being a teenager he 's never been told to be a real life,while i do n't think i 'd ever heard of this film a few months ago i would never want to watch this
1,there are so few things to be said,there were several movies with this story
1,in the past year is an experience that is the,in fact the only real problem is the ending
1,but then when i first saw it i had to rewind it for the first time,but what about it this is n't the only way to introduce its characters to the end
1,the only problem that i could have made for,the only other way to make it watchable
1,despite the fact that the film is set in the period the only thing that made me think about the film was that it was made during the height,despite having the only one who has to fight his way through the film he finds out that his son cannot really be saved from a nearby life
1,i think it was a waste of my time,i 've been looking for a new movie in hollywood
1,if you want to see an action thriller do n't,if you like these films you will find this
1,i did n't get the impression of this film until the very end so i was left wondering how this film,i was impressed with the portrayal of what was the best movie of the last decade of the 20th century
1,his father and the child in the film,his brother has been kidnapped and killed
1,it was a very good episode,it 's a movie that i really
1,rationale was that it was n't even a sequel or it would be worth watching,rationale is not a bad thing but it 's a fun flick to watch
1,the first is the acting of james stewart,the story is set in a small apartment
1,with that it would have been a perfect fit but what,with these problems the film has little in my opinion
1,the plot of this movie could have been very interesting,the music by don ameche is also great for a film
1,there is so little going on in the story that you,there are some very funny moments when it is funny
1,in fact they were very entertaining with the character of the two musketeers,in all fairness the film could 've been a great story about a man
1,the acting is very good with the actors playing the lead roles in the movie such as a couple,the actors are good but there are no extras and they just did n't make the grade 2
1,it 's just a fun movie,it 's not an action film
1,however this movie is quite good,however the movie never loses any real
1,i thought the movie would be a little too long but it just did n't do that well,i am surprised that the film never took a serious turn to the point of being a true classic
1,it is a film that is n't just bad it is simply horrible,it is a good film but for all the wrong reasons is that all
1,exhaustion is also a common ground of one of the most beautiful and touching,exhaustion is a very interesting film that has been done many times before
1,the movie makes us hate and it is not for,the film has been released many in my memory
1,diapers are not bad but not this one,diapers like myself have the power to make the
1,requests the viewer to watch this movie and think about it,requests to be the only one who can actually get the money
1,then the girl 's character says something like this in your life and you have your own family in the film,then when they arrive in the city and they find it hard to believe the real culprit is a threat
1,often it 's a pretty bad movie but the acting is awful,often it 's a great film that does what it takes to make
1,he had an idea of a story that was n't the same,he has to be a bit crazy but a nice little guy
1,i would not waste time on any of these,i did n't even know what to expect when the
1,most of the film takes place in a new york city which is a big,most of the time it 's just a movie which is not very important
1,we have an excellent family film a good family drama a story about a dysfunctional family of two sons who do n't need to be together,we follow him and his cronies but when he finds out they are not alone or he can go there is a big payoff about him
1,i am not a fan and a lot of people have written the review on the,i 've always been a fan of these two films i have seen in them
1,mira sorvino as the mother who played the mother is n't the best of her,mira sorvino as the evil killer was so incredibly annoying that i did n't even want
1,she 's just too sweet as a human being,she 's a fine actress and you should definitely enjoy
1,i am not surprised by the fact that it is very long since it 's not a very typical,i did n't know why this movie was not nominated for best supporting actor or best to play
1,when she 's being kidnapped and she decides to go to her apartment she is rescued,when i saw the trailer and was shocked at the fact that the ending came from one
1,in this episode we learn that her daughter has taken her father,in the movie they have the most beautiful music ever filmed
1,peter fonda and michael moore are both very good actors,peter ustinov plays his own role as the father who gets
1,i was very disappointed to find myself wondering exactly what the film is supposed to be about,i have to say when i think of this film i just ca n't believe someone would give
1,visions of the world is the greatest of the genre,visions of a man is a film about a young boy
1,it 's all about the man and his mother,it is the type of movie where the viewer has
1,general arcand is a great actress and i,general m 's a bit too generous
1,as the movie started out very interesting and i thought it was a little predictable,as for some of the other comments about the movie i must say i would n't
1,russell crowe 's film in this case is a very bad effort,russell crowe does a good interpretation portraying a young boy who 's being
1,lloyd kaufman is also good here,lloyd bakula does an exceptional job and
1,at least that 's what i would n't have said,at the very least i find some of the scenes involving
1,this is one of my favorites,this was probably one of the worst
1,sadly the plot of the movie has to be a little too long,sadly we get the feeling that it is only in the beginning
1,tony the director has a knack to make a documentary about the meaning of history and is a real good film,tony is a good man who makes his way to her home and does something that could be taken from other people
1,as a result of the film she plays the mother of the family and her son of the,as a child it 's also a pretty entertaining movie from the start and a fine end
1,but this film was the best of the two,but what was n't it just seemed like a total
1,the acting is terrible except for the actors and the direction is a little weak,the film starts with a bang and a car crashes around a desert cabin
1,this is the most pathetic film i have ever seen,this is one of my alltime favorite movies and i would
1,the plot is a lot worse than most people and it just keeps a lot of action from getting,the whole thing reeks of stupid dialogue with the two leads and the film is pretty much unwatchable
1,the movie is not a documentary and is just about the subject of the book,the film is quite slow to sit through but it does not really make any difference
1,after all it does n't even have the potential,after seeing the movie i thought that it was a
1,in my opinion it 's an excellent film to watch for a good time and if you want to laugh out loud a few times then watch it you 'll feel the,in the opening credits the camera zooms on a bed to frame the camera on the floor and the camera pulls off a scene that 's the highlight of a car
1,no matter what it 's that you get to see it you realize that the film is n't just,no wonder it gets such a wide berth as this is the only reason i can recommend it
1,i was a kid so my sister was in love with it,i think it 's the last of them to show how a good
1,this is another movie that has a lasting premise because of the director 's vision to the point where the film is,this should have been a warning to all concerned that if you were in this movie i will say it all
1,you 've heard the word saying this movie is terrible,you ca n't get a single laugh when the film is
1,laraine rains was in great form in the late 1960s,laraine is quite an expert in the movie but his role
1,every once in a while the film turns into a series of flashbacks,every aspect is good and i would n't have liked the movie but i
1,finally the end is really lame,finally the acting was awful and there
1,why does he pick things up with the help of a man who ca n't seem to keep a woman who 's the son of,why did he always have to be a woman and the girl who made him wear glasses while filming it in their first place
1,just like the first two minutes of the movie you can just,just a bunch of kids talking like that in the woods
1,all of them had a lot of time to work and together they had to deal with the issue of the two women of the,all the action is punctuated by a complete lack of continuity but overall it feels like the whole movie was filmed by another movie
1,the script is very sharp and the performances by all actors are very good and the performances by the,the story is told in flashback and the end is one of the first scenes of the movie
1,though the film 's plot line is somewhat dated there are many instances that are pretty obvious that the film is supposed,though i have seen the first two movies the other has made me think of something to look for and enjoy
1,anyone else who could be a great fan of the likes of bruce willis and peter cushing has the,anyone who 's really interested in these movies should see this film so they can get into it
1,this is a truly abysmal horror film,this movie is so bad you ca n't
1,actually the movie is one of the few movies that i would recommend,actually one might think that they 'd be able to make a movie that
1,a young lady falls for a woman in a beautiful woman 's apartment,a few scenes where they make a movie are n't so bad
1,what is the story about the friendship between the two men,what 's even funnier is that it is so bad that it
1,a great example of how far the film is,a great deal of fun and worth seeing
1,and that 's about how she got it for she was,and that was what made me want to do this
1,having grown into the house and was in my home was quite a good film,having just read all the comments on this i decided to check out the comments section
1,it was great to see the movie,it 's hard to tell the difference between
1,he makes it through unscathed and then becomes obsessed with,he plays the part of a very unlikable guy
1,most of these are the very worst things ever,most people will think they were all that
1,aside from the poor lighting and editing i ca n't help but feel that a movie like this should n't even have a story,aside from being an adult i could n't help to enjoy the movie 's portrayal of the character 's struggle with his father
1,both films seem to have been designed to shock their audiences but,both of them are n't funny and the plot is predictable
1,the movie is about an ordinary and underappreciated family and the,the film is filled with a great deal of gore
1,i 've already heard some complaints about this movie,i think it did a great job of bringing down
1,i think this was the case that made the movie,i have not been disappointed with it as i do not
1,i'm a fan of david spade i 've seen him in a small but sweet film,i'm a big fan of this show as the kid and dad are still alive
1,i had to stop hoping i was in for a disappointment,i have seen a lot of movies but this is not one
1,really you are in for a treat,really this movie is about a group of
1,well i think it really did,well it 's not as bad as
1,jacqueline bisset was good as her boyfriend as she was n't the best actress i have ever seen and i really felt it was one of the most,jacqueline o'connor 's character is n't as good as her husband though it is not just her fault as the girl she never seems to be on
1,the plot itself is a little too much to be taken seriously the plot is a bit slow but as i said the storyline was,the movie also has the feel that the director had to tell the audience but i did n't feel like i said it was
1,i'm afraid to say that this was a horrible movie i had to see the film as a child,i'm also wondering why the hell was so much in the middle of the movie and did n't really care
1,on the surface they were able to get a little extra credit in making the movie,on an island flight from the police station to the new orleans to try to steal the
1,the acting is terrible and the writing is worse then that,the plot of the film revolves around an ancient american who is
1,but in a way this is a movie i will remember as far,but you do n't have to have seen that of this film
1,this film is quite a surprise,this movie is just plain bad
1,now there are some problems with it but that 's why,now i'm a sucker for the original and i will always say
1,after he is forced to leave the city where this has,after that they become a little girl on the beach
1,the acting is bad the music is annoying,the story is quite original with the use of
1,jimmy lydon and michael pare are in top form as a man whose wife is a little rich and a bit too young to make,jimmy swayze who 's just got a few lines in this movie that he was given in the script and was a perfect villain
1,exemplary film with no discernible plot twists whatsoever and i suspect that,exemplary direction in a great ensemble classic but not very memorable
1,the film is shot in a style of,the main character was an obnoxious man
1,but what a waste of time it really,but then the story is n't bad
1,from what i saw i liked the show,from the beginning the story is told very well
1,how could you feel when they are in a,how does this movie ever get a release
1,the director 's cut is a bit over the top but it 's really fun,the film also shows how the story begins to develop and what it is about
1,his character was a complete idiot,his performance as the character with the
1,during one of their trysts they are a group of kids who have been kidnapped in a forest crash by a group of young men and two boys,during the final showdown scene where he is trying to kill his friend and is shot in and by his mother he realizes her husband wo n't die for
1,real life is not a story like the first one,real estate worker has all he wants from the world and
1,the whole story line is predictable and,the plot is a little confusing
1,there are some moments of humor but i could n't bear it,there are some good points here the music is n't the usual and
1,in one scene the man is shot in one shot and he walks into the camera to,in fact it 's more of a film about love and romance than a love story
1,fast cuts but then we get to see the final fight on the floor,fast furious to a point where it feels very very long that it does n't
1,burt reynolds as usual is excellent as the,burt reynolds is good in my opinion
1,there 's no doubt on that one of them is,there are a few good laughs in this movie
1,he is a great actor in the first,he has the best of the best
1,however it does have a strong element to it and it was just to be made,however the ending makes me wonder if the plot is anything that would n't allow anyone to
1,director david lynch has a great screenplay and is in top form with its story line,director robert downey jr and the late preminger himself seem to be making a mistake
1,i'm glad i watched this on tv as an adult,i'm just waiting and hoping they 're going to have a
1,i could n't help but think about it 's problems,i would rather watch the reruns of a miniseries like this
1,here she is an alcoholic housewife with an insatiable past and the fact that she is being stalked by,here the movie gets boring and i think it 's more than just a drama to begin with
1,arquette 's character is played out in a very humorous way,arquette plays a reporter and mother who is a rich woman who
1,resembling the film 's focus the movie has a couple good points to it,resembling that you 're not in the dark you 're in for something more
1,and it 's very interesting to watch it without having to resort to an ending that has,and for a film like this i would n't be able to give it any credit
1,these guys are n't going to get the same message they have to work in this movie,these were the first things i noticed before that the movie was released by the same director
1,the movie was very bad the acting was horrible there was no acting talent and just plain boring there was no tension or,the acting is n't too bad but i have to admit that the actors who portray is pretty good as the story
1,inside the house to take away the baby 's family a little more,inside the house he realizes that the killer is a vampire and is cursed
1,i 've already mentioned the movie a little bit,i was a fan of the movie and it really
1,anyway if the show did n't have its potential and the first few episodes of,anyway she is a great actor and she makes up some pretty good movies
1,watch it alone and you will see it in every,watch it if you have ever read the book
1,i ca n't say enough about the film 's shortcomings and what is worse,i have to tell you the producers was making a film that was n't even
1,it does n't go well clear and is a true love story,it 's a shame it was n't on dvd in the first place
1,it 's a little bit overdone for me the acting is pretty good,it is a wonderful film and one that everyone will love it
1,he gets back at a bar for one thing,he plays a young boy who is the only one
1,i saw this movie on the scifi channel and i have to admit i,i had never heard of this movie until i got it on video
1,films like this were a lot different and not even more enjoyable,films like this have to be seen as the worst movie of our
1,but it is n't the same problem to the first two,but i think he did an excellent job in it
1,why do the actors do such a terrible job with such a poor script,why did he never get a chance to use a camera to cut this movie
1,david lynch is an excellent choice for a script of a classic film,david carradine is a standout as he gets a solid performance in this movie
1,this one was a little too short,this one is n't very good at all
1,christine 's dad 's love is just so awful that,christine and her family are very young to watch
1,barthelmess was so funny that i wanted to punch my ears out of them but he was never allowed to,barthelmess gives some of the best performances of his career on here and the film is n't very good
1,they are not the best actors they 've ever been,they could n't just be so stupid they had a little
1,the acting is bad except for the lead actress,the acting is n't bad it is bad
1,and then the whole film explodes when the characters are,and it is n't the greatest movie ever made
1,an excellent film for fans of italian tv cinema,an old man named john wayne 's wife a woman
1,i think it was a good idea to make a more successful film,i think that the film is an amazing documentary of the history of modern
1,when the movie ends you realize that it would make the movie more like this,when the world turns away to get rid of the bad luck you can expect to
1,like it 's predecessor 's and it will be as funny as it should be,like most of the other disney movies i 've seen the movie just takes a few
1,for instance the film is just about how it was in the book,for starters the plot is a bunch of teenagers who get the chance to
1,in the end of the film i was surprised that this was not a film to be a,in fact the best part of the show has to be that it is just plain stupid
1,in fact the acting in this movie is so poor that you cannot see anything more than a poor actor,in any case this was the last movie that i watched it 's best in the theater and at the end
1,but it 's not so much to make it more interesting,but there must be no redeeming qualities to this movie
1,although the actors are so wooden they are all pretty awful,although it has a great plot it is the story and acting
1,i had just watched this movie yesterday on the scifi channel and was surprised by the title,i was so surprised by how this movie got out a 10 or 20 year old i would
1,a must see for all of us that like to avoid a movie,a little boy with a bit of personality and a weird sense of humor
1,it 's really great to see the film as a very moving subject on how to,it seems as if it does n't have a clue what the movie is about
1,by the time there was a new series of new episodes that were left out they were completely unrelated to this movie,by the time i saw it on the shelf i had heard and read the reviews before seeing it as my favorite film
1,i have n't seen any other films with that particular premise of this film,i could n't even remember how much to work out in that department but that
1,that 's why i like it but it just did n't work,that was the case of some of the other reviews i saw on
1,while watching this movie a second time i found it to be a very dark and dark film,while i am glad i did not have a problem with watching this movie i thought there was going
1,it is not about a gay family,it does make a bit of sense but
1,despite the fact that it 's a good movie but the film could have done without,despite what is supposed to be the ultimate ripoff of the original film it is also a
1,real life was a huge disappointment,real story is about the struggles for
1,but when i was a little kid i,but i really have to say that
1,that should be said when the film is released,that being said it 's a movie that you can
1,the only good part is his name,the story involves a guy who is kidnapped
1,by the end it was really hard to follow but i think that the whole film would have made more sense if the characters,by the way i would have thought that i had missed what 's going on in the way of being in the movie
1,note the very last minute is the best i have about this film,note the movie was a bit of a parody but it also made me
1,levy is excellent as well as a tough cop who is always trying to protect his daughter,levy is a good actor even more so for a film but he does a good job with
1,it 's not even funny and i think it 's very well done,it was also a lot more fun to watch it in a theater
1,i had high hopes for this movie and i have been a fan since i saw the first one,i have n't seen it since it 's released on tv in the late forties and still remember it fondly
1,just the tip of the iceberg in the last quarter hour or so,just as they were made the next weekend they 're all going back and
1,he is also very good in this movie and is one of the worst actors i have ever seen,he is just an american and it is a shame they were still in jail for his movies
1,i thought this was a very bad movie,i was looking forward to seeing her in a
1,and if you do n't want to read the book read the book you know that there,and there really is no way that this was any great tv series to begin with
1,batman returns with a new twist in his life as usual as a human man,batman returns is a film that i have n't seen and will never forget
1,i would n't have been more impressed with this,i think this movie deserves a better rating
1,many people have commented on this film,many of the performances of the cast are
1,this movie was a joke and i do n't think they,this movie also gives a unique performance in this picture
1,hey do n't we see a man,hey this should be another warning
1,it is a very very boring movie,it was a very bad movie i was
1,the movie is a good thriller,the story is about a group of
1,please please do n't read that this movie is worth owning,please note that i did n't feel it was that well that
1,this is where the movie falls apart,this movie could be made by a group
1,one thing i'm certain of a good horror,one of them has to be the most annoying
1,he gets to sing with a young girl and a young girl who,he gets the big girl out of the bag of the hotel
1,or maybe he is a bad writer,or the fact that the story had been
1,yea the story line is just too silly i do n't care about anyone who 's actually in the game,yea i had a lot of time to develop and it seemed so interesting that the two guys were still together
1,a movie that can take your own opinion about the events in the first place,a little bit of the dark story and the way things are set up
1,sondheim 's work for the big hit is a wonderful film,sondheim was not a great director because there were a number of
1,the plot twists and turns of the action are a little hokey but as a story the film is a little too long for its own good,the director of the film also shows the lack of vision in the book and the film looks awfully like something you would expect from the same old
1,almost as much of a problem as the characters who were supposed to,almost no one is going to take refuge in such an event
1,he has been sent to a prison party where the owner of a small californian town is located in the middle with,he 's a great actor but his acting is not as bad as he was in the role of the man
1,this film is one which i 'd highly recommend for everyone,this movie could have done a bit better if it had a
1,matt helm 's original score is quite interesting and adds a lot to the fun,matt hoskins plays dr paul a little more ambitious and he 's more of a character
1,the film is a little slow and boring,the only redeeming feature of this movie is how
1,the first and most of the movie follows the lives of a couple of characters who are searching for a missing civilization and a very dark secret to destroy their evil deeds by killing the,the only thing that makes this movie stand out is that it is n't so much a story of the evils of human behaviour but still about the human spirit to a certain extent
1,the movie itself is pretty decent,the ending is very slow but it
1,there is some gore and the film was pretty good as it seemed to be the first,there are also moments where they are not as bad as the first and the second
1,de oliveira is a master of the art and this works as a great documentary for what is one of his most famous films,de palma 's adaptation of the classic novel by sir james cameron based upon a novel by stephen j corbett the legend of a former
1,and this is the only reason why this,and the whole thing is just awful
1,and that is what happens when i do n't know who or who the killer was,and it 's a film i would recommend to anyone who 's interested in films for those
1,i was surprised to read about this movie,i have to say though it 's really a
1,outsourced is not a film i would watch once once,outsourced is a movie that shows the lives from both sides
1,i 've seen this movie three times,i do remember the whole movie and it
1,it has some funny moments and a few good oneliners from the movie as,it is a great piece of work and a great deal of fun
1,irene dunne plays a young woman caught in the depression,irene cara and robert duvall are good as the couple of
1,do some research or something with your own money,do n't expect any laughs the plot is a little
1,he was killed when the camera went,he has his own unique story
1,i really enjoyed this movie so much,i have seen all of this and i
1,this could have been better if the,this film is very well done
1,lou diamond phillips is excellent as the villain who,lou is also the best in the film
1,the movie is not that bad,the ending feels as if they 've
1,about the only thing we have here is that it,about a year later it 's a bit dated
1,just saw it in a cinema and it is absolutely fantastic,just as the film is a bit slow and the end is
1,the movie is so bad with its laughable cast and script that you wonder where to begin,the film is a great example of what makes people tick it to a certain level of filmmaking
1,brown is very much one of the,brown was just a bad guy
1,predator is a terrible movie that i wo n't describe,predator has a good reputation and is a very good movie
1,some of the actors are just too good as well as the supporting cast that makes this flick,some may argue if you think about it you 'll have to see it to find out
1,it seems to be a very difficult proposition to find the most important character of the film,it is a story of love in the lives of a bunch of people who live in a
1,after an initial encounter they are forced to leave behind the city as well as the other tenants who do n't seem to care much about the characters,after the first few minutes we had the two main characters the young man played wonderfully by henry travers a young boy with no sense of what we are
1,the film opens in an interesting manner where the viewer is treated to the story,the only thing i have ever seen on the show that i liked is that it
1,in fact if it were n't for the sex scenes the movie was n't a lot of fun,in a movie you can tell if it was n't for the bad dubbing the film would have been
1,and he does n't want to go for a walk,and the whole thing has to be one of the worst
1,the movie starts off like a play and that 's the main flaw,the only person who 's not one person in this film has been given
1,we do not see the movie it 's just plain bad,we were in for the next sixty minutes of the movie but
1,nonetheless this could have been an enjoyable movie if the filmmakers did n't have,nonetheless it 's a very good movie though it is not that bad
1,ted danson in an early film is one of the great mysteries i 've seen in a long time,ted 's evaluation of this film is just as well known that as if he was playing a straight part
1,the film has some pretty cool moments but the rest,the movie was very much in the right frame
1,all the actors were all excellent except and the two leading characters the script is so bad the writing is awful the,all we can think of is where they are being taken into a movie to see them in a good light
1,this is a very good movie that,this film is a must see
1,this movie is a real treat,this movie is not to be missed
1,i have been a teenager to watch,i did n't like this movie
1,it 's hard to explain why it ended up as a sequel,it makes up most of the characters in a different way that makes
1,every time i watch this i have to be a,every time you watch it you 'll enjoy it
1,mugged was the story of the mother of sam 's dad,mugged by a few of the reviewers who commented on the box
1,holmes 's character in a role has a certain fascination with the woman who he was accused,holmes plays a young woman who is determined to get her life out of the system
1,as a result it is a movie to look at,as for the story of a girl who is pregnant at
1,made for tv and a movie that shows us how to make a good documentary,made with that same degree a lot of people who have seen the movie know they
1,if you think it is the best film ever made,if you like a horror movie with a little humor thrown
1,the story is n't too interesting it 's not even good enough in its approach,the ending is great with what 's actually happening with the movie 's conclusion
1,this is n't a comedy it is n't,this is one of the best episodes that i
1,take it for what it is a bad film,take the time to read the book and read the
1,the movie takes place in a small,the movie is not for everyone
1,catherine is still not very convincing in the first place,catherine deneuve plays her wife a former lawyer who has trouble
1,a little too slow for me,a group of people take refuge in
1,i was hoping that the writers were going to show more than a little longer,i saw the movie twice and i had to say what it should of been
1,it was the kind of movie where you could just think of it because it was not a typical,it is a real shame how i can understand that he has done a lot of films since
1,i just saw a screener for a movie for the first time in the uk on june 11 1973 so i'm glad to find it,i do n't know how much it looks like it was made of all those directtovideo films that made its money at a festival
1,mirage the story begins in the first of a few years after the war,mirage also appears to be the most annoying one which i have seen
1,both movies are the ones that have made their movies,both of which are the only movies that have such strong
1,it would be a shame that the film is n't available on,it seemed to be a long way from the action genre
1,having read the first review on imdb i have been looking forward to this movie,having the best of a plot and a lot of characters in this movie you can
1,first of all it 's a movie that just does n't seem to have,first of all the movie is a mess of the first half hour
1,it 's also a movie with no real purpose at all,it has been made available only to entertain fans of the classic
1,and i have to admit that i was a bit skeptical about what was going on,and that 's why i think that this is the funniest movie i have ever seen
1,ok first of all it has been done by someone who had to go,ok it has a good script but it is all very very bad
1,kay is an intelligent woman who works at a convenience store and falls in love with a woman who does n't want to go up with her family,kay 's life is n't so much a story of life as her father but an obsessed young woman who has been in her home from prison as a
1,we can forgive him as he 's so much a genius for the role he does with nicholson and his cronies,we were so disgusted that he did n't get any information on that character that he did n't seem as though he
1,i have seen more than 2 films in my life and i am very impressed,i saw this movie when i was 10 and it still has a very good story
1,by the end you 'll leave the movie with one of the most powerful images ever,by the time i get my hands on my remote i had to stop the tape
1,the film opens of a group of college girls sitting at the pub at the beach and the boys try,the plot is simple but it is a little bit contrived and a bit overlong and not very convincing
1,scott 's character is a bit cranky but i think they 've just begun making the right people for a while,scott bakula is the main villain in the movie as a young man who 's a little stiff the way he is
1,the film is just a bunch of kids playing out as if they,the script of the film was so ridiculous that its a joke
1,i 've seen a lot of bad movies in my time,i think i would 've taken the movie too much
1,how about the plot in the movie it is,how many times did you see the movie
1,even a film of this ilk can never be released in hollywood in the past,even those who are looking for a movie that is a must but not that bad
1,granted this movie is n't bad but it has it 's moments in,granted the plot is so thin and boring the characters are ridiculous
1,time has passed away in a few seconds,time travel is n't a movie that will have
1,around the time it is discovered that a group of friends are having a party and are looking for a life they want,around the time there is a scene where a mother is walking around and her face to a mirror with her legs
1,or the fact that it is set in the,or just do n't waste their time watching
1,anderson is a genius to watch,anderson 's character is an actor that
1,instead of being a good film it is very very good,instead we get a lot of boring stuff that 's not funny
1,looking like it had a very low budget it was like that,looking back at the movie that came to mind the film was a
1,pino donaggio 's direction was excellent but his performance is very good,pino donaggio is the only actor who has been known as an actor
1,i had the honor of seeing a few episodes from the tv,i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto international film festival
1,it was so bad that there were no other movies that i did n't like,it 's just the fact that the movie is so long and boring it 's not
1,those were what i had to see for myself,those are the movies i have seen with quite a
1,dialogue and acting are a bit below,dialogue is awful and the actors
1,every time a story happens you will see a new movie,every time i watch this movie i feel bad for everyone who
1,in fact he does not show much in the movie,in a small scene in which sylvester plays with some of
1,however i think it will make a good movie and i hope,however the movie itself is also rather bland and very funny
1,no one will ever get any sympathy for the poor,no one should tell their stories in this movie
1,tim curry does this and is very likable as,tim roth and john cusack are great together
1,at the same time it 's a movie that is,at a certain point he 's a little suspicious
1,what 's the appeal of the scene in the middle of the scene,what i did expect to be a very good movie was the music and
1,finding the right way to see if the movie is going to get the exposure across a good balance in the future,finding her father and his mother is the closest we can get to be taken care of and will not get more out
1,however the only reason i gave it four,however i could see the whole production
1,much of it takes away from the plot,much of the dialogue is pretty dumb
1,the characters are just flat the dialogue is bad bad it 's not as bad as the worst movie i have seen in a long time,the acting is ok but you ca n't really complain about the acting or the storyline it is too dull for me at the end
1,the story is very well developed and the acting is superb,the film is also notable and it deals with the problems of
1,this is the third film made by the great director of the late sixties,this movie is an example of what the director thinks is to be a great
1,after seeing this movie i could only have seen it as an example of,after the film is over the top it was a very pleasant film
1,the script is full of cliches and the ending was a,the first half hour of the movie is really bad
1,it 's like it was supposed to be a comedy,it is as entertaining as it sounds and is one of
1,everyone 's in the movie the plot is not interesting,everyone was a big fan like the one who did n't
1,so if you have a soft spot for your movie it will appeal to you,so i saw the movie for the first time i loved it so much i actually
1,like all the other reviewers i have seen the movie a lot of it 's a lot of fun,like most of the movies you 've seen and is one of the most unique movies ever made in the
1,who could forget it and make a movie,who was going to do the research for this
1,no one is really interested in finding an equal but to go,no it 's like the old house of frankenstein or something
1,it 's just the sort of movie that you need to,it 's not so bad but it 's really bad
1,given the talent he received for this role he 's the,given the poor acting the production values are pretty low
1,you know how hard your alley and,you 'll be glad you did
1,i do n't know if it will be like the fact that this is a,i think that this film deserves more recognition than the other in the world
1,all of the characters are played very well by the actors,all i got the feeling that all the main characters are trying
1,the only thing that made it worthwhile was the fact that this was a film that the,the director of this movie wrote the script and the directing was horrible but it worked
1,now this is what i am talking about,now we 're talking about his own past the
1,his mother 's father is a bit of,his performance in this film is excellent
1,if a friend and girl were making an attempt to get them,if you want to see a good asian movie watch it
1,notable for a few minutes of the screen time and the film is a delight to watch,notable cast members from this era should not play out and you 'll need to find a better
1,and he does n't want to get himself into a car accident,and the other actors are quite poor the film is a little hard
1,i do n't think that the movie would ever have made the book,i thought this was a very interesting movie that should never have had that
1,the plot is about the man who is being sent by,the film is very entertaining but the script is awful
1,it 's not an oscar contender but the movie is also a fun experience in its view,it 's like the director of the movie was hoping for the worst movie of all time
1,the movie is about two friends each,the characters were not fleshed out
1,so it has its very short subjects,so it was not for the sake of
1,marlene dietrich as always is the only thing i really liked to,marlene dietrich is a fine actress but she makes me question
1,if the director had a bit of money to be had to put this on,if not for your consideration it still amazes me that the movie does n't have many
1,title cards and music videos of the,title o t de la bestia
1,good luck for a movie that is worth it,good story good characters some good acting bad music
1,first time i 've seen him in this role is one,first of all they have some great lines for them
1,the movie is set in england,the movie was about as exciting a
1,crummy movie that could be used to be,crummy movie to boot in the uk
1,plot wise but a good mix of,plot and storyline is just awful
1,and it 's one of the most pathetic movies ever that you will ever find in a movie store,and the last twenty minutes of movie were so cheesy it had to be made by two directors
1,we know the story is supposed to end a little girl named conchita is pregnant,we do n't need to be a hero but this movie is about as good as
1,it seems to have a lot of potential but,it has the most beautiful scene ever filmed
1,do n't misunderstand to your friends if there is one,do n't be fooled by some of these comments
1,elvira is a very bad movie but the acting was just so bad,elvira the main character is a caricature of a family who has lived in
1,we 've heard so many of the things about the whole ordeal that the film becomes so,we know how to play a character and his acting style are n't all too bad
1,furthermore the film is a bit slow moving and boring,furthermore i do n't think it was a little scary though
1,would n't he know that he 'd spend money and money,would you expect the film to make your own skin look real
1,this is one of those films you have to wait for,this film will only be remembered for some people who have n't
1,nowhere near as entertaining as those that are being shot in one area with a large foot,nowhere else we learn that this is the kind of film that can become a huge hit in
1,instead it was like being made to cash to the ground so that he did n't have time to get a job,instead of doing it i am afraid that no one in the world was willing to give him a role or even care
1,a man of note is not the,a great cast and great performances
1,for all the good reviews on the movie i just,for the first time i could watch this one
1,garrison 's mother is killed when the daughter of sam 's mother turns them into something and is unable to cope,garrison is an odd man in the end but he 's a little less confident to have in her role
1,who is one man who is a loner and,who did this in to see a movie
1,this movie has to be an insult to both of them as,this is one of the worst films i 've ever seen
1,this film is the best it 's in the last thirty years,this is an insult to the intelligence the fans of the film industry
1,i think the reason that most films like this one,i did n't care when a movie was made
1,this film has some great moments in,this movie is a complete disappointment
1,again there 's a few problems with the first one,again i did n't think the film had any kind of
1,not to mention that the movie had no point in,not that i 'd like to read any comment
1,i'm surprised by what i would have liked a movie that 's better than the original,i'm sorry i did not get this movie but the fact that i love that is something
1,if you are going to remake it do n't worry,if you have n't seen this then do so
1,they are all a bit of a jerk and they 're not even believable at all,they are all for a very simple look at the world which is in the world of
1,it makes me wonder why the makers of this film chose a sequel with so many different ideas that would n't be made even published today,it 's the fact that the characters and the characters and the story lines make this film stand out are the performances especially the one and very
1,i 've been looking for it since then i 've seen it twice but it does,i have to admit that this movie 's sequel made me want to read it
1,the ending of the film is as predictable as the rest of the movie,the movie is pretty tame and there are so many scenes where the camera moves
1,in this movie however he 's a jerk for the,in fact this is the worst film ever made
1,the first half of the movie deals with the characters the story of the first two,the main plot is about the real killer who is not a coward at all
1,kids do n't think they can survive with their child,kids do not want to get away with it
1,it is about the war that is being held behind by the americans in the country,it 's like they 're trying a hard and realistic but funny story that keeps us in
1,but this is a good film,but he just wants to play an
1,though it is not long before the movie turns you into a world that is,though there are some pretty obvious plot holes the film is a bit predictable
1,i did not have any expectations for this one except for,i was expecting the worst movie to get on video
1,as for the script well it was just not so bad,as usual for this particular movie the actors are so well written
1,first let me say that there is a good story in this movie,first off the film is not worth viewing for all of the time invested
1,the first film of a series of great shows is the one that takes place in the united kingdom as they get older,the film had been filmed several years after the release of the movie in my opinion and the story was just as bad as
1,a great director to watch with a good sense in,a few years ago i was watching the movie
1,there are several reasons that they should not be,there really is nothing to say to the story
1,just as they are in the beginning and they all seem to,just do n't go into this well expecting the original movie
1,this is not a movie like the shining in the first film,this is the most ridiculous movie i 've ever seen on celluloid
1,she is a little too busy trying to be funny and i can only see her face,she does not even look like a cross between her and her hair in the film 's favour
1,this movie is just a piece of,this is one thing to watch
1,one of the best examples of this is the first film i have seen from the first film i 've seen a lot more,one must remember that the filmmakers have tried to make something original and they try to make it look bad but the rest
1,i think it 's a great show that is n't a comedy,i thought the movie looked like a bad indie movie but in some
1,then a man enters the country in a way that the people that saw him in the original film did not,then when i read the synopsis i had read the book which was the most haunting description in the film
1,the plot is just plain ridiculous,the acting is horrible the directing is
1,why did anyone do anything like this,why not do it with a large number
1,unfortunately the movie has nothing going for it,unfortunately the movie fails miserably because of its title
1,this is a very good film with excellent performances from,this is the worst performance i have ever seen
1,with the exception of a film about the evils of war and the holocaust the economy of the soviet union of the times,with a supposed budget of about 5000000 it 's probably a bit hard to find any reason to give it a low ranking but
1,the film is filled with moments and scenes,the movie is very dark and creepy
1,his character is supposed to be a good guy,his wife is an outcast who has been killed by
1,unfortunately this film was so bad that i actually turned off the volume on ebay,unfortunately the film lacks a coherent and interesting plot that has the dubious twist at the
1,the movie is also a bit slow paced in parts but the movie is also a bit slow,the music is not very original and is also very dated and is n't too much of a mess
1,it really was n't very well done and was not the first time i thought i would,it 's just a good movie about what they wanted on the subject the director chose
1,the main idea of the movie is what a bunch of people want to be,the acting is so bad that the entire thing is just a bunch of pointless characters
1,the film was shot in canada and was in an old way,the first movie was a great idea but not a good one
1,i was so disappointed that they decided to cancel the movie because they,i have always been an open minded person in the united states
1,please please do n't waste the time watching it,please do n't read this review or be commenting on
1,it 's a shame that they have such a poor quality of acting skills,it 's all very real very interesting and it 's not a bad movie either
1,after hearing about this film and having watched the movie i can see that it is a,after watching the film and reading the book my thoughts of the movie were the best
1,the only problem i had was watching dahmer 's character,the film opens up with a great opening sequence featuring an
1,a lot of people would say that this film was shot independently and is one of the most impressive ones i have seen,a lot of the film takes place in a small town in a big city but in the first half of the movie there
1,additionally it has to make a point that a movie that is not only a good one is about the power of life,additionally if you are looking for an example of how much of it is the story of the film there is no need to
1,this is a good movie about a,this is a very funny film
1,perhaps the worst movie ever made the director and producer have made something interesting in the,perhaps it 's because i'm afraid it would be a lot more interesting and entertaining
1,it would be good to see the actors involved with this project of a movie,it has some interesting parts though as a bit of action in the film
1,it 's not that the movie is so bad it 's good,it was a very clever movie with a couple of laughs
1,the movie is a lot to bad,the film 's title sequence at the end
1,the whole film seemed so bad the acting was atrocious the plot was boring,the film is not the most boring film that i 've sat through
1,stella 's father who is supposed to be the father of both the family and the daughter who has been separated on her family,stella is the one who keeps the camera and it does n't seem too good to have a chance to see the movie
1,it 's just a bad idea as a bad film but it fails,it was like he has to fight a couple of times and just do
1,my friends would have been a little more interested in watching this movie because,my favorite character is the guy who plays jesus in the first two
1,babenco 's attempt of direction and editing,babenco 's film is quite entertaining
1,rooker 's movie is not funny and it,rooker is in a class of this
1,as it turns out that the director does n't know what he feels he must be working,as the final note the film has absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever it simply does n't make sense
1,it 's all the better you get a feeling of watching the first half of this one,it 's not a bad movie and has an excellent plot but a good plot and good acting
1,they 're all on the verge of being an,they are the best actors in any movie
1,to me this was all that could happen to you,to my disgust he has n't yet seen anything
1,however i still liked the first film because the last film,however this film did n't have to do it much
1,just when he is n't the only one you will see his face,just like the characters and a bunch of people you could care
1,the ending of the movie is as i thought it was a bit of a,the ending of the movie is the worst i 've seen in a movie
1,sondra locke gives a tremendous performance as a nun 's mother and daughter who is not the only one in the world to,sondra locke 's portrayal of the daughter as they play in a movie made me want to slap myself in the head
1,and the acting which was really good is all the better in the movie,and for all of you who love movies with the same name i do n't
1,the story was quite predictable though the direction is n't that big and there 's some very odd and impressive cinematography,the first half of the movie is an attempt to get the audience to know everything about themselves but it 's a
1,the first of three films made by the first three was one,the movie is a complete waste of time and the title
1,pretty soon it was just a bad movie,pretty much all of us would n't know it
1,the only thing i would have liked,the characters all have great problems
1,this movie was about a bunch of friends who are killed and all of them are dead and killed and they 're,this film is just a waste of time i 've wasted my time in an intellectually charged and intellectually disturbing film
1,one of the great lines i have seen in a long,one can only say that this was a good movie
1,remember what i was looking for,remember that it was an era in
1,and the best part of the film is when a,and the plot is really stupid and not funny
1,it was like watching the rushes of a man trying to figure how the man was going to get back to his wife 's house,it 's a story of two guys who meet the same person in the same apartment with no real reason to make them go
1,dare you go in expecting the story,dare we just forget the title
1,i was so excited because this movie was such a waste of my time,i saw this film in new zealand city of new york and loved it immensely
1,although he does not get his chances it does n't seem like a character that i think is one of the few interesting characters that i have ever seen before,although i can understand the director 's intentions in the film he does n't have this much screen time and it does seem to have been a mistake to be able
1,yet it also does not take place at a time of crisis,yet the movie never gets old as we see a lot of movies
1,gradually the viewer feels as though the camera are too close to a real character and the story is about the same,gradually we get to see the woman from the beginning and then the film goes to get you going into the movie the
1,zeus also is the first movie ever to be so powerful,zeus is a very beautiful man but he has a good body
1,in my opinion a great film and good family,in addition to what i think is an interesting idea
1,its a very nice film and i recommend it to all those who,its a shame that it has n't received any other academy awards
1,myron the kid is a jerk who loves to kill a child in a,myron is a very good movie and the two leads are pretty good
1,its almost impossible to believe but i have the feeling it 's a good start to start a little,its a good example of how people react to the subject of the film and how they could make their
1,this movie is like a remake of a,this film does make a good movie
1,and it is all the characters are,and i love it when the guy has
1,these guys are not so lucky at the party to make a trip to themselves,these are just a few people you can find a little bit better than the movie
1,there is no need to be a film that has been done so poorly because you can see that the director 's intention is,there were too many clichs and situations that do drag out too many times you never really cared about any of the characters
1,the movie had a lot to do with,the plot is simple and very predictable
1,at least the story was a bit weak,at the time of writing this review is in
1,i 've heard that this movie was made about 2 times,i saw that the film was shot at my home video store
1,they were all in a row in the,they are not afraid to show us
1,one of the worst movies i have ever seen,one night of the movie and then he decides to
1,brittany murphy was perfect as the villain of the original,brittany murphy plays a somewhat eccentric and neurotic man that just
1,overall a very very entertaining film,overall the film is one of the
1,it is n't even that bad,it 's an action film and it
1,the film does n't even have to be called for those who have not,the only good actor is the guy with a big mustache in mind
1,they just had a lot of fun,they did n't care about anything to this
1,the director 's commentary to be on the case and that 's why,the film 's plot is n't interesting enough so to speak the action and
1,i really felt the tension between the two main characters was the best of the movie,i am not a fan of horror films and this is n't one of them
1,the plot was pretty predictable the dialogue is terrible the plot line just plain awful and the ending,the film has a nice pace but the story is too thin to be entertaining or interesting
1,somehow the script is so poor that its untrue,somehow they seem to have lost their touch
1,if you like a comedy you 're a great horror movie,if you want to know a movie like this you can love
1,then again i have seen it several times and each time it reaches you,then there is that scene where he and his father get a little scared at
1,he was a quiet character he was a very nice actor and was the,he is supposed to be the ultimate character but he does so little
1,producing a sequel that was just finished,producing the first of them all the best
1,as the movie goes on its obvious that some people are too old and the film ends on a really upbeat note with it 's running,as a child who 's been living with her mother and her life the relationship between her daughter and her mother is still very compelling
1,they were also made to try and make a movie,they are not afraid to get a chance to do something
1,helping to make it a point to see this movie unfold in,helping to keep the audience guessing of what is going on
1,second the movie is not a horror film it 's not a typical thriller or anything like that it,second i was very angry when i went to see this movie i had a lot of fun
1,kudrow has been in a lot of movies lately in the past and she 's always an actress she can,kudrow plays a woman who has been abused and married by the time she tries to leave her alone
1,the film was directed in the style of the day,the movie also has two very good supporting actors including the
1,so what i got was a great story about people who,so what 's more the film is a great one
1,polonius is one of the worst directors in his early career and his movies have no,polonius is so charming with the character that the characters are almost always very likable
1,fester is a pretty good actor who is good actor as his son,fester is a great movie and is a must see for anyone interested in
1,it is the worst of her acting,it is not a big picture but an
1,the movie starts with the man in the lake with his mother but the first one is about a guy trying to get revenge on him,the acting is poor the story is horrible the actors are bad and there is no real story at all no acting and no action
1,there are also numerous scenes to the very beginning which would be a perfect example of,there is a lot of people on tv nowadays and i really liked the movie
1,this is the most disturbing part of the film and is really worth waiting for and is not a movie that i will never forget,this is a film that will appeal to everyone in a sense of humor and culture that should be in my opinion if you 're looking
1,i think that it was a very,i do n't like a film
1,set a little to the chagrin of the most beautiful and beautiful woman in hollywood,set in the day of the hays game there is very much that in the way
1,he makes it through the whole movie and then it turns out to be a great idea,he is a true story of the life of the hero who lives under a bridge that he
1,suspension of disbelief is the fact that,suspension of disbelief is the film
1,have n't you ever wondered whether you,have you ever watched this movie
1,a woman 's life becomes complicated and so as a,a few moments in it are n't particularly memorable
1,the ending of the episode was so abrupt and abrupt that you could barely see the potential of the character and not as a character study of life,the only thing that i have ever seen so far is that it has a lot like the rest of the story as they do a few of the
1,i was a big fan of it and i thought that was funny to watch,i do n't think this was the first of the three series but the last season
1,i did n't like that but i did it for me that really was the case with,i 've seen a lot of bad movies and i 've watched it and i like
1,while we are talking about the situation that we do n't understand to the extent we are left alone to ponder that the audience is still watching the same one as in the first two movies,while i do n't agree with the comments here that 's why the movie itself is so slow it makes you feel like you 're not only for the two main characters but as you watch in
1,a movie which can make me laugh,a movie that i would rate in my
1,without a doubt the most boring movie i have ever seen i ca n't think,without any hint of how the actors would play a character in this film
1,coincidentally i can see his character at work and he says this,coincidentally one of the biggest cities of the 20th century is a young
1,in a film of this magnitude it 's a very difficult task that they can,in fact it 's an incredibly beautiful movie but i can imagine why not
1,it was so much to go with this film that i felt cheated,it 's all so awful it makes it impossible to comprehend but it 's
1,conspiracy theorists are n't exactly related to a story,conspiracy theorists who do n't believe in them
1,cat bite dog is an example of a great movie and a great cast,cat 's shoes is a good horror movie it is so great it 's almost
1,it 's a pretty stupid movie,it was a really good movie but
1,i would n't have had to endure it,i could n't stop laughing at the film i
1,i was in shock of the movie at the beginning,i 've always been a fan of movies in my life
1,the first time we saw the first season was still on the air for a change,the film looks like a high school play student 's play on a porn film
1,now he 's got to get the car right,now the director should get a copy for his own
1,i would have preferred a better movie,i was expecting some more laughs and this
1,that 's not a criticism that is only hinted at the fact,that 's when the movie reaches the top of the list
1,if the show does n't get any better it is not just that it is n't that interesting,if you 're thinking of renting this movie on tv then rent it and watch the rest of the
1,but if you do n't like and see the movie as a true story it,but it is also a movie of what i call out of all things
1,michael j fox who is the star of this,michael dudikoff is great as the main villain
1,these guys were killed in the beginning,these two stars are also good
1,as a child i have seen a lot of movies in my day but this one is so bad it,as for the acting of the movie i really would n't be surprised by the plot to be fair
1,they are a real charmer to be sure but this is not one to do so,they do n't want to get out of the city they are on the island
1,dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 12 pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines,dr john gielgud does a fine job on the movie which is a shame as he gives the
1,buffalo bill was the only real reason to go into the movie,buffalo bill was an entertaining little film it could have turned its own
1,all in all this movie is a must see for anybody interested in,all of the leads were good but all involved had their eye
1,the film is a real treat as the film progresses in,the movie 's direction in the story is quite simple
1,lowrent production values are used to enhance the atmosphere of a film with a minimal plot,lowrent and very boring and it seems that he was n't going to get a kick out
1,he 's not only about the movie 's technical aspects but it does make it look like a documentary,he 's in love with a woman but who just does not know he ca n't beat her
1,the only character i can remember is the one person who does that,the movie takes place in the future and the us are on the run
1,but it 's just a great movie that keeps you guessing whether or not to,but this film just was n't a good way to spend time in time
1,under all the technical aspects and the fact that the director has not seen any real talent and is able to make more convincing work with the cast the script is also quite good,under an underwritten and blizzard to his wife and his family it seems that the only one left with his life and he has no idea of being the killer in a car accident
1,this is a real treat for a movie that was made in the early 80 's but the story is just,this film is a real treasure for me to see a film that will always be a pleasure to watch
1,however as they 're in love and love for each other their lives fall apart,however the movie has a lot of laughs and i think it 's too short
1,the story begins at the funeral of the young man and her brother and her two,the film has an upbeat look to it as i watched it to the end
1,the film had very few redeeming qualities the film had many moments and was just plain boring,the script is so awful that it 's hard to believe that this film was even filmed in
1,i am not impressed in a story which i wo n't even reveal,i 've got more of an idea of how people who are supposed to
1,it seemed to be on acid,it may be this is the type
1,in fact this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen,in fact this movie is pretty funny and i love the ending as the
1,she has an odd story of how to,she is very beautiful and very funny
1,tarzan was the only thing that was a,tarzan is no exception in its plot
1,although i was disappointed at some of the other scenes that have happened i did not,although i have been watching this movie on video i could not get into it
1,in this episode kirk 's friends take his show in a,in conclusion the movie is a complete waste of time
1,along the way he meets his father and his girlfriend,along the way she falls in love with each one 's
1,beware of the best movie ever made,beware in the middle section of the film
1,to make it all over this movie makes me sick,to be honest it was n't a bad film but there
1,there is an awful and pointless scene between the,there really is nothing original to look at
1,suffice to say that the movie is n't all that bad either,suffice it to say that the acting and writing is awful and the
1,this is the worst movie i have,this is the one to watch
1,sure there were a couple of chuckles but this is where the humor comes from the fact that the characters are all,sure it 's a bit dated but it 's also a good movie and it shows what the film is about
1,in one scene a guy goes down to another woman to watch her husband 's face but the other one is,in the first season of season 2 of the series it 's a total waste of time and the same
1,another thing that i did not liked about,another movie with a very bad ending
1,this is a movie that 's not afraid of the time period and,this film is one big mess and a complete waste of time
1,but this one is a total waste of time the acting,but the film is also filled with clichs and references
1,getting in this case for all of you,getting the hell out of the way
1,and then there is the guy who plays the lead role in the film but he is still,and the other actors who have n't worked together in movies like the one in the film
1,i did n't think that it was funny,i 've read somewhere that the director was trying
1,the plot is a little weak at times,the film is not even remotely enjoyable
1,if it were that the movie did n't have to try to portray some people in life it 's really an awful movie,if you 're into the horror genre in general and if you want to see an asian movie that you ca n't take seriously
1,all in all a very fun watch for anyone,all of his works seem to be getting into every
1,the movie is very very funny,the only reason i watched this film
1,by the way if you 've seen ichi bill or the jackass king this is your movie,by the end i have been a friend of one of the many other movies that i 've
1,after seeing the first movie for a few minutes i thought it would be bad enough but it has a few redeeming qualities,after watching this movie a lot of people were talking about it but it is hard to say it 's a great movie
1,the film follows as a whole movie with,the director obviously did n't get it
1,she does n't take a fancy look at all that is n't going to win,she 's been a little more than a lot of the movie in her career but
1,in this case the main character of the movie who was so upset and lost was a good idea,in this case a man who is an idiot in the business who is constantly involved in the crime and
1,what a waste of time and money,what can i say the story is that
1,while it certainly has some funny moments in it it was n't,while the cast is fine the script is not too bad
1,critics have already dismissed the lack of imagination and it is no surprise,critics would be a more forgiving person to accept all the things
1,fallon is the kind of character he is given but he 's still funny,fallon 's character is the only good thing about the film that 's good as
1,peter o'toole is also the best in this movie but it is a shame that he did n't go in to do such films like this instead,peter cushing 's performance was excellent and i was expecting something a little more serious and i 'd not recommend any less than a bit more
1,darren mcgavin and richard jaeckel play their parts,darren mcgavin was a delight to watch
1,this movie is absolutely horrible and that 's saying so,this movie is not even worth renting if you 're looking
1,although the acting is bad the movie looks amateurish,although i 've seen that i 've heard this was
1,the movie is a bit hard to figure out who you are,the actors in this movie seemed a little more than they expected in
1,someone needs a new life a movie that is so stupid,someone was trying the worst movie i have ever seen
1,this film is quite a good example,this movie is just a very bad movie
1,getting a few chuckles when the action takes place on the first place where the action takes place,getting a grip from the director of this movie in which the lead singer says she is cheating on
1,it 's a real shame because the story and character development is just bad and the,it 's a pretty entertaining film and it would certainly give you that feeling good
1,to say that this was supposed to be a serious horror film i would rather have to endure it than,to make matters worse the film has its moments as one of the best shows out of the ordinary
1,and the whole concept of the story seems,and he did a very good job
1,but the movie is a lot like it,but this was the first time i had viewed
1,pfeiffer was the biggest star in the world and is an excellent actress and her character,pfeiffer is a pretty boy at least she gives her a role on this show
1,this is one of the greatest examples of the movie,this makes him a real character and he has n't been
1,he had the worst acting he could n't be a bad,he 's not only a young woman but a woman
1,perhaps if someone could tell that a true story is a little bit more than a good one i would,perhaps this will help the director to see his first film and he will make a better living performance
1,note a few scenes in the film when,note the ending was just another notch
1,the plot seems like a bad thing and one wonders about the main premise,the only thing that was really scary was the use of the camera work
1,the main difference between a good movie and my mind is that i thought,the acting is great but the movie just seems so dull to me
1,that is not the case with the film,that being said the film is a total disappointment
1,it 's just a movie that you 'll never forget about a movie,it 's almost like a film about an elderly student trying to make a
1,i was surprised to learn that the movie was a waste of time for me and i am surprised when i saw it,i was not expecting anything a good movie just like the book because of all those involved in the making of it
1,the movie is also very different,the plot seems like a mix of
1,a man who has made up with a woman who has,a young man a young boy who is a child
1,any fan of hers should be rewarded with the idea that this is,any time they come on the screen you ca n't even tell
1,when i saw this movie i thought the acting was ok and all the other actors,when you have to watch a film with a very good director with no budget
1,the film is set up for some very long periods of the movie where,the movie is about two friends who try to find love and love
1,glad they could have done it right,glad that i can remember that they do
1,even as such it is definitely worth the watch,even if you can handle this and have a good
1,our main character is the most famous character in history with any real reason to be so disgusted or at least be a human being,our heroes will be like a bunch of kids who are in a car to take a trip to the next night to get their money
1,in other words if you 've seen a movie you have seen by the critics on the shelf and you know a lot of,in fact if there is some sort of plot about a man he needs to make his own decisions and accept it differently
1,that 's the main reason why this film is the most controversial of the two,that being said there is a certain similarity with the story which is not the best
1,but as a fan of films i have never,but it does n't do much for me
1,it was very funny and a bit scary and funny,it 's not just a few laughs there 's no real
1,the characters are a bunch of cardboard cutouts with no real motivation for acting or character development,the movie begins with a very strong and interesting conclusion in the end and the ending and then
1,do n't bother with this film unless you really need a decent scare,do n't get me wrong i love this movie but it was also the
1,i think that one of the characters i was looking for is the fact that they are supposed to be friends or both of which i do n't,i have watched this movie dozens of years ago and i'm glad that i had wasted more than a couple of hours of my life to watch
1,what we get instead of a film in which the story unfolds at the beginning is,what the movie is supposed to represent is the fact that we were not entertained
1,but the movie is also a very poor representation of the subject matter,but what i do n't know is that the movie never got the funding
1,i saw this at a friend 's house and did n't remember anything,i would like to watch this movie and i would have been surprised to
1,it is a shame that the director of this,it is one of my all time favorites
1,there were two of the main actors who,there are also several very good examples
1,but it 's a movie of a film and it shows how,but then the movie starts to unravel from the first film
1,the movie was made and i liked what i said about,the movie was very entertaining and had a nice ending
1,someone should have had a better life,someone else did not know where it was
1,stripped is the most beautiful film i have ever seen this movie is simply,stripped of all the actors and actresses are a nice touch to behold
1,also the only reason this movie is not appreciated because of that aspect of the film is how it is,also it would n't be better to be more successful and have been on the edge of the doubt
1,this is a movie i 'd never mind as a whole,this is the first movie of the series that really makes an
1,with the help of a man named a dead man in the city he is sent to prison for a job of being murdered by a former sheriff,with this film being the last film on tv i 've seen the trailer and the whole movie is about the same thing with the same plot
1,my wife loved it and did n't love it until i saw this film for no,my guess is that if you 're one of those who have a good time
1,many people do n't want to know what to call them,many of us would be surprised that this did not make the
1,ever since then i have always felt that a film that could be made in the style of animation was very interesting,ever since it was released in 1990 he was a young stud who had been accused of being the world in his life
1,i think the director had to make a good movie,i really ca n't recommend this movie as i will never
1,the story is told to us by his mother the,the acting is not bad the story is predictable
1,i ca n't remember the last time that i cried when the characters appeared,i was able to locate the first two in this movie i was expecting a
1,the only thing this movie shows is the story of the original,the movie does have some great scenes and the acting is quite decent
1,he is a very talented character,he 's one hell of a man
1,i think it is the reason why i have seen this movie,i was also impressed by the story and characters and some very very
1,add a few twists and turns of a story of the future and there 's little else,add a bit of comedy to a movie that has something to do with the other
1,madcap and stupid the movie is n't about a family being a mother or,madcap and funny in a way that was so much fun to watch
1,we all know it is going to be a lot of fun for some viewers and it 's pretty good to see,we are led to believe that they are n't at all attracted to the story but in the end is a film you
1,we 're not supposed to be shocked but to make,we can only hope this is a long time
1,french cinema director lucio fulci is a master of art,french films are also the subject of a very popular movie
1,my wife 's character was so much i do n't care if the movie was so boring that i was not able to see this movie anywhere,my wife and i watched the movie with its sony recording on the dvd box set and the director decided that the cast was great and the script
1,with an open mind and then a certain amount of money the film has become more like a,with no hesitation he is not able to do so with a large portion of his work
1,so in the end it 's a fun thing to watch and some interesting parts such as the little girl who is so much more the,so much of that was all made in the end but it 's not just a matter of what a movie it is about how
1,and if you 've already seen the first half of the movie there 's a bit more,and the ending of the film makes no sense in the final third of the movie
1,gorehounds are looking at this film from the perspective of the movie and the plot and the script the acting the dialogue the acting everything else was,gorehounds will be left wondering about the movie 's content that is n't necessarily that the story line is about something that 's not so simple
1,i do n't understand why anyone would find,i could write a more interesting review
1,when i first saw it on tv i was amazed by how bad it was,when the movie ended i was hooked and it was still a great show
1,okay so i 've been trying to figure out who is the next victim of the story,okay so i am a fan of this type of movie but i have never seen the original
1,it 's hard to imagine if the acting director who had just written his own name for the role should,it 's not worth it to have to have a few chuckles if you can get a good laugh
1,get a copy from an american tv series called this is the first,get the dvd and the other it 's all over the place
1,you can only guess what he had to endure,you should have a movie that had so much promise
1,i would have liked to be the first,i have seen worse than this film
1,all in all a great film for anyone interested in the culture of war and the politics that make you watch the movie but do n't worry the first time you watch it,all we know about is a woman who was sexually abused with her father who was also in her own home and she had become more involved with her own father 's love which
1,she just does n't know how to fight,she plays out of the ordinary woman
1,what makes this movie stand out is,what was that supposed to mean
1,the acting was good for the time period that seemed to be a fitting move for,the ending was pretty predictable and the plot was so poor it 's almost unbelievable
1,his films made them a huge success,his first time was that a little boy
1,next time they try to bring us a story to the beginning of the movie we do n't get it,next time she 's getting the job of a car she is not able to get back to a hotel
1,from the outset to the movie 's end i got to see this movie,from all this the film was shot to the point where it was a little
1,it is like watching something big budget but it just is,it is so bad that it 's good to watch
1,that is the only thing that this movie has going for it so i ca n't get a copy of it anywhere,that 's because we are never given enough information and is n't even remotely interesting when a woman has a boyfriend
1,the director of the film is probably not as accurate and as to make,the characters are the ones who are not portrayed in the whole movie
1,the movie is really hard to follow and i do find some of the scenes in the bar are hilarious,the film was shot on digital video and the editing was excellent although the scenes were pretty bland and poorly filmed
1,this is a film that has a few nice twists and turns,this was not one of my most favourite films to date
1,there 's no real character development and no real suspense,there were two things i hated about this movie
1,the actors are also excellent especially josh 's portrayal with his,the plot is very poor and the acting is horrible
1,the movie was shot during the depression scenes and was quite effective,the first thing she is in to a movie is a scene where
1,i am amazed by the number of comments here that the movie,i have n't been able to find any better to watch
1,none of these characters do anything to distinguish this as an adult,none of the actors were convincing except the two leads they were supposed
1,seeing this movie in its run of tv shows is a bit of a mess,seeing the movie was one of my favorites and it would probably make the movie longer
1,some of the most interesting scenes occur when the,some of the supporting actors are really good
1,overall this film was an insult to its intelligence and the only one who did n't really care,overall it is an enjoyable movie to watch and for the time period it was filmed in
1,i could forgive this movie for its faults,i thought this would be a classic movie and
1,granted it was n't bad and the story was n't bad though not very great,granted they are n't as funny as the one they are but you get to get
1,the movie does contain a lot of plot holes which are the main,the only positive comment about this movie was the way it opened
1,even the soundtrack of ennio morricone 's classic soundtrack seems to have been influenced by the sound of a song in the background,even though it 's quite obvious that the entire film is set up in an abandoned house the entire audience will never hear them
1,it would make a very strong addition to a story that would make no difference,it also has the same kind of humor that makes it more fun to watch than
1,first let me say that i do n't like to comment on the music i was n't,first off the movie itself is not so bad it 's good but is actually better
1,or maybe it would be nice to see the movie that has been,or perhaps the director is going to end up making more money
1,and it 's just about the worst of the bunch,and that does n't mean that a lot of the dialogue
1,i had to watch this movie just because i do n't know what to say,i thought the movie would have made better sense but it 's too late
1,a good film about a very attractive man who is an,a very funny movie that is n't even worth seeing
1,the movie also shows that these characters were a part of the,the movie has a lot of fun in it for me
1,according to the dvd sleeve 's cover the director of the novel and the book are the same person who wrote,according to this movie she must be at a loss of her own sexual love in her mother 's life
1,the story is very simple the acting is so bad its a shame,the ending is n't bad enough so they can get it right
1,the movie is an exercise in the way it,the acting of the three leads was great
1,i 've been waiting for more fun to,i 've seen it dozens of years
1,or perhaps not to a movie in a world,or why it has not been so widely researched by
1,also a lot of movies that go on in hollywood and are not even,also they all have a different feel than usual in their respective ways
1,so much of the characters were either that or the director and writer did n't know that before going to bed on a boat and the other was the one that went for the,so if you 're not too young or even want to be moved by the fact this movie is an absolute must see for its pulse this is probably one of the great
1,it 's the most annoying of any film ever,it 's so easy that it 's the first hour
1,instead we are shown to think that he is,instead it 's the worst movie ever made
1,in this world we get the inevitable ending of the final fight between the monster and the giant spider,in my opinion it did not look at all like it was on the other side of the road but
1,i have always admired the critics who have seen the film but i do n't really understand the point of the film,i am also a fan of this movie but it 's the only real thing i can remember and i would definitely recommend
1,and i 'll bet that this was the case with many of us that we would probably not consider much better,and of course there 's something that you can do about this film is that it was a big hit
1,the plot is n't so well done it 's actually a,the plot is a mess and the acting is bad
1,5 it 's not worth the time and money,5 it makes me wonder whether she was having an
1,marcos is about to graduate of a group of poachers to be killed off,marcos has an imaginary friend and has his wife killed but he does not realize
1,both are not the same as this but it,both the story and the characters fall flat
1,the acting is ok and the script is a bit too contrived,the only thing that kept me from believing that this film had some
1,just like the old guy who has no qualms what happened and the,just when i thought this would be funny it would just suck
1,i ca n't remember much of her when i watch,i was impressed with the end of the film
1,yea it 's not as bad as it sounds,yea this really is what the film should be called
1,when the film is made a few minutes into the movie i thought the entire premise of getting the point of airtime was to leave the theater so,when i first read the cover i was in shock that this is a movie about the hardships of those who do n't know what to do
1,instead she 's a woman who does not want her son and the man she loves,instead the acting is horrible in every sense and is a bit too wooden at times
1,this was my first experience when i,this movie is a complete mess
1,this may have been a good movie to,this movie is one of the worst
1,also i found myself wondering how many americans in the industry are not in for the sake of a,also the soundtrack is n't really that good and the movie does have a few faults as well
1,robbins 's character is the only one who will be the hero who is in,robbins is a fine villain but the film never makes any impression or tails
1,typical of the movie is the way the director and,typical operating procedure is a beautiful piece of work
1,the film begins when the main characters of the two snipers are,the movie had a decent cast and a very nice story
1,he 's supposed to be a hero and he 's trying to be,he has also got the job and a great deal of talent
1,i thought i 'd give it a try,i thought that was what was so appealing about
1,i was very impressed in this very short film,i have never seen the original and the movie was
1,when a movie that i have to watch over all my own,when he returns he has nothing to worry about at first
1,later there 's the killer who kills the killer and kills the girls who killed them and then they kill him,later they become the leader of the family who is a very good girl in a way that allows her to get
1,they do have a lot of fun but there 's nothing to really add much to the story either,they 're all that they have just a few moments and just happen to have the same effect
1,then there 's the guy who is one of the most interesting things to be,then again that 's why you 'll have a good time watching this movie
1,this movie was like a home movie,this is a very good horror movie
1,debbie rochon was excellent in her role as the,debbie rochon is good as the bad witch
1,if you are looking for something a little different and interesting than you might actually enjoy this one,if you do n't care for the fact that the film makes you feel like you 're watching the
1,certainly the best movie of the bunch is a very funny satire with a good,certainly a mustsee for the whole family with a very strong sense of humor
1,for the most part though the action is somewhat dated,for those interested in the series watch this episode of the
1,just like the other comments this is quite simply my alltime favorite movie,just like most of our movies this is one of the best
1,the movie itself is a mess of a film and it 's not even the,the only good thing about this film is that the ending is so predictable
1,the movie is a comedy but it 's just so funny i ca n't believe it,the first was a bit of an accident as well the film was so bad
1,no matter how long they tried to save the world of the antichrist and the world we were told by the communists that they were a real threat and then we would just have to make the movie,no character is spared here in this film no other character or even a real person in the cast except for a very minor character whom i felt as if that was written at least in the case of
1,the film begins with a long prologue which is not a mystery about the relationship between a father and son,the script is very clever but the acting is so bad it has to be seen to be believed
1,but this time a lot is not in my opinion a good movie,but if you can ignore the fact that the story is just the same
1,the main story is not all that great,the director of a film called el la iglesia
1,at the end when the police detective is revealed he has a little too far out,at least it 's not the typical suspects and a little too easy to follow
1,i have watched it numerous times and i still do n't care anymore,i had not seen anything else in this movie until i recently rented it
1,i have not liked it since my childhood was n't,i was surprised at the quality of this movie
1,the cast has very strong names,the film does not have a coherent
1,unlike the first part i thought the plot would be,unlike a little more in the latter two films
1,a few months later it 's a movie set as a mystery about what happened in the beginning and a couple,a man named mine who is in the army with this movie is a very good idea for the genre
1,it was funny and the acting was great,it is a very long film with a lot
1,i ca n't believe the rating that this was a waste of talent,i was n't able to see it but it was still entertaining i guess
1,anna sten was a great actress i thought she looked good she could 've done better she,anna christie as a writer and singer is the perfect compliment to the film 's success
1,instead they have no idea of how the film takes,instead the viewer finds the characters and so forth
1,but for those who can stand a movie,but this would be a good one
1,it 's all so well done and so easy to watch,it is a story of two sisters who love their relationship
1,not to mention that this film was made and released by a young audience,not sure if a little bit of the fault of the two heroines is in
1,in the book she was a young girl with a daughter 's body and mother,in fact he makes a lot of fun but is unable to resist the temptation for
1,the main idea of the film was how not to make a film about this story,the story begins as a series of flashbacks from the book of events as the movie opens
1,the whole premise of the movie is,the whole movie was pretty boring
1,a couple of hours later you 're going to be wondering what,a good story a good cast and a very good script
1,throw the blood of a man who has an,throw a bag of popcorn on the table
1,there 's a scene in which a young man is stabbed on,there are plenty of scenes that just do n't work out
1,this movie was a bit too good for me to recommend it if,this is the first time she is ever known for the film
1,i'm sorry to watch a horror flick,i'm a fan of this movie
1,there 's so much confusion that i have never had the slightest hint of seeing it again,there 's no suspense no tension it just seems like they could n't even come up with more
1,the film follows a young boy who lives in a large mansion near new york to live a life on the streets where he lives in his home in england in his country,the film begins with a guy getting an automatic bullet that turns out to hit her and is startled to discover that a couple of months are left to go after her
1,this movie was just a bad bad,this is a pretty good movie
1,it is a bit of a stretch but a good thriller with solid characters and,it is the most beautiful piece of art i 've seen on the screen
1,already the only positive part of all is the fact that it is n't as good as the book,already i ca n't recall much more about it but i am still stunned by how bad it really is
1,the film has a lot of potential it is in fact a,the movie is not only funny but the acting is superb
1,my favorite scene was when a car wrecks on the beach runway,my only problem is that they were not all in the family 's
1,the acting is good and the script is a joke but that is the problem i have with movies like this,the only thing that bothered me about the movie was its attempt to tell what was the worst movie in the movie
1,this is an enjoyable film that deserves to be seen by,this was probably the most interesting part of the film
1,when i first heard the word of the film and i heard,when the movie comes out the movie is not very good
1,because they 're a lot different then the other,because of the way he portrayed it was also very
1,christopher lambert is a wonderful comedic talent he 's the master and the film is n't bad,christopher walken is the best actor in the movie but it 's hard to blame him for his
1,this is a movie about the holocaust and the fall from the,this movie is n't worth your time and money and money
1,the acting was ok the cinematography was decent but not enough to justify,the story itself is quite simple and the story of a boy and mouse
1,lindsay lohan and michael ironside are the only real,lindsay lohan and matthew mcconaughey do excellent work
1,this is not an entirely bad film it is n't very good but is still a very enjoyable film,this show is about the life of a boy of the past and the man who killed the family
1,just as they try to be a little more serious i know they 're too,just to give up on all of those things it will probably confuse people
1,indeed it seems like a lot of fun and a little bit of nudity and a lot of good stuff but this is not a movie that will leave you wondering who,indeed you do n't need to think about what happens to the characters but it 's just a story that makes you think and a truly great experience for a movie
1,i think this was meant to be a very funny movie but it is not,i have not read any of these books and i am surprised by how much of
1,i just wanted to see a movie and got into the theater where i thought it was a great movie but i,i have seen it three times and each many of each time it makes me laugh every time they show it
1,as a matter of fact it was a bit of a copout to see,as a longtime fan of the book i will be a bit biased
1,otherwise the rest of the movie is a mishmash of boring action and,otherwise this movie has all the elements that a film should have
1,but i could n't stop watching the movie,but that 's about all that is wrong with
1,while i do not remember the language there is much more to the movie than just another movie in a while,while the plot of the original novel is not only good for the book it is the best that could 've been
1,i am not a big fan of either of these movies,i ca n't stand that there are more than one line
1,it 's a shame that they still had some talent,it 's all so incredibly lame the characters are awful
1,kevin spacey looks like a bad boy,kevin spacey plays michael sullivan a cocky man
1,one of the best of all the marx brothers,one can see why it did n't take a lot
1,the film 's premise is the one of which he is sent to a prison to protect his family,the whole family is a bunch of people who have their heads together and a group of people who try
1,as a final note i was left asking why it got so much better towards the end,as the movie went on i thought it was very interesting because of all the actors
1,they did n't even mention the story,they are both the most interesting and of
1,aside from that it was n't the best performance ever but it does work,aside from the very attractive and gorgeous joan crawford playing the most ardent wife you
1,making this movie even more interesting as it is a movie of one,making a lot of sense but the script is n't much better
1,soon after a brief encounter in the city with a small group of soldiers,soon a friend of mine gets the chance to buy it and i was impressed
1,if anything the only reason i wanted to see this is because it seemed so promising,if you can watch the film closely for what it is i would probably not be surprised
1,here was a great cast of a movie which was very entertaining but also has a plot that 's really the,here she is given a chance to become a famous actress and is also quite likable in her role here
1,he was also a huge success and a real talent to the role,he is not just one or the other people who have to be a
1,some people have commented about the story and characters are so stupid that,some of them look good and they have a lot of fun
1,robert duvall is a great actor and i have to say though i'm sorry to,robert englund 's character is so likable that you just want to hug him
1,it 's not a great film it just does,it 's very easy to see why anyone would want
1,i was expecting a lot more from this movie it was a waste of time and money,i 've always seen the new series which is not always one of these days where i can
1,nevertheless it is a good movie a good story to be told if you do it is a movie that makes it hard,nevertheless the film has an impressive story line it is a very interesting film with plenty of surprises and an occasional conclusion
1,could n't wait to watch this film for some reason,could it be a movie about a killer snowman that causes
1,however the acting was very good and i could n't find,however this film was made with a lot of potential
1,do n't bother with this film,do n't let my younger sister think
1,and that 's what i expected it to be a very entertaining movie but there 's,and for the record i could not stand up to the rest of the film
1,for a very good reason it should be the highest production of,for instance the final scene in the bar with the dog
1,and he 's in bed the whole time,and the music is a complete mess and as
1,he 's the only character who is a real jerk,he is a great actor who is n't really the best
1,all three stories are just a complete waste of time and a waste of time,all in all i do n't mind the fact that the movie was filmed in a
1,but in this film she is the perfect man,but the story line makes this movie boring
1,the story is simple and simple for its time,the story is very simple and there 's also a
1,it is difficult to say a movie for you but you just feel yourself and want to be entertained,it 's hard to take out any details that have come across so successfully that the movie ends as something
1,however if there 's an attempt at trying to be funny there 's a lot of gratuitous gore effects such as the gore scenes and the occasional violence,however as we all know the story of a man who had a dream for his own and the two brothers who are the first to know who he
1,no wonder this movie was made with my mind and no one else could,no real suspense no suspense a story a very boring plot just a bunch of
1,i saw this movie at a press screening on a big screen,i thought this movie was quite good for a young man
1,but what was up with that,but it is a good movie that
1,i do agree with another poster about this film that i have heard and seen in my original reviews of the,i am so disgusted to own a dvd of this movie on tv so i can give it a chance
1,this movie makes the film more interesting,this film could have been good
1,the plot is pretty much all predictable as usual and the characters are,the movie was very well done and kept my interest at all
1,we know it 's not going to be a good thing to be,we have some of the worst scenes in the history of cinema
1,he is so very talented and so good as a real jerk for,he plays his character with great intensity and a sense of humor
1,plenty of laughs a bunch of people and a girl who is an alcoholic,plenty of people with great imagination to see and learn their own shortcomings in life
1,watching her in the end i found the movie was somewhat interesting,watching this movie i felt that i was not going to be surprised
1,it 's an interesting movie with a couple of laughs and it is not that bad,it 's very easy to find an audience in the horror world that is so much fun
1,for those who are looking for something in the world of the,for me there was n't a single scene worth my time
1,i think this is a good film for everyone who thinks the movie,i did enjoy this movie and i did it on the dvd
1,the only redeeming quality of this movie is the,the acting is bad the plot is ridiculous
1,so what if the producers thought to make up for,so what was this movie supposed to be about
1,some of the characters are so real and you could feel the sadness of their lives,some of the scenes seem awkward but are done with a subtlety and some very good performances
1,and for an independent movie it 's not,and it 's an example of the quality of
1,every episode seems to consist of a group of people who ca n't be taken,every single joke in this film is so lame that it was n't funny
1,tingle has to come close and say that it is a great movie and the best of the bunch,tingle 's film is not the least bit of an achievement i will say but i doubt it will be
1,the movie 's climax is also a little overdone and some of the plot just is n't enough to save a little rushed exposition which,the movie 's premise to go for a big name is actually really good and is very interesting in the context of the movie
1,her character development has a great deal of humor and she delivers a great supporting performance,her father was a very gifted child and i was n't surprised by her mother
1,they are both as good as the one with their heads,they are not so bad they are just as bad as they
1,one night he meets a stranger girl whom her parents have,one of the most memorable films i have ever seen
1,there was no plot to be found in the film,there 's the usual plot devices and the characters are n't
1,he then proceeds to steal from a bank robber who is a suspect at the hands of his uncle,he is not a bad guy in the first half so he never makes up a character to go out
1,plot summary of the first movie and it 's a wonderful,plot and acting are excellent but it 's a shame
1,this one is about a young woman named krishna and her mother who is in a different country,this is not a film that should n't have been made but if the plot of the movie was
1,oh and do n't get me wrong i loved the original series,oh and by those who did n't get to read the story
1,although the story is rather simple and the characters are very interesting there 's really,although she has a bit of the movie she does n't have that much
1,in the first few years of being a teenager she has to get pregnant with her son and is trying to save,in fact the main focus was a lot more fun to make a film about the life of the human spirit
1,the plot is simple the characters are,the film is quite well made
1,just like the other two movies of which i saw in my mind the whole thing is like a cheap video camera but not all,just because it was a sequel to an episode that was made in the 80s was pretty much a ripoff of the first one
1,i had no sympathy to this show,i think that this is supposed to be
1,but this is an excellent movie,but you never really know who will
1,rated pg for graphic violence and sexual content,rated r for nudity violence strong language music excellent
1,it would seem that when the film was originally released in a very small town,it was an excellent movie about one of its central characters and it has its moments
1,this is one of the most interesting and enjoyable documentaries to watch,this time it 's not only that there 's no reason for that
1,now he has to come to life with her and her life in a strange way,now i know this story is about the adventures of a child prodigy in his own right
1,still there is no denying that if the film is really about,still this movie is one of the best of the decade
1,the whole story is the one that keeps the story moving and there is a scene where a guy who plays,the first time i saw the movie was in the theatre and i thought that the title should be called
1,alonzo and his cronies are in a position,alonzo and the stranger are in a great shape
1,but the acting by everyone involved are simply good and i ca n't help but,but this is a movie that could easily have been a much better movie
1,i was also surprised by the fact that i was a woman in a cinema film when it appeared in the,i did n't watch this movie with my wife and the girl who said that i had never seen it
1,one of the most hilarious films i ever saw,one more thing it does n't matter to this reviewer
1,ok i'm a huge fan of the series,ok so the movie was very entertaining
1,chanwook d has not been quite a success but in reality he is,chanwook park has an uncanny look at the world of horror films
1,but it does n't really have any kind of message,but this film does not really have a good story line
1,the whole concept of this film was completely lost to me,the first half of the movie are quite predictable and the story
1,current movie makers include a few funny parts and a bit of slapstick and it 's the best,current 's work for this one is the work of a genius who knows how to get a good
1,director brian yuzna had his eye for this,director robert englund has a cameo in this movie
1,i am still wondering if he 's trying to get any further from me because he 's just another man to be in my opinion that this film will,i have never seen such a great movie that the director and director have made me feel like i can only hope that he never got another chance
1,unfortunately the film has no substance,unfortunately this was just another way to
1,and what a wonderful surprise and a great job,and i would like to point out that the film
1,i 've heard a lot of the negative comments here and found it interesting to say i was surprised to see what i,i had to give this film a 1 and a half for being one of the most painful i 've ever seen
1,ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha and his wife,ha ha ha a very funny and very very funny show
1,the film is about an american woman accused of becoming a man and that of a native girl,the only thing i can say was that my mum was going out to a movie festival for me
1,kevin costner is the first and still star,kevin kline is as good as ever
1,much of the story is based upon an incident,much of the movie consists of three actors doing their
1,for me it is n't a film that is either very slow or boring as a serious thriller and it 's more like a psychological drama,for those of you who like to think the show is a bit more sophisticated in the first half of the movie it is worth mentioning and
1,for a film that does n't have anything to do with the actual plot it 's more interesting than a lot of the other ones in the series,for example the film begins as a group of young boys sit in a cave listening to their car in the background while the first two inches in the
1,sean penn is an old lady whose name was not quite good and the film,sean penn plays his father as if they are a man he 's in
1,and it was n't so bad,and i have not been able to
1,caught it on dvd it was on my laptop,caught my eye for a while in the first five
1,obviously this is an exercise in what happened to a child who is just the way,obviously she was just a little too long and the ending was n't really a good one
1,having seen the previous comments i know what i am saying i 'll tell you that i 'd never seen,having watched the series and the subsequent tv series of episodes i was very excited to see this movie
1,according to a previous poster i was n't sure to write an accurate review but it is a good story of people who just seem to be a bunch,according to most imdb users you know i 've seen a couple of movies of this type and i 've always been a big fan of the genre
1,the story itself is very good and the acting performances are excellent and all the supporting cast is excellent,the ending is very anticlimatic and i do n't think he will ever get to the end of the movie
1,no other way around with this movie,no one can replace him or he 's
1,the movie is a great tribute to both of us that we see today and the other is the best movie in the movie,the director is able to bring us the typical suspects that are the first few of the films that made it 's more memorable and
1,cho 's acting as the father seems to be too passive in,cho is a man who does n't know anything about him
1,i love how it is n't a movie but rather a documentary,i was able to see this movie at the sundance film festival and
1,i was so angry when i saw this movie when i was in the theater,i was surprised that this movie could n't even be made as an insult to the
1,with the exception of his character and a character that you can understand is the real thing that he,with these two movies of this type they should have been given much more credit to the genre
1,that is why i would advise the creators,that 's right the film was good
1,to make the film even more complex it should be shown as a serious piece of,to my dismay he has n't been the easiest elf to make such a film
1,in all it 's been a long time ago i have just seen it on hbo,in one time and the people who live in the same hotel will have a great feeling
1,sped up is a film that never really made me laugh a great deal,sped on a shoestring budget to add a bit more atmosphere to the overall plot
1,the director was the writer and the producer did not know what a movie,the first half of this film is one of the first of the series
1,simon has his usual and pivotal role,simon was in the right place
1,this is definitely one for the great movie buff i will watch,this film is not worth seeing for the performance of it as much
1,either way this has to be the worst,either way the movie is really great
1,the movie starts with a bang which is actually about a woman who has just returned to her husband for reasons of her,the only thing to do with me for one thing that the movie is missing is the way this movie was made
1,richard widmark 's acting as a detective with a great deal of charisma was good,richard gere stars as the police inspector who tries too hard to get him
1,chucky is n't one of those who really had a thing for him,chucky returns home a little girl named sosuke 's boyfriend a new man and
1,the ending is great as well,the main reason for this movie is
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and should get the recognition it deserves for it 's title,the only good thing is that the film is very boring and lacks any real sense of depth
1,steiger 's performance was pretty impressive and,steiger 's character is very believable
1,i saw this for the first time when i was about 7 or 8 years old in,i was n't even aware of the real world and the characters i wanted to watch
1,the characters of the movie are not real,the story is interesting and there are some really
1,what does they have to say,what a great way to spend a
1,in fact the film is n't a great idea or a funny one as a whole just plain fun as it 's just too silly or too boring,in a way the script is very bad and there are so many problems i have with the film too much of the story is boring and contrived
1,their lives become one sided and the next we see each other when their relationship grows apart between them each in,their character is more developed at all and in the process of their own actions they get a new job
1,if this was a comedy then i would definitely go see it,if you are into a horror film you will love this
1,note in his review a lot of,note it 's all very good
1,the story has been done for some time and it 's not a particularly compelling story,the first film i can find in the movie is that it does n't get much more
1,i had heard about this film and could not believe it,i 've seen several other movies where this movie has no redeeming
1,but that being the case here 's how the film fails to attract any sense to,but this movie is so bad that i was laughing at the lack of substance
1,the plot is a little thin and the story itself was a little predictable,the story is a bit farfetched with the main exception of having its predecessor in
1,purple rose is an awful horror film that is a,purple ace is another film by a novice director
1,maybe the best of all the movie,maybe it was n't the case
1,was it really necessary to be a fan of these,was it a joke to boot of any movie
1,on the other hand if you do n't know about this film you might get a bit more sense,on the other hand the movie could have been interesting if it turned out to be a good mystery movie
1,none of these films have any substance,none of this happens any less
1,this is a film to watch,this film was a complete waste of
1,roland a veteran of the group of people who have to do the repairs are a bunch of losers to get in,roland and behold the film is just another excuse for a film that has a cult following that is so funny
1,i do n't know if the producers were trying to make the movie but as a,i do n't think that the characters or the story were believable in this movie
1,i was not convinced that it would be as simple as it was,i do n't know what 's worse the apologise for this movie
1,thanks to all concerned of the movie i have to say that this is an excellent film for a rainy day,thanks to it and the story that unfolds a lot but that is really what makes this episode a classic
1,i am a fan of this series and i am very pleased with the way it deals with issues of the holocaust,i have to admit they are not at all a good idea not to have a film that is just bad
1,if you have nothing to do and you get bored with it 's a complete waste of time,if you really like to read a book on the back read it if you know nothing about it
1,spoilers after i read i could write a negative review,spoilers that 's how you can get a job of being
1,i was also amazed how much this film had to go down in the series,i was in the theater watching this and my eyes were on it to see that
1,like so many people said the film is so slow that at the same time i find the movie very,like a lot of the other commentators have said that the movie is a complete mess of a film
1,alex who has been the best of friends is a great and believable character,alex in a small part as the villain is a revelation which is the key
1,a lot of his life is gone,a must watch for those who are n't
1,i think the whole film just is n't good,i 've seen most of my old shows
1,zombies were the most annoying things i have ever seen in a movie,zombies that are so bad they 're good to watch but you can only
1,this is the best comedy i have ever watched,this movie is about nothing but a bad movie with
1,there 's a lot of violence going on with a lot of,there are other movies that have a good mix of them
1,the film begins in a very peaceful setting of the war,the acting is great and the cast all perform together
1,even my friend had the pleasure of seeing this film,even though she is the only person you 'll ever notice
1,werdegast and her men are a great film and it does not take a genius for him to develop it,werdegast has to be one of the most underrated actors working for this film and he does not disappoint
1,half the film is a compilation of bad actors who have no real talent,half of the movie takes place in a time warp setting in the woods and
1,indeed i was quite excited when it said it was n't,indeed the story is a very interesting one which makes me cry
1,still this makes the show very enjoyable,still the film is n't a total disaster
1,but i can still feel my frustration of being the way the film has been done,but if you 're not familiar with the original movie i think you should see this movie
1,the movie is a good family movie and the acting is superb,the acting is excellent especially by the young actor as a character
1,do n't go see this movie,do n't let this put you off
1,the story line is great for what i think it,the plot is about a girl who gets married
1,one wonders if the director had to put a whole bunch of friends on a,one would n't be watching if he was not so smart in that role
1,really the film has a wonderful cast and a wonderful cast,really bad film and not worth the time it takes to waste
1,but the film 's overall intentions and actions,but the plot is n't that interesting
1,i have watched it several times and i have no reason why i was so excited to see this movie,i would have rated it a zero if i had n't read the book that is why the title of the
1,be warned it 's just a little,be warned if only a few
1,it was also a pretty good movie but it was too hard to get the point across,it was an odd and thoughtprovoking film and it did n't make it any more fun at the
1,that 's what the first two sequels were about,that 's what this movie is just about
1,but you know where a movie is over,but that is just a minor problem
1,on a personal note this was a pretty funny movie,on the other hand i would like to point out a
1,as it stands this film is very very long and boring,as i said before i was very impressed with how the movie
1,its one of the best and it is an amazing film,its not a total flop but it 's worth the money
1,the music is beautiful and the visuals are gorgeous,the actors are excellent and the cast members are great
1,the only redeeming feature of the whole film was when the camera crew was on the bus,the characters are so interesting that you 'll just feel the pain and care that 's being on
1,when he gets the credit he decides to play the same role as the real life sweetheart who plays the,when the movie is revealed there are people in the world who are not going to like this film
1,oddly enough the film has a good story line it 's,oddly enough this movie was so bad it was laughable
1,recap a film called northfork starring the great edna rose and the man who knew a little in the first film,recap in my opinion if you have n't seen the show you 're missing out on something that is not really much
1,i think the problem lies with the film,i was expecting something more a rather dull and
1,jack and his friends have become the worst one and it was just that the film was not very funny and the script was not quite so,jack 's wife has a boyfriend who is cheating on his wife whom has taken to the child 's daughter whom she is not aware of
1,others were very much like the real life,others have criticized the actors in these roles in
1,basically the same thing happened in the movie,basically this film is not for the squeamish but
1,a very good movie about the evils of the people,a film for a lot of people but i do n't
1,a few weeks earlier i thought the movie was a little too short,a few years later she has become one of the cutest women of all
1,when this movie was released there was a lot at all cost to get into,when a movie tries to make a movie about a true story it does n't have
1,fans of the original movie will like it,fans of the classic and '40s horror film the
1,in many ways the film is not the greatest horror,in the end it 's not even really funny
1,why did n't they just shoot it,why did n't she get her in the
1,you 'd be hard pressed to get past the bad dialogue but it,you have two great actors doing the same thing they are doing
1,professional and well photographed in black and white,professional actors were all cast and crew members who
1,and it just happens to be made,and the story has to be a mystery
1,even the first episode is so much easier not to get that kind of plot,even though it 's not as bad as most films i would say it was one
1,because of the fact that it is the most popular feature and,because the movie was not as great as the first film
1,the plot is a bit thin but the acting is not very good and the characters do n't really connect with each other either,the film is about a bunch of men who decide to rob a house in a remote cabin of the future when they get attacked
1,but that 's just enough to make me want to vomit,but you can still love the film it seems that they 're
1,his character is not as annoying but it seems that he is,his performance and the rest of the cast is also good
1,i did n't want to leave,i do n't know why the movie
1,there is a good scene where the mother and son are discussing,there 's no reason to be able to watch this movie
1,he should n't have bothered me for it,he is so out of place that i ca
1,fine film dealing with a bunch of young people who are not living in rural england,fine acting by some great actors who make a very believable story about a real event in
1,i thought the film should be viewed in the united states,i saw this movie yesterday i remember reading the novel on the
1,as i have been a fan of hers i have a feeling that he is one of,as a result of its own failure this film is still a classic piece of work
1,it was so sad and sad,it is so bad that i do
1,how about that i do n't know why i was never able to watch it but it would be the biggest,how can we get our hero to be a guy or when the hero 's death is in the book
1,little of the time this is what the producers are doing herethe same way,little did they know that with this man who had the possibility of seeing the
1,a movie that would have been released on,a great show for the whole family
1,besides the acting in this movie there is something not bad not even that bad,besides the fact that there are no special or many things that the film has going
1,the film was made in 2001 by the critics with,the movie is a complete bore of a movie
1,after watching it i can say that its the only reason this should be made,after that it was the best show of all time the best part of the tv
1,but the rest of the film is so bad,but this movie also is really a good example of
1,she has no personality with her eyes at all,she 's in a movie to be in the film
1,charles durning has never had enough screen presence on the set nor the character of the great dictator,charles durning plays a young and handsome man who takes refuge in the country during wwii in his early
1,the film has a very good story and some great action sequences,the only reason to watch this movie is that it makes you think
1,unfortunately the movie has a lot of problems,unfortunately the film does n't do it justice to
1,this is not a masterpiece for kids because it,this movie is a joke and a must
1,first off i saw the preview for this movie on imdb and it scared me,first it 's supposed to be a comedy that makes it so hard to swallow
1,hubie and pumbaa are good at their worst but they have no chemistry in any of,hubie was just not as funny as his later movies which i did not like
1,from that point on there 's nothing to spoil but the characters,from that point on i went to the cinema to see
1,mark hamill was a little more than,mark wahlberg as the lead character
1,at the same time it 's not so bad it 's good,at the end you will have to see the film to believe what
1,as for the acting well done by the director 's direction it really makes the film feel a little bit longer than that,as you would expect from a great film the main character is one of the coolest characters on the planet in the movie
1,his character is a complete wuss,his character is also a bit annoying
1,seeing the story of this movie the same way it was made to look like a,seeing this movie is not a waste of the time i paid for this garbage
1,its a little too long in its own right,its not a great film but a great action movie
1,does he do that he 's a man who can never,does anyone really understand why the movie should be called
1,where is one encouraging of the other,where is the story and story of the
1,brigitte is a very strong one as the woman who plays sebastian who is,brigitte nielsen is good as the heroine who comes to life with him
1,it 's about the only person who believes the truth in his life,it would be hard to imagine that the film 's creators would have given
1,gone do you like this movie,gone and see this film if you
1,do n't listen to the critics here on this movie,do you know if the writer was just aiming for a
1,camilla is so obviously a victim to her son,camilla 's character was a nice surprise too
1,he does a pretty good job showing a lot of the movie that he is in the middle of the movie,he is very talented and a little nervous but that makes him so powerful and so believable and so powerful
1,father and son are so blinded by their portrayals that you wonder whether they were in an old asylum or what he and his family are getting from,father and daughter do n't have the money to leave her with the other girls and to get a new one and leave their room in the family to
1,believing the only thing to be said is that she 's not so much as the lead actress,believing the film is made to cash into its success it has a strong atmosphere it is
1,those movies are n't bad in a lot of ways,those are not the days of this movie which would have
1,i would highly recommend this movie to anyone,i think the best thing for the film is
1,this movie could have been the worse movie i have seen but this,this was a very good movie with good directing and good acting
1,this movie is not worth seeing as a spoiler but it 's one of the best in my opinion,this is my first comment on imdb i thought this movie was very well thought out so i did n't
1,on one level he 's pretty much a little bit wooden with a bit of overacting in his head,on an adventure note that it has to do with some of the usual clichs it has for most people
1,i was a huge fan of a movie like this,i am very disappointed and glad this is only one of
1,why would this film be so much of an action film,why ca n't we get a whole lot of money
1,frankly i would suggest this for all time viewers,frankly we have our beloved and well done and very
1,i love this show but i really do not get this film,i do n't like that one but i can imagine why the writers
1,the plot is just about the same as that,the only real flaw is the plot which is probably
1,but this episode had no plot and just needed to make the point,but i can only assume that the writers and director did n't have to
1,dirty harry was a pretty good actor to look at and he looks the,dirty dancing is one of my favorite movie noir movies of the year
1,our story is n't really a bad one or the bad but the,our hero does n't know how to shoot and get into bed
1,the only reason the two movies are n't in is because of the quality of their films,the film is also a very good action movie that is not afraid to be a thriller
1,some really bad acting horrible music and bad editing,some scenes were too long and it was almost embarrassing
1,he 's not a funny guy,he has a vision and it 's
1,one can say that i do n't understand,one thing i thought had was that
1,many movies of this type in a way that it should have had a lot of the cast members in it,many people think this is the worst movie of 2008 it 's no worse than i expected it to be
1,definitely the greatest animated movie ever made,definitely the best film of the year and
1,that is n't the point here because the whole idea of the film was a bit,that 's when it comes in the movie but the movie is also very boring
1,he 's not as funny as the first one but the one thing that i did n't like,he is a fine actor for being a character that does what he can to avoid himself
1,when i saw the preview in the back of a box of cereal i looked good for that,when they meet in the first episode and then a few minutes of the movie are we are left
1,which brings me to this movie is really very different and the,which makes this a good film for fans of a classic
1,so the two begin to unravel that it 's,so in conclusion do not see this movie
1,my husband 's son is a film of my,my advice for all means is the movie
1,she is also quite beautiful with the exception of the actress portraying her,she 's got a lot of good things to do but she is really
1,later they find the house and the owner of his apartment,later i saw it on tv at a local screening
1,i think it 's one of the best of it 's kind and that makes sense,i would say that the first time i tried to watch it was that it was a
1,i 've heard that he was an independent actor and,i do n't have a clue what that means
1,i saw this film in a theater in san francisco,i think it is the reason i gave this movie a
1,too bad this film never gets the recognition it deserves,too bad i had to go to the cinema to see
1,sadly the film does not allow its director and his cast the script which goes on and on,sadly it turns out that the man has taken her out of the house for the last time and
1,this was the stupidest film i have ever seen,this is one of the most entertaining action movies i
1,naturally it 's not a horror movie and it takes all three of the scenes to make them,naturally they are the two and the girls have an insatiable affair with a very young woman
1,looking forward to the original release to see if you can,looking out this movie is a great example of why
1,not only was it supposed to be a comedy the characters were n't developed at all in the first place,not because i do n't like the way i was to get it i was bored but then i thought that
1,marion is a great artist and that 's exactly what they are,marion has some talent in her eyes and she brings us into her
1,most of the time people are talking to themselves in a,most people would be forgiven for trying to find it
1,aside from that the film has a very good soundtrack,aside from the fact the main character is the same man
1,and if it 's just that a,and it 's not just that
1,to call it that is the worst movie ever made,to say that it is not a good movie is probably
1,the only positive thing about this picture was that it was made by a,the movie itself is one of the most underrated movie experiences out there
1,from there on it is n't that hard to understand what the motivation,from there is n't a big problem that makes the movie interesting
1,some of the scenes are so bad it 's funny,some of them do n't have the same plot as in
1,the story of a young boy named seita is a young girl who gets a,the movie was n't a movie it was good it was just so bad
1,a very important thing to remember,a few of you may want to
1,it also features a couple of minor scenes and you have a recipe for,it was so boring that it made me laugh for the entire film
1,there was a lot of humor and the acting was alright,there are plenty of shots of that and a lot of the
1,robert deniro 's acting in the first episode was very believable in the series he was in it,robert de niro is a very talented actor and has a few good things to recommend it
1,it was not an oscar winner,it is a great show and that
1,all of the performances in this are a total disaster,all the characters are great with their own unique personality
1,the director of it 's own good story was,the acting was so bad it 's funny
1,the film had an odd atmosphere on a long and very unclear budget but there 's something that could give you a headache about,the movie is just awful in every way and there is n't even the good parts of the first film to begin with
1,well it was the best movie i have ever seen,well they do n't know how to be a movie
1,each character is an obnoxious stereotype who comes to life,each member of the cast seems very well planned
1,plus this is a great movie,plus i am not going to comment
1,after seeing the movie i do n't understand how all of these factors made me feel like,after this it was made on a low budget so that 's what the director wanted
1,a movie for people who like watching movies that are n't a waste of time,a young woman falls in love with a young girl named henderson who wants her mother
1,i did n't like the movie at all,i had hoped to watch some of them
1,todd pegg 's portrayal of the inspector is the reason for the film,todd does his best and he does a fantastic job of showing a lot
1,he is an actor and i think,he was a little more successful
1,here it comes a bit of a stretch to,here 's the spoiler it 's that bad
1,in my opinion the movie is very entertaining as the series goes on and on and on,in all it may have been the best of it all but it certainly was n't
1,the movie was just not very good it was n't,the director of this film should have been fired
1,i would suggest you just want to be entertained by a bit of a bad movie,i have to wonder why they put all of the crap out of those awful movies
1,id must disagree it 's all about the movie,id also liked the movie as well as the original
1,a woman who is not very interested,a bit dated for me though
1,the first scene and the last and the second and final one is a little confusing and the characters,the actors are all ok but the movie is n't as good as i thought it would be
1,good acting great script and just like that of a good director like,good acting a fine story and even a little of my liking
1,if you 're not a fan of the original i will give you a hint of how to live in,if you want to go and see a movie that will keep you guessing that it 's worth it
1,brains were n't the best of this kind but i do applaud anyone who,brains are always on display and it can be easy to forgive them
1,if i could have imagined this film the other reviewers would be,if i could give it a try i might not have
1,marsden has no qualms about what was going on,marsden and his men play with the same kinds of
1,the movie takes you into the lives of those,the story and acting is also very solid
1,he has just gotten some information on how the world has become a threat to society to the fullest and the world 's population is the only one,he does his best in his role as the main character and the film does a very good job of depicting the relationships of the two characters
1,if the filmmakers had to invest in a film like this,if they did n't make the movie they had it
1,he gets to the point where it is difficult to make a film with him but the way he gets involved with the main character is that the actors,he is a young man who loves to have an ego but ca n't seem to have any luck and his parents are too young to be gay
1,look at this movie like if it was n't a bad movie,look for the scene where it shows in the theater which means he
1,as a result i did watch it several times and was impressed and thrilled,as an avid fan of his earlier work i ca n't imagine any of the
1,still i could n't tell if anyone was,still it is not an action movie
1,the acting and script are very good,the first thing that i did n't expect
1,they have to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire,they had a nice idea of who they were and how they were making it
1,without the usual humor it 's all rather predictable,without much of a fight scenes the characters are very
1,for a movie about a killer and a black guy who 's a monster,for an example of the movie they were a bit of a disappointment
1,de palma makes a wonderful movie and the acting is excellent,de palma plays a very ambitious role in the movie that plays
1,in this case the movie is not as bad as i have,in his autobiography he takes it out of the way that the protagonist
1,jose ferrer is perfect as a cop,jose ferrer is absolutely stunning and even though
1,it is very good to see the same guy that has a good sense of humour but,it 's almost impossible to believe any of these films would ever have been released theatrically
1,no matter how dumb or pointless it is you may think that the film is really about a girl and her sister,no one has been a victim of either of his contemporaries and his daughter is n't nearly the one who has the same
1,too many cooks are being taken to a halt at a certain point in which the audience is left to wonder whether that is intentional or if the,too bad it never makes it to network office for anyone else and the director should be applauded for trying to keep his career on this one
1,instead of the usual formulaic and bland hollywood style the characters are often,instead of having a fight with another guy he 's a jerk
1,unusually there was some nice photography to look for but what else,unusually this was made in 1952 so when she was released in a
1,when he returns home in the city it 's the first time that he is given the task of getting a,when you think about it it 's just the same old same old same old same old enough to be
1,but it is a little slow to find a way to go through this movie,but this movie is one of my favorite things to be made in the early 80
1,many of the comments seem to suggest it was written in,many other films made the same mistake as this one
1,the plot was interesting and the acting was very good,the plot has a lot of holes and the acting is
1,the cast is perfect and the cast is great,the script is n't so bad that a lot of
1,i thought it was a wonderful movie,i saw that the same day i saw
1,most certainly did n't know exactly what to expect,most people have never been in a movie theater
1,there is an even more subtle ending and i have always liked the final confrontation with the little tramp,there is one thing about it that is interesting that this movie is a movie with a very limited budget
1,grace was very good but that 's only it,grace as a film that is so boring and unoriginal
1,otherwise not only did it feel like,otherwise what about the whole thing
1,hollow man is a film of a young woman who,hollow water is a terrible and poorly made effort
1,incidentally the film was n't a success,incidentally there is no real reason for that
1,they 're also so good in that it 's,they are the best people in the film
1,this is one of the best movies i have ever seen,this is a very poor attempt at making a movie
1,every time we hear a line of dialog i have a soft spot on the wall,every line is delivered so well that i almost forgot that the movie would end up being
1,he also wrote this story about his life through the depression of his life,he also finds himself transported into a world of trouble and life in a city
1,with some exceptions i have to say that i really wanted to like this movie a lot,with a cast of great actors who are willing to work and work with the audience and the
1,indeed the film is pretty funny but it 's also too bland to be enjoyable,indeed the film makes sense but is ultimately an insult to the intelligence of this film
1,the actors do very well in the film especially,the characters are just stupid and not real
1,you know you do n't have the time to finish the movie to get,you do n't have to be the right person to appreciate this film
1,it 's hard not to laugh out loud,it 's not that it 's not that funny
1,the first time was one of those movies where,the film is a bit of a mess
1,and when the end credits rolled up in the middle of it the whole thing was not going anywhere,and the fact that it is not really a horror film is a mystery to me by a young man
1,i do n't see how anyone could explain that i saw this as something more than a comedy which i liked it too,i love the show in my head it has no real storyline the acting is terrible and the story line is a bit too
1,but the worst of the film is,but that 's a minor quibble
1,i 've never heard of such poor writing so i have n't seen anything else on this one,i saw this movie at a theater in the summer of 1988 when i was in a class at
1,they 're a lot of fun to watch,they did the same with each scene of the
1,if you 're into this show that is not a bad thing if you want this series is to be,if you have n't seen this film i would highly recommend you avoid it as the worst movie ever
1,another problem in this movie was the way,another problem is the lack of logic
1,i'm not just saying that it was n't even remotely funny,i'm sorry if the actors could n't afford a good script for
1,and that is not to say that the acting is terrible the special effects are awful and the script is,and the whole movie was about as funny as a sack of beer and not funny or even exciting
1,but i still prefer the film in my mind it is a brilliant work of,but the movie has no atmosphere which is the point of it 's good
1,these are my thoughts that would make a fine,these guys are the best in the movie
1,missed a point of view about a film that could have been a little shorter,missed the point but the one thing that really annoyed me was the whole thing is
1,they should have been able to show the world where,they could make one movie after watching the other
1,weakness i did not know about this movie and i think it will appeal to anyone interested in the work of a little boy and the film has,weakness i ca n't believe the fact that he is not only in his last year 's eve a film that depicts his love with a woman
1,we can see it in a theater with a very limited budget the first time it 's over and it is still great,we do n't know who is responsible but the plot does n't go out of its way to develop the tension but the way
1,it 's just a bunch of clichs to make a film worth watching,it 's hard to get a movie that i could enjoy this as one
1,it is hard to believe that a film like this should be viewed by people like me that want to see this,it is a little hard to believe this is a real film and that in the end it was all done for that
1,ewan mcgregor does a great job as he is here but it 's still not enough for him,ewan heston is very good for the role as he is a good actor in this role
1,i have to mention one thing and a scene that has a very special effects,i just watched this again because i thought it was going to be a bad movie
1,the acting the script the actors the script the special effects all make sense to me as you have to be,the only difference between the two is that the film 's main problem is when the story is not a very good
1,its a movie that has no real redeeming qualities whatsoever,its a very dark movie but that 's it
1,the first half of the film is so funny that i found,the music is very very very good and i love it
1,and then there 's a bit of a twist ending but it does n't even work on the level of what,and in spite of his great performances the movie still manages to get some of my favorites and i think
1,those who do n't know it like the ones you 're looking for,those who do not like this film are really the ones we 've seen
1,so in the end this movie was a total waste of time unless one is a movie student,so if you were watching it on an old man then we were n't impressed or entertained
1,a very very enjoyable and very engaging piece of work that delivers a,a group of people who are being pursued by a mysterious killer
1,but it is a movie and a lot of fun,but it never does and it 's not just a bunch
1,a young girl in a suit,a movie about a man who thinks
1,the story is n't really as good as it could have been,the story is about a group of kids who are a bunch of
1,i did n't get to see it for yourself i found the film to be so,i love watching the movie as part of a movie that i could n't watch
1,the story is a bit slow and the dialog is awful,the first two of the best movies of this series have a
1,i have to admit i love to watch this show,i 've seen it countless times in one way
1,it 's a good mix of the two movies a few of the great comic timing but it 's not a,it 's hard to say if it is true or not to see any of the characters in the film
1,the whole thing is a mishmash of scenes from all involved with an unlikely plot to an interesting story,the film opens with a group of bikers in a van hall club where a group of men sit down
1,i was expecting much from this movie but it,i ca n't wait to buy the soundtrack
1,unlike the rest of the film the film is shot in,unlike the aforementioned american films the film fails in this
1,this may be the worst movie i have ever seen,this is a great example of how hollywood could get a
1,the story of two young men who are,the movie starts off with a bang
1,overall i'm a fan of movies but i 've already found some good entertainment,overall the film is very good but there are a few interesting moments that make
1,perhaps she can do the job she needs to put on a,perhaps the only time to get this point is the ending
1,you have to wonder if it 's not all,you get what you think is going on
1,neil shore was n't as good,neil labute is a master of genius
1,throughout the entire movie i was laughing hysterically when the movie was released,throughout the movie we are reminded of the real edith nin and the movie
1,director richard de la iglesia has the ability to make it more realistic and more effective in its approach,director james cameron who also helmed the original film with the exception of the classic horror movie of the same
1,the movie is pretty much a carbon copy of this film and it makes the movie a little too,the only other actor who could have made an otherwise decent performance was to make a good movie
1,they also get to show the real killer that the killer is n't afraid to and,they are both a good example for those who were trying to save the movie
1,americans are either a stereotype of people or the other members of their community,americans have their own rules that are never explained and that 's what this movie
1,although the film itself is not a masterpiece of the two horsemen it is certainly not a comedy,although the film was made during the early 70 's you can tell it 's not even a film
1,the movie also features one of the most interesting endings to a movie i have ever seen,the first part was n't that much better than the first but the ending really was very disappointing
1,the first one with the same character is the same and the characters are really good and the,the plot was simple and it could have easily gotten the better direction from the original cast
1,robert deniro is good as usual,robert deniro plays dr watson and is
1,unfortunately the film does have a lot of fun to it,unfortunately the acting ranges from a flat to a mediocre
1,but the plot does n't work for the rest of the,but the director of the first installment is an extra
1,you could almost hear that they were making,you have the best actress out there
1,i really wanted to like this movie because it could n't have been better,i am going to write that one of the worst films ever made
1,kudos to those who like this type of thing for a few,kudos for the director to do this work if it does
1,poor acting bad script bad dialogue bad story,poor acting is terrible in the first movie and
1,then they have a chance to be,then this one just falls apart
1,for a film that features a few plot holes you 'll have to watch it to find out,for anyone who is really interested in any of you i have n't read the book and seen this
1,also we do n't even know what to,also the acting is great the cinematography
1,everybody else is in their element for the entire,everybody seemed to go to the same movie
1,but that 's all it is,but if the characters were n't so
1,when i saw that the people in the movie were in it i was really looking forward to seeing that one,when he does n't get up with his father 's wife he 's arrested of his daughter and he becomes enraged with
1,the only problem the film has going for,the film has a very good pace
1,the story of this film revolves around a love triangle between the girls and the women,the movie starts with a bunch of teens trying to escape their father 's wedding
1,even though the film is not as good as the previous three films the movie still manages to keep,even the director 's own standards could n't get a film out of a collection of other movies
1,the film begins with two young men returning into the countryside to see an old man,the first and only thing that made the series so enjoyable was the final showdown
1,but then the film turns into a,but this is a great example
1,its a waste of talent but it makes you feel,its all there and it 's a great film
1,if you love a good old fashioned adventure flick the movie really should be a thrill to watch and it 's a shame,if the people in this movie were so stupid it should never have happened and i do n't think they could be a better
1,i do not know where to start this review also made me think that it is a good film,i think that the producers are trying to convey something that has been done before and since this is the
1,little richard lynch is one of the funniest directors of all times,little did she know she is one of the most beautiful people ever
1,you will never find a movie that has this one that i would recommend,you can see the movie 's going back and forth between the two but it
1,i do n't want to see a single person who likes watching this film,i had just watched a few scenes of this film recently and it has been
1,the story is really interesting and the performances are good too,the movie is based on an actual events of the first movie
1,in conclusion the movie is pretty bad but it is very good to be,in conclusion the movie is n't really worth seeing in its own right
1,the characters are believable in their roles as they are introduced to a few of the other actors,the movie is about a killer who is trying to kill everyone in his life and is killed but
1,it 's just bad bad and boring,it would appear that the scriptwriters had tried
1,i had a good time watching it,i 've got to tell you
1,i 've never heard of this movie until i saw it as a very funny film,i have seen this film several times and will always be able to appreciate it
1,the plot itself is pretty basic,the whole thing was about the only
1,with that and many things you might do a better movie and it is one that the,with these two actors they had to be in it and then make a better appearance
1,i had heard so many of the reviews on this movie,i thought it 'd have helped to make a statement on the
1,i thought my son could enjoy this movie because of his strong portrayal of a mentally handicapped man,i do n't know what to say about it except for the fact that most of the comments here
1,i have never seen an entire film that i can honestly feel for me,i do n't know if the movie is supposed to be funny but it 's
1,yep what 's with the killing scene,yep he has nothing against it
1,and the movie was really funny,and that 's what i expected the
1,bunuel also has that opportunity to give away that in spite,bunuel does it again and again is a brilliant film
1,the story is simple though a man who is still trapped in the dark side of his former life who does not seem to know,the acting is terrible the script is bad and the acting is so poor that it makes up for the lack of acting talent
1,among all this film is a very good one which has its charms and i will say it,among the other actors that were n't as good as the ones who were cast as the actors the
1,i do n't care if they were trying to convince me,i thought i 'd give up after about ten years
1,only to have a bunch of women who do have a good laugh,only the film could get the best picture oscar of a great story
1,why is it necessary to say the least the story and plot is a,why should anyone else think that a good movie is a bad movie
1,by the end of it we are left to assume that this could,by the time the film reaches the climax is a bit abrupt
1,even the acting was horrible and the story of this show is simply boring,even the scene where they cut the boat from my mind was pretty weak
1,not only is this a very entertaining film it succeeds to entertain,not only is he so good it 's not even funny
1,practically the same movie i enjoyed as a child,practically all the people who made this movie who have
1,i think it 's a pretty good movie though it was n't,i am sorry but this film fails in its own way
1,harold lloyd is very good as the villain,harold lloyd 's performance was excellent and the film
1,i could have done it for the sake of an american audience that is in their youth,i could not help noticing that this is a comedy so why would the filmmakers take the lead
1,it is as though the writer did n't,it is n't the best of all
1,meiko kaji looks a little like a typical young woman,meiko kaji is also great and is the best asset in
1,for an example of how this movie fails miserably and the characters are all boring the acting is terrible the dialogue is awful the script is poor,for a first time director john ford who produced the film 'the merchant ' is a wonderful story about an ambitious cad with a tremendous heart
1,part two is about as exciting as watching paint dry,part 2 is one of that classic film that i saw
1,yes this movie could do well for me,yes it 's like it will probably be alright
1,although the premise of the film is so simple it 's not funny,although the film is dated and the action is slow there is nothing wrong
1,rent it or do n't expect much,rent this dvd instead because it 'll ruin
1,their relationship with the other characters is palpable but the film really falls apart,their relationship was believable and it could easily have been an interesting plot
1,hollywood has never known what to expect but i,hollywood should make a better movie than this
1,if you have seen this on the shelf then i 'll be sure to be disappointed,if you want to know who the story is and the ending you have never read and
1,he is also a bit over the top but,he has to do this to protect himself
1,one of my favorite shows in my childhood,one of my favorite parts when the young daughter
1,billy crudup is wonderful as the stoic and grizzled psychiatrist,billy crystal has a lot of screen time but he does
1,unfortunately the film is still an experience that will be the inspiration for,unfortunately it 's all over the map and the movie fails miserably
1,then the movie ends and we 've seen the same girl over and over again,then the movie switches gears from the point where you feel that the story is about
1,overall i give this film 1 star,overall i 'd recommend this movie
1,he is also an actor who has not been in a movie since his death in which,he seems almost perfect in what he does in spite of the circumstances of his life
1,bob newhart is a good actor,bob 's portrayal as the main character
1,the story of a young woman whose father does n't seem to have sex with his wife,the main point in the story is that the film is shot on the big screen
1,but what i loved was its amazing and funny moments i liked the characters,but it 's a pity it is not so much better than the first movie
1,i thought that maybe they should have done a little less research and they have,i had never heard of the original bambi so i figured to myself that
1,the only redeeming character in the movie is the main villain and the girl who was a pretty good fighter and has a nice time,the film is quite short with lots of scenes which make me jump out of the movie theater 's vomit of all things the size of
1,but when you consider this film to be one of the worst movies,but the real thing i did about is the movie 's plot
1,the main characters are very interesting and the plot lines are very believable,the movie also deals with a very strange subject matter with a few characters
1,the acting is pretty good and it is,the music and the score are beautiful
1,courting a very wealthy woman in the process who is a former member of the team,courting her father who has a boyfriend is a perfect pianist and he is given the chance
1,that 's why i think it 's a good film,that 's not all i have n't read and never really
1,hey i was n't going to give up,hey i'm gonna give a little to the movie
1,spoof in the form of a great performance by,spoof 's a good match for a movie
1,its a pretty well produced film,its not bad but the acting is
1,hence this would also be one of the best animated shows ever,hence that 's the point here in which this movie is going
1,the story is about a guy who gets kidnapped by,the movie is not even bad in my book
1,there 's a lot of stuff for the first hour or so,there were a couple of moments in this movie that were actually funny
1,my advice you should see this movie if only for that to work in a video store,my friends and we all know the film 's original name is n't even mentioned in the film
1,yes it 's the one with some real people and it 's a,yes it was like a home movie but you get the point
1,the characters are very well developed but the film itself was quite entertaining,the movie begins with the first a suicide that happens to the child
1,it was an okay movie but i did think,it is a shame because of this film
1,seagal 's film debut is the worst of,seagal is excellent as the lead villain
1,i'm giving it a 3 and i did n't really care how good it was,i'm glad the actors were good actors and the acting all around and all i got
1,finally i found the original version of this movie to,finally there is another good scene in this movie
1,even though it has been in the last few years a very weak story about the assassination and the very sordid side of human nature and the life of the young victoria 's mother who is a bit much,even though the plot is n't great and it 's all the more interesting in the final analysis as the plot twists come into the story of one of the most important characters in the history of horror
1,one of the best movies ever made,one of those films that you just could
1,great cast and a nice little action movie is just great fun to watch,great actors great story good actors all around this is a very moving movie
1,but there is also not enough of a script or a story that i will not spoil here,but the movie still manages to keep the action going throughout the entire length of the film
1,connors has been a good actor as the president since the movie derailed with the character,connors plays his father who is a former man with his wife and his wife
1,is that all the bad acting the movie has going for me,is he going in a lot of time but it seems a little
1,for anyone who does n't care about the music and culture is a,for instance i was bored for the first time on the dvd
1,the acting in this movie was pretty good,the first time you saw them were all there
1,the story takes a few twists to begin and ends with it 's,the film is shot entirely in the dark light and is shot
1,well i guess they just did n't care about any of the,well you ca n't tell me what the director was thinking
1,oh the movie is the best of course and there is a reason to dislike this film it 's not,oh dear if you are n't a fan of all of the dead ringer i 'll have to wait
1,in the movie he plays a very very straight straight,in my opinion i 'd rather watch it again
1,the movie was n't bad at the start of the first movie and i was really hoping the movie would improve some of,the story is about a woman who works in a brothel in italy in france and is married to a younger man
1,what the hell was it all about,what the heck are these kids thinking
1,but this film is n't bad it 's not,but the movie is just too dull too
1,then when the main character starts conversing with her mother 's son and her son her friend becomes pregnant because she 's a very human and not a real person,then a guy called caleb decides to rob a bank in the desert when he is in a helicopter and the whole army is trying to escape the earth
1,son was also an excellent character,son of a child is a film
1,i think the director of this film did n't like the book,i was looking forward to seeing this film because it has a strong
1,also if the actors could n't be playing an actor i think the actress should be more than a little more interested in the script than the acting,also you can tell from the beginning that there are some of us that we are n't supposed to be happy when a girl gets a kick in the
1,a couple of friends were left wondering at the end because of the lack of,a few years later we saw the same movie and the acting was excellent
1,at times that makes you think about the way the life of the characters,at that point the plot develops a sense that the viewer would care
1,it is not a bad movie because i did n't,it was the best movie i have ever seen
1,the script by richard jordan was n't great either but the actors were,the film 's biggest problem is its title which is very misleading
1,it does n't look much more interesting in a good way,it 's the most powerful film i have ever seen
1,how did he manage to keep the show,how many movies do we have to do
1,the film does n't have the usual plot devices as a comedy but rather a drama,the main reason this movie works is because it 's a movie that you want to watch
1,they also did an excellent job,they are at the top of their
1,i ca n't believe that the director actually wanted to,i am surprised that this was released on video
1,its very hard for me to accept the story as an,its a movie that will not be appreciated for you
1,poorly photographed and filmed badly executed,poorly written poorly staged badly staged
1,i saw the unrated version and thought it,i have n't seen the last movie
1,it has all the clichs to be a funny comedy and an interesting one at,it is about the lives that made it so successful a very young woman
1,the acting is bad even with the acting it 's laughable the movie is boring,the script is quite slow and boring the acting is poor it is n't even bad
1,i do n't think there would have been much more to distinguish the story,i 've never seen the tv show that had been made so well by the
1,yes i like this movie as much as i am,yes i have seen this movie so many times before it
1,david lynch has done so much better in my career and this is the first to ever come close,david boreanaz is one of my favorite actors as he plays a good guy and is just a very good
1,too bad i have n't seen him on the small screen since,too bad it 's never really got a chance to satirize
1,perhaps the worst is the script,perhaps you should know that when your
1,one could only wish that some movies like the last house,one might even have to be in the film industry
1,in conclusion i would advise people with that,in fact the movie would be better if you
1,the plot is simple the acting was bad the effects,the acting is so bad as to be unwatchable
1,although the movie tries to be humorous and fails miserably it was just plain stupid,although we know who the movie is and why it was made in the first place
1,in fact i do n't know why i have n't seen it for about ten,in this way she 's just as good and she as the other girl
1,quiet and very real very funny,quiet down the road the movie opens
1,to get you to believe that in the end the director was going to turn into a movie without the audience,to be honest i do think this is my favorite of the films as i 've already seen this on a lark
1,i 've seen better acting in a kindergarten class play,i was so disappointed that i could go on forever with
1,first they 're not as good as the first but in fact,first of all it was the first time i saw it
1,for that matter the film is so great that it 's almost impossible to see what 's going on in,for instance when she tries to make sure we 've just watched this film it is not that great
1,it 's a pretty straightforward film that shows what life does best sports and people should be,it 's one of the most moving films i 've seen in a very long time
1,when it comes to movies i ca n't imagine why anybody would be,when you get to see a very young judy davis get topless
1,david carradine is a great actor,david is a very handsome character who
1,pity on it all a movie with a good plot,pity the other reviewer has called it a spoiler alert
1,if i was n't the only person that actually went through this film would be bumped off the head of a hat,if you want to show you the reality of the story the movie is highly entertaining but if you have read the book
1,so it is a great little film that will be missed in a couple of hours and certainly appreciated,so i do n't care how he got his hands on a tree but it 's a movie
1,on top of that the movie fails badly as,on the other hand he 's pretty annoying
1,sorry i'm not the right guy,sorry to say i have a soft
1,in this film he plays a very straight man and it is difficult to get,in fact i was a little disappointed with the first half hour of it
1,it 's hard to suspend belief that the character is not a real person,it was n't all there but a nice and humorous action flick that could easily
1,the actors were pretty good at it,the story begins with a couple of young
1,let 's see how a movie like this can get made by an unknown cast to the point that it 's difficult to watch this,let 's get back to a movie that is the first thing you can do that you can actually get the whole movie to get rid
1,realizing it is n't really as funny or exciting as that later films but it 's a great story that is well worth checking out,realizing a bunch of people from a small town who lives in the desert and are taken away from the earth by the river
1,but that does n't stop at all,but he 's very funny and he gets
1,yes there are plenty of shots of the man that make,yes it was n't as good as you 'd expect
1,who 's to take this one out of their,who cares if there can be a few
1,secondly i could go on and on,secondly a lot of people were n't even
1,it was a really bad movie,it 's very well photographed and the
1,thought they were good actors and actresses,thought to the point where they 're supposed
1,we are all talking about what we have to do in the movie,we follow the story of the same man who is a great writer
1,there is an attempt to make a lot of,there are no good characters in this movie
1,as for a very well done film this has some really,as a result this film had an effect on me
1,suffice to say i have a soft spot for the fact that the film,suffice to say you 're not the only one to watch this film
1,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i have seen worse,this is not the kind of movie that you would n't have to watch if you
1,the story is a little convoluted and lacks any real humor,the music is very annoying i do n't even remember that much
1,the only good scene is when he gets chased by a truck while a cop is being,the acting is excellent for most of the film 's actors and the cinematography is wonderful
1,all in all the acting is pretty decent the actors are well done and the characters are very realistic,all we see is a bunch of random idiots that 's not even funny or entertaining or exciting
1,in this film it 's a lot of fun and it is definitely,in the end the movie is so boring that it is unbelievable
1,and there is something a little overdone,and then why have a guy in a
1,people who can watch the film do n't get enough money to watch this and it has nothing,people are always thinking that there really has to be a movie that will be a classic
1,aunt gertrude is a great movie and i liked it for a few reasons,aunt helen was one of the worst shows on a saturday afternoon i watched and
1,she is married to one of her students and,she is very convincing as the young woman
1,it is a real shame and one of the worst movies i have ever seen,it seems like he is trying to get rid of the old men and the man
1,the first movie in a bunch that was supposed to be scary,the movie is a little hard to understand but not as long as
1,it 's hard to believe that the writer was,it 's the first movie i ever saw
1,in this one he has been the only character in one movie to find a better actor and,in a sense it 's all in need of a movie which is not a good thing
1,i do n't want to give you a good reason,i had to go see it on dvd and i must
1,what i really like about this movie is the lack of depth in the acting department of dialogue or the actors involved,what i saw on was the fact that the actors from the original were n't exactly what they seem to be
1,her husband is so obviously the same who he played him,her character is a bit eccentric and not a good actress
1,if you want to have this kind of movie,if you have n't already read that the original title
1,and why did i give this film a 1,and of course this movie goes on for a very
1,like the other reviews about the film the script and the performances are quite good,like the previous poster said i would suggest to see any movie i saw this film
1,reese witherspoon plays a reporter who tries to make a statement,reese witherspoon was in fact a bit annoying to me
1,sad to say however that the ending is so predictable that it becomes a bore in itself,sad that this film is in my opinion one of the best films of the past few decades
1,i really like that but this is a terrible effort that has all the ingredients of a great action thriller,i have to say i found something interesting in the movie and then it just was n't that good
1,i am not even sure what he was saying,i think that all the good points were good in
1,every scene in the movie was perfect,every shot of a scene on the street
1,910 i love how the writers tried the,910 i was in a good mood
1,this is one of the funniest movies i 've seen in a long time,this was one of the first films that was shot in a small town in
1,unfortunately this is a terrible film,unfortunately the acting was good and the
1,this movie has to be the most awful movie that i 've ever seen,this is the story of an aging man who is born in a new england
1,it 's a shame that this movie only lasted for,it is also a great piece of the film
1,some of the scenes are hilarious,some other commentators have commented on this
1,do i even say the film is n't,do n't get me wrong i loved the way
1,part of this is his role to the movie,part of the reason why we 're not supposed to
1,she looks like that of a bad guy and a very young girl,she is not a typical actress but a great actress from a movie that
1,kevin costner is in his prime here he is the only way to watch one of the last remaining,kevin spacey as the young man and william mcnamara as a young man who are forced to fight
1,in the meantime she 's trying to get her revenge against the man,in my first two days this episode has been in my mind
1,i am not the only actor of the film who is the only actor on the movie i can identify with it,i ca n't help but wonder when she 's going to leave him with his wife 's wedding party and he is a
1,it does n't make a lick of sense but it is an enjoyable movie,it was a bit of an accident to me to have seen the movie in
1,the movie is quite good and is certainly watchable for its time in time,the film 's main highlight is the scene where the mother of two sisters and
1,usually i found this movie to be a little tedious,usually i am still amazed to watch films from my local
1,this movie is one of the worst movies i have seen in quite some time,this is a true shame and for the rest of us it is not just about
1,well it 's a little bit too long,well it 's also a great movie
1,i think we were to be careful of the film as a whole,i would like to know about the plot but i can only give it
1,he seems to be in it for many reasons,he is so charming that he ca n't even come
1,the movie also features a few scenes involving the girls at the beginning but it does n't come together,the story line is not even that much like other people do n't bother to make an interesting statement like
1,now the plot is n't as much as the original,now that 's a good movie to see for yourself
1,but it never gets boring and the movie,but it is n't all that interesting
1,i have to say that after all it was a long,i was so disgusted that the movie was a flop
1,my favorite part was when she looked at him for having a good time,my only complaint is that in the first of many scenes the movie is shot
1,much like the characters and situations they do with the first part of the movie the first part that the characters are trying,much of the movie 's dialogue is dubbed in english and it is so obvious that i actually cringed through the movie
1,on top of that the dialogue is awful,on that scene you 'll have a good laugh
1,besides this is a very good and original movie,besides what the hell is this film about
1,we are shown on the screen that the director is trying too hard to make us,we also know that the story is n't a lot better than the other movie
1,this was a very bad attempt at a spoof,this movie is the most interesting of the entire series
1,qi is the kind of character who never really played a person who 's been married,qi is a good example of how she 's been able to cope with her
1,blonde in particular is a bit of a spoof but i did not expect much,blonde women is a movie about a group of teens who have a relationship with their
1,it is n't the best movie ever made but,it is an amazing film with great performances
1,the whole premise is very familiar to us the movie is just about the love and the tragedy,the plot was simple the characters were n't likable enough or the characters were the least likable villains the
1,in the original movie there was an excellent amount of action,in fact it is so bad they should be ashamed
1,werner potente looks stunning as a beautiful woman with a good heart,werner fields is also very good as the detective and the supporting cast
1,the movie is n't as bad as its predecessor,the ending was so abrupt and unbelievable i could barely
1,a very nice and good movie,a young woman who tries to be
1,what was n't really really a good,what a sad and cruel story
1,director john schlesinger has done a superb job in directing a perfect setting and music score,director richard jordan does a good job with the film and its overall good' action flick
1,in this day a young girl who 's a teenager,in other words this is one of the best
1,and this is the one who 's making the film that is n't very exciting,and the other is the one that makes the viewer feel as if you are in
1,instead of a great character he was a caricature of the characters,instead of being a good film it 's like a cheap tv production
1,overall it 's very much fun to watch and there is a very strong,overall i was very disappointed and i could n't have been more wrong
1,in the first episode and we all know that they were just getting away with being a hit,in fact i think this movie was one of the best in the series and the only thing that
1,charlie brown is great in every episode as the bumbling uncle and the only thing which makes this a show to watch is that it is n't afraid to be funny,charlie 's father is a very good film about a family that moves into an apartment after a couple of days and the parents find the family a true opportunity to spend
1,personally i was n't sure whether this movie was meant to be a spoof of the book or the film,personally i love it when i can not get to see any of the other comments from this film
1,again the ending is too much of a complaint but i was quite surprised at how i felt the ending was the end,again i was really looking for the good guys in this movie and i did not really care about the other characters
1,i ca n't believe that the movie did,i do n't care about these guys
1,eventually the film ends with one of those two things that you wo n't get,eventually we see this a little more than we have in the first one
1,john carpenter and his writer michael mann must have been in touch with the original,john gielgud 's portrayal of the inspector is a great performance of his role
1,robert culp as a young girl in love is,robert ryan is an absolute genius to watch
1,that 's what i thought it was,that 's just why i watched it to
1,jack frost has a good cast but i just wish he could play more,jack nicholson is in it and the rest of the cast does a good job
1,the film was a big disappointment to me to be the main one,the story of the kelly gang' is so ridiculous that you can hardly care
1,i'm glad i did n't watch it,i'm still trying to figure out what the
1,the film begins to fall apart and it has to make,the ending and the ending make you want to cry
1,although the story 's premise is somewhat original it lacks any sort of atmosphere,although this movie may not appeal to anyone who 's accustomed to the genre but
1,an american version which in the early 70s,an excellent film for kids as well
1,there are many reasons that i am not impressed,there 's a reason why a movie such as this
1,as in all american films he has to play the role,as a result it was a total waste of time
1,it also made me laugh out loud when i saw,it seems that the filmmakers decided to take the book off
1,unfortunately the film is still quite enjoyable with some nice visuals including the,unfortunately this does not even have a plot line to be found
1,second of all there 's something wrong with it,second this movie was a very funny movie
1,zhou is the one who 's been in prison with a woman and she 's the only,zhou de vaca the writer of the book is an extremely rich director and his character
1,still there is a lot of action in this show and it is hard to watch but you 'll not be hooked to the,still i think that was a good thing because it 's too bad that they had to put out all the right ingredients
1,so if you 're not a fan of horror films then you should probably,so i was n't expecting to go into a coma as i was
1,the actors are great and the story lines were very good,the cast is very good as well as michael keaton as a
1,that is n't true the script is not very interesting to begin with,that is what is so beautiful and unique about the whole thing
1,it was the first time i saw it that it was so great,it was a shame the first one did n't go out and a lot
1,did i mention the first half of this,did anybody get to watch the movie
1,spoilers that 's the only thing i can say about this movie,spoilers below it may have been good for a couple of days but
1,but that is n't what the story is,but if you get a chance to see this
1,when i read the book i was a bit hesitant to see it,when they try to convince a story with a message of its time you
1,the story is simple and the actors look like they were,the film has the typical feel of a student film
1,death of a serial killer that was a little more suitable for me than this piece of crap,death wish is a film about a couple of years ago on a cruise of amsterdam and their journey
1,while the script is a bit thin it manages to keep you on the edge,while the movie has an excellent cast i think it is very well done
1,the film does n't have to rely the audience on the characters nor the plot,the story of three men who do n't know about their own problems and their relationship
1,after the screening of this one i think it 's a great show to show,after a couple of years of absence of the film i had an inkling
1,the movie is filled with a few laughs with bad language,the movie is about two couples each and every one
1,he was just about to die hard,he 's in my mind the most disturbing
1,i would never get to see it again,i love this show and i am surprised at
1,however this show was a real let down,however it is n't a good idea
1,as soon as you 've seen the trailer it 's worth the,as for the film it 's the same as i was
1,and this film was one of the worst movies of the year,and the scene with charlie and lucy having to fend if they can
1,instead the film fails at everything that is needed,instead we get the worst movie ever made
1,the director 's commentary on the film is also interesting and,the only thing good about the series was the animation
1,the film is very bad the music is,the acting and cinematography are superb too
1,she also has to find some way of getting her back and make up for everything with her life,she has n't been in love with a woman but she 's been a bit too much for her family
1,when a movie made by a bunch of people who had been at the theater for this film and the distributor,when it is said there 's a scene where the characters have to take the viewer out of the story
1,12 years later the mother 's sister dies and has to work up the mother 's daughter,12 months later it will only be released for a few years as it is on the dpp
1,while the story and acting are good all around are very good,while some were a little more convincing and interesting than i could have
1,it is a very moving story of two children who go from one 's,it is a movie that can be watched in a lot of places
1,for example the first scene that lasts for 2 weeks,for instance the scene where the boy and his dad are
1,so what if they had to get that in a way that the us would be proud of,so the movie started out well with the actors who made the movie the first thing that i could
1,there was a good idea and some of the acting was,there was n't a lot of nudity in this movie
1,after a brief prologue i was very surprised by the whole movie,after a few episodes about them being chased by a crazed psychopath that
1,if you 're not familiar with this film for those who are,if you have a choice to see this movie rent it
1,only a few minutes into the movie we are just waiting for something to happen and then it goes downhill,only a few minutes later i got the impression that the movie could have never been made better by the time
1,little does he know that if it was to have a,little is n't a priority that is a great movie
1,and the ending is quite a shock to the audience,and the ending was not the best of all that was
1,this movie has a great deal of humour and a great cast,this is not a movie in the 'so bad it 's good' category
1,while it may not be as good as the first one it 's also a little,while the plot and characters are n't particularly compelling it was just a complete dud
1,also they were n't really made for a,also the whole cast was pretty good
1,i had the feeling that he 'd rather see the light of day than,i was so surprised when i saw this show for the first time
1,the acting is very good with the entire cast being a real star,the story of four friends in new york new york in the early 1950
1,i could watch a documentary about the life of a child in a class and a place of a woman who,i have seen many other movies in the past decade and now i have seen a lot of other films
1,the characters are so believable and the story line so full that the story and characters become one dimensional to this day,the plot the characters are all the same and the plot is predictable and the story is very thin and the movie itself
1,de niro is not the only actor in his role that i could n't help but care about,de palma 's directorial debut was to make the film accessible to the fans who saw and enjoyed their
1,even the most diehard film fans were disappointed this was,even a good actor could n't save this one
1,then there 's the way the director,then the film ends abruptly abruptly
1,if you 're the kind of person who has seen this movie,if you can find this dvd you 'll probably like it
1,yeah it 's that bad i 've seen worse movies,yeah the story is a little weak and the actors try
1,i would give it 9 stars,i was a bit surprised at times
1,would it be a better one for him because the movie was just,would it be a better film if the story is not told
1,the film is so utterly unbelievable it is hard to believe that the director,the music by max steiner is so perfect it makes me very nostalgic
1,it seems the movie is trying to be a comedy,it seems that when he gets his head ripped off the
1,was the film supposed to be so hard to control the plot,was n't that the way he portrayed the character in the movie
1,and of course when the movie 's characters are n't supposed to be likable we are led to believe that the real culprit,and the scene where the hero is throwing a bullet in the head while the scene with his father is really lame
1,that 's the only positive point i can say,that said it has to be one of the worst
1,what is the target that you do know,what you do get is a film like this
1,but i was a little bit afraid to see this,but the rest of the time i was just bored by
1,the ending is the best part of the whole film,the movie is about a young woman who is obsessed with
1,by the end of the movie you are the hero of the movie and you can find a way to connect with a character like you will be in the,by far one of the worst movies on television ever it 's a big disappointment as i think it really is a bad idea to give it a chance
1,most of the actors in this movie seemed,most movies have that kind of sense
1,dustin hoffman stars in his usual charming,dustin hoffman is brilliant as always
1,at the same time you just have a bunch of actors trying to play it straight,at the end in the middle of the film we see the woman of the town holding
1,in one moment she 's on the train with her son but when she finally turns on her he becomes involved with his brother after,in this film he is a very talented actor who makes the role of the film his own look like a man 's character
1,the actors have the ability and the ability to portray the,the whole world has no problems for a good reason
1,perhaps the movie did n't get better,perhaps if the director had n't read the
1,male nudity as well as the rest of the cast is quite good,male nudity is not necessarily seen in this one and it is hard to
1,how can i go wrong with this film,how can a film that has a similar sense
1,the movie is a mishmash of characters who are not very convincing,the only redeeming feature of the film was the acting of the actors
1,visionary is a good movie about the dangers of the killer to the bad guys,visionary film about two young boys who want to get together with each other
1,don knotts is a good actor but he never does deliver his,don siegel 's direction is a little above par as well
1,francis ford coppola 's first venture in the world of film noir directors have a certain rapport between them,francis ford coppola has always been the most prolific director of the film but i would be curious if i
1,what a great film by that great director,what is more interesting today comes out of the
1,the movie has been a classic for the past several decade but this is not a great one,the film also features many of the characters from the three main roles and the supporting cast includes the
1,apparently it was a long time ago as it was on the same track as i 'd heard of it at the end,apparently all the kids did n't know it but they did n't seem to care about their characters or because they were a good
1,also we did not find any of her other,also there were parts that were pretty funny
1,probably the worst movie i 've ever seen or maybe the worst of the worst movies ever made,probably the most irritating scene in this show is because the main characters are so stupid and stupid that
1,a film that is set in modern day sweden,a couple of young women are killed by the cops
1,kurtz and his friends in the movie are also very well developed,kurtz 's life was a huge success in itself the story of a
1,it 's an absolute mess of a movie,it 's a story about people who are not
1,sharky 's machine is the story of a rich man,sharky 's curse of the mummy is a pretty weak ripoff
1,he was not in the same league as the ones of columbo,he 's a real guy to be found and a person who is
1,spoilers spoilers ahead i think they have some kind of weird future but that makes it more believable,spoilers ahead the ending is so predictable as to make the final showdown between the two characters and the
1,obviously there was a way out for him he had a good time and his voice was very,obviously they are trying to make it out of the ghetto for the rest of the movie
1,big fat liar has a special guest appearance,big edie has no qualms about it
1,come out on the heels of the movie for what it is,come on people are n't that good looking but the movie is good
1,i could see it being a very nice film and it 's not a,i thought that the movie was pretty good but it just got worse
1,why on earth they would do this kind of thing,why the producers had this movie is beyond me because i
1,both of which leads to the downfall of this story about the man and their friends,both men seem to have an idea of a situation as to which point a lot of
1,a group of people with a huge,a very interesting and entertaining movie
1,there is a lot more to it,there 's one moment when a young boy
1,then we get to get a big sense of humor and wonder at the end,then i got a lot of fun and watching i did n't want to give this
1,the film is not as good as the first,the main problem with this film is that he does
1,i think they were trying to make something more than just plain dumb,i ca n't see how anyone can get involved in this movie
1,the film opens with a couple of scenes between goldblum,the story is so good it is n't funny
1,it 's a shame that they never saw it,it was one of the few movies that i enjoyed
1,later on the film abandons him to be seen by the police and the two begin to investigate,later when this film came on late night cinemax i decided i 'd give you a choice
1,one is a pretty nice girl with a high pitched attitude a love of god,one might not be fooled by the movie but there is one good moment
1,every episode is a delight to sit through,every other film i know of the last 10
1,but the film was n't even close to the worst of the worst movies of,but when the film finally arrives to reach the point is a complete loss
1,if the movie had any redeeming qualities it would have been nice to have a good director with something to go and go and make the movie,if a person who can do a movie should be left with a lot more time spent the film tickets than anyone else should see it
1,but i can understand why this film flopped,but the problem is it 's also quite entertaining
1,i saw the movie several times before,i could n't stop watching it
1,it 's really a shame to see this as a movie but if you 're a fan,it was funny to see all the stars involved and the actors were all very good
1,the film is about a boy who lives in england and his,the cast and script are a lot of fun to watch
1,but this movie is n't a big budget blockbuster it 's a pretty poor,but you get the impression that the film is not a serious documentary
1,and why is the story to the beginning which is so stupid,and i 've read a lot of other comments about it
1,language is a joke as is the story,language is n't the only thing that really is
1,she had the money and her father had an affair with the mother,she 's a little stiff in the movie but she is a bit more
1,better still i was amazed it is,better than that of a movie
1,it is the only film that can actually compete with the viewer and has a good story,it could have been a decent film if it had been as good as it was
1,it 's the same film with a similar theme song,it does n't have to be one of the best animated
1,and if you have to see that scene alone is a little long,and he was in the scene in which he had a scene with an
1,pandemonium is a very good movie,pandemonium is the worst movie i have
1,for a horror movie this is a very good movie,for this it is not a good idea not a movie
1,who is there in the end and they are just trying,who does not understand a character of a real person
1,dawn of the dead is an excellent series of great episodes and i,dawn is a classic of mine that i would n't have seen
1,lately a movie about a girl and her daughter that are trying to survive in new orleans,lately i saw this movie and i loved it even more than i thought it was
1,compared to the other two versions,compared to the first the first half
1,otherwise the film is very well done,otherwise it was n't a great story
1,the plot itself has a nice twist but that is n't enough,the only thing i liked about this movie was that it was shot
1,if the plot is a little slow it 's the same as the original and the ending,if you have a taste of the film you 're not in the book at all
1,the movie is a good example of the,the acting sucks so much of that
1,there were some scenes that were not worth a lick of a,there were so good actors in this that it 's embarrassing
1,just because of the fact that i,just to let it go on
1,sadly the film 's biggest asset is its limited,sadly the story is a little off kilter
1,no matter what the plot it is a,no one should have done the same
1,now i do n't know who is who it 's supposed to be but the problem with the story is that in all the,now for the first time i saw it at tribeca and thought wow maybe it 's a little corny and not that funny
1,and i am not a fan of his work or not the fact,and i 've never understood the plot line of the first movie
1,the music is beautiful and the songs are well written,the whole thing is about how the film is about the
1,sasha is the first to find the old guy in his place,sasha also seems to know that he has nothing to do
1,if there is any other film to be made,if not all of the characters are good
1,steven segal plays a good guy who has been a big fan of jackie chan 's career as,steven berkoff gives a stellar performance as a detective who is sent to prison for his crime
1,it 's a very funny way at a comedy,it takes a new life when i finally found the
1,this movie was just so horrible that i could n't care less,this movie has a very good acting by a bunch of amateurs
1,im surprised to find that people who say it is a bad movie i do n't get it,im not the only actor who plays a role in this movie which is really really sad
1,pryce seems to have been too busy to become involved with the action scenes but,pryce did n't look like a cross between the typical american and american hero
1,the first thing i can say is that in,the only reason for this is the acting
1,it 's a shame that the director does n't know anything about it and how he does it,it has a few good moments in mind that there were some hilarious moments and funny cameos
1,but the film was n't bad either at all,but i ca n't really tell the difference between these
1,donald pleasance has a small role in,donald crisp is a good actor
1,you can be forgiven at first glance but you do n't have much to think about who,you can tell you the truth is the actors involved in the making of the show
1,the film is a real pleasure,the only problem that i have with
1,i could have had a headache,i 've got this in my collection
1,the only thing worth seeing are the opening titles on dvd,the film was a bit too violent about what they are dealing
1,the film is based on a play by the same author,the whole plot is not a bad idea but it makes some
1,johnny knoxville 's character is the perfect,johnny filone makes one good film
1,his role is a very weak one,his performance is a joy to watch
1,they even show the girl a bit more than i imagined was the only character that kept coming out to,they also learn that he is a master of the island and they both have their own own plans
1,that should be an embarrassment to this turkey,that is n't a bad thing but it is
1,each scene is shot on the same level to the other 's in the final cut,each of the main characters is the stereotype with a lot more than a passing resemblance to
1,the movie is a good mix of the usual genres a great action movie and a great,the director should be given another film to work with that in spite of the talent
1,he plays himself with a strong sense of humor and timing which is what makes this film work,he 's also pretty much in love with her but he has n't gotten the credit done before
1,when all that said this film was really good,when you see the film you can see it 's
1,this may be his greatest role since 1938,this is a pretty awful movie with lots of
1,incredible story telling the story of a family,incredible story great soundtrack and awesome soundtrack
1,the acting is terrible the script is ridiculous and the,the movie makes you wonder how it would end
1,the music is very good and the music is wonderful,the director of this movie also has the best actors in
1,this movie is a must buy for anybody who enjoys good good movies,this is the second time you saw this film and the first time you
1,for some reason this is just another film,for the time you should see it
1,if anyone has a problem with him the show is n't,if you want to see a film with bad dialog this will
1,if you want to make an interesting movie about a group of men and not even,if you do n't have the opportunity to see this film you may be right
1,you know what this movie takes in its entirety,you see the movie for all the time
1,they even get the girl who is supposed to be funny and when he 's a bit older he is still alive,they 're trying to make a living and they fall prey to each other but also they do their own different forms
1,it is the perfect movie you can make you think,it is a complete waste of time and money
1,at the same time a young boy returns from new york to find out whether she or he is a real boy and a woman who,at least he did n't get to know that he was going to show it to his daughter so he could n't do it right
1,now i do n't see that,now that is n't what i do
1,if not the worst it will have ever been,if i were n't so much on the subject of
1,house of the dead is one of the great films made by warner brothers by the same director as,house of wax is an amazing film that the lovers of the books can see as they 're
1,the story is pretty straightforward and some of the jokes are fun,the plot of the movie is a little bit too implausible
1,despite the fact that this film was directed by an american actress i felt i would 've been,despite that they still have a different personality than they were to be in the original story
1,it 's about three men who are married to an asian boy,it 's not that i can see where a good actress is able
1,i just saw this movie at your local tv station and it was just bad,i 've been a fan of many movies lately so this was the first of which
1,ingrid is a good actress she always gives us all,ingrid pitt stars as an evil cop who is willing to
1,but i think it will have to do with the others who were born in the us,but it 's also the fact that the acting is bad because it 's so bad
1,this show is about a man who is n't even in,this is the only movie about it you 'll find
1,this was n't an original idea either,this film was so great that there was
1,would you really think that this was a bad movie,would he just be able to get away from the crime
1,note that in the end of the movie the hero is,note that the plot was n't too bad at all
1,in addition to the fact that there 's no such a thing,in fact that alone makes you wonder where the real magic went to
1,watch it with friends and friends,watch this movie only for the scenery
1,the film is quite a meditation on the human condition,the movie opens with a man who 's been told to
1,just to show the real killer that he was supposed to,just look at this one that you 've got mail
1,the story revolves around an elderly woman who was a boy who wanted to make her life,the first one of the great series is the very very very very very very very very very
1,final verdict i was hoping that something would improve my curiosity,final verdict i love the ending where the heroine gets drunk as
1,we 're shown that we can identify the,we never get to see him die
1,sometimes i found the plot twist and the dialogue very intriguing,sometimes you could have a lot of laughs to watch
1,it is the story of a man named john mcclane a man who is a struggling man and tries to steal a few dollars,it 's a little slow paced for you but the movie is not all about them being an american werewolf with a heart of gold
1,the acting was terrible the actors were very good the plot was a little weak but the way the story came,the film itself is very different from the usual horror story but it does get the point across the plot
1,there 's a lot of gore in the,there 's not one moment of suspense
1,the acting is bad the story is worse than the movie it has a story that is,the script is not bad enough to be bad it does not deliver any of those
1,a great film in my opinion,a great movie is it was one
1,the director tries very hard to tell her that she just loves him but she 's,the first thing that the movie makers had was that the ending was pretty cool
1,i would rate this movie a 10,i do not want to give this movie
1,in fact i would say i did n't see the movie,in my opinion it does n't have to be the best movie
1,in the end it does n't matter,in other words that is a bad thing
1,the main characters are the same,the only good thing this movie had
1,in my humble opinion this movie is an absolute masterpiece,in the end she 's given a job of her life
1,there was a time capsule of the story which was a lot better than the one that did,there are a number of movies that have been made on the strength of the first film
1,ca n't possibly make a film that is,ca n't say it 's so awful
1,but the story is that the people who made this,but the plot of this movie is very weak
1,at least he got the girl in a cage to keep a straight face and just as a kid,at least the first time i saw it was n't that bad but i do n't think it 's too
1,it really is one of its few shows,it 's also a shame to see the actors
1,gee the movie has some good acting and a good premise to make it good,gee yes it 's a little silly about the whole film so why was it necessary
1,that would have been a lot better and i did enjoy the movie for what it was,that 's when the director 's first foray into the camera is to be a flashback
1,but for an hour of my life i can only give it a 3,but that 's not the case with the movie so much so that it becomes
1,irene dunne in particular was excellent,irene dunne is great as the young
1,so in a way that i am a fan of the classic and the story itself is pretty good,so he is a man and a person who has fallen in love with the girl of the book which
1,after watching it the entire way through it is not a comedy,after the fact that the movie is set in a brothel where the
1,the first part was n't so much better than the first one,the only reason i wanted to see this film was because i have
1,i was expecting to be a better person as a kid who never lived in,i would n't be so stupid if i could not be a better person
1,the story was interesting and the acting superb,the main premise of the movie is to get
1,i would highly recommend this to the actors,i ca n't believe that the people who wrote
1,the plot of a man and woman in a society who,the movie itself was so bad its not even funny
1,a few minutes into the movie you start getting a little surprised at the corniness of this film,a lot of things seem like they are not going to be more interesting than this one
1,the music is excellent and i can see how much money i will be on my hand when the film is released from the states,the only reason people can give this movie a high rating is because they have been making more films than they would ever have been but
1,it 's not really the best film ever made,it 's also a lot more fun to see the
1,if one was a teenager then i thought maybe you just know how to play this role,if there was any other thing to complain about the whole thing just made the wrong choice for
1,mr scott is an excellent actor but he,mr bean is a pretty good actor
1,also the characters in the movie are n't very funny in their opinion because they are just bad,also there are a few funny scenes involving the ones where the girls find the house on the boat
1,have you ever heard of the film beforehand,have n't the privilege of meeting the main characters
1,a good thing is the script and editing,a very simple idea of a film of the
1,for example they are on the bus a little too much to say about a guy named felix who has a heart attack,for me it seems that it 's really a great idea that a good man could have had a few good lines and then
1,the ending is pretty standard but then again that 's the story is that this is n't a very good,the film is a masterpiece in which the story of the film 's main character is a complex character
1,if they have a good sense of humor i would suggest this movie for anybody and you will never know it,if this had been made by someone who had to put the movie into a film then why the heck did n't
1,the story of a woman that was not so much and,the acting is not all bad but it does n't
1,but the rest of the story is a dream,but the movie is still a very good adaptation of
1,their character is so believable that the audience is rooting for the actors to shine their lines,their chemistry is so much more believable than in the previous movie but is a good guy with
1,i had no choice i was so confused,i was hoping for some nice stuff and for
1,then the movie turns into a monster,then a woman decides to leave she is
1,it 's one of the worst horror films i 've ever seen,it has a very good feel to it that is very refreshing to
1,i just saw this film at the cleveland film festival it was the most powerful film in,i was expecting it to be a bit of a comedy the plot was predictable too
1,from there we are left with a very long winded pointless and pointless finale of a sequel to that of,from the point of fact this film has its own charms the fact that the actors are very talented
1,working at the mall is a pretty decent show with the typical supernatural humor thrown,working with the other actors in a film that has absolutely no redeeming qualities
1,smack is a movie that will be remembered,smack is one of my favorite movies
1,she was a big hit and a very talented actress who had,she is also the only real person in the entire movie
1,there is a very dark atmosphere and there is a lot of the scenes of the original story which makes the overall film a little different,there 's a bit of everything wrong with the original movie and this version has some really creepy characters and i thought it was good
1,darren mcgavin has a good voice in this film,darren mcgavin is in it as usual and is an
1,my only problem with this movie is,my favorite character is the daughter
1,del toro does a brilliant job of showing a man working,del toro is a real good guy in the film
1,clearly the only reason i did n't leave it to a child was because i was bored,clearly the film was released on dvd so maybe i'm not going to get that out
1,it 's not a bad film but it is,it is a wonderful film about a man
1,some of the scenes between the doctor and a woman,some of the acting is n't that great either
1,upon entering the story you ca n't help but feel that the movie is n't even worth the time it takes,upon seeing a bunch of the movie makers this would be the one we had come to expect to do
1,it 's a great story about a bunch of people that have to fight for the sake of their lives,it 's just that the movie is n't about the real characters of the first movie so what happens
1,orson welles 's direction is superb as he does it but the film never seems to come up as a whole,orson welles plays the role of a very wealthy and very strong woman but it is not a good thing
1,sorry i had a chance at this website for a while,sorry i did n't give it a 1 but it 's one
1,and i ca n't get into that fact,and there are moments in the movie that i
1,from the opening credits you just know the title character of the title is a little bit confused to be in the mood,from what we see in the trailer this movie is one of the best in my life and i do n't know how i
1,it 's not a horror movie it 's not a bad movie and a good movie,it is a bit difficult to understand what a mistake this show is but it is worth
1,that 's when a bunch of young kids find themselves dead they find a house full of people in the forest,that 's what it seems to be the only one that has the ability to have been able to do something better
1,he has no redeeming qualities no matter what,he has made this a classic of his career
1,full swing in the last five years,full house i was hooked with this movie
1,with no discernible message about the film it does not feel like it 's a long long way to go,with all of its foibles there is a very long scene at the end where i was watching a couple of
1,another film that should have made some money on my money back when i watched the first one,another scene where the main character is killed is one character that he feels like you have not seen
1,it was a bit of a surprise as it showed how the first episode is going,it has everything that can do to a person who cannot get his life right
1,a movie that has the same actors and crew as they did at least,a few days later she is the oldest son of david a former who is
1,in one case he is not a good man with the right arm and yet a very simple guy,in this movie we get a real sense of a relationship and that there is a lot of sex in
1,a good deal of good movies are made and not that it is n't,a few minutes later she was n't really acting in an entire story like this
1,aside from that i would say this is a wonderful movie and it is a must see for anyone interested in the history of modern day during world war ii,aside from a few moments where it feels like an overlong film with no sense whatsoever no real story line no story and nothing else in the way of gore and
1,maybe he should have stayed with them,maybe it could be a little better for
1,and he 's got a very short story,and he is not a good actor
1,of course this might have been a great film,of course i had n't seen the original
1,there are plenty of movies that do not have to be very good,there were several things about this film that i hated most about this movie
1,this would be a good movie if it were to make me,this is not a movie you could watch in a theatre
1,it 's an absolute delight to see that a director that can make movies is a real treat,it is n't funny to see the actors act as though it is from the real world
1,just like the other shows it has a lot of action,just the fact that all of the action happens and i was
1,but it 's not even that bad,but as a result of some of the
1,wow if you are a fan of the movie i 'd give this movie a 110,wow that does n't make a bad movie but then this one is not for everyone
1,as for the story itself it 's a lot of fun to follow what 's going on,as the movie is set in the present you know that they are in there as an afterthought
1,the film itself is a classic,the only drawback that i found of
1,the plot is a good one and a very likable character,the acting is awful and there really is no character
1,my wife and i did n't watch the movie till the end,my advice for this movie is that i can find the dvd
1,a little bit too many people who have never seen him in a good role as well he 's very believable,a very young boy who lives on the fringes of the family decides to take them with his son and make them
1,first of all this movie is not so much a mystery of course at the,first of all you could n't have had a bad movie in your mouth
1,because i 've seen this movie so many times so far it makes me sad to have,because the acting and acting are so bad they even make them feel like real people
1,if you want to watch a movie that is so bad it,if you want to see a great movie see this one
1,i am glad there were more movies like this one,i saw this movie on cable a couple of years ago
1,this movie is a complete waste of money for a poor and inconsistent script,this was not only one of the best movies i have ever seen but it
1,we all know what the hell the director did but it could n't,we have seen more than enough to get this movie back now
1,you know that it 's a real good film but you do n't have to,you could not even tell the difference between a straight man and a guy
1,released in the usa and released the new year of the war,released from new orleans i guess he was the most overrated
1,the story is a simple mixture of genres and a story that was so,the whole idea of this movie is just a vehicle for a movie
1,i thought the director was trying to recreate the book by adding the,i 've found that this movie is more or less a masterpiece
1,and there 's a good performance by a young,and the film has more than enough nudity
1,danny devito is the funniest of all time,danny boyle is as always a great character
1,after seeing his films on a dvd release of the original film in my opinion the only real gripe is that i had no expectations about it in,after that he gets the girl and the rest of the family is there for the rest of their day and it 's also a little weird
1,in all it 's not a film to be,in short this is a good film noir
1,the story is n't really a romance and there seemed to be a whole movie with so many holes that i had a hard,the main character is the typical hollywood clich guy whose love of the lead female character does n't seem to have much personality
1,i ca n't believe there is more to the original than this,i do n't want to ruin the plot here but the acting and
1,hindu slater is a master of acting skill,hindu graffiti is a classic that does a very
1,i was surprised that this movie did not take its place away from the first time,i think i was a bit skeptical about the movie and found some redeeming value to some
1,with a plot about his search for the murder he decides to do so,with the possible exception of a decent screenplay a decent cast that is not as
1,the script is so bad it 's almost painful to watch,the film is a perfect blend of drama and romance with some
1,the movie is very good and a lot of fun,the plot is n't that bad to be found but the
1,then we get a new york movie with a cast of unknowns and actors playing the same characters,then it becomes a great movie with good acting and a strong story but that 's about it
1,it 's a film that makes a mockery of the genre,it seems like it was set on a planet somewhere in the
1,this is a wonderful movie with some excellent performances,this is the first film i have ever seen where
1,then there 's the way the reporter who kills her in a hospital,then i thought the show was just about as bad as the original in
1,but i am surprised that such an enjoyable movie could n't get made,but then there 's the fact that the director is trying to tell a
1,to say the least i would rate this a zero,to sum it up this is the worst film i 've
1,sometimes the movie seems to just get,sometimes you know it is n't
1,the characters and dialog is n't the main focus,the acting was excellent and the story was so intriguing
1,the movie is really just a movie of that era,the acting is pretty much a bit overdone but the story
1,and i was n't too scared to be the last,and it 's a shame that the film does n't offer
1,ok there were a few good elements but it,ok it was just like an action movie
1,every scene has the right to be a bit of a thriller and the final chase scene in which,every time you think he is a good guy you just see him getting angry about the situation
1,it is a great movie but the acting is horrible,it was like i had never thought that a movie could
1,watch out for it to be the classic one,watch this if you are interested in movies with a
1,even though it 's not a movie about the evils of the supernatural the violence that is being made is not the main thing that does n't seem,even the most mundane moments are the one where you get to see the killer 's face in some scenes as i did n't expect the film
1,there was a scene where he goes home and goes through the motions and tries to stop,there have been several films for years but this one is n't bad and the worst
1,after reading the synopsis it sounds like something that i do not understand,after a few minor characters in the movie we 're just starting to think
1,so the film is not even for you,so much that i ca n't believe that this
1,all three of them are married with a bunch of women who are married,all you can ask is the question to the questions why not bother
1,it seems that the director was trying to get,it 's just so funny it 's funny
1,sadly i was n't able to read the book because of the story and its characters,sadly it seems to have a lot of potential to do with the characters who are supposed
1,a real joy from the young master who had the ability to,a few years later she was born to play a child
1,likewise a bunch of people who were n't a threat to each and all were drafted to make,likewise this film has been made several years prior to its predecessor as a child 's film
1,patrick is an expert in the movie industry as he 's given some time to have a new life in a society that is a real stinker,patrick stewart is superb in a supporting role as the man who is a good guy and a woman who gets involved and falls in love with a
1,the film also had a good cast,the film looks cheap and boring
1,the director of photography and a film that has to,the movie is also not for the faint hearted
1,i am a fan of his films,i just could n't help but laugh
1,as for the acting well i do n't think it 's,as with this one it is really just plain terrible
1,that 's where the story falls and,that 's why the movie ends
1,wells 's direction was n't as polished as they used to,wells is a great actor and the cast is superb
1,about an hour later we meet some of the characters and a story,about the only negative i can remember is this a bad film
1,anyone who wants to see some of the other films should be warned,anyone in a similar situation would be happy to see her again
1,my guess is that the film should appeal to,my favorite scene is where she goes home
1,this film does n't have a lot of nudity but it does remind me of my teenage friend 's movie,this film is no exception it is about love and passion and friendship as you have a great cast of the
1,even with its flaws and its technical ambitions and its shortcomings it fails miserably as a whole,even for the first half of the film there are a few things that should n't have gone
1,dancing is an excellent example of what it wants to be but,dancing is one of the more enjoyable of all the movies
1,her character and she does n't have anything to hide the fact that the story is very interesting,her first major problem with this was that her character 's performance was not developed in a way where
1,ultimately the movie is also very boring and not even a,ultimately this was a movie for the kids to enjoy
1,tons of gore in some scenes,tons of the movie is just boring
1,my rating is for the story,my dad and i rented the show
1,in a way he does n't have any kind of a sense of reality or atmosphere,in fact i was bored at how awful this was when it was first released
1,footage from the very very very very different angle is what the viewer can see when the film has it all,footage is very much the main character of the film although his relationship with the father and daughter is very good
1,ar and another person in this world,ar in the first five mins
1,this movie is a very bad one,this is not your typical american movie it
1,do not be discouraged when this movie is n't in the same league as the blair witch project,do not watch this movie and you 'll find yourself wondering what happened when the movie ended
1,every single one of them is a complete moron,every once in a while it takes you a very
1,the story is a bit predictable,the film is also about a couple
1,the story is so complex that you 're really left wondering why it happened,the ending was so bad i do n't know where to start and it 's
1,this was really a good film,this is a movie made for those
1,the story of the film revolves around the lives of two friends from both sides of the family family who is a very,the movie opens with a group of friends stumbling around to investigate the mystery of some sort of mysterious and mysterious virus
1,but it does take me a couple of times to realize that,but then they 're in town with their daughter 's car
1,although it does have its flaws the film is pretty weak but the script makes a refreshing change,although you know that the plot is the same and the actors are n't as good as in this
1,this is a movie that you will never,this film does n't quite make sense
1,as the title suggests to the person 's comment i was not going to give it away because it did not come close to the truth and is not,as usual there are so many elements of this movie that i found myself laughing at the stupidity of a man who would love to see this movie
1,questions have been given to them as a whole it is the worst movie,questions are revealed that all of this film is in an odd way
1,and i think the best part of the movie was the scene where the kids and the family members were in the bar,and when you consider that i have the opportunity to watch a rerun of these kind of movies i am still surprised to find
1,the film is based on a true story of a woman who is sent to her hometown,the story follows a group of friends whose friends have to spend a weekend together in a big
1,two of my friends are in the film theater of film history,two people have to play soccer for a better while their roles are
1,anyway i do n't see how many times it has been on the bottom 100,anyway the film was released in a very small budget but the production values were poor
1,the film is also very poorly directed poorly edited and acted,the story does not have enough twists to make up for the
1,thus it is a pity that a lot,thus the movie was just plain horrible
1,i did like the first time i saw this movie and i was a good fan of hers and liked to,i had heard of this movie for the first time when i was 9 and have never heard of it
1,after a few years i saw this film,after an unfortunate viewing i was looking out for
1,and why was the young victoria,and if that were the case then
1,however the ending is a little too abrupt too much to ask what,however there is a lot of bad acting and an unconvincing acting
1,they were both brilliant as they were,they are both a fine actor
1,i was n't impressed with the acting and the,i was shocked that this movie was made
1,on the bright side if you are an animal lover i would be more likely to go,on that basis the two are all over the place of the movie and their interactions
1,the only good thing i could say about this show is that the story is not very simple at all,the first movie was an excellent adventure for the genre and the cast had a bit of chemistry but there really
1,having lived in a small town in a small town and living in an abandoned apartment complex in the small towns of new mexico city and the small towns,having a conversation between a man on stage and a woman he is still the only character that seems so far away from being a caricature of a person 's
1,the acting is horrible the script is poor and the acting is awful,the characters are very real and there is a good deal of humor that
1,each of them are presented in this movie a bit more,each scene is in a word to describe the scene
1,something about the whole movie is that she was really a girl in an institution to kill the girl,something about it that i was looking forward to seeing if you were a die hard dudikoff or a completist
1,also the film was shot in an extremely simplistic way and i have n't mentioned it in quite a long time since i have seen a lot,also the music was quite good the song was very well done and the cinematography was gorgeous the scenery was gorgeous and the cinematography was awesome
1,2 there is something new about this film it 's not bad either,2 this is not one of those movies about how it 's supposed to
1,only the title of the movie has an actual storyline that does n't fit into it at all,only the acting is horrible the script is bad the story is weak and it does n't quite work
1,going in with the wind it was the first time we saw that she did not lose her hair so she would have a chance in life in the future,going on the same day if you are a diehard fan you are likely to find a copy of this film but i did not think it would be much better
1,the whole time is set up a bunch of crazy women in a small village with a rich couple,the acting was superb with an ensemble cast who would have never been better served for the role
1,if you want to watch a movie about real life i 'd recommend this,if you want to see a good movie about a family and an adult who
1,this film is a good example of,this movie is a complete failure
1,what we get is a movie that 's supposed to,what 's the deal with these people 's lives
1,and this guy does n't even care much about a good guy who is not a,and the other actors were not very good and the story is a bit confusing
1,but the most effective aspect of it was the fact that there was no character development for the main character,but that 's exactly why she chose her to show a lot of her life and the rest of the movie
1,it has no redeeming qualities but the most memorable scene in the movie was when the two friends are going to be together,it 's like i 've just finished watching the rushes of the series and have only seen two episodes of the series
1,it 's so much more and less,it is a very good film
1,what i thought would be the worst movie out of all of the,what is even worse is that this one had a huge budget
1,its a shame because there are some very good performances,its a shame why we get to see it
1,suddenly the film opens with a bang in which it is almost as if the producers were trying,suddenly you see how they can have the exact same effect but is not the first one
1,but as a movie this film was a complete,but what is this crap with the script
1,all in all this is a great movie to watch,all of the characters were all very well acted and there
1,the main problem with the film is that it takes a little long and not a single minute of it,the film is a classic example of an independent production and it is so rare in their career that it 's
1,i do n't see it ever and it will be on the dvd at the big box office so you can buy this dvd and watch it to the end,i have a feeling that it would be a better choice for someone 's money or even a decent movie for an audience but it 's certainly one of the better
1,she looks like the perfect guy for the role of the daughter,she does n't know who he is or she 's just getting on
1,now that 's the only good thing,now if you 're going to have a
1,mathis is one of the main actresses and is the sole survivor with her in it,mathis is one of two films in which he appears to be having sex with someone but
1,as far as i'm concerned i have a soft spot for the genre but i have to say,as for the story you can see in some of the most amazing episodes a new character
1,buy the soundtrack for the dvd,buy it it 's worth you watch
1,this is one of the very few movies that i think is a total bore and in my own opinion a waste it 's just the way it makes its point,this is one of those movies which is a very important one because it deals with a lot of people but it is very realistic and very realistic that the filmmakers did
1,the story is a bit of an allout clich but is so bad that it has,the first is that the film had a bit of an impact on the viewers
1,this movie is just a waste of film,this movie is a must see for anyone who
1,earlier the same is being said for the director 's vision,earlier as a film i was amazed to find that this is
1,11 i ca n't believe how many of the gags were funny,11 years later they do n't make much of a difference but they
1,gillian 's character was a woman and her mother died,gillian is a man who is a little more ambitious than
1,not even a little bit of the film 's most enjoyable moments were the ones which made you think,not to mention that the whole thing was so ridiculous and predictable that i could only hope they had made
1,in this sense the film is a bit like a play with the ending,in the end the director has succeeded in his job for a while
1,one of the best films of this generation and it has no shame on a plot line,one of the things that is so funny is that there are so many funny parts in the
1,even with the help of a good girl this was definitely a bad thing,even more than this movie 's dialogue you would think that if i had n't
1,while a good film to watch is not for anyone who enjoys watching the trailer of the movie,while this time around i 'll have to sit through it to see more of the same
1,even though a few of the other characters are not the main characters in the film the,even more disappointing is that the whole movie takes you into the realm of the story
1,the first one is the third of the best,the film is filled with flashbacks and sequences from one
1,the film is shot for a nice,the movie is a complete joke
1,we were n't really sure why it happened,we are introduced to this type of film which
1,you can see it in one sitting,you will laugh at the tv
1,i 've been a fan of the novel since,i saw a screening of that film which was a
1,the cast is excellent and the film is not about the,the main theme is the same way as it was
1,steven seagal is excellent as always but in a bad performance as a cop it,steven berkoff did a good job with this movie but not in this movie
1,sure it 's a good thing that the script did n't seem to be good enough for the movie,sure i know there was a lack of respect in my opinion but i ca n't remember how much of
1,the whole thing just seems to go nowhere,the only thing in the film that could not
1,rocky and her friend are also on the run from work,rocky is a complete bitch whose sole purpose is to make an
1,i just do n't know how i could have saved it,i could barely believe that the movie is supposed to take place
1,i 've been wanting to give this one an,i could have had something else to say
1,and there were a number of times that could,and there are no surprises in this show
1,after a long time i was hooked from watching the entire production,after seeing this movie i was amazed to see that this movie has
1,i could n't stop smiling but i had the distinct feeling that it would,i do n't even know where to begin i 've done so here
1,i would recommend this film to anyone of any age who enjoys good movies,i 've seen it countless times now and i am still amazed i 've wasted
1,i would highly recommend this film to people who know nothing about them and want to see them on tv,i 've read many negative reviews about this movie and there are no spoilers so why should we care for them
1,there are also some scenes that are n't really worth the viewing,there were a number of other movies out there with which all the
1,it 's a shame that this is n't only the first movie that i have ever seen,it is a story line not to mention that the script writer and director writer david mamet 's
1,i have to say that the film was very good,i have been waiting eagerly for guffman and this is the
1,the film opens with the guy walking,the film is a true classic
1,none of the characters are developed to care about,none of the actors are really very believable
1,coda of the title is an interesting movie for that alone,coda for the movie is a lot of fun too bad
1,animators and directors are so blinded by the film industry that,animators do n't even come across as being a film
1,the main characters are the most interesting characters i have ever seen,the movie is a complete disgrace to the book and the acting is
1,and of course there were some very funny moments and there were the funniest moments where the,and if you want to watch this movie you 'll get to know nothing about it
1,the acting and editing are horrible but even a little bit of sense are left unanswered,the acting was terrible although it did n't have the usual characteristics of some of the actors
1,i 've already mentioned that some of the things i did like about this film are pretty nice but some of which are quite obvious and very poorly done,i did n't think the movie was even as bad as it was and the acting was terrible although i did n't think it was possible but it was really
1,no one was laughing or anything,no other comment is given here
1,lucy 's acting seemed to have been made by some of those people but not the slightest of the story,lucy mukherjee is excellent as the young man and the love interest is one of the very best of the depression
1,with the release of the dvd release in the uk and a,with that said it was just a movie for the lovers
1,kudos to those who did not love their performances so you may get a,kudos to them for trying to avoid themselves like a movie they made
1,clearly the actors had been given a bigger and,clearly the worst movie i have ever seen
1,still it has a pretty cool feel,still the movie is pretty bad
1,but he is also in the process where the film is made,but he 's not in the book but i did not expect any
1,an old woman who does n't seem to get into trouble or even care when he realizes that she loves him,an interesting note is that the script itself does n't need a strong word and the plot is completely unbelievable
1,our main character is in the book so as to be said about his character and his own feelings about the truth of his actions and the way he,our hero is a bit of a jerk as it seems to have to rely so heavily on the plot that he can only be put on screen
1,how is it possible that a movie with such vile,how can the movie be more effective than this
1,however he ca n't get away from it because he does not believe that the man is the one he does,however when a film that makes you think good and bad as you think they are n't good at all the bad
1,it was all very good looking for the,it would be a very good movie
1,it 's like watching a high school theater project,it was a little disappointing that the movie was going
1,well it was a great movie,well they were all very good as
1,just before the end of the film i was n't expecting too much,just like this i 've never heard of them but i'm gonna say that
1,only to the movie lovers to the point that they could n't get it to,only he is in the hospital scene that would be in a coma without the slightest
1,the story involves many things that are presented as a comedy,the acting is not great but it is quite entertaining
1,definitely not for everyone who appreciates the first two films but this one is not,definitely the worst movie to have the reputation to be on a screen with the worst
1,fonda is a young woman whose father has the family 's life to,fonda is the man in the charge of the great russian war
1,kelly and company were married to the old man who had to come home,kelly is a great dancer who is still playing the role of a character who
1,he 's been in his place to try and kill them,he has never seen a movie that is the best of his
1,it was a great performance and a great movie to watch,it 's an interesting concept but it never really works
1,her mother is so much as to be a distraction for the viewer,her father and wife is n't the best but still the show is about
1,she 's a woman and the woman of a house is n't exactly a witch,she did her job with this role in her life with the script and the acting
1,like the characters they played the characters were so funny and all the acting seemed pretty good,like most of the episodes this one has more of the same characters and plot lines and the
1,there are several things that really happen here in this film and they are the two dimensional,there are some things that were pretty good but this would have made some really good movies in
1,fred williamson and his girlfriend and father of mine had just been looking,fred macmurray is very convincing as the tough cop in the film
1,but in all fairness this is not the worst film i 've ever seen,but the real thing is that the film seems to have so much to do
1,but i have been in a state of,but it is very enjoyable to watch
1,the film is also a bit slow paced and,the film is an excellent piece of work
1,at one point during this movie it makes it seem like it was,at the time i saw a movie where i was a child
1,the film is also directed by the great alfred hitchcock,the plot is n't all that interesting as it does n't
1,i had a lot of fun watching it,i had heard that the director thought it was
1,he just does n't seem to get it out of,he and his buddies have a lot of fun
1,which is about the movie i do n't know about the director 's intentions,which is the only part of the show that i would recommend seeing
1,the movie is so bad it 's pathetic its so bad it 's hilarious and,the acting is not as bad as the characters and the story was awful
1,i think that if you have seen the movie for yourself i suggest that you,i think he 's the best thing in it to be a complete jerk
1,but i have to tell u what this movie could do with,but the story is a bunch of actors who have nothing else to
1,all in all though the film has plenty of action,all in all it does not make it a good movie
1,not much else but a bit of a movie,not so much to say but it certainly is one
1,and that 's because they are the only ones who,and that 's what they do in the movie
1,in this version i would have given it a 75 instead of 4 stars,in the book 's case the main theme of the film is that of a
1,there 's even a brief hint of love between the two,there is a lot to enjoy here but what a treat
1,i have seen the movie approximately 4 times and i have never seen another movie like it again,i saw some of the comments on it but the movie was about the same people who were married
1,elke sommer is great as the lead but he was the best in,elke tourneur has always found a better way to pass the time
1,oddly enough the plot is as much an agatha christie vehicle as the characters,oddly a woman who had never met her father and said something like that
1,the story is really a simple and simple idea but at least that was some point and the plot just,the first time i saw this i was hooked and had heard the real thing before watching the movie
1,many of the reviewers who are complaining about it being the worst i have seen,many of the reviews here mention the movie 's plot and its reliance on a true
1,i was a little puzzled after watching the show,i am not saying it was a great movie but
1,fantastic acting and a lot of good,fantastic movie to see the way
1,soap opera was the only movie i remember,soap opera is not just a movie but a
1,apparently the director forgot to show up a few,apparently this was the case the only time
1,i thought it was a very interesting and original film,i think the reason it took a good 2 for me
1,i would say this movie really sucks because it seems so good,i do not believe any of the actors who did n't care much
1,and as the film unfolds we do n't know what 's going on,and the movie starts well in a very nice and funny way
1,this is a very funny movie,this film is about the best you
1,there are no other scenes and no great songs,there was something really nice about this movie
1,the whole family does n't even care about themselves,the movie is a good idea not to be taken
1,i have always been fascinated by this film and i was surprised to find it at the same time as i would like,i do n't know why it 's a bit too old for it though but the characters are very realistic as well
1,the film is a classic of the highest magnitude and its one that,the film is a great piece of work and a good movie
1,i do n't know how these folks get such bad reviews,i think i should have given the movie more credit
1,even in the final battle in july 2001 we can learn to see how it 's possible,even if it 's a spoof there 's not a lot of blood or gore in the first
1,an old friend of mine who was a huge fan of the original show the tv had a lot,an interesting note of how it ends with that of the hero in one sequence in the middle
1,insinuating the fact that it was not for people who wanted to see something to see a great show,insinuating in the beginning of the movie the hero 's daughter dies and he 's having his way
1,if that were n't enough it was n't enough,if you do n't want to have a laugh and
1,explaining the plot line of his son who is the son,explaining all of his past is the story of him
1,overall the movie is good for a rainy day but the acting from the actors is excellent,overall a decent film with plenty of laughs lots of nudity lots of nudity some nudity and a
1,instead all you 'll see is just,instead it looks like a movie
1,i have a soft spot for the movie and this is one of the few of the movies that i have seen the first year,i was expecting the best i 'll come out of the theater but the film is a bit too slow and the characters are n't as
1,i think its a little hard on her side and she is not,i had n't seen it but i did enjoy seeing it in an hour
1,it really does not seem very clear,it is an insult to both films
1,i do n't know why they did n't have to do more of the acting,i would recommend watching this film on a rainy day night alone and it 's just
1,instead we have two sisters who are,instead it was just another movie
1,some of his films include some of his own but then his films are pretty boring too,some of the characters in here seemed more real in the case of the book than the plot
1,i was shocked that the makers of this film chose such films as the last,i did n't see the movie at the time but i was n't disappointed
1,actually the whole thing seemed so stupid,actually the first time the mummy returns from
1,for a movie that i think was a little better there is not much to this one,for the rest of the movie izo is a film with no real sense of time in the
1,not even with a cast that could n't be so good,not only is this a great movie but i can imagine it
1,at first you should n't have read the book,at first sight and a bit of a bad film
1,this one is about the real deal of life and how,this film was one of the funniest of the 1980s
1,this film shows a lot of violence and nudity,this is what i like about the characters in the
1,learn that the young man is a woman who wants her back to the house and the mother has to get to her house,learn from the very first opening shot of the world the movie was pretty good but it just could n't have been done and is
1,the movie is also very entertaining in it 's own right,the film opens with a group of kids taking in the town
1,his role is a bit over the top but the movie,his acting style of timing and physical expression was amazing
1,the acting is terrible the directing is bad,the only saving grace for me was how a
1,egan is a young and beautiful woman who is determined to marry her father in an attempt to seduce her but a very poor,egan 's performance is one of the worst performances of the movie to put her in the mix of her oscar nominated performance
1,i was very surprised when he appeared at,i had my doubts about this movie
1,from the very start i realized that there was some serious humor but nothing really,from an early appearance the viewer is not able to find anything in singapore
1,this is the one that made this movie and in my opinion the best one i 've seen in a long long,this movie is about the same and the people who make these kinds of films do not take advantage of them
1,why did n't they get to the apartment,why was this film made at all
1,which is why he never really has a vision he,which i would rather watch on the video shelf
1,avoid this movie like a plague,avoid like the plague unless you are
1,howard hawks is the main star but it is hard to accept that he is the first man to ever,howard hughes as a man that has to be in his element to survive the death of her husband
1,i could easily guess more about him in a way and not wanting,i was not expecting the usual sex scene or sex scenes to show that
1,anyway this is an absolute treat,anyway it is also a shame to
1,when i watched the movie again it still made me want to,when a movie is a remake of thunderball it does nothing
1,was n't the film supposed to be a joke of the genre,was it necessary to make a movie about a girl named patty the
1,i think this was an interesting project for,i am very disappointed this time around
1,oh so if you are a fan of the,oh and it 's not all that bad
1,there 's a lot of action scenes including a shootout in which the girl is lying,there is a lot of violence in it but it 's just not as entertaining
1,this is not a classic it 's just,this movie was a waste of time
1,although there is a bit of gore it 's a film that is not only the most compelling and disturbing,although the story has a great deal of laughs and its humour is sometimes lacking in the action sequences
1,lovely is the best thing to do about this film the acting,lovely but not a film of one of america 's greatest
1,i 've seen a lot worse and have n't,i really hope they do not ruin it
1,the first half of the film is about to go after you,the movie is really boring and has more holes in it than the
1,whilst they were not the same age i did but the movie did manage to capture my interest,whilst some of the scenes were shot as part of his early film he has made a very good
1,but i 've never been so touched by the movie i have the feeling that it is in fact,but you 'll see that you wo n't be able to keep your ears at all the more
1,a film that i would recommend to anyone,a must see for any family fan
1,there is so much wrong with this film,there is a lot of blood and gore to
1,it 's a bit of a shame since i 've been a fan of,it is about some kind of alien who has been destroyed to kill
1,in other words the movie is pretty much an exercise in exploring a subject of the holocaust,in this film there was a bit of humor and it would have been very entertaining
1,i'm sorry i did but i could have done a lot better,i'm not a fan of the series but the movie was pretty boring
1,this is the film that makes the film such a success it,this is one of the most entertaining films of all times
1,the script is not a drama but the story is pretty good and the plot is quite interesting,the acting was n't much more special the characters were n't very good either the characters were flat and
1,he 's not the first guy to,he seems to like that too
1,none of it is very much an action,none of the actors ever made mention
1,the acting was good with some of the better actors in his early career,the plot involves a bunch of teenagers who have to kill the evil of the
1,and if this is a real flaw,and the ending was pretty weak
1,granted this film is a complete waste of time and the money to go see it,granted if you like action movies and movies like this you can really enjoy this movie and
1,the film has been released on a limited budget for distribution and is currently on the lookout for a feature length movie about a very very good film that makes it,the film has some nice photography and the story of the story 's secrets in the past while being a bit predictable to boot is that it does n't matter
1,i 've seen worse films from this director,i am a huge fan of the books and
1,the whole concept of the story as a whole is the,the story concerns the two sisters and their interactions together
1,otherwise i could n't take a break to,otherwise it is a pretty standard movie
1,you do n't have to watch this to understand what happens on television,you have to think that this movie is a bit like a cross between
1,so when i found the movie and liked it i thought maybe,so he and the rest of the film is pretty dull
1,the acting is ok too bad i think it would 've been worse,the script by richard o 'donnell and his collaborator john dillinger is one of
1,it has to also be the first film in its genre the movie is a real,it was a movie which had an interesting plot to it and a few twists
1,there is no real life in this movie which is what the,there were some good parts but that 's just too much
1,because you 'd have an inkling of what to expect as a,because it 's not really that bad it 's just bad
1,from all the hype to the movie,from the opening sequence to the final credits
1,and what do we know from the director,and the ending is a real downer
1,this is not only the most compelling,this is a really great adventure
1,i just finished watching this movie on cable late night cinemax and i did n't have high hopes for this movie,i am glad that i was on the verge of seeing this film for the first time in many decades
1,makeout with this movie is like a cross between the two,makeout with the other characters in this film is the fact that
1,i love how the movie tries to get a bit,i am glad that the dvd was finally restored
1,while the film has some moments with the best scene in the film that is so incredibly boring that it 's funny to watch,while a great movie it is good as long as i 've seen it 's share of comedy but i do n't get a chance
1,apart from the overall asides in this movie there are some minor lapses in this story a few minor glitches with the final showdown between inman and the daughter of a friend who is n't very attractive,apart from having a big budget the actors who have chosen the roles are not bad and the bad guys make good use of a few good points while the rest of the cast is wasted
1,on paper this is n't a bad film but a,on the other hand the movie was not great
1,great movie and good entertainment value with,great film is a big disappointment
1,the film has more than an hour of duration the film 's pace is not quite a steady ending and a lot of the,the story is about a girl who is sent back to her old school where they do n't seem to care at all
1,it 's so good that you want to take your brain off the screen,it is a great story and a must see for all young viewers
1,i thought this was a fun film with good performances but it was not as good as the original,i do n't think i 've ever heard of this film again and again at least the one that makes
1,the film is a complete waste,the story is not the best either
1,it had me smiling on the floor of the room but in,it is a complete experience to sit through the entire movie
1,there were lots of good action sequences with some cool acting but,there 's nothing wrong with that but it never gets boring
1,the film is a little slow but there are a few of the elements such as that one,the characters look like they were reading and the story itself was just plain stupid and stupid
1,and if you are thinking about renting this film you are not sure if there 's a reason to want to see this masterpiece,and in fact when you think that all is needed to go on a rampage they all come out of this bag with some friends
1,the first part is a good one,the plot was simple and the whole concept
1,while the film itself is quite interesting the film also lacks the feel that one might expect from the,while i was n't particularly impressed by the movie i was expecting it to be a horror movie
1,it 's a shame to see him in such a horrible film,it 's hard to make a movie so powerful and this film has
1,but the plot is not too bad,but the most memorable part of this film
1,the plot was a good one,the film 's plot is very simple
1,if this was n't enough it is n't,if you like to waste your time with this
1,the plot concerns two women who decide to go to italy to visit,the acting was so bad that it 's actually funny to see
1,alright so the movie 's main drawback is the direction of the movie itself as,alright i know it sounds like a low budget but it 's really bad
1,if you want a good movie with a lot of action and action sequences you should enjoy this one,if they made the mistake at acting in the original i could not have missed a beat to it
1,i was also delighted to see how much the director knew it was n't even remotely suspenseful and was quite simply boring,i do n't recall the original film from the opening scene but i'm guessing i was watching a documentary with the same title
1,ps the movie is not very bad but its really bad,ps and a few of the scenes the movie has been done
1,to make matters worse the film is also a very nice film with some good action sequences and a cool twist at,to sum up the movie it is the film and the story and the story and characters that were never resolved
1,by the end the movie is so predictable,by the end i could n't get into another
1,the music by leonard is very annoying and the music score is absolutely horrendous,the film is a little long and the story is quite a little more enjoyable
1,next time he is going to do some things he 's not going to be,next up the road trip to another town with a small town in the middle of
1,as the movie opens you learn that the killer is actually a vampire and he has some good friends,as for the rest of my youth i have been looking for an adult swim to come from a child
1,still it was n't a movie that needed to,still it 's an enjoyable and enjoyable experience
1,she did it right and did n't do her job,she is the kind of woman she gets to go with
1,if you do get the message that this is a film that is a very,if it were n't enough in the opening scenes it would be as simple
1,the film is set in a futuristic mansion where the hero 's life is revealed he would go down the,the whole thing is just a bunch of bad guys and then their friends get together and have sex
1,it 's really a shame this is n't a sequel to a movie which is a real shame,it 's a pity as the only movie that made its point of view is so bad
1,the movie begins to become a success in the genre,the story is about a woman who goes to india and
1,okay maybe i am the same with the movie,okay you can tell this one is the best movie
1,however i was surprised that he got the role he,however the film did n't even make much sense
1,thus you just know that the film is a comedy,thus the story takes us into the woods with a couple
1,this is one of the worst movies i 've seen,this movie makes no compromises and is quite predictable
1,this movie could easily have done a much better job of acting but it 's not much more than a bad horror flick,this movie made me want to see it again and then my friends were on a trip to the video store when it was
1,if i had the opportunity to see this movie in the first place i could n't find a reason to read it,if you want it on your tv screen show for the first time if you 're a fan of this show and i
1,still it is n't a total loss that makes it even harder to get into,still the movie was a good idea and it made a very good movie
1,al pacino as a tough man who comes to the town to help him find a peaceful woman on her deathbed,al lewis plays the part of sheriff who takes his clothes for granted and has a lot of fun but that is
1,this movie is one that i can see at least once,this movie is n't even as bad as it was
1,urmila was not a good actress,urmila does n't seem to have a
1,this show is a total disgrace,this movie is a very good film
1,flora is a good actress and i do n't know if i am just a small,flora 's performance is the main character the film is a perfect example of why
1,i have to say that i have not been impressed,i do n't think anyone could actually see this
1,not just a few examples it 's about two hours before they have left,not only did he not make a movie appearance but they did n't
1,the first half is about as exciting as the movie 's opening moments but,the movie starts out like a typical action movie with an extended plot
1,he 's the best thing to come out of this picture,he 's the man who has to come to him
1,the film is n't as interesting as i expected it to happen and if it were n't enough i would not have left in the,the only redeeming feature of this production is the photography of the scenes which is so powerful i could n't believe any of it
1,maybe it is the fact that some people are so disgusted with their lives that they do n't want to go to the nearest church of the,maybe the movie was a bit too long for its tastes and for the majority of the audience members the audience is taken seriously for it
1,so the film is just about a bunch of,so do n't bother to buy the dvd
1,it is the most entertaining movie i have seen in quite some time,it 's all about the fact that the movie never fails to make a
1,think of this movie like beckham the movie is n't even that great at all,think about it i suppose there was a lot of potential to do a bit of
1,yet another thing i can say is that the main problem of this film is the,yet she 's so charming that you cannot help thinking she 's a good movie
1,throughout the entire series i really liked the film and thought it might make a better story than the original,throughout the movie the viewer realizes that the film might have made a lot too much of a good movie and
1,along with a nice cast the story is great and the actors are all solid although not too impressive to the,along the way he meets his father a young man who is the first of her life to love her
1,the film is a total waist of my time and money,the music is beautiful and haunting in its own right
1,but i ca n't even think of a true reason to watch it,but you really start to realize that the movie is n't as good as
1,i do n't mind the actors but,i love it i love it
1,genuinely it 's a shame that it ended up,genuinely this movie is not worth the time
1,cagney 's performance in the film 's lead is a fine one as well but the film seems to,cagney 's character is also one of the most famous and interesting actors ever i 'd recommend it
1,this is the movie about a group of young teenagers from the past who are sent by the cops to get the job on the road they live with,this story was also a good one though the acting was good although i was n't impressed with the acting and story the direction was not as good as the
1,it 's a very interesting story with some,it had a lot going for it
1,instead of a lot of good things i would have liked to see,instead it was just that they had to work up a notch
1,after seeing him this was his job he made the film a success to me and he,after all these two characters were n't even the ones to be developed as i was
1,totally absent from the first one and even,totally devoid of any depth or intelligence
1,but even the plot is so bad the dialogue is ridiculous the movie does n't make you laugh cry or cry,but there are too many characters in this movie that were really bad and there not even enough of them
1,and then the final battle scene is quite good,and as the film progressed the movie ended abruptly for
1,while i had read the other review on the movie this movie is a complete waste of time,while this was not the greatest of the series i can think of to be a total waste of
1,it would have been nice to see a man who,it 's a great movie that has been made
1,the acting is excellent and the story keeps a few surprises,the director is not afraid to make his own movie
1,you can watch this film without any preconceived notions,you have to think that he could not act
1,unfortunately the rest of the production is n't that bad,unfortunately in the middle of the film you realize that the
1,which is a very clever way to go see this film,which i loved the first time i saw it was a bit
1,that does not stop the movie from being a bad movie,that the plot is about the same name that they wrote with
1,roger ebert has a few lines,roger corman has done a pretty good
1,twolane blacktop is a film about how the war against the,twolane blacktop is a good film not to be missed
1,it is a shame for anyone who is ever familiar enough,it had all the ingredients of a great action picture
1,the main premise of the movie is that it is supposed to be a parody of the horror genre as,the only reason why this movie is so awesome is it is made in the year 3000 years before
1,this is a classic film that will appeal to everyone,this is a story that moves from a completely believable to
1,i really enjoyed that there was nothing,i love this movie a lot
1,having watched it several times over the last couple,having seen it i would n't be surprised
1,cowboy bebop is just a poor excuse for a,cowboy bebop is the best of the series
1,the script is just a bunch of dumb characters,the director did not want to give up on the
1,by the time the characters are talking in the scene the director has a knack for the killer for,by the way the only thing missing is the ending the main plot twist which really sucks you
1,i 've been a fan of this movie before,i was so confused that i actually paid money to
1,the film is very well paced and the director,the director is a master of the genre
1,alejandro jodorowsky 's novel is a classic,alejandro amenbar directs another brilliant film
1,my only regret is that this is what is so important,my wife and i watched this movie with my parents
1,i am so disappointed that i have the slightest idea about the film,i love the fact that i do not want to see a lot of
1,when the film 's final verdict on the cover says it 's a,when i first saw this movie i was about 15 years old
1,as far as i have seen in my life this is a,as far as i know it could not be more interesting
1,this film will make you laugh at your heartstrings,this is one of the best comedies that i have
1,she 's very sexy and the girl is,she was n't a very good actress
1,i would have preferred it if i had n't spent the,i just want to say this is a good film
1,i saw this in the theater when i was a kid with the first 10 and a half,i was so intrigued about it that i decided i would only watch it for the scenery
1,stupid dialogue and a ridiculous performance,stupid to say that it 's not
1,it 's almost as if the director did n't get that right,it 's a movie about two women who come together with each other
1,for a long time in which a young boy can get pregnant by his,for anyone who likes movies that are n't in a very funny way
1,victor mclaglen plays his part with dignity,victor was a great character and was so
1,you can only guess this is the greatest action,you 've got to give me a break
1,the characters all are killed and the ending seems too random,the script has all the weaknesses of a great movie
1,what the hell was so cool about,what a terrible movie that was
1,this movie is the exact opposite it is very hard to take,this movie is n't a masterpiece it is n't a good one
1,the movie is a very poor movie and not worth spending too much time exploring to anyone,the film has no real plot to be had it 's flaws the direction is terrible the plot
1,a very funny and entertaining romp about a killer,a very well acted and well written film
1,it 's a little sad to see the original version but it 's also a very good film,it 's a film about people living on the streets that can be found by the other people
1,it 's a little jarring to say the least,it 's a bit of an action movie
1,old fashioned and the same goes on the,old fashioned black white and very little
1,his best friend tom is trying to stop his mother who was sent into prostitution,his brother has been dumped in a prison by a local officer and his wife and
1,simply put there is nothing new here that is n't as good as the first episode but the film,simply put there are some other characters that do n't seem to care if they were good enough
1,finally i have no choice but as a film buff i do enjoy it but in fact i'm the,finally a group of people decide to use a device to escape their bodies from a nuclear holocaust
1,she 's also a good actress but,she 's a pretty good woman
1,in short it was a waste of time,in fact the whole movie is a bit boring
1,like the other reviewers i saw them and i think they should see this film,like most people this film does not get an academy award nomination it has to rank
1,the film is about a gay couple who have inherited their lives,the film is full of clichs that make you think and make you
1,i do n't know why i wanted to get to see a movie,i have to say that i would like to see what the director did
1,by his own standards and the fact that they all have been on a train station he 's not trying to kill anyone in sight to make it,by the time i saw that the character was introduced to a child named delia we found ourselves wishing that she could make a movie for the character of
1,i have seen thousands of movies made by a director that has made a huge statement,i would like to know more people like me but i did n't get it
1,after i finished watching a preview i was surprised to see that it looked very bad,after all it seems that this is the only part i do n't really appreciate
1,the script is great the script is very strong,the movie was shot on a budget with the lighting
1,a group of scientists led by a deranged scientist named,a man that has no interest in finding out
1,i'm afraid that the people who made this movie could n't,i'm not going to ruin this movie as i have
1,i am not sure if i should n't have been,i had to wait for the movie to end
1,benign love is the story of a boy who has escaped from a murder to avenge a mysterious,benign love story is a movie about the power and the fall that they have to overcome
1,i would have been surprised if this movie had been shot and released,i was in for a surprise when i realized that there was something to
1,they do the opposite thing about the,they 're not at all believable
1,for instance the opening montage of the movie in which the film switches to a great pace of suspense is a definite shame for me,for those of you who have not seen it see it as much as i'm glad i will give my children a good deal of fun
1,in the end of the day is a movie with a lot of plot holes and,in the book they all seem a bit uncomfortable because they have all of them
1,this is one of the worst movies ever made,this is an excellent series and one that i hope
1,that 's right it 's a bad movie but it is one of the best of the bunch,that is n't a great deal of money on this film to do but to those who do n't
1,hacks a movie that has been criticized for the art of the genre for a thousand years as the story is a little bit different,hacks and other nationalities and the people that killed a woman 's family were killed for a few minutes and so that the whole film had
1,peta a good actor with his usual hair is really amazing but he gets in trouble with his wife,peta is a very funny movie which should n't only work out but it is very good to see the
1,yet he is n't the only thing that really seems to be the point of the script and the story is that,yet as the film continues we get an explanation that is there is not much of the dialogue to be found
1,the first was pretty good but it just did n't work for me,the plot is a bit hard to follow and it drags you into the
1,this film is an embarrassment to watch,this is a very good film and i
1,a few days later she has an affair with a,a good cast including a very attractive young actress
1,like a lot of the movies you can do a lot of them at,like a bad movie the director of photography is very close to reality
1,walker and his friends are in trouble but the only real threat to any of the other people is the fact that the movie is a true,walker is a man who is n't very funny but his character is so stupid and so annoying that it 's so painful to watch him
1,there is no need to see anything approaching it so that does the best it does,there 's a scene in the film when he throws out a cigarette and the scene where
1,adam is so cute and so cute that i feel sick for the actor of the film,adam 's acting is a bit of a let down to any of any other players i have
1,the only person who really is one that could do with a,the film has an excellent plot good characters and fantastic music
1,how did the director and producer manage to create a movie,how could you know that in the first 10 minutes
1,elvira 's character is the only thing i love,elvira is one of the best actors around
1,yawns that i had no qualms that i had a chance to get the movie down,yawns i think it is that the two main actors were n't all that bad
1,anyone who says the film is n't bad and has an inordinate understanding of,anyone interested in the movie would have seen this film a little more
1,i was n't looking forward to an oscar,i think he should have been more
1,a lot of the film takes place in the early 1980s as it moves into,a must see for those who likes good films and this is a mustsee
1,he 's not an original person at all,he is in the film for all of its
1,the movie opens with a girl getting a job for a car accident,the story begins with a somewhat interesting premise of the same name being used
1,the film does seem to be the same one that we 've,the film is about a young girl who is a teenager
1,my advise avoid this stinker at all costs,my favorite wife is the aunt of a child
1,i would n't waste my money on watching it,i was so bored and happy i was n't laughing
1,hack does n't know how to deal with the situation the,hack was a very good movie and i loved it
1,the movie itself is very slow and slow paced and does n't make a whole lot of sense,the main character a girl who had a daughter is a woman and an underaged woman who 's been
1,the acting is n't too bad and the script and acting is terrible,the film was so predictable and boring that it 's almost like watching a
1,the story line has an interesting premise and the actors are all good,the movie does a good job of dealing with the complexities of the human
1,this is a classic and a mustsee to fans,this movie has a nice sense of humor
1,as for the other characters in their roles there is some time when he appears in the same movie as the ones that are the first movie in the series and the first one was really really good,as to why it was released theatrically released on vhs it 's one of the best i have had a great deal of time as i can remember that one of the best movies i 've seen in years
1,the film is a very interesting documentary about the lives of several,the film also has the best elements of the original series
1,so i have n't seen it before,so the movie is about as much of
1,the film starts off well but the action sequences seem contrived,the film is an insult to the viewer 's intelligence
1,it was an enjoyable way to spend money to make sure that it is a movie of course,it 's almost impossible to describe why it would be like this one to think it was a sequel
1,everyone who is familiar with the history of the genre and knows who the film,everyone involved in this atrocity could n't possibly decide to make a better film
1,i was in a state of depression with her in this film,i think it is one of the funniest movies out there
1,i do n't have time to tell myself why,i saw this movie many years ago and it 's
1,judging by this film there is a certain amount of gore in this film,judging by a lack of talent it would be nice to see the movie with
1,and this time there was no real threat at any point,and the ending with the main female protagonist being played by a
1,this movie was a very disappointing effort to sit through,this film is not as good as it can be and
1,the movie is a perfect mix of the two genres,the script is so terrible you do n't need to listen
1,it is a very sad movie that is as much as one could have liked,it is a movie that can be appreciated for people who enjoys movies that do n't
1,the movie starts out slow and slow but there 's really much to enjoy there,the movie is a great example of why you have n't seen it in a cinema
1,an attempt at humor is also evident,an old lady has a dream
1,similarly the acting is terrible as usual although it still was n't really a horror movie,similarly the acting is horrible the editing is awful and the characters just are n't interesting
1,anyway the movie is so bad that they just ca,anyway that 's how bad the whole movie is
1,i 've seen some really bad stuff in my time,i do n't think they were supposed to be
1,it has a very good cast,it 's like watching a tv game
1,at least it was a little bit too old and,at the beginning the show is a big hit
1,may or may not be the greatest,may i forget the first film
1,the only thing worth mentioning is the music but i,the acting is excellent and the writing is fantastic
1,their relationship is so much better than the rest of the characters,their father had a lot of money and a nice wife
1,i could n't help but laugh when kutcher 's character comes out of the blue,i ca n't believe the people who commented on this film thought it was a decent
1,director robert deniro is very funny and i would give the movie a 910,director paul naschy was a fine writer and director who did this much better
1,she 's not really a bad actress but she 's really,she has to be one of my favorite characters ever
1,it 's also the first movie that could have been better made better by the,it 's just as awful as the other movies of the 80 's like
1,the movie has an extended cameo and some actors are n't as good either as they are playing a role,the first of the three myrtle differentiate a lot more in an older style than any one of them
1,thus there was a lot of potential,thus in the middle of the film there
1,i did not care for the main characters,i think this was going to be a movie
1,from a technical standpoint the movie is very much like it,from all this i 've had my doubts and opinions but i
1,the characters all have a certain motivation for a good one and the story is just too contrived,the movie was a complete joke from start to finish and in my opinion the whole thing was shot
1,in the end this film is a must see,in fact i 've just seen the mst3k version
1,i think that this is the best movie i have seen in a long time,i had no idea why she is so good as a young girl and the supporting
1,actually i would not recommend it to anyone who 's,actually they do have a lot of good lines
1,valerie delpy is an extremely talented actress and has a great acting career in her role,valerie alba looks like she had no ability and to do a movie about her acting career
1,i have a theory that you have seen the first,i ca n't believe how bad this movie was
1,moore 's film is an excellent achievement of his own,moore is a great actor and is a perfect choice for
1,mani ratnam is n't always the director,mani ratnam 's direction is superb
1,as far as action goes it was very much like it 's predecessor or maybe it 's still a little slow that this is n't a bad,as a child of the time and place of our youth it 's hard to say that any of them is really not an excellent actor
1,you can tell that the director director wanted to put a whole lot of time and effort into a,you 've never heard of it before but there is a whole lot going on for this series
1,somehow the film is filled with scenes that do not make sense or are n't so real,somehow that was only to blame for a few moments in which this film was released from the
1,i was expecting it to be a spoof,i saw this movie at new zealand television in
1,if you liked a bad movie and do n't have any expectations this movie will probably be for you to see,if you 're an american movie fan or are interested in watching movies for a few hours then you 'll be disappointed
1,george c scott 's character is so stupid that it is difficult to see how he can actually be so funny,george c scott plays a character with a bad accent to say and he 's a great actor a good guy and
1,each character is either completely stupid or a caricature of characters,each story is very good and this one does n't make the
1,he 's not the only person who has not made it to the end of the movie,he is not in the least bit of a nut or he is in the presence of the
1,to sum this up i have to mention that i am a big fan of anime,to add insult to injury the two girls manage to get him to the island and get
1,the story was a complete failure,the plot line is simple the premise
1,eventually it became apparent why i ca n't find the words in a movie,eventually the movie takes a turn on the first two minutes and then it becomes
1,a lot of the dialogue is n't a bit of a joke,a man with a gun who has never been a victim
1,as for the movie i think the film was n't that gory it 's a film that is really just about an interesting character and it makes an interesting difference,as to what happens when the characters are on the show it becomes a chore to watch and even so if you 're in the mood for a comedy
1,but this film will probably be forgotten as the worst of the genre and certainly not enough,but then he has no problem with the script and is n't the best movie ever made
1,they are a group of characters from the planet a very likable,they 're going to be a bit too much to bear
1,it is an enjoyable film especially in its first half but the first half is a little slow,it is a great little flick a great cast of actors including the excellent brenda vaccaro who plays her
1,but the rest of the cast is all,but then again what was he thinking
1,this episode was the worst i have ever seen,this movie will probably rank as a very pleasant diversion
1,i had heard about the film in the video store but the only problem i can tell you is,i think that it might have been a great movie to see if there could be some controversy
1,kyle is also a good actor as a character that he plays his mother who was an emotional outcast who just loves her husband and who can love her,kyle meets up with mr bumble who has an affair about her family and her parents and how they are connected to a very rich life and they both are
1,we have the idea that a little more than a few of the,we can understand the problems and not the consequences of the story
1,florence is the only real reason for,florence shields does have good acting
1,it 's not as much a case of the real events,it 's just a stupid waste of time and money
1,before the end i had no expectations for what might have been the truth,before a woman with an arrow can only be fired by the local police
1,the film is so funny that i did n't laugh at the whole story,the director should be shot to pieces in the context with a minimum of dialogue
1,if i had n't seen this i would 've seen it on a regular basis and have seen it,if that 's true then you are watching a movie with your friends trying to get to the bottom of
1,everything about this movie is awful except for one thing i liked it but i ca n't wait,everything was just going wrong and they were all trying to get the right thing to get it out
1,after seeing it i had no idea what to expect,after reading a book of about the novel in the back
1,for all the wrong reasons that i have seen this series has nothing to do with the fact that it shows us how these people do what they,for me this was a good family movie and it was very easy to watch and a must see if you 're a fan of the show
1,however the director does n't think about the problem with the main character or his character,however it was also pretty fun and the movie is very well done to say the least
1,i'm not kidding it 's a great film as i think it 's a,i'm just wondering when it comes from people trying to make a buck
1,if you do n't want me to know what they 're looking for,if i had seen it i would have left it open on my face
1,there 's not enough plot to tell the story and i think that 's how you would want to get,there 's a scene when one is in front of a speeding car which is n't just a flashback
1,although it is a comedy there is some humor in the movie that makes no sense,although there are so many things in her that seem very funny at times it 's a
1,what is even more disturbing are the way the camera moves through his body,what i got a nice ride was the introduction of a young child who 's
1,you can tell from the outset that this is the only film that i have seen i have seen from a different angle,you will see how lucky it was to see the two stars of the film the movie 's only saving grace is that it
1,it is a very moving movie and the story does have some,it was a shame that none of this movie made sense
1,there was a good deal of nudity and nudity here in this film,there 's a lot of bad stuff out there and there 's some nice
1,talking about the music of the music is wonderful,talking about the story as it 's is the only
1,it is not that easy to find a good person but that 's all,it 's like that you have the hankies on my face and you 'll have
1,for those of us who know and love and,for this one the film is quite simple
1,all i have to say is the film is n't that bad it 's not funny it is a,all the kids that have had a child 's house have been locked up for a long time
1,as usual we have to sit through a bit of one of those films on the screen that makes little sense,as for the other characters the plot is ok the characters were stupid and the movie is a complete mess
1,it is hard to tell if this show should be made or available on dvd as part,it is a great documentary with a very subtle view of the subject of the film
1,or why would she go with the other guys and that she,or is she getting the right one to help the film
1,it 's so bad the script is n't bad or even even good enough to make a movie worthwhile,it 's a nice little film with some good acting great cinematography and a gripping climax in which a great
1,my rating is for the film and a 7 out of,my favorite of mine was the way the film ended
1,this was one of the most moving pictures i 've been out of date for over 40 years,this is the third movie i can think of that i have seen over the years since i have
1,it 's the ultimate reason i even considered this movie,it 's an interesting concept for the characters and some very
1,one of the great movies in the history of cinema,one of the best things about this movie that i liked
1,apart from the fact that the story is not about the war of the world the movie has been about a couple of years later a war,apart from a few scenes of violence and sex some moments between darren and belial are not enough to convince the story of an american woman
1,once they were left alone for the weekend they have to go up and,once the bad guys get involved the bad guys start stopping the town
1,linda cardellini 's character is so annoying to say most of the scenes you have seen in my life,linda bassett who plays the role of a woman whose husband gets involved with a married couple is one of
1,i have never seen a movie that has the exact same amount of imagination to it and there can be a bit,i thought this movie was one of the best and it made me feel like i was watching a tv movie
1,rounding the show out for a few seconds of my life,rounding out all of the old movies on a whim
1,the story is based upon the true story of an elderly,the film has a good mix of characters and characters
1,direction was very good with the exception of the first half of the movie,direction direction direction direction editing and cinematography are all top notch all over
1,it 's not that the movie is bad,it has no relation to a sequel
1,first off the plot is pretty dumb and not a good one,first of all is that all is not really a drawback of the
1,once they are shot it does n't have any significance,once you know the title role by the time you 're
1,after the opening credits roll away we see him as the owner of his family,after reading the book the movie 's title seemed to be a reference to the film
1,but the movie itself is so bad that it,but in this regard i was very disappointed
1,for fans who have n't read the book by the way,for a very young and good time watch this movie
1,however this was made to entertain and entertain me for the rest of my life so i,however it is a little too long and you will probably not see it on tv
1,as with the movie and on the dvd cover the film is a complete failure,as far as i'm concerned you should n't be expecting a horror movie with the same
1,the story is not bad and the characters are n't good at all,the film 's plot is n't quite good enough but the acting performances and
1,one of my favorites is that there are so many different films out there but,one of the best things about this movie was the scene between the actors
1,at least the film had to make the audience feel sympathetic about,at least they could have spent the night in the car
1,the movie is very well done and very well done,the plot is very predictable and the story is rather silly
1,this was made during the depression when a young man had a child 's heart and was forced a bit of a,this is a very good movie and should have been viewed by anyone who enjoys the art of the first movie
1,shows like that in the book i do hope for more,shows the real talent of the actors as a whole not a
1,of course the whole thing would have been an improvement in a better hands,of course i would n't really say that i liked it but if i were
1,it 's a nice change from the previous films that made this movie such great,it was made for tv and there were only three things about a movie
1,how many different scenes that were supposed to have,how the grinch is treated to the character
1,the film has a great supporting cast with its cast but they also give it all and more of a boost that is n't as strong as it seems,the movie is n't as bad as other recent efforts like the aforementioned halloween or even the mummy movies but also that it was so much more than this film
1,nothing new i would n't want to be,nothing special but rather a bit scary
1,script is n't a great plot but it could have been much better,script and acting are great but i do n't know what to point this
1,anyone wanting to make a movie based on a book by the author of poe,anyone who is a fan of the genre should find the show very entertaining
1,it would be nice if i would have had,it was the funniest movie of all time
1,if they were n't all bad in this movie they,if not that the script is full of clichs
1,spoilt by some of his best work,spoilt by the war that we had the
1,when the first of the bad boys comes out they are a bunch of idiots that are being chased by an unseen assailant,when i saw this for the first time i was a loving person at a time when the new wave of tv station was
1,in many ways this is a fine film,in a nutshell when you watch this film you
1,the acting is pretty average especially the guy who plays the guy,the director seems to have a little more money than he 's accustomed
1,fonda 's performance as always is quite good,fonda and russell 's chemistry with each other and
1,within an uplifting film noir style is always the same,within the first five minutes there are plenty of scenes involving
1,however it is n't as bad as the other two,however it is quite clear that these two have been together
1,from this point on his journey and the rest of the movie is just padding,from that point i saw i realized what it had to do in order to get
1,forget my goodness and do n't get me wrong i am a big fan of the original,forget about the story but there is a lot of dialogue in this movie that makes it hard
1,the movie was just plain boring,the film is very good the characters
1,don cheadle was a very funny comedian for a movie called a little bit of a comedy,don coscarelli had a very successful job and i thought that this one was a little too ambitious
1,finally it 's a great family movie that does n't make any,finally i was able to enjoy a movie with its characters
1,because it is a comedy that is not funny or anything like this one,because if the film really is a satire of a film that is in the
1,kutcher plays a very very good role as a very intimidating and likable man who has always made a living,kutcher is a young man in town who has a girlfriend 's wife and two sons to his wife
1,it would have been nice to see how they are going to work,it 's like it came out of the tv with two kids
1,it 's a very good film that is n't,it 's a very well paced performance and it was
1,do n't bother to buy the dvd or if you 're interested as one of the best,do n't get me wrong it has to be the worst movie i have ever seen
1,life of the minotaur was a terrible attempt at making a,life and fiction are n't even present in the film
1,did it take us to a place where the,did n't it have that kind of thing
1,also the film does n't work with all,also it does n't make any difference
1,it was so obvious that i was left feeling like something that was going to happen i thought this film was going to be something that would have gone on,it is a movie that will be a lot of fun and i recommend it to anyone who enjoys a film with some mates you ca n't relate to and it
1,as a longtime fan of a great film director i was delighted,as you can tell it is a movie to be sure
1,was he supposed to be a comedy,was it a good movie but it could
1,it would be a lot better to go to see it if it had a bit more money and a better cast,it 's a shame that a remake of this can be released so that can cause a certain amount of money to pay
1,harry dean stanton is the only one who really shines in his role,harry is a great actor but his role is totally unconvincing to the viewer
1,part of the reason why i did n't like this one is the,part ii part iv part of what happened to the young man
1,this film had me rolling in my seat when i realized that,this movie was a very interesting portrayal of the human condition
1,it seems that the producers should be ashamed for this one too much,it has all the best elements and also has one scene a couple of
1,clark gable is a delight to watch,clark gable is a wonderful actor
1,you can tell the difference in the movie is that the movie makers do n't know what to do with it,you 'll be amazed to see how bad he 's when he 's the only one who could really be in the
1,my favorite scene is when the young kid runs a train and runs into a man who is n't even paying a scratch to see the film,my advise to anyone who is ever a fan of the book as i do n't mind a sequel with a few different stories i highly recommend it
1,is an insult to a movie but,is the best way to describe
1,trivial the film does have a lot of plot holes but the story is more like a drama,trivial spoilers ahead of the two films the two were born and saw on tv with an extra of
1,in some ways it is the worst of the films and it has nothing to do with the other movies,in fact the only other character who has ever seen this film was the guy playing the same role he portrays
1,honestly i 've only watched this movie,honestly this is where it belongs
1,i have never seen a film that made me want to see the real thing,i have to admit it 's a very well made movie i recommend it to anyone
1,the film 's plot is a typical runofthemill thriller with some,the film is a mess and a waste of time
1,so we get an interesting idea of how the world,so the film was a complete waste of time
1,just the same time that i have never heard of,just to see how these two guys are in a different
1,i saw the movie yesterday at the chicago film festival when i was young and i do n't,i love the fact that the film was so bad and could 've been a complete mess
1,boman irani is brilliant in his part,boman irani jr who wrote his screenplay is
1,polo is the one who 's always been an alcoholic and is determined to take the risk of doing so,polo is a good movie about a very strong character but not the typical american comedy and you 're in for
1,i do n't think that the movie is a bad idea because it is just a,i have not seen many other films on the subject board since the late 60s
1,the film is very well made and has,the acting is very good as well
1,seriously it was just a boring movie made up,seriously it was a complete waste of time
1,the whole movie was very predictable because you could never see the whole thing,the director tries to make a statement about the subject in which a woman has
1,it also shows the great power that can lead to the,it 's just a poor excuse for a bad movie
1,jeff wincott is n't a bad actor like he did in the original,jeff fahey plays the part of the doctor but it 's just not funny
1,also the movie is not bad,also i was surprised by the lack
1,the film is a comedy a satire for those who enjoy this type of story,the movie also has a lot more interesting characters than most other shows that were done
1,then again it 's not that bad,then it becomes a series of flashbacks with
1,and of course i do n't really know why this has the rockbottom rating to be found,and as for the plot well i do n't know how i could ever have read
1,watching this movie i felt my pain about it was like an accident in the middle of some strange scene in which a woman is trying to,watching it is like watching a movie where you 're in trouble with the plot you get the feeling it was being thrown by the director
1,soon the man who is the only character from the movie was a very tall guy,soon a local policeman is brought over to the village of an orphanage in new jersey and
1,claudette colbert is also good here,claudette colbert and richard burton are excellent
1,with a more subtle tone that is not a very funny one and a great idea,with the help of a good looking cast it is a shame to see him in some
1,my recommendation is if you are a fan of his work or the,my favourite movie in the last 15 min was the last one
1,this is one of hitchcock 's best film,this time there is a bit of hope to
1,an important role was given by john ritter,an insult to the original writer for the production
1,i had to keep watching a few scenes to find the story,i was impressed with this movie for a second time and it was
1,we 're not all that bad either,we do n't have a lot of bad
1,the story is about a bunch of girls who are sent to prison for a camping trip in a small town,the movie starts out interesting and the movie starts with a happy ending but instead of a good story or a good
1,i saw this movie on the sundance dvd last night and it 's,i thought i would find some kind of point to this movie
1,this was my first of many shorts with the same cast and crew,this film was an awful attempt to make a horror movie so i guess
1,enduring to the end of the end the characters are revealed in the end,enduring in the first movie the story is about redemption which is very realistic in
1,running time in the film i was surprised at,running time is a nice film as well
1,the music is quite good as was the whole thing,the film starts off slowly and becomes very tense but the
1,dolemite is an amazing actor that is so believable that it is hard to believe he would be on the side of the camera or show,dolemite has no real character no more motivation than the other actors he is and that is n't really the reason i can believe that the director
1,halloween 2 takes a lot of effort out of this film and manages in,halloween has been a favorite of mine and it 's the best ever
1,this is the kind of movie that does n't make anymore to a film and is a must see,this was one of the first movies to have a budget and was nominated for best special effects
1,and for the record i have the dvd that was in the movie with the sound off and it was pretty good,and the scene where he says that she is going to be a little better than this movie is beyond me
1,robert deniro and the always reliable anthony scott are great,robert redford is the real reason i think the entire film
1,a movie that is so funny and fun and even touching if,a very young woman is the youngest daughter of the family
1,there are lots of laughs in the film but it 's,there 's nothing else that you want to be in
1,my favorite scene is when one of the main characters asks his son for a ride that,my favorite character was the one who played jesus and it is a very good example
1,disney 's movie has been done to death in the,disney was not afraid to put this one together
1,nor does she take the time to get a,nor do they have to make a movie
1,dutch 's father who 's been killed but has to be a ruthless judge who,dutch 's music here is also great and the music and dance is excellent
1,another one of the few movies i 've seen that i liked over the years,another one that makes the story even more of a mess of a series of the
1,i have n't read the book nor seen the novel by this movie i think,i did have the chance to watch this movie as a child for the first time
1,the story is set in a small country town in london where people live their lifestyle to be a bunch of,the plot involves a serial killer stalking people with a secret that is in his possession of a corrupt detective
1,a very well written story that is worth mentioning,a good film for all the right reasons
1,it is the only way of life as if that 's something,it 's so stupid in places that it feels like nothing
1,my only complaint was the lack of any interest in the screenplay,my favourite song is when he sings a song and then he plays
1,while i liked the fact that it was not a comedy this is more of,while i think we 've seen him in all films he 's very funny
1,youngish actors of a variety of successful actors are fine and the cinematography is flawless as well,youngish in the past is a character who is very talented of her age in the first
1,it was a complete waste of time a waste of an hour i wasted watching it,it 's a lot of fun to watch but if you have n't already seen the series
1,wow what a shame that this movie,wow that 's a nice idea
1,watching the film is what makes it stand out from most recent films,watching it i was amazed to find it a pretty funny flick and it
1,ps they do n't have much,ps this is a horrible movie
1,ving rhames is perfect for his role,ving rhames is a brilliant actor
1,although it is not perfect or deep on the movie it could be quite an entertaining picture,although the film is not about a group of people and their relationship it seems they have been
1,why did a good film like this one do n't do that,why are they in the middle east that they get in trouble with
1,it has the same feel of a high school play but that was it,it 's a shame because as a film this was the greatest one
1,if you 're looking for a film to try and see how it is going to,if you are into this sort of thing you will definitely enjoy this movie too
1,it 's just like watching a soap opera,it 's a shame that people who know that
1,but this movie is just one of those movies that you really really wanted to enjoy,but this is no problem for the poor kid who is not quite as impressive as the
1,overall this is a film which does n't require a great cast to make it watchable,overall i was shocked by the film 's flaws the acting was good and the music was
1,the plot is n't so bad its hard to follow in the slightest but it makes for a good ride,the first of the four yuki films is a true story of the repercussions of a young man 's struggle with
1,kal ho naa ho is an awesome movie,kal connery gives one of his best performances as
1,i am a huge fan of john carpenter 's work,i 've always been a fan of david bradley
1,etc it 's a film about an aging young man,etc this movie sucks and is n't really bad
1,the movie is so bad that it is almost impossible to believe a movie made such,the only thing that was left was the movie 's message of the first film
1,combine in the cast with the likes of the two main leads alice joan collins michael douglas,combine the title and you have an awful plot line the film is a complete mess
1,the plot was a bit of an idea but it,the acting is horrible and the script is stupid
1,i saw the film and liked it,i saw this film when i was 17
1,the movie follows the adventures of a young boy whose life and his daughter 's problems in life,the movie 's story is about a man in prison where her father 's life is intertwined
1,the plot is about a group of four young teenagers who work to a mansion,the ending is not so bad the acting is so bad it makes you wonder why
1,in my opinion they should have done more to the story they tried,in my opinion it is not only the acting ability for the characters the
1,camp 's movie has some pretty interesting characters,camp and the beast is about a killer snowman
1,note the film is very well shot,note what was that all about
1,given that the film was made for the first time in fact,given the title song i 'd suggest the movie is set
1,yes the story has a great premise,yes it 's a little hokey with the
1,9 the movie itself is a mess and a lot of people get excited,9 the plot is so simple that i ca n't even figure out whether it
1,truly an excellent show to watch,truly i think the filmmakers wanted that
1,the story concerns a mysterious scientist that goes to his,the acting is excellent and the characters work wonderfully
1,but the acting was n't great and the writing were very poor,but in other words this is the film that is supposed to be
1,this story is about two hours,this movie is a very very good
1,the acting is a little too high and the plot is very good,the film follows the adventures of a man 's life and a woman who
1,scientist is very upset as to why he was n't going to kill,scientist was a bad guy who was the only thing they had
1,it 's not as powerful as some of the other comments on here,it is about a man who gets caught up in a murder mystery in
1,the only real drawback was the way the story was changed,the only redeeming feature is the fact that the movie was shot
1,the movie does make you laugh like a bunch of people,the acting is n't great either but i ca n't help but
1,david duchovny was a good actor but his character was so bland so,david lynch 's direction is superb and his performance is very good
1,prote is a man who wants to,prote 's daughter is very different
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life,this one is so bad it 's funny it 's just hilarious
1,apart from the fact that it has an almost hypnotic score it was n't even that good either,apart from the occasional sex scene i have seen all the movie in my life and i 've ever
1,this movie is no excuse for any movie,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,gordon is a little too long for this and it shows,gordon pegg 's the butcher and the duke of undress
1,but in the end what a waste of talent and money,but the movie is also a bit of a bore
1,to be fair he has a talent in it but he 's not quite right,to say that i would have been surprised that it had been produced by a new
1,i think that is what makes her good,i saw a screening of this on tv the
1,i have seen a lot of bad movies but none of them are,i do n't want to go away with it but i do
1,the film starts off interestingly enough with the obligatory ending that the audience has to endure in,the first half hour is a complete piece of crap that has a lot more depth
1,i think that if the writers were trying to explain something different from other film adaptations and then they are going to get,i think the producers should have tried it to make sense of the movie in order to make some serious horror movies
1,but the movie is still one of the worst movies i have seen,but there is a lot of great action scenes that are funny
1,muddled with a few subplots but the dialogue is very good,muddled and poorly paced it is not a great movie either
1,the movie is about three girls in a city who,the movie is a lot of fun to watch
1,rhett 's character seemed so stupid to me that i,rhett was just a jerk in the last film
1,it 's not that i do n't really get it,it has some cool gore scenes the best scenes i have
1,i'm sorry i had to go to the theater,i'm a big fan of all the genre 's genre
1,i did not find it in a very interesting way to start the film but i had to watch the movie to find out about,i am not one to give the movie a higher rating but i would not recommend it to a wide audience of any kind
1,this is just a bad bad movie,this is one of those rare movies i
1,the characters are really great and i really liked seeing,the story is about two friends who have sex
1,he 's not an actor or actor that is so awful that it makes you,he makes one of his better appearances and this is one of my favorites
1,it is one of the great movies ever made,it 's just plain funny to sit through
1,they have no chemistry between all the members of the cast,they 're in the same predicament as in one of the best
1,i do n't even think there is a lot,i would love to see this film again
1,ken and his friend jesse are both young and very handsome at the same time,ken russell is good as the evil man who gets a job in the form of
1,overall i would give this film a 110 because i could have done better,overall this movie is pretty good and i can only recommend it to any fan
1,maclane plays the same role as the other three musketeers the epitome of one of,maclane is a fine actor and that is because he is a real star
1,they are both a good actor in many ways this,they do n't have a lot more screen time
1,whether it 's in a film noir or not in a foreign language and the other 's attitudes is,whether you should try to tell you that or not will be as bad as you might think
1,if you 're an adolescent or not to see it you must be a little bit,if i had to be a good man i would n't say much about it
1,once you have seen the film it 's just a bit of an endurance test for a thriller which is n't really a good,once you 're a big fan of the classic disney 's this is definitely better than the first time i had seen it
1,instead a group of guys decide to travel on their honeymoon on one night of the honeymoon while the other two,instead i got more of an emotional rollercoaster ride and a lot of fun and a little of a plot
1,very good film that will leave you,very interesting and very very funny
1,suddenly in an american landscape there is a huge number of people in the world and there 's the hope that they must survive,suddenly the plot is told in flashback that the audience is introduced to an evil spirit that turns out to be the one
1,i think the idea of this film is that it might have made the movie more enjoyable but alas not enough there 's nothing to hold,i would like to be able to relate to what i saw in movies but i do n't want it to be anything but boring
1,that 's what the critics of this film are all about,that was the only thing that bothered me from the getgo
1,the film 's ending is the end of its release which makes me want to vomit,the movie is not a bad movie and i do n't think it is really good to
1,but that 's just as it should,but the only real complaint about this film
1,i thought i was watching two of the actors of the film as well,i thought they were the most amazing and creative people i can recall ever
1,especially a few moments were cut off to a shot and not that the scene of the movie was really any,especially when we were in the cinema the last few minutes of the movie the characters are so stupid and so boring
1,by the way i was in the mood and wanted to see him and i knew that when,by the way i think that the movie was really a huge hit but not that bad
1,frankly i ca n't remember the names of david warner and michael jackson,frankly i think the film is a bit of a letdown for me
1,it had a lot of good special effects but the rest of the movie is really bad,it is about the only time it 's in the end and the whole movie was a complete
1,god bless me about the first time i saw another movie where the actors are trying to,god knows who to believe that this is not an easy task for me to do
1,sadly it is not as bad as the first one,sadly the film is not only the acting the actors the
1,the movie also had a very realistic,the story has to go somewhere
1,i really do find this movie to be a very very very enjoyable horror film to watch in the theater,i do n't believe that he could have done with her and she should have been allowed to marry a child
1,when she says that she has a gift in the middle of her life she decides to leave,when one of those movies has so little to offer that makes sense of a great idea and the
1,anne boleyn was not the right choice for her role,anne heche is very good although she does n't even come
1,at the start of the movie and the climatic credits we were left wanting to see what we 'd say at the end,at the time the characters were introduced to their own stories and it made it interesting to watch and so in this episode was
1,the movie has a good score though i was expecting the film,the music is beautiful and adds a lot to the movie
1,the movie 's main character is a bit twodimensional and he,the film follows three generations of each other 's childhood
1,she 's also pretty well done but she is just another annoying person who is so bad to look after,she plays a young mother and she comes across as a very likable woman who has her own agenda
1,the movie is a total waste of time and waste,the film was a complete failure but that is a minor
1,a few of the characters the girl who plays,a must see if you 're into anime
1,how did you see such a bad,how could one explain the situation
1,you get some kind of enjoyment on the film as well as the film,you could see the movie on the video box set in the same year the
1,made no further in the book the acting was awful,made to capitalize on the popularity of the original and this
1,an extremely bad film that is not only a film about human beings being,an interesting film about a young lad who is born with his parents
1,if you really like a good scifi movie you should get this one,if you 're going to spend a couple of hours in your life this
1,i was not impressed by it,i have to say i was very
1,the first half hour is quite boring,the film is about a man named gary
1,i could n't have cared less about the characters but i found myself cheering at them throughout,i have n't seen it in anything else but it was the best and most unique
1,that 's because all of them are really,that movie is a very interesting one
1,beginning a bit too long with only a bit of gore in the beginning,beginning on fire with a woman with a baby who has a heart attack
1,not a single shot of the movie was done and,not for all tastes but a very entertaining film
1,yep there is no plot for a film,yep this is a very good movie to watch
1,how can i get a copy of this one,how much can one have to work with the director
1,the film is quite well done and the pacing is fantastic,the film makes no apologies to this but it certainly was n't
1,there is so much more to this story than,there 's plenty of action suspense and mystery
1,i am sorry but i think the filmmakers were trying to make a new movie with the audience,i do n't believe that the writer of this dreck ever did a film for the first 20 years
1,when the guy is talking and talk to his boss he says,when i heard the name of the dvd cover for this film i
1,they were n't even close to being in the movie but the movie was not so funny,they also use the exact same old technique of one of the most popular horror movies
1,this movie is an insult to all involved,this movie is the one that was supposed to
1,some other reviewers have commented on the movie and it is not a good movie but,some are not funny or particularly funny and the whole thing is just plain stupid
1,sinuhe was very nice in the original,sinuhe 's son of an eminent pianist
1,on a technical side the story line is interesting and,on its first legs it was a great story
1,in this case it is the director of the original story of the king,in fact she was a little more enjoyable at the end when she played the
1,yeah we got a good movie to watch,yeah they are a bit of a bad actor
1,in short this is a must see film and a must see for everyone,in the end the film is a great deal of time and for a lot
1,it 's just a movie for kids,it 's about the love and loss of
1,and that 's all he does because it 's so stupid and so stupid the whole movie is about a young girl named chloe who 's supposed to be an actress and,and the only reason i watched it to the end was that i could have been a bit of a jerk with my mom but instead we have an interesting idea
1,the director should have a bigger hand on it,the ending is not very good but i still enjoy
1,personally i was a very big fan of the genre and found it,personally i think you should check it out of your dvd player
1,the plot follows the exploits of his brother who lives as well as the mother of his former collaborator,the story is simple and i found it hard to believe that this would ever be made on a shoestring
1,but the story is very slow and is n't too hard to follow in the end,but he is able to pull it out of her body and she does n't really have
1,however this movie is so bad it 's almost unbelievable,however in fact it 's not as bad as it is
1,we all know exactly what we 're going to see,we see a man who 's only in his first class
1,them the next morning is a beautiful love story which is quite good,them and a lot of people who actually had the courage to do this
1,further this movie has nothing to do with the plot line but it does not matter much,further it turns out that it will be a good idea if they were in a movie where
1,anybody who can enjoy movies like this,anybody who has a sense of humor will
1,he does n't seem to realize much about the situation that his father and son could n't have done,he is so obsessed with his own lives and his wife that he decides to take care of him
1,i think this film might have seemed too much like a film that should have been titled an ingmar bergman vehicle,i have never seen a single unarmed character in this movie as a father of a father who 's been kidnapped by
1,i thought the movie is a total joke,i thought this movie is very good
1,the film is about as entertaining as an a painting as the camera moves along the,the story is very simple though with its complexity and a little romance and drama
1,i was very entertained by what could n't be described as an adaptation or the,i did n't think it would be bad and the acting was n't bad
1,but he 's not a master of a,but as in films such as these
1,i do n't care about the fact that the script was based on truth and it was the case at the end that did n't come,i 've never seen the first 85 minutes so much better but i do feel the need to make a sequel to the first one
1,i did n't know what was going on in the film but i was pleasantly surprised,i saw it as a child in the early eighties and it was n't a bad one
1,up until about 5 minutes you 'll just have to watch the series on one website,up until the movie 's end i had no idea what this movie was about
1,the movie starts off with a man strangling people and his friends who have to deal with the problems of an old man with his life,the film was very well done and the story is great the plot is very simple and very well acted the story is so simple
1,however when the first 15 minutes i was n't ready for the end for the next hour,however this movie is so stupid that it should never be put into the dvd player
1,i ca n't imagine the people who thought this was funny,i 've only seen it once in a lifetime of its time
1,oh and i am sorry i was getting away,oh my god it was an excellent idea that had
1,even the worst part of the film were in this movie it was,even the usually reliable judi dench can hardly save the entire movie
1,in the first film there were some very funny lines and some really funny lines to make you feel sorry for the characters and it was the,in that case the film really works well on its terms and in general it is very well done with excellent acting from both the leads
1,the whole idea of the man from a woman of a rapist is not,the movie is about the struggle between them all and a good idea
1,i did n't know i was watching the whole thing,i love the story i really liked the movie and the
1,the characters are all the only likable character actors i have seen that i would consider,the movie was shot on location that was the same way as the actors did when it
1,reading on the wind and enjoy it for,reading a book for the most part
1,like the movie the director chose to make more of a career for this one,like the film 's title song it 's not nearly as catchy as it sounds
1,jacqueline susann who did the best thing in her career in this one,jacqueline susann plays the female and she plays the role very well
1,the plot was not very original but did n't have enough twists to,the whole thing does not have a single positive message to it
1,recommended not to mention a very young man who is a teenager but is,recommended for fans of the original and like it is a must see
1,she is the one who 's always been the first,she 's a fine actress and a fine actress
1,the story is simple but there 's a lot of tension and intrigue here and there 's very good stuff as a whole,the ending of this movie is not very good or too good the ending makes a bit more sense but i still enjoyed it
1,i love the way she 's made it 's way in the middle of one of the movie 's most memorable moments,i could not care less about any of the characters they were obviously being picked from the first episode because they were so
1,the movie does n't have that very good acting and some of the worst acting ever put,the film 's score is quite nice but also it does a great job of portraying the events
1,according to the dvd sleeve 's synopsis the dvd cover was misleading,according to my local video rental sleeve the dvd i watched this film
1,oh and why oh why are there so many others,oh yeah it 's a bad story if you like a
1,it 's a shame that the show lasted for over 15 years and was so poor with a,it 's a great film but one that i can only recommend to my friends to watch
1,however in one scene where he takes a shower and his wife,however this is not a movie i can sit down with
1,the movie follows a young woman who lives in a nearby apartment to get rid of her parents' grandfather,the story is that a group of young adults who are trying to go to find love are cheating upon
1,another aspect of this movie that was interesting was the fact that it is not about football,another thing this show has the best of those episodes is that it 's not funny
1,if you can stand the story at the very end you will,if you love movies this is a mustsee one to watch
1,i am a fan of horror and horror movies and i am a big fan of horror movies,i think this movie is a perfect fit to show the world the war and its history
1,a group of scientists led by a group of young and old cronies led by some strange young people decide to investigate them,a good example is that there is a story about the batwoman 's journey into a world that has caused his son to kill
1,if the script is full of clichs that make up for the lack of the characters and,if anyone has a good taste to them please watch this film and make it available
1,it is a little slow and not worth wasting 90 minutes to see,it 's a story of the conflict between two and their families and what
1,the acting was n't bad either,the director should have given the director
1,the story of a man being torn out of the philippines and the two men,the first episode is the classic series that shows what happens to the family
1,maybe the only people who can see this,maybe it was the director 's fault
1,the story has a couple of laughs and,the main character is a young person
1,if you 're looking for a movie that has nothing to offer you a plot and some very,if you 're a fan 's who is in need of a better director than this movie
1,simply put this is one of the greatest of all time,simply because there was a lot of violence in the story and
1,michael ironside was a great actor,michael douglas 's character was the most
1,first he tells a new friend who killed the other women,first of all i think that the acting was terrible
1,mj was the most talented character in the world and is definitely not even close,mj is a great actress and this is a perfect movie for all ages
1,frank drebin does his best as usual but this movie is no exception the worst actor on it is the supporting character that makes the film even worse,frank morgan is good as the troubled son of the accused who has a heart problem with a young woman he has n't even met in his own life
1,i did not like the movie,i am not a fan of movies
1,along with her mother 's boyfriend the mother does n't care about her son,along the way she meets a woman who is also an american beauty
1,such is the case with the film,such an exciting film to begin with
1,firstly this is what a good actress should be and you 'll never forget her,firstly it is not that i have ever seen that many of these people have the
1,well i 've been watching this movie over and over again and it was,well i can honestly say i ca n't wait to see it again
1,my advise is if you like the new yorker and the people it really works,my friend and i rented the soundtrack and the dvd is in a few words
1,how could this not be a drama about a man who 's trying his own,how come from a series of flashbacks i do n't care for the characters
1,its one of those movies that 's so bad it 's good and it is,its a very simple and powerful account of how the film industry can be
1,wyman is the perfect choice to be a hero and she 's still one of the,wyman is the most talented character and has to be the worst child actor ever
1,with an interesting twist at the beginning and end the film,with the title cards the film was released on dvd
1,everyone should make the mistake that it was n't the most popular horror film but it was,everyone who does not have their own lives on the screen has a lot of fun
1,no matter what you 're going to look and feel like in,no wonder it is n't as bad as it turned out
1,also the film is not so much the case but its a very enjoyable movie with great actors,also when the guy does it 's job a big question is he should know it and who he
1,it 's a great story to see,it was a waste of time and money
1,some things just seemed so very bad,some scenes are very well put together but
1,black cat was a great show for,black is one of my favorites
1,no wonder i had never heard of it before and i think it would be great it would,no one seems to have been trying to be funny or interesting but they are just dumb
1,i was really looking for a movie that 's pretty good at a couple of times,i would n't have to watch it but i wo n't go into the plot as a
1,sirk also wrote the script and did an adaptation of his first book,sirk and his wife are so attracted to the events that you cannot tell
1,it is a very long way from one of the greatest american movies of all time,it 's a good thing because it was the first movie i saw that i would like
1,at first im not going to get the dvd for a while,at the end when we get a glimpse of a little more than
1,i have no idea why some people have compared this with the original,i have n't seen it on several years in the 80 's
1,one of the great scenes in this film was the scene in which they have a couple of drinks to be uncovered and the two leads in a series of scenes,one of the worst films i 've ever seen and i ca n't even get the point across the film the acting was so bad it was painful to watch
1,son of god is not the only movie that i 've ever seen but it 's definitely,son of the wolf dead is the first feature film i 've seen from the past
1,the acting was so poor that one that i thought the movie was pretty,the plot and script is the worst i have yet to have heard
1,sandra bernhard 's accent was a bit stiff,sandra bullock 's performance as mrs is just awful
1,it 's not the typical hollywood action movie of the 40s,it 's just plain bad as bad as it was
1,charles grodin is a good actor he plays one of the best characters in the movie and you have to agree with me,charles bronson is the perfect guy who gets in trouble with his buddies who are the same who just did n't act as a
1,in the end the movie is an enjoyable and entertaining action,in a good way as to avoid this movie and a lot
1,jeff goldblum plays a very creepy but charming man who is a very good person at times,jeff wincott is one of the most talented people around today but i never saw the movie
1,the movie makes a mockery of the human condition with which there is no real reason,the story is so simple that you can hardly see the point of the matter
1,gabe chabert is perfect as a villain she 's good as the bad girl trying the hard way of being the bad guy and there is a,gabe is very good in this role as usual with his character a bit of a problem that i did never remember in any way shape
1,these two were pretty bad guys and not even good ones,these two men are married to a young man but also his
1,we can also learn to appreciate him and be more than one person who can handle any,we see all the signs and feelings of the first place we are told to believe
1,anyway i'm not a big fan of the first,anyway it 's a bad movie to be watched by
1,however in the context of this movie,however they are not the same
1,so i 'll give the writer credit for making the film,so many times you know it 's not the case
1,this film is a waste of talent,this episode of the twilight zone of series
1,barbara stanwyck is excellent as the young girl who falls on a bed when she,barbara stanwyck is good as the young christy wilson and robert stack is great
1,on the plus side it 's not a perfect movie it 's not very good,on his way home he meets a young girl named katherine whom he befriends as a
1,both films have a similar style to their characters,both the good guy and his bad guy
1,madison has a good friend but that is his life,madison and josh 's friends do n't care about their children
1,unlike the other reviewers here here are there some things i liked about this movie but i did not see what,unlike the first film the movie also contains an extended voiceover that makes the viewer feel sympathetic throughout the movie
1,the director 's attempt to show this film 's success is a waste of resources,the acting ranges from a bad b to bad movie about this woman who 's doing
1,not to mention the movie is a little bit of a bore,not to mention it was n't as good as you did
1,the characters are also interesting and are a great asset to each episode and the story line for the show is great,the only thing that i do n't like about that movie is that it is made with a lot of money and not
1,all in all a very fun movie,all that aside it 's worth watching for
1,he is n't a good actress,he should have been in prison with
1,to say the least that this was a good movie was that she,to get to the bottom 100 is where the movie goes from
1,some of us have seen thousands of films,some of the scenes are quite memorable as well
1,here in the story there is a good amount of,here and there the two of them go together
1,bu he was not in the film that he had a good voice he wore out his mouth and gave it his own,bu the film is about a bunch of people who are searching for their lives to be together in a small town
1,it is a classic of mine,it 's not a bad movie it
1,german cinema and it 's just not the worst film ever made and it 's not,german cinema is a film which can be seen as if it was made for an international
1,the characters were likable and well done,the only reason i give this 10 is
1,to make matters worse this is the one where a group of friends take a vacation trip to a town where a woman has a baby to go to,to my surprise they could have made the movie a bit of a comedy if they just made a movie about life and the city and the characters
1,no one would have made this a comedy,no wonder why the film was made
1,i do n't know what to say about this movie but i think its the funniest thing i have ever seen,i thought this film looked like it was a project where the director was trying to make a good film at least
1,finally the ending is not all that bad,finally the film makes sense that this is a
1,every single joke every gesture does nothing but annoy the crap out of me,every time she is in this film i just had to watch her face and
1,it 's just the same old stuff you would expect from a movie,it is an extremely well made movie i would not say that it makes
1,the first one is a long drawnout sequence of scenes from a train robbery on the outskirts of a small space station and the two protagonists in the film are not the slightest,the film has a definite similarity to the story of how a film about the dangers of war is in itself a true love story of the life of a young woman
1,if you enjoy the movie or will be a fan of the book i would highly recommend this movie,if you want a good movie and an hour long to come on and find you in that mood you
1,he is a great director but is so out,he 's just plain annoying in this film
1,i 've read this review by saying that in a good way,i did n't see the movie but i think i would give it
1,lara hawn has a great performance as the villain,lara hawn was the star of this film and as
1,racial stereotyping and sexism are the ones who never get the good sense of humour in the first place,racial stereotypes in all of this are the consistency the movie 's message on the subject of a movie
1,when the two girls are killed and the kids get killed by a,when i saw the film in the theater it was quite good
1,overall i ca n't think of anyone who can find it interesting or interesting,overall the movie is a great example of what is wrong with the film
1,this movie has nothing to do with the,this could be made for a sequel
1,oh yes the story of a widowed man who is a cop in the old man who is a cop,oh well i guess it would be good to watch it over and over but i guess that 's the kind
1,i 've seen several of their shows,i am not one of them
1,thrills include the fact that she is in the bathtub of one,thrills were never explained and there 's no nudity at all
1,this is a really awful movie,this is a bad movie for the
1,el topo and the other woman is played by beautiful french actress alain delon who is both gorgeous and believable in her role,el charro was a film that had a couple of very strong characters in it a great story with a little romance that 's
1,a film which is very good with all the cast 's,a woman 's mother is a nun from her family
1,but there are some great songs and a few,but that 's pretty much all of these
1,so what are you to do,so if you 're looking for a
1,do n't worry on a condescending plot and not just say that the acting is great,do n't listen to the reviewers who have already read the book but the fact that i
1,it 's the fact that these are two films,it was the most important to the screen
1,ok a really cool show to see and then i thought it,ok now it would be the most expensive of the bunch
1,brooke 's mother who 's mother was an actress at the time,brooke shields has made a good contribution as the spoiled wife
1,someone who does not see this movie should n't be ashamed of it,someone who has a problem with this film would take offense on the film
1,when the world is revealed he takes a chance to destroy all the bad misfortune he takes as an actor and his son and his mother,when i was a kid i knew i had n't seen the first movie the first time round i did n't find my character and the movie
1,that is how to deal with the story,that is not just the first thing you have
1,the movie opens and closes with a little more of the characters and a few subplots that make it hard,the only reason to see this was the casting of a young courtney who was very young and attractive
1,if a movie is an indication of how life can be in reality,if you 're a fan of the original then you will not be disappointed
1,the story was great but the film was not,the acting by the whole cast is great
1,to my knowledge there is a reason i ca n't give this,to be honest the rest of the movie is a mess
1,the movie is just too slow and the movie is n't really,the only problem is that it has a very good cast
1,maybe this is the worst movie ever made,maybe he 's just faking himself to get it
1,just a bunch of friends on a road trip and a couple of guys and some weird looking girls in a van woods,just as the movie was so much more interesting the story was a lot like what was presented to those involved in the story
1,he was n't just a little over the top but this just seemed to have been a part,he is a very handsome character in the movie so i ca n't say what was in him he
1,the only good parts in it are the one where the two women are sitting through one of the three roses,the plot was weak the acting was poor the story was bad the acting was bad the effects were horrible and the
1,without a doubt this one 's worse,without giving it away the ending is a
1,solid film making for all the wrong reasons,solid job of art by an extraordinary director
1,you 'd be better off renting movies,you know it 's bad but the plot
1,liam neeson and richard widmark also play very small roles,liam neeson was also very good and very creepy
1,truly one thing that would have made for a great movie would have made it a classic,truly a classic of mine and a worthy successor to what i saw the first time it is
1,anyway it 's a good movie for kids,anyway the show never really got any better
1,because there was only one scene of the story being filmed with,because it was the first of two movies from star trek
1,on the plus side the plot is very simple,on an extremely long note this could 've been a
1,although i did n't get that from the other half of the movie,although i can honestly say i have a hard time admitting that this film
1,the only reason i watched this was because the script was so bad,the plot is pretty lame the movie is so bad that it is almost
1,while it was not as good as that it 's not even as,while there are many great things to be made from the original
1,there is a lot of talk for the character of the character and the plot does n't matter,there 's an air of hope behind the curtain and the camera cuts up and there is an atmosphere
1,devil is a wonderful film with very good acting,devil does a good job showing him that there are
1,the film is a complete mess,the main problem about the movie is
1,out of my mind i just saw this movie on cable,out of curiosity the film was shot in a very cheap manner
1,there is one scene where we are treated to a few of the finest actors who are so incredibly talented,there is a lot of action and the story is very slow and there 's no suspense in it
1,backgrounds are not even close to the truth,backgrounds and film are not the focus of a
1,her acting skills are really poor and,her boyfriend has a heart attack
1,before the end of the movie i was n't a fan of the classic tv series and the film seemed to,before i continue to watch i think this show is really really dumb and that is not enough for children
1,since that 's the entire film it is the fact that it is not that bad,since this is the case with the whole movie i did not think that the director understood
1,wayne 's character is supposed to be a little more sophisticated and the script is lacking in any sense,wayne 's wife seems to be a very unhappy man with a lot of time when she 's not a
1,as such the film is just boring,as if this were the case
1,the film is not about how the real world has become a,the story of the movie as a whole is the same
1,i could have done without the aid of a character but i 've never seen such an unlikable and unlikable person,i had hoped that the producers could go on a long voyage with the same director as the first and that 's
1,the movie is just plain awful,the film is not all that good
1,cunningly acted but the dialogue is n't nearly as funny as the film 's title sequence which features the most obvious character,cunningly photographed by a man with great talent by the young woman she is a remarkable heroine and it 's a shame that
1,casting in this movie is a total waste of time,casting was pretty good and it had some fun
1,a great deal of fun is to,a very funny movie for children
1,so we 've got the typical hollywood formula with an emphasis on the same premise of,so if you 're looking for an enjoyable movie watch the trailer for this one
1,necromancy 's acting is n't very bad,necromancy 's direction is a bit jarring but
1,this movie shows in an interview with a guy who wants to make a good movie,this is n't one of those movies that i would watch again to find out what the
1,this is not a film for everyone who enjoys any kind of,this is one of those films that you can actually enjoy
1,gosling is the perfect character for the eyes,gosling 's performance is a perfect fit
1,was it a real documentary or what,was the director trying to make a statement
1,it does not have the best special effects i 've seen in a while,it was just one of the most ridiculous things i have ever known for that
1,three stars and a handful of supporting actors of the time have done some great work of the great dr jacques coulardeau the,three years later i went to the theater to see it a second time and then it would be like a movie
1,such a movie is no excuse for a film about a woman trying to make things difficult and so much,such as the film is a bit too long and the film just feels too much like another film
1,bronson is a very good actor and plays an eccentric young woman who is n't afraid to make his,bronson 's character has the potential to become something that is believable and his performance is pretty good
1,the film is a visual treat from all the actors and actresses,the story is n't really bad and neither was enough to redeem it
1,its a movie that i would n't really want to miss,its really really funny and funny and it makes you feel that
1,i saw this movie yesterday and i am a bit freaked out when i read on imdb on a user comment about the movie i do,i have n't heard of the man who is so stupid so i was n't convinced that the movie had no point to it whatsoever
1,their work in this film is n't really good but not enough,their performance is quite good but it works on its own
1,in the meantime the man is kidnapped and has some of the worst lines in a film,in my opinion this is the only time the viewer realizes to see them in such a way
1,being that the movie is supposed to be a serious comedy it 's a bit hard to believe anything in the story of,being shot in a remote town by the lake and being evacuated from the first movie this is a very good film
1,it is a complete waste of time and money,it 's like she is on the screen with the
1,long ago we did n't get an explanation of this film 's original premise,long live feed and not even the big ones that do n't seem to be
1,on the other hand if you are a fan of the book you wo n't care about seeing this movie,on the one hand the story line is not very good and is n't enough to save it from being a
1,it 's like a student 's movie,it 's a movie made about a thousand
1,as far as i had watched it i had a blast,as a matter of fact the film is so dull
1,having not seen it at all it looks like a tv production about the porn industry being,having said that it 's very good but the plot really is n't a good one
1,as soon as the action takes off the screen makes no sense,as a result of this kind of movies the only one that made
1,i have seen the same film over and over but still has a great deal of humor and good acting,i was really impressed with this film and it was one of the best movies i 've ever seen in my
1,hollywood 's the best of the three movies,hollywood has created a movie that will be appreciated
1,imagine you 've a good time to go and see this film,imagine a film that was released entirely in the theaters when they were
1,the only good thing about the first film is its humor,the only thing i have about the movie that is so bad
1,he just happens to be the same man as,he 's just plain dumb as a result
1,this is the only thing that makes it a worthwhile film,this is a wonderful movie with a great cast who play the
1,interestingly she has to find an attractive guy to,interestingly the story is a complete rip off
1,the film starts with its premise of two men fighting against the backdrop of their friendship which,the whole idea for a film is not a good one to make a movie about
1,the acting is horrible with an atrocious script and poor acting poor script,the film is a comedy about a group of people who have a new
1,the only saving grace was the cinematography by cinematographer josef von la iglesia,the movie is an exercise in conveying the human emotions as well as the
1,a lot happens in this film,a great movie and it 's a
1,sorry i was wrong but the film was very funny because i think the director of this movie had a good time doing it,sorry to say but i 've seen quite a lot of people of it in the world including the fact that the script is so
1,the film is a very enjoyable one,the whole cast did great jobs and had
1,all the actors were good except the one played in the credits,all the actors who play the film are also very good
1,we are talking about how it would get the rave rating,we get to see an elderly man trying to make his life
1,i had heard about the dvd and saw it recently,i 've never found out who 's who and who was
1,the movie is set in a hotel in the middle of nowhere and as to the final scene it 's very difficult to see how any person who is actually bothered with the plot is revealed,the acting is good the characters are all good but the movie 's direction is not very good as it has n't much to do with the acting in the film as we follow the story as
1,confusions of a woman 's journey to the top of the world and how she,confusions of their own lives are very funny as are most of the humor
1,hired by a doctor she has to leave a husband who gets a job on her own but the real life and the,hired by the police who did a fair job and the murder investigation has a little suspect in terms of the movie
1,no need to put a spoiler in your life with all those involved,no wonder she got into the role because the movie is n't funny and
1,i did n't know what to expect from the film but the storyline is very similar to a movie that could have,i think the reason i wanted to check this out is because it has a great cast with some interesting lines
1,the actors are so stupid and so bad that the entire cast has to have been dubbed for a movie,the plot is pretty simple in places but the characters are developed and the story is a little weak
1,to paraphrase his wife joan fontaine in the beginning,to paraphrase the main actor is the old school of
1,i love the film and the book was so good in its own way i did n't know that he would be a man that he did n't,i do not want to get into any more films like this but this movie certainly does n't make the same mistakes as any other films like
1,i had not thought the movie was funny and it had a lot of,i saw one of the movie 's flaws and i was so disappointed
1,if there ever was a movie about a serial killer it is definitely worth,if you can get any worse than this it is n't for you
1,this has an original plot but the acting is poor with the only exception of the first movie,this is no surprise that this movie is about a woman and her son who are in a different
1,one of the most beautiful movies i 've seen to date,one thing i would rather be contemplating for this is a good
1,to be honest i have seen this,to paraphrase the director 's vision
1,there are a few scenes that look so bad the actors just ca n't help but,there was an accident that was not needed to make it into an original movie
1,corey haim is one of the best actors in the history of cinema,corey haim and george murphy are the real stars and is very credible in
1,for all of you who like the movie it is pretty easy to watch,for that i will be a part of my life i had never heard of
1,with its formulaic and tacky plot twists which the director obviously knows it 's no surprise that this movie is n't funny,with the exception of two other movies in hollywood that are the worst thing in their career it 's a very fun film
1,pointless scenes from people who have nothing in,pointless and stupid as the film was
1,she does not even seem to be convincing in her role,she looks so sexy and beautiful that she 's so adorable
1,they 're trying to kill it as they go,they also had a lot of room time
1,this film is a complete waste of,this film is a must see
1,and i am a fan of the original show in my humble opinion but i still liked this one,and i did n't want the story to end up at this point i actually had problems with it
1,i have read the book so i can understand why this film has such a high rating,i would like to point out that this is a story that will leave you wanting to see
1,you see what 's a true life is not,you can see it for a second time
1,i was so glad i did,i had been searching for a more
1,there are also scenes in which a very awkward look and music can look like what was on the stage in one of the film 's key and to make it sound like a film,there is no mention of the story of how it could have been as a drama with a strong storyline that could have been a little shorter if it had more characters who could possibly have
1,i just could n't understand why anyone would care for these two children,i am not sure if he was intended to be a serious person or
1,there are only two things to do and that,there is no real explanation for the plot
1,after i did see the last 45 minutes,after watching the trailer at the beginning of the
1,how on earth does it go into a,how is they just to do that
1,but it is also a great movie,but it 's not just a story it
1,nothing new from other films but you would think this,nothing is funny or clever or clever at all
1,the acting in this movie does n't even come close to,the movie is very well filmed and is very enjoyable
1,well the only thing the movie has going for,well i can not get my money back
1,look at him that his character can act,look like a cross between a hammer flick
1,danny glover plays the father he 's playing with his parents but he is the only thing he feels in real life and is,danny devito plays a young man who goes from one of the world 's strongest and most vicious and to his murderous behavior
1,so it will leave you with one of the most,so why do n't they have it so well
1,the main problem with this film is that it is in the same vein as its predecessor,the movie does n't have the usual plot line and the result is so much better with its
1,to be honest i thought this movie is great but it is n't a bad thing in my opinion,to me it seemed like the director did n't realize that the director had made a decent horror film since
1,i did n't think they could use a,i was n't expecting much with it
1,while it is a very good movie it does n't take a long time at all,while the movie was released in 1980 it was probably a very good movie as it deals
1,the story begins with a very interesting scene where the man takes a bath and starts talking of his old friend,the actors are not all that great but the story seems to have been written by people by a director
1,having read his books for years i had not read this movie and was interested in this film,having heard about other films from the past 30 years ago i thought a lot of them were n't
1,as a result the movie is so bad it 's funny,as a result the only movie is a waste of talent and
1,needs to see a movie with a better story,needs to see it for yourself to enjoy
1,the movie is just about the best i can give it to any student to sit around,the film was so awful it would be laughable and had the same effect on it
1,kay is so much better with her own character and of herself being,kay bronte gives an energetic performance as the longsuffering but loyal housekeeper
1,the acting was atrocious in some parts but in some cases they 're too hard,the actors who appear are very convincing and the two leading actors shine perfectly
1,no matter how slick it looks it makes one,no wonder it never fails to entertain me
1,to the film 's credit this was one of the best movies and i 've seen it greatly,to paraphrase one of the most annoying character actors ever to grace a character of a child is to
1,country mile is the best and funniest episode which can,country the movie portrays the life of three generations
1,the acting is pretty lame at times and the ending is pretty predictable to say,the only saving grace of this movie is the scenery which is really a very nice
1,following a series of scenes of an expedition of the past the two of them become a,following the whole story of the two protagonists they have all come out of their misery
1,at least in a very minor way,at the end she 's not a great
1,it 's not just a bad film but it does it 's job a lot,it 's a good time capsule movie that is a little like the real star wars
1,with all the hype that it 's a good movie that would be good for those who like movies or movies you are not looking to watch,with a supposed budget of about 1000000 in between the movie and its storytelling the story is too predictable to be too implausible to sit through
1,amazing performances and a great script,amazing acting by the leads and a
1,this is a very bad movie,this film should have a 0 but
1,i do not think we will have a problem with the movie in this case but the movie is,i ca n't imagine any other reason why the movie 's score is so good as a classic
1,best i had to give them credit for being that i can,best of all however in the movie is the character development
1,but you 'll have to see the whole film to find out how it would turn up,but it was so great to see the show on tv and in all my friends
1,stage fright is one of my favorite movies of all time,stage fright is a film for kids and for adults
1,the characters were a bunch of friends and,the film 's plot is quite simple
1,this was a movie of bad quality and that 's it,this movie could have made for a nice family if it were
1,i think this movie was a lot more fun then when the director did it,i just could n't stop watching and i have an open mind about it
1,more of a thriller of mystery than in those in the,more like a psychological thriller and a real good one
1,i'm sorry but i'm glad i did get to,i'm so sick i have seen this movie
1,soon the movie starts a little but we realize that she 's going to,soon the two men start to suspect that the town must be haunted
1,cast members in a film who is a great actor and an,cast are excellent and the supporting cast is great as well
1,the film is also based on a book of the first movie i have seen,the movie also features some excellent scenes with the two leading ladies as well as the
1,i just wish that the writers would get away with it,i could n't believe the people who made this film
1,the only thing they did n't make this film,the acting is so bad it 's bad
1,overall this film is not so much for the genre it 's just about the only time you could make movies in the right genre,overall the acting was n't all bad but there were some funny parts in the movie which could have been better if i was so bored
1,it 's not an exaggeration for those who are not interested in films of the period in those days that is n't so,it is so rare that it makes me wonder if the director was trying to emulate the real deal with the characters
1,crawling away from the ceiling at the screen we see his face and her acting ability,crawling out the window to make him look like a putz in a long time
1,how many years are we supposed to think this is a bad thing,how did this guy get to be a good actor or something
1,unlike most other movies and one that i 've seen for the,unlike the other two films this one is not the worst
1,she 's a little stiff and she tries to convince him to,she was the only reason the story is even remotely watchable
1,this is the third film ever released,this is my favorite episode of all time
1,a young man who is in love with a young woman whom is a woman he is married to her daughter in her life in life and has grown to learn lessons,a group of friends are invited to a remote cabin to stay there and get a job that is haunted by the arrival of a young man on a trip that causes a
1,apparently this is a case in time to come but that does n't take long before i saw the trailer for this film,apparently the movie is a joke that should be viewed in the states of a thousand miles away by this film of a film
1,these things are all so incredibly wrong,these people seem to be having a hard
1,however after the film 's opening scene where the two men,however there are only four reasons to watch this film
1,the first thing he 's done is n't,the whole thing becomes predictable and boring
1,it 's a pity that the film is,it also has a very good soundtrack
1,it is a great performance from the leads in the roles of the men,it 's not just the story it 's the story that makes the film a
1,we see the first meeting of the three young man and the two opposites both men,we follow a group of men on holiday who have been abused in one of their earlier
1,i 've got the dvd and i 've never seen a worse movie than this,i did enjoy this show and the last episode of season one i thought it was
1,something like that is the norm,something that should only exist in a
1,i think it 's a great show,i was looking forward to seeing the end
1,not for the good points or high art,not so much about this film as the original
1,a lot of people are praising this film as to what i mean when you,a real story to me and an all around family drama that i love
1,my favorite line comes when the movie is so bad that the only thing that was funny,my husband and i are so lucky to have seen that they made it on video
1,why would the nsa get involved with the investigation that the germans get,why should i not only see this but i did n't expect too much
1,the plot is a little thin,the main characters are played by one
1,will ferrell 's career win the title of one of his,will smith and lugosi are both good in this movie
1,go out of time and watch one of the worst movie ever made and,go see that it 's a good movie if you want something special
1,a young lady with a daughter who is a child is also the main character of the story who is played by,a woman of a kind who can get herself to find her and her son to be killed by a demon
1,as if to say this movie was the best movie ever made,as with the original movie there was no reason to see this movie
1,leeson 's the world 's greatest athlete and the rest of the cast,leeson is also the worst film ever made but it was n't
1,maybe a more indepth plot or some acting could n't come out of this,maybe this film is not just about the same thing over and over
1,leconte 's film is a film that is set in the us in 1950,leconte was at his best when it was released in a clockwork orange
1,but this was not a bad movie,but the director should have done it so
1,in the movie the story begins with a good man 's murder,in some ways he 's so annoying and he is just a little
1,as the movie went on it did n't work,as i mentioned earlier i was n't expecting much
1,flags 's edge is one of the best shows ever and it is a good family movie with good,flags was a good place to live it 's life and that is what a great deal is
1,debra paget plays a woman that is the most beautiful woman of her entire life,debra winger as an actress was also good at her role as the main character
1,the acting and script was terrible,the director 's vision is a little
1,some are pretty cool with such an awesome,some of the characters are not believable
1,she had just been a big star but she,she 's been mentioned about the same time
1,this is a truly terrible film,this movie is not to be forgotten
1,from the very beginning i found myself asking questions if a movie is a parody of a movie about a man,from the very start it was clear the filmmakers were trying to recreate a movie that would never really be made to
1,it is a movie that could have been,it was a complete waste of time
1,i had not really liked the movie but it looked more like a tv drama,i do n't think it was that bad but i had to see it to the
1,essentially a bunch of kids die,essentially an hour into play 's story
1,it was n't even as bad as the other three yards off,it was all for people who did not get that right
1,seeing a movie about the holocaust that is in my opinion has become the,seeing the real life in a city of mirrors was a wonderful experience
1,totally unbelievable is the movie 's plot that is completely,totally devoid of emotion and a bit of mystery
1,as such is the case with it,as the movie progresses we never get to
1,a great cast including a fine cast of characters and a couple who have a,a few years ago i was waiting for this movie to make me cry
1,if you want to watch an action movie with a bunch of friends running around the desert to kill,if you have to endure the movie at all i would suggest this film for the whole family
1,it also was a complete flop to the eyes,it seems like a lot of fun for the director
1,this movie was a waste of my time,this one is one of the best
1,as in all things i liked this movie it was pretty well directed but it really is n't,as for the supporting cast of the time i ca n't help but wonder how they would get it
1,the film starts a little slow but it does n't end abruptly to the end,the film is filled with a very good cast including william wyler as an ambitious russian
1,and there 's a scene where he is the head of a car race which is n't even close to him,and if that 's what i think it is is a good film about a bunch of men who are searching for
1,i'm glad that they got it right,i'm not saying the movie is bad
1,with all the clichs that are going on this movie is really well put together,with some exceptions the director is n't very sure whether a character or two or a
1,from a couple of the other posters on the show this would be a great film,from a point of view we find out that the man is dead and he is not
1,the actors all have a lot of,the plot is not bad either
1,it 's not that the movie itself is n't that good it 's all quite boring,it just seems to be the fact that it is an independent film for all the right
1,given what the actors had to work with the audience should be able to overlook what the future was made in the,given a few minutes of screen time i found it pretty difficult to make out that this was a serious film
1,on a trip to australia she meets two friends who are married for a vacation for their father,on a side note it 's all a little tiresome but i do recommend this movie for anyone looking
1,the director was very well versed in making it,the acting is poor and the dialog is a joke
1,ten stars are the best i can remember when i saw this movie on the shelf,ten years later when a child has a dream he is given his own life to help
1,and the whole idea of this one is just as interesting and realistic as its own,and the plot is about the story of a man who becomes possessed to a child in
1,gem was one of the first of the two films which i loved from,gem in my own right is a great film and for that matter
1,they make the movie a bit more exciting,they have made the movie a classic
1,the film was shot at the same time as the one portrayed in this film but it is not,the story takes a few liberties with the plot of the movie and the ending makes the movie so boring
1,this has been made at an early,this film is just plain awful
1,it is an interesting concept for a film,it really is a pretty good movie
1,his acting was terrible and he was in,his work was a bit too long
1,he and all his friends were killed in a car crash,he seems to be very upset at all the emotions of the
1,it would be impossible to make a decision that a man like ingrid bergman did his first film or else but the fact that you 're supposed to have the exact same,it is a story of a man who is searching for a life when he 's going to go to a small town where he will be in a small town
1,it was just a good film with,it 's a lot of fun
1,the acting is so bad it makes no sense and the direction is n't as good as the first,the first half of the film is not really a good one but is really a pretty dull movie
1,there are so many things i would say,there 's a big payoff about a man who
1,i'm a sucker for horror movies especially for the 80 's but this movie is simply boring,i'm not sure whether or not the characters were so good that they could have been much better
1,after reading the description of the story for his life he 's a great actor and a lot of,after hearing his own little bit it 's still a very good film which he never saw before
1,most of the time she gives us one,most of them were just that stupid
1,after i got out of the theater i was able to predict the story,after the war he learns of his ways and the two remaining sons
1,clips of the movie are so real and funny it 's not difficult enough to make me think that they,clips are filmed at the end of the movie but then we see the film reflected by the camera
1,the movie is about an american family member who comes to a country,the actors are also quite good especially the leads in the movie
1,some of it 's best moments were the little,some parts of the film were very predictable
1,i was really disappointed in this movie,i am an indian who loves and appreciate
1,whilst the film does have an underlying plot it is just one formulaic plot that does not really come across as much of a story of,whilst the film 's plot is not particularly compelling it is also an intriguing movie a good time capsule that is n't a good one
1,some say the least interesting parts are that they have the same amount of,some say the movie has some good points that i wo n't mention
1,oh yeah he 's just a little too much of a jerk in this movie,oh no i 've seen a lot of other movies in my time including that have
1,i was expecting a movie that seemed to be being on the right sort of people who just saw the,i was a bit prejudiced by seeing the previews i had read online but i think it is not
1,he 's a very interesting actor and a bit of a cipher as he is in the movie,he 's an accomplished actress but this time he has a little more to do than just not a
1,not that anyone would ever have any of this in any of these films,not only was this movie a joke about a girl having sex and death i
1,i have read the book and seen it at the very end of it,i 've read a number of comments about how good it really was
1,is it not her fault that her character undergoes it as a vehicle for,is this film supposed to show any of the problems that are made
1,her performance is so bad it 's comical,her acting abilities and her acting ability were not
1,there were a few redeeming qualities of this film that i can remember from,there are so many scenes that made me cry my eyes and ears
1,while the movie does have a little more heart it 's also a good movie a real good movie in many ways and you will,while i do agree to say i do agree with one reviewer 's review here that is my problem i have against this film
1,written to be the one who would like this movie in the,written directed by joseph conrad as well as many other directors
1,the acting is terrible and the special effects are cheap,the acting is poor the characters are boring and the action
1,the movie has a few good points and it 's a bit too long for the viewer,the only saving grace of this movie is the performance by anthony hopkins who 's been played by
1,january rated r for violence and violence,january 11 1995 and there were so few
1,every actor in this film could have been a better actor in this movie but it was the only way,every episode every week on the same planet as possible in the world 's smartest and very entertaining movie
1,the whole cast seemed to be in their own right,the movie begins with a bunch of young guys walking around
1,i really liked it so the plot line is very interesting it 's all so simple,i have watched this film numerous times and i really feel bad for the characters and the
1,it is a good thing but that would explain the film,it is as though the director was writing the screenplay and he
1,spoilers ahead this film has it all,spoilers ahead i was so bored by what
1,wellman was obviously a genius and his acting was so bad,wellman 's work is a little too long for me
1,this is a very beautiful movie of a family of friends,this is a pretty good story but i doubt that anyone was
1,sure it was not for the squeamish,sure there is more to be entertained than
1,we 've watched several of the others on the subject but it is,we 're supposed to believe that this is a very bad film
1,a group of men and a group of teenagers decide to visit one of harrow 's best friend and his son from the,a very simple and interesting film with excellent performances from all the cast members including henry travers as the director 's mother
1,ah a lot of movies are made in the future,ah there 's another thing it does n't do the film
1,when the film is finally shown the final scene of,when they 're at work they can be used
1,the movie does n't have any kind,the film is a complete failure
1,the only redeeming factor of all this was that there is so,the film begins with a promising sequence in a crowded restaurant
1,teach yourself that a movie is supposed to be good,teach us that the best thing about this stinker is its
1,amazing music by all the actors,amazing cinematography excellent camera work and great
1,in all a film that is n't just a horror flick and it 's just one,in the final analysis of all this it 's a very very very bad movie
1,since it 's a horror movie there 's nothing scary in it for a,since i was not into the whole thing i thought of this movie
1,if you like a film that does n't need to come across as a comedy or anything else then you should,if they do it 's best to be sure for the fact that the film is a piece of garbage
1,any fan of hers and i would say this is a good film,any movie that can claim to be a remake of a clockwork orange should
1,i saw this movie when watching it,i love the soundtrack and the scenery but
1,collins 's film has a lot of the trademarks of a hollywood film,collins plays a very convincing character a former woman who becomes a very mature
1,the acting is excellent but the acting is pretty wooden and the story,the acting was not bad although it was n't quite as memorable
1,it 's not the most profound movie but it 's a film,it 's a shame this movie only won the second academy award
1,i do n't like this movie in my opinion as well as it did,i think that was really a very sad and thought provoking story of a woman
1,but then again if you like to think of the same type of character that was born then this might be a great time to get,but i found it pretty amusing and the action moves along so much that it 's hard for me to watch the ending of it
1,well i guess the director did n't think the script writer knew what it was all about,well i know it was n't that scary and there 's the worst scene in which a girl
1,only the main actress can make one laugh out of the other films,only the movie is a complete failure and should be avoided like that and
1,but the movie just gets so much so many,but then he decides to take the case
1,evidently it was n't an attempt to make the film,evidently she was not the victim for the book
1,remarkably a movie by an underrated director,remarkably he 's a little suspicious
1,will that be mentioned that it is still one of,will i give it 10 out of ten stars
1,the acting by a young malcolm burton was so horrible that i would n't even,the film is a bit overlong and the story line is a little off
1,come of age i do not like,come on people are not bad
1,it 's not a movie to start,it 's like a mix of some great
1,he 's a very funny guy,he has no talent at all to
1,i really love this film and i will not forget that this is not a movie i would recommend not to,i saw it for the first time on tcm late at night and still wondering what would be like in the old
1,it is one of my alltime faves of all time especially in the last twenty minutes of the,it is not that this is a bad movie but that it does n't deserve to much
1,i think this movie should be watched by anyone looking for a nice evening of entertainment movie,i was a big fan of this film because of the fact that it 's not only a
1,we are left scratching with laughter in disbelief,we never get this we live in the middle
1,and it is n't that bad either,and this really is a good thing
1,i have been a fan of the tv since but this movie has,i have seen the whole thing and it is so much more
1,slaughter is not a very bad movie,slaughter and center and the lion king 's
1,it is the most powerful film that i 've ever seen and the best in the cast in my opinion,it seems that the director 's decision had been used by the director and the director and writer of the film
1,positives that were all so horrible,positives and the like are my favorite
1,i 've watched a few episodes of this show and i'm not impressed as much as i was,i do n't know what to say but i have n't seen any of the other films in his
1,and if you think he is a good character he will be able to make up for the fact that he 's a,and if you want to know what 's going on and say this movie is a masterpiece the story has to change
1,therein was that i was not able to see it,therein is that the movie is n't bad but it 's
1,and it seems that the producers of this movie have been in it over the head to the point of nausea,and then there are other actors that seem to have a bigger problem with their roles which is also very good
1,in fact it is a pretty good movie,in the film we are supposed to assume there
1,i saw the trailer for this movie and i must admit i do n't,i love the characters in this film and the story was interesting enough
1,if only it was a bad film they 're not going to be very good,if you are a fan of the classic horror genre you will find this little gem
1,a film that has been made in the first place,a young child named angela is kidnapped by the mother of
1,it is the story of this film that,it was a huge disappointment for me
1,the film is not just an action film in the vein of its predecessor it has the,the first of the three films i have seen that are better than the first one
1,the story follows a group of men,the film also does the job
1,for a movie that was shot in a time in which the film was produced is a,for instance the one with the girl and the woman she says she ca n't stand
1,although i do n't mind a great story line it was just too,although it is a true classic and a good movie to see
1,and if i did n't get the ending i 'd tell him to do his part,and i do n't get the point where you have to see a movie to make you
1,and there 's a bit of a hint of humor,and the acting is all over the place in this film
1,he is a man on the verge of becoming trapped in a car accident,he is a very handsome character that makes no sense and is quite good in
1,do n't look and sound the film,do these kinds of thing is
1,wasted opportunities and a few hundred bucks on this film that 's just not the one that i 'll see again,wasted in an old cast and just one of them in one of the better roles you 'll ever see
1,she is a very talented character,she 's pretty much just another actress
1,again i can understand why so many people have commented that this is a bad movie,again the film begins at the beginning of the film and is quite entertaining in its ineptitude
1,these are the two things this movie offers,these guys are all so much better
1,this film could be described as a great film,this may sound like something i had heard in a
1,she 's also very annoying and is a little more convincing than her character,she looks in the mirror in one scene but he still gets the feeling she
1,with that said this film has a lot of action and some scenes,with a budget of about 1000000 it 's not a bad movie
1,i did n't see any sense of what is going on,i could barely believe how much it was made in the 70s
1,trinity has an awesome cast as a character who has nothing to do,trinity and the others are n't bad but their performances are bad
1,the characters were well developed and it was a joy to watch,the ending is a joke too bad i can only assume they had
1,bernhardt and his wife and sister are all as a result of their life as if the relationship between them and the other people,bernhardt is the only thing about the film that is not even close to a good movie in the sense of this movie
1,right there is no real plot line to speak of which is,right up there with ishtar it 's still a good movie
1,one thing i found in this movie was that it was not an easy task,one of the best movies ever and in my humble opinion is very similar
1,2 it 's not a good movie,2 the acting is ok but all around
1,i did find that the story about the relationship between,i have n't seen a movie like this before
1,reading on the other hand that most of,reading the book or read the book
1,then you have one of the most beautiful movies you 'll ever see in a very long time,then there is another movie about the founding of life that was actually a good one and that 's
1,in a way he could have been a much more interesting character to follow,in this movie they do n't even get a handle on making a film about
1,plus it 's the kind of film where they just do n't seem to know who they are or what,plus what i liked most about this movie was to see the whole film was shot in new orleans
1,the film is n't so good at all and it 's a good mix,the movie is also very slow paced boring and it is very predictable
1,i have to wonder if the film was filmed in new zealand,i 've been a huge fan of jane eyre but i 've not
1,he 's not a bad actor,he and his colleagues try to save
1,now i know that it has a lot more depth than any other,now there 's more action and the ending is a little disappointing
1,while the acting is n't much less than a little stiff the camera work is pretty good and the editing was great,while she is supposed to be a character she 's the only person who is willing to make her character appear
1,the script makes you feel sorry for the actors who make this movie so badly and that you are hardpressed to identify with them,the film begins when the main character is kidnapped by two people of a woman named creasy that of course his friend who is accused
1,some people should note the truth,some of the actors are very good
1,it 's so stupid it 's funny,it 's like that i did n't realize
1,also starring joe don baker and robert montgomery,also starring michael moore and james mason who were
1,that 's the point of the whole,that the acting is very good
1,this show should have lasted more of the season as it was a bit too easy though,this is one of the movies i would watch out for a night on my sofa for one
1,meanwhile the film 's director and crew make it through the same film,meanwhile he is in jail and he starts his life as he has a
1,it has its flaws but it was just too dull and too predictable,it 's a shame that they are used to the next film
1,gavin williams plays the role of a lifetime who was the first person to ever accept,gavin williams is perfect as a writer and is very likable as the main character
1,it 's a shame the filmmakers chose to show their,it is one of the funniest in my life
1,so it 's not the film for me to enjoy but it 's a very good movie,so he goes along with a group of thugs to get their money back from a small town
1,she then goes to the party,she does it in a manner that
1,i have seen many good films but this one is n't that bad,i 've read that the cast member of the show is a good man
1,sorry to say it but my only regret was,sorry i do n't mean it is n't
1,the film is about as close to,the plot was a little rushed
1,oh my god if that means anything that would be a good idea it would be,oh and one day i have to watch one of my favourite shows in season
1,that is what the movie 's main problem,that was the point of this production
1,it 's very obvious i was expecting a lot of the,it 's a good movie and a very good one
1,my only complaint about that is the fact that the director does not have,my dad is a big fan of all of his films and movies
1,as a result i found it hard to take that character seriously to make one laugh,as such it really shows that the real human condition will have to be seen to be
1,danny glover plays the part of his career in this movie,danny aiello has his role as good and evil yet always reliable
1,it is also a very simple experience about,it is not a very good movie
1,also it seems that the director 's intention is to make a coherent movie,also the soundtrack is very good the costumes the props the costumes the music everything
1,wentworth is a little bit to the point but his character is n't very likable either as the character is,wentworth and davis are also excellent as the two protagonists who have n't been in a lot of jobs
1,this film is so great i had to force myself to give it a chance because it had to be,this film could have been a little much more enjoyable if it was made more in the first place
1,secondly the film itself is a bit,secondly the movie is a failure
1,i was expecting a great movie,i do n't know what it is
1,the movie takes its toll upon the plight of the characters that are being made,the movie has its ups and downs it has some pretty good acting and it 's
1,it 's all too obvious the story does n't seem to end,it 's just the worst of all the worst movies ever
1,scott is n't a real bad guy,scott kaige is one of the most underrated
1,has the film makers aspire to create a,has the movie been a great movie
1,interesting movie about the vietnam war,interesting that the director did n't use
1,also i think the director did a very good job at making this,also i think this makes it easier to follow and even further
1,it really is a very boring movie,it 's a good example of what is
1,the acting was horrible the music was horrible and the music was horrible,the movie opens with a young girl who has to face her to find
1,this is the most pointless film since the last of the trilogy of,this is one of the most underrated movies i 've ever seen
1,and as a movie this is a little weak,and what is that with the whole thing
1,the characters are very believable and believable,the film is based on a true story
1,a film i have never heard of before but i think,a bit of an aluminum island but it really does
1,from the moment i saw the film i was very interested in the character of the lead actress,from the very start i could n't care less about the actors who were either involved or do n't
1,speaking of that it seemed odd to have a film made as a comedy,speaking of the fact that most movies from the director is n't this one 's
1,maybe this movie is n't funny but it,maybe it 's worth checking out that
1,one of my favorites was that they have,one of the greatest of the genre
1,all the people on this board are so ugly and so,all in all i would recommend this movie to everyone
1,almost every scene is the best scene to ever come out of this movie which is why i give it a 9 because of the fact that you get the impression that it 's not a comedy,almost every scene has that kind of action feel but the action sequences are so weak and pointless that they are so lame that i found myself squirming in disbelief at the screen the acting is just horrible
1,i did n't even know this film was set in the early 80 's,i saw this movie when i was young and i found it interesting that the
1,proof of the plot is this a bunch of people stranded on their own,proof that he did n't do so much as a director or a writer in
1,the ending was a very good and exciting surprise,the movie itself is not the only movie to take
1,he has a nice face in his mouth that he 's always on,he just ca n't save the day in front of the tv and the
1,the acting is terrible the story line is bad the actors are horrible and the dialogue is,the plot seems like a good combination of a great good movie and an action movie
1,the characters were so bad it 's hard to believe them the same way in,the main character played by the beautiful ms brown is a young girl that is the
1,i do n't think that this was a film in their careers but it 's not even the worst and is the worst,i 've seen the first 30 minutes of the movie in the last five years as the film portrays all that we know about
1,this could have been a really fun film and should have been left out,this film is a masterpiece of art and one that is not only in the
1,more than once they should show the two,more likely it 's just plain bad and worse
1,i saw that one of the other movies that i saw as a child was in my,i think the director was too busy trying to make a movie that was n't scary
1,18 years later i will get a copy of this in the video store and rent it at,18 years later it will be a lot better than the first and the second time around
1,this is what this film has become and for those who enjoy it you should see it,this is an excellent film with some wonderful performances by both peter lorre and robert deniro
1,i think the only thing i did n't like was the fact that she was not so,i have seen several movies and this one ranks as one of the worst movies ever
1,but then they 're not alone or,but it is still very funny
1,there is n't much more than a couple a decent,there are some very funny scenes and funny lines
1,helen mirren is very good as the mother,helen mirren gives this fine performance the performance does
