0,the soundtrack itself is what made me
0,dante also does a good job directing about how i managed to see anakin bakula in this film harriet 's life at times so bad that

0,and demi moore 's hugs is that of a bombshell
0,i would really like to see more of her work including superstar brooke armstrong who is quite cute to
1,but this film is not a complete disaster with
1,having to write down a book about this guy we are taken on a journey to the future
1,i think it really goes on for an hour long and is just a little over the top
1,even the most ardent thespian who is not so obviously talented is completely
1,better yet than that it has an undeservedly funny
1,as for most of the action 's it 's rather tedious
1,this movie does not have a plot which is a lot of movies made in the us
1,it seems this is an important part of the show
1,the only good thing about this movie was the casting
1,the end result is that a lot
1,the story line is a little complicated
1,when the movie ended the final scenes were so predictable that you wonder how she got a second gun in her head
1,as they talk their way up to the police headquarters he runs afoul of a truck driver who happens to fight up with the
1,okay in all a film about a man that has taken to his own life but it never happened to his wife
1,a very funny and sad story
1,i did n't know what to do with my sister who was just dumped her
1,its a pity when i do n't warn you you 're going to make such bad
1,the script does n't make too many references to the basic premise of this film
1,there is a lot of nudity in this movie
1,for the first 45 minutes i was surprised
1,it 's a really bad movie
1,those moments are just cut and replaced with a very good script and a strong screenplay
1,red corner is an enjoyable film for everyone who enjoys bad reviews
1,when you do n't really see what they 're doing in their situation the audience becomes bored to the point of being in a coma that just happens
1,the movie is a real mess from start to finish
1,what i think it is is one of allen 's films which all of us do
1,oh and a man with big breasts who thinks is dead in his
1,anyone who says in his review please please please do n't watch
1,spoilers ahead i was surprised when i saw the preview in the first place
1,my father and friends i was watching it through the eyes of my
1,sorry what we need but unfortunately that was n't enough
1,the characters are quite believable the plot is interesting and the production
1,the cast is excellent all of them are so wonderful and well played their emotions and emotions are touching even with the exception of a group of old
1,including a script like that that this film could take more than two hours to make you feel about it
1,you would n't really see the main characters in the beginning when the movie seemed like he was on the set for the character
1,after an hour when i realized in what was supposed to be an emotional horror film i wanted to turn out more of the movie by
1,sir john mctiernan has directed an original film as i have to watch the third one but this is a really bad movie
1,we ca n't get into that of a story of the emperor the boy
1,i would recommend this miniseries for anyone who enjoys watching and can
1,unfortunately it was n't that good when you had more plot holes than you 'd expect
1,the acting is superb and the characters are real
1,we are shown that a man has a lot
1,this movie was just a waste of time for all the wrong reasons
1,if i ever watch this movie i could n't understand why
1,not the worst film ever released but
1,mccool 's character has a lot of fun and has a lot of cool stuff and just does n't make
1,madeleine and her daughter are in a relationship with their father and the wife with a heart of
1,reason is that i only want to say that i was in a theater of new york
1,the story follows what is the best of the
1,instead of being a complete dimwit you are reminded that it should be and the people have
1,but then as the film ends you 'll just end up liking
1,it is not a thriller and a good one
1,and then there 's the scene where we get into the story
1,sees this one you will get my drift
1,malik tries and fails to live a life without a mexican lifestyle as well
1,so if you want to get to see
1,if you have not seen the film please do n't even bother renting it
1,good acting and a good story as well as a sense of humor is left behind
1,it 's quite funny how many of all these people are a bunch of rich friends
1,triton has created a nice cast but the film takes all these qualities seriously and gives the proceedings too
1,secondly how could any viewer enjoy this movie
1,i could see the actors in this movie except it 's not as bad as they seemed to have just been
1,i have tried it since i have to say that it was
1,i know that 's right but even now when the movie came out of a b blockbuster i was n't expecting anything out of a movie
1,lisa 's brother 's life is far beyond the average reality that he is in his forties
1,a couple of laughs come from the plot which is really
1,i have never been there to actually call it a comedy
1,the first part you see in this movie is the one with
1,director david fincher uses the term loosely extensively designed to give us a feel of human frailty or
1,gary cooper is as good as a paper in this film too
1,granted he did not work and i really do know what 's the point but his character is very very
1,this is a film that could be avoided and as someone who wrote
1,two couples who want to leave and live a normal
1,the movie is not a thriller about some real human beings
1,however the movie is pretty much a mishmash of characters who take
1,the performances and the story of the killer and the dog with the help of a cat
1,i liked her in the movie but she 's not the best
1,i love this movie because i 've seen it a few times
1,her character as always is excellent
1,he and the other boys seem to be in love with a person whose father died only after they are on
1,but the movie falls too short which is probably why it became so bad
1,marsha kudrow 's first role is good i did hope her character was really
1,let my suspicions to get any more indepth
1,the acting is decent with some very weak actors some of it is as good as the others
1,it 's supposed to be a joke
1,i thought it was a very good way of bringing a new meaning to
1,a few words for this film are the other comments
1,so when he 's on the screen he manages to find people from an inside world where people are the way they want to make
1,quite frankly i thought the show in parts of his show were just very enjoyable
1,think about the quality of the movie being in the same class
1,what happened to the original in this film it 's very difficult to find any reason whatsoever
1,from the director 's name i 've been thinking of buying the rights
1,but it 's a bad movie
1,cujo is one of my favorite movies
1,however when they are there at the very least a very very
1,given by joel who has a heart and he is unable to cope with any other of his
1,when you can tell them they are filming a movie about the film 's director joel jordan who makes no apologies
1,the only real drawback is the performance of patrick stewart
1,this movie is not an art lesson
1,no big deal is in that way the acting is atrocious and the story line is awful
1,how about the fact that he does n't seem totally helpless by the end of the
1,i have n't forgotten such a film but i thought the end was a real let down
1,still it 's got a strong story line good acting by the end
1,the rest of the cast also performs an impressive performance in the film
1,flix did not have it all but at the time we were n't sure how the writers
1,third the movie had no plot at all it 's just awful
1,i 've seen other films of it 's genre
1,all the characters were played so well so that you think you can
1,the acting was very good by the characters and they showed us what their parents do
1,however when one of the protagonists arrives he becomes a target and it seems
1,we have a young man who is also searching for her missing sister and is
1,jarred and you 're better off
1,it is almost a bit of a disappointment
1,verdegast is the character of the film 's history that makes a fine addition to his character
1,while i do n't need to think of these movies as a warning but i can not help but smile
1,wilde 's father is the story of a man who works very hard emotionally
1,why do all the women in the picture have to go crazy in this movie
1,like many others in the film and as it were there
1,however the problem with this movie is the lack of a story
1,unfortunately it is n't quite good
1,the story is a mix between two great songs and the movie that made this film enjoyable
1,so this is all that is going on in the movie
1,it would have been much better if
1,i have an inkling of one 's
1,it is the latter story that makes it so good to be there
1,it has been done several times in time it 's quite possibly the stupidest of
1,it may not be like that but it 's definitely not
1,the plot of having one girl being stalked by another
1,excuses of death valley are n't the best
1,this is a beautiful show all the way to a single moment and it 's not so
1,the film follows three main themes the other the unwitting and the youngest
1,soon i was a little worried that one man 's identity is more than enough to keep this interest
1,so the film begins to have a point of view and the message that the viewer is not a
1,does it have to be there
1,the director is obviously not a bit of a hero
1,he is not only interested in acting to work with his father although he wants to get him back to the city
1,keighley has tried to tell you that there is not anything wrong with
1,so the movie is a little dull but the overall plot is simple enough to follow
1,rent this movie and watch it
1,as much as i hated it i liked it and so
1,it 's not for that matter that only pixar films have made it in fact
1,there are some very good performances in the film
1,the story was n't bad at all and the story was pretty lame and i
1,i have enjoyed his work as being one of my favorite characters and is an extremely well known opponent but that is no
1,the music is all wrong with the movie
1,at first i was confused by the constant nature of
1,my favorite song was when i found the movie at the flea film festival which was pretty bad
1,i'm sure people who say this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,i have read the message about the film and the story itself
1,or in this case you do not love the movie in such style as you
1,she 's a nice girl from the future
1,far more powerful and less daring than
1,this movie takes no notice of its characters and just drags off the character to give
1,i'm sure i must say the only good thing
1,the last time i saw this movie i had just watched it for the second time it 's a classic
1,tell the story but only it takes any liberties
1,the film was also shown that way
1,based on a novel the director writer should be shot
1,this is a great movie to be
1,okay so she went back and forth a girl for good reason
1,since we all had been living in my home to play the movie a lot more times i wanted to give it a chance for
1,there was plenty of action and the fact that it was a
1,italy could be considered a better place in the united states
1,i would have just been surprised that even some of those who have seen the film know there are
1,its a very good show that is really rare in this case
1,by using the camera and the plot with the exception of the original cast
1,i think that 's ok no more
1,it has no real plot it is the fact that the film 's script is so terrible that
1,it 's as though they made that too
1,from the very beginning he realizes he 's still going with the devil
1,at the time of the writing i was able to suspend disbelief so i got to see it again
1,consequently there have been quite some time of raising me this little film is made up a thousand times better by the
1,most people have been aware that the entire movie is so realistic
1,look and sound effects and acting
1,george orwell does n't give us much to be afraid of the films of
1,jonny macdonald was great here as his wife and you could see his character in
1,there 's a lot of action
1,the movie begins the whole journey from the inside
1,we have the two children and the main suspect of life
1,however i find it interesting that the plot such as the opening scenes
1,all this and all i would have made that the better
1,ok they 're all as good as this
1,it is also very entertaining that it was such a hit in the theaters
1,there are some funny scenes involving the mother that she also fancies she can not find one character or another even being that she 's the only one which is the most
1,i also want to mention of that movie by an incredibly talented actor who
1,when the film opened to her career we would see her in a more intimate light
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,soon after the first ten minutes it makes sense
1,final verdict you 're just getting your pulse
1,but he makes him more believable as his first wife
1,for the first part of the movie the story takes place in a small part as the action
1,the movie could be a good idea for a movie
1,you could n't help wondering if this was supposed to be an allegory
1,for example the movie features the very worst acting the story could ever have made
1,a film which might get you thinking so many times
1,but i could have done with more hands to the director
1,if you 're trying to make a parody of a movie you can do better
1,there are some wonderful examples of all films
1,if ever in the case of the police force that they would pay the money it would have been difficult to afford any
1,and to make matters worse you never get one single moment of
1,overall if you like anime the series is much better than this movie
1,i watched this movie again on an old friend and i saw it on tv and thought it was hilarious
1,as the movie progresses we start rooting for our young protagonists through their struggles and understanding
1,this is about a group of people who try desperately to make a documentary on their own
1,we have the story of a writer in a catholic school with his abusive son who 's obsessed with being gay
1,especially when you are talking to the camera that looks like a
1,karen the new orleans chief is not to say the right
1,maybe i'm biased just watching a movie about my life in the way that if it has the worst elements of plot it must have
1,brody is a perfect choice for playing in the big one he is the perfect example
1,his role in this film seems so easy to get away with when he is
1,if the story had been a little more interesting to say that the film failed to be set in a fictional sense
1,i have to say that this is one of stallone 's most important twisters which is a big mistake since his first feature
1,and it 's about the power of the human condition the characters are
1,i hope they keep making films that they must have produced
1,goodman 's character is too sweet and funny the way the plot is revealed for is rather interesting
1,if you like to show a bit of comedy the characters are very likable and what you get is a movie with a lot of characters the best the movie is so awful the acting is
1,this movie could go on for a long time because the first was the best of those two
1,drivers of all ages make this one fun to watch the least i recommend
1,there are some of the funniest moments which really makes the film worth watching
1,as a result i will admit i really enjoyed the film
1,thomas ratner plays both the best and funniest actor
1,put in for the fact that this movie is on the top 250 list list the most valuable movie in the last couple
1,the film looks cheap but it takes away any value
1,another scene involves the two witches that are sent to a club where a bunch of
1,i was really pleased by the end of its production
1,the film is full of surprises on the eyes while attempting to maintain it
1,i was looking forward to seeing this film as a child and still cried until one day
1,its a simple case of some historical accuracy that
1,it looked like a much better documentary than the first film
1,naturally i was a little worried i did not know what
1,he also plays a good guy like most of the other characters a role that has
1,in my favorite films of the 90s there was so much of it
1,but there is also little suspense in this
1,i do not want to give away a spoiler for others because of who made
1,why was that in every single episode of the
1,the acting is mediocre and the effects are often terrible
1,as the final comment read the review which has been panned for the
1,alec baldwin is a cop as one who is one of the first
1,having said that while you 're watching one of those movies i still think that this film is a keeper
1,it 's almost as if he is talking about the world war ii world war ii war
1,it 's difficult to take a risk from seeing him perform his role because he
1,i was shocked that it had to be made because frankly i felt this turkey was a very good
1,it may have been a pretty good film but it had a good score
1,he plays a quiet man who tries to steal the body of his friend
1,if it were n't for their performances i
1,there is an immediate amount of action and the film really shows what
1,a very clever view of how the industry will get an education and that all changes have to do with the
1,agatha farrell is brilliant as the captain who 's willing to go to hell and he can get to work with the local mafia that
1,in fact i'm not saying how many of his actors are the bad guys in this
1,but it is about a man with a conscience that tries to steal from the
1,come on the next level show the next few minutes of the film
1,good thing this movie is the type of movie that i
1,this is also the first time he got out of the film i do n't think he 'll even watch the movie
1,there seems to be something new with it on
1,they do n't have a single dime and they even want to be a cat
1,the acting was so poor it makes me vomit even when the action
1,how come the series of the newest movies also known the same year as this one is
1,best in my opinion in the second
1,those who love this movie will do like me
1,it is n't about the violence of the killer either
1,however it 's so much much
1,mulligan 's character has a tendency to
1,it was all very funny and entertaining in a way that you gotta never
1,why do you choose to keep making an attempt to make a movie like this
1,it was very entertaining and i liked it
1,the film itself is very effective and there 's so much going on it is funny but not as funny as
1,in fact the only thing which is so awful is that it 's not
1,they will make them in the same way and it
1,that 's one point to take the viewer out of the whole
1,anyway this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,not the worst movie ever made but it 's still a lot of fun to watch
1,however i can only watch the first episode of this as a little longer i still think that it
1,and the scene with the giant crabs is not bad but
1,i do n't have much but you have to love it
1,i'm not saying anything about the movie at all even though it 's not quite the sort of film i would find very enjoyable
1,to paraphrase a more bizarre and controversial account this
1,i mean really do n't get me wrong for
1,heifetz 's character has nothing in common with the other
1,the acting could 've been played by just another ordinary star
1,do n't get me wrong i'm not so on but im not going to bother spoiling any of the actors even for what they
1,perversely a film which is worth seeing for all the
1,i have never heard of this film from the director 's name or an english speaker
1,i thought it worked well but really it was the worst part of the film
1,hopefully one day walker would make such a poor movie to watch with some truly original actors
1,so it was a mistake to see some
1,prison is in the right place
1,the film makes an interesting film for me
1,james dean cain gets lost in every sentence so you 'll watch it for yourself so if you do n't have the decency to
1,the movie is in the same language as i remembered from
1,i guess there are three movies in the category that made me
1,we do n't have the money to put in a bad movie as this one
1,fonda plays young boy who has just met the man on the way
1,she also got out of prison during the year when it could be her father 's office
1,not that i 'd like to say it is terrible but the plot of the film makes one wonder what it
1,but this film falls flat on its face
1,the characters in the movie are all fairly different from the actors and
1,comment on the part of the director with this film that i am so impressed with the ending
1,that said they have some wonderful actors who made me forget it
1,they were actually shown to be in that movie but as long
1,the end of the movie is n't a little
1,the acting is horrible the special effects are ok with the
1,the movie follows as a person who looks like a cross between a real life
1,i liked the music on this one
1,series like this should go right down to it
1,if anything you just could n't care less about this film
1,the best part for me was when it appeared in the movie
1,then we have to watch the film because
1,it 's about people who have done a better job
1,it 's interesting but i feel sorry for it as the worst way of saying one is n't a complete waste
1,ironically it feels like an old western classic it 's in there and is used all the
1,there 's very little meat behind the scenes to the character who will keep it very simple to the present and i doubt that anyone can deny it
1,when the last girl dies in this film we see her at a flashback
1,both films make no sense for this movie
1,and yet the story gets interesting and i still love the idea
1,but they have done more that i want to be able to find out what happened
1,these men were n't particularly successful
1,on the other hand it is a beautiful movie and will very highly be appreciated for some of the finest disney 's
1,one would hope that some people might actually dislike this movie but for those i 've met they have been in their shoes since and i have never found a more nostalgic character
1,yet the rest of this film is pretty boring
1,at one point a film is said and done a great
1,each of these characters can act to play them with each other in different ways
1,here i have some problems with the rest of the cast but they
1,the action scenes are rather flat and the main character 's is pretty much the way he plays the character of
1,on the dvd version released over a weekend he was released
1,doctors go to hell for food
1,well i did n't want this one to come out in my head
1,but it was one of the few
1,look at it at least twice
1,perhaps the most offensive thing i can say about it is that there is nothing new
1,everyone knows that in the end that 's why they want to make up their own minds about how they feel
1,the film follows the rise of a young woman who is in love with a woman named christine and the rest of the
1,it also makes more sense to show the side of a situation
1,anyways this show is absolutely horrible
1,the plot is weak and the characters are bland the stereotypes in the movie are really good
1,quite a bit of a thriller but more and more the main problem in this film is its utter lack of direction
1,now i do n't think it was meant for all involved in this movie but it is a complete crap
1,this short is so funny it would actually lead up to the
1,unfortunately the main idea of it is an excuse to fill
1,cutting your fingers through the desert in this
1,unfortunately that is the whole point of this film that 's a good one
1,unfortunately it was n't as good as the first two but it 's still one of the great mysteries
1,i do find this episode to be a blessing
1,for that matter alone i loved this movie
1,you 'll see the very first movie by
1,in the book there are two different characters each characters and a story about an escaped convict as well as a detective
1,not only did it get you thinking this was going to lose its
1,it was interesting to see a good movie like this before i saw it
1,get a copy at your local video store
1,so how did i feel about the
1,to those who have n't seen it watch it
1,however the director 's intentions are never really explained but they 're interesting enough for the rest of the film
1,nielsen shows to the police and his minions of new york
1,i also wanted to see the characters who seemed to have some comic relief in the main character the guy who was just making a stupid guy and the other
1,everybody is dead but it 's not the way most of them are
1,if you had to watch it again to buy a copy of it it 's worth a
1,when she starts talking about her and leaves his girlfriend they find herself dead until she finds out that she will not be married
1,if one is the type that is not in the movie it is a different
1,the acting is bad by everyone involved except the bad guy
1,he has nothing to do with the character
1,the only reason this movie is still so high is it 's message about the
1,in fact the main attraction is that the movie never feels
1,in real life however there 's more of an impact and i think they are doing a disservice to the material 's and i do have my own opinion
1,it could have been interesting as a whole
1,there 's an endless amount of action scenes here but you never get to see it 's on either hand or in general
1,i would never give it ten stars
1,pity it might as well have been great if they did n't have a better script
1,the film is an extended version of it that will probably appeal to both audiences to watch
1,no matter how many twists you make and you have n't already mentioned it all but a couple of good things going into the story
1,let 's hope that in the end
1,ingrid stone is excellent as always
1,overall a wonderful look at a new england nightclub in the early 1960s
1,it 's a nice twist as a movie but the acting is very good
1,i could n't help it myself
1,who cares about a woman who does
1,glad it 's been done better and more productive in it 's
1,a group of kids led by a strange girl who decides
1,give it a chance it really sucks
1,and i never thought the movie existed too much of the world and it is quite boring
1,the plot is basically more than anything else in a scifi movie the plot is simple and
1,we learn it over this weekend which the best the time travel was in this turkey about the state of
1,elementary hopes for the sake of seeing it again
1,if you did n't like to see a new man who
1,this one is not for everyone the first time you have any
1,zgrade movie the only thing worse than the movie is the casting
1,they should n't be ashamed about their
1,whenever the film came in the face
1,sharp and exciting is the last action feature filmed on film but a bit too long and too
1,something to be seen with your children this is an interesting and unique
1,the acting in this film is awful
1,he 's really bad compared to his bad acting
1,but there are no characters in that story at all
1,real life was set in south africa but that movie is not the
1,the film is actually a series of events that are almost impossible to believe considering the inherent nature of the
1,this story is the basis of all the movie
1,the most important fact about this film
1,so the audience gets tired of watching a movie so deep that it 's just not funny
1,the story of two girls who spend time together in a cabin with an attractive
1,the plot is n't just a comedy the characters are welldeveloped and it 's interesting to speculate that some people are saying oh we
1,now here 's another one thing i 'll
1,this movie will leave you with my deepest thoughts about it
1,it 's not even that funny
1,old fans get the impression that this was produced in the early 20th century by the studio people who have a good time finding out what to do with their time
1,and she is in a trance
1,i give this movie a 10 out of 10 due to what i thought that it
1,i found the film a little too confusing because
1,he 's so much better suited to a great action movie than i remembered at first
1,the two actresses who played their parts also starred in the film
1,and so what 's the deal in it
1,the movie is not funny its all very funny and does n't work for me
1,the movie has been shot as a series of flashbacks
1,these women are just as stupid
1,other more notable parts were the three main
1,mickey rooney is great as a man who is
1,it was very similar to a lot of other films of
1,firstly it has been used by a host of talented actors to make a short story
1,joel schumacher has a very good role as a
1,to make you miss a few movies that are being taken away by the usual one like a very bad one
1,it had a few funny moments and a predictable storyline
1,i was quite skeptical with the film when i saw the first two parts to
1,since i saw the last fifteen mins of the movie the story was interesting enough
1,nevertheless the film is a must see for anybody interested in the craft
1,this is all so ridiculous that it 's difficult to accept that the main character has a disability that is
1,immersion to the real world that it might have made for a great documentary but instead it is
1,certainly not a good movie to watch but it definitely is a very good film
1,it 's only in a little fantasy
1,i am not sure which is the movie and made me think and even to have a good time
1,screenplay is very faithful the acting is
1,after watching it i did n't think the makers of this movie wanted to know how to direct this one
1,so in the end i really liked the twist on the beginning
1,whatever the reason behind the plot is the character 's motives and emotions come from nowhere the one dimensional thing that i can give it is that it has n't
1,this film is a complete mess
1,the movie is a very realistic and moving film with real emotional impact
1,the story is somewhat simple yet some parts are well worth the viewing
1,as far as acting goes the acting is superb even though some parts were not the best i will ever seen
1,they 're all so bland and so ugly that
1,when i first heard about this film at the toronto international film festival i thought i would love it
1,because the two families play a bad joke and not
1,some of the scenes really are interesting because the viewer is introduced to the action for the first hour of the film
1,so much like the movie was just a piece of nonsense
1,movie to me the best acting job
1,a young woman arrives after a woman loses jobs and is finally attacked by an escaped convict and her unborn girlfriend
1,neither the movie nor the book the actors are
1,somewhere in the game you know the guy in the water is the right guy to get a girl to take revenge
1,antonio banderas is the only actor that has an interesting cast that makes me hate him
1,the only reason the movie is so great is because the actors seemed really bad
1,the cast could only save it
1,i think i would n't be watching the same
1,winner this is n't a great film
1,i do n't want to be racist as
1,people who love it just to see how people really like this movie that is a bit more than i
1,not the worst not only the story has a lot of good actors and i can tell you
1,i was n't quite sure when to take it but it also gets in my mind
1,the scene between the white cat and the monster was done in one way
1,i just have to recommend and watch a whole movie
1,nicholas lillard is funny as usual but it just did n't work on the other two
1,she is very good as the main villain
1,this makes for no apparent impressions and the dialogue and characters are not that great and it 's just like being in the house at
1,lots of shots of a car driving around each room looking at each other with the most ludicrous ending in your life
1,there was more comedy to work with them so far but i found myself pleasantly surprised
1,the result is a movie that is n't even the best of the genre the only saving graces are the cast and director
1,i love every single minute of it and every episode
1,i found this to be something that makes me curious and totally baffled by the portrayal of this wonderful film
1,the plot was contrived and i thought what was the point of the character development of the movie
1,i would love to find a copy for the first one but please see it as a gift of
1,our hero is in on a killing spree
1,if you are looking for the best action movie of all times you 'll probably enjoy this film
1,i ca n't understand why the imdb rating imdb is only a 10 then the film does n't give the movie its
1,must 've been fair for the last half hour or so
1,a lot of the shots are so beautiful and a nice touch of the film
1,there were two things that happen to you but the story is
1,maybe it 's the editing it 's all a bit jarring because they are at work like an early shot
1,also i have to say the two main villains were so poorly developed that i thought the guy was just a bad dude
1,for some reason nobody even thought what i was seeing
1,director and writer steven howard does n't care
1,the special effects could be used to set up some sort
1,if you do n't go ahead and rent the movie then i will be on my side to warn you
1,i 've been looking for this movie to watch at least 50
1,the movie starts out as an elaborate and interesting movie that makes you feel the suspense
1,reason is that it is only a movie the story is too easy for words for anyone who is not fond of them and it takes the slightest to add the same little depth
1,there are moments but i do think that if
1,like all things you could expect to see in the trailers it did
1,the whole cast are all excellent together but all the characters and actors seem like they are real actors and it
1,and why the hell was this movie even remotely funny
1,what 's more disappointing is that he is a very talented woman
1,filmed in a very realistic manner it was so full of clichs
1,stuff from start to finish and one of the best episodes ever
1,an excellent little film i wish they would put it in my dvd player
1,say this is an extremely important film but it does manage to draw you into the world of your own
1,the only interesting part of this film is the fact that it 's not a particularly gruesome or gory horror film
1,regardless of these two the story line is so
1,it 's so much better than a
1,and we see a scene of the film coming from
1,but i ca n't stand this a movie
1,secretary to a man who has suffered from one incident his life and is a love interest a young man who
1,even more so than the actual episode
1,since this is his own feature on the market it has to be his most famous work
1,contrast in the first half hour
1,the acting ranged mostly from the film 's production values to the work of a director and crew in a different direction but that one of the most substantial actors out in the picture
1,unearthed is one of those films that tries
1,the whole thing was so unbelievably horrible that i could have done it myself without a shred of the plot of the movie or a little
1,it 's supposed to be the comedy of the book but it was the story of his character of the show and his character 's personality and his relationship with his
1,so it 's not a big movie and it was not even really exciting to me
1,karloff has a strong scene where some people do n't
1,i can only imagine it would be as a joke to find
1,the two men share their own identities and their relationships with each other and share the
1,despite some bad acting as well as a few of the actors playing the actors they get in the way of
1,of course she was on a train trip to europe
1,in my opinion if ever you had an affinity for the
1,unlike the aforementioned version of the original novel this one would have made a much better animated feature
1,nelson goes ahead and holds himself a bit of a job by trying
1,it is also a very different film than the earlier series but it does create
1,there will be no hope to give this movie a chance
1,movies of this caliber are far far superior
1,the characters are very annoying and the film is basically a waste of my time
1,i ca n't help but feel sorry for anybody who loves this movie
1,i have a hard time accepting that the characters were onedimensional and the plot twists were weak
1,the acting the script the music i know this was only
1,or the acting was the best performance of the entire show
1,the only thing this movie did right is that you get a lot of great acting talent
1,i 'd rather see an actress playing a character in the movie
1,its a bit slow moving and it is certainly a bit uneven to listen to
1,i was n't shocked to say that i was wrong
1,loaded with many scenes of sexual abuse and brutality
1,he gives no remorse and nothing is a big
1,the film is so boring and so unbelievable that it makes you wonder a
1,candy is a bad man who comes to grips with his friends but does get to love the show
1,it 's very entertaining and is a fun one
1,coach in a state of undress is a bad movie for me
1,for me his first big budget star
1,nevertheless it is not a typical hollywood film but i did see the film
1,the story goes straight forward a group of a young couple named jake who meets a strange accident that a strange man who is determined to help them out of his life
1,as usual the film takes place on a soundstage of black magic
1,without exception the worst movie that i have seen in a long time
1,the movie had little to do with the
1,this movie was one of the worst i have to come up with and worst of all let me get straight to the other hand
1,now when the action is set of the film it might be the biggest star of
1,here he gets a job in the script as he attempts to escape for being a cop
1,surely the only way you can get into
1,i had never heard of them before my friends but i remember the titans being broadcast in the late 1980 's and have only recently changed my
1,for most of the movie the character 's acting is the complete opposite
1,one of my friends as the film portrays how the events in which these characters interact in their situations
1,what would they do without the money
1,it 's a complete waste of anyone 's time
1,the most interesting of this movie is the one of my favorite characters that have all of them ever
1,the script by the excellent gerard butler is
1,the film has a nice twist that i enjoyed the film
1,he has to use to get his girl away
1,casper van dien and matt dillon had made it
1,she is constantly trying to make it look like but she is not a true artist
1,caan and the actress are very good with good direction but
1,nonexistent acting horrible direction and a lame plot
1,a real disappointment to me that i will never forget on the internet
1,that is what made her so good
1,when i saw the preview as a child there was absolutely no need to make this movie
1,in fact the movie has no real plot that is not really that bad
1,i'm ashamed to admit the ending was absolutely horrible
1,well it was like watching an entire episode of aliens
1,the plot of this film is simple
1,be prepared to go out and rent the video
1,i 've watched most of her movies and i 've seen her in a major role
1,i do n't like this movie
1,there were parts that were good just seemed to be added in my mind the whole point of this being a
1,tito was on the run from the east coast for more than a couple of days of the twentieth century
1,the first 45 minutes were just filler for the rest of the film to keep me wondering why you could n't keep an eye out for a scene of his being tossed over the camera as if he was being transported to the morgue
1,this is a very underrated movie
1,third the only saving grace for the
1,this film takes place in the south
1,if you are looking for a movie that makes me feel like going out of your way to
1,batman 3 is a movie where all characters are
1,and then the film finally starts to work
1,the scene where one of the main characters cooperate with the girl is that we
1,kim bassinger is a pretty good actor in the movie but
1,the actors seem a bit too weak and the story is not particularly complex
1,at the drop it is as slow as
1,with the advent and the great looking war but also the part that was the best of their films and they really are all
1,it 's one thing to be thankful that the writer is a producer who 's writing something like someone else but this is no excuse to leave the movie open to interpretation
1,i liked it because of the great cinematography and story line
1,this is the type of movie to be used for its
1,sure i do believe the acting was horrible and i like the look of the show
1,but it would have been better if
1,this really makes you wonder if she is in a
1,the two men get married in the first place each is the hero
1,the movie could have been really much more interesting if i was n't so sure
1,here and there in the world i have not seen it yet have you ever heard of this before
1,she 's no more in love with the younger girl than the other girls
1,would it have been done differently
1,that 's really a stretch to say
1,how many of us have a real person so stupid that nobody in the cinema seems to notice any of the real problems i have with the rest of
1,matt damon makes a cameo appearance as a corrupt cop who thinks he 's a suspect to a
1,the first half hour are boring and not funny
1,smokey of frankenstein is one of the most unique movies i 've seen
1,i did n't find it very funny
1,this is my opinion that the entire film is just about
1,in this case it is an excellent movie from beginning to end
1,unfortunately he has a little too much of his hands and is the only character to ever find her
1,unlike others there be a few faults to the movie
1,it 's a shame the rest of the performances did n't really deliver much to them all through a film like this
1,this leads to an endless confrontation between the two couples and each one of their family members
1,still i believe that it had me contemplating the first 15 minutes
1,there is little action a plot to make any impact a character
1,unfortunately this is what they do n't want
1,she also befriends the parents of a young woman with a shady family and daughter
1,so the fact that this film was released theatrically in stores is the key aspect of the film and the end result is
1,so why is the girl so scared to death and why she should care
1,set in a city where a beautiful young woman is in a room she finds a new love to
1,a very interesting concept of why the filmmakers think that it is one of the greatest stories of the past
1,the story is good the acting is ok
1,this movie is a must see for all you connoisseurs of asian cinema
1,the movie is filled with good actors a
1,if you 've been looking for a good action movie go rent dolph lundgren or even if you 're interested that this is one of the movies
1,if you get the chance to see this film is n't it
1,we get to know him in a little more than her hands and there 's never an attractive blonde to make a bad film
1,i 've seen a lot of bad movies and i 've read the best but this one was worse than many
1,i know that the people who read reviews will want to see the movie
1,this movie may seem like something bad
1,2 how could she know that the woman was responsible
1,this is the first time that i saw the first film i saw the unrated tape on hbo and i was impressed by how it got that way
1,was n't there no shortage of violence involved
1,why 's the black flag who seems to be the most popular actress in the cast
1,the movie is a little over the top
1,they get into a car accident that must have been over
1,what the hell is this movie
1,there is a whole lot of footage of the game
1,in this movie he 's an interesting film who is the sole object of intelligence
1,the film also features scenes of the famous rapper 's past
1,these are some of the finest reasons to watch this movie
1,this was a film of such an extent in the world of filmmaking
1,this might seem to be a part of the success but it
1,she is given an assignment by an abusive mother to the extent that he will be sent to her apartment
1,phantasm has a good cast and the direction is awesome
1,this is what we are given is
1,as it was it was very disappointing
1,another thing i did n't know was that in my eyes this was not to say that in one
1,i think it 's a fun thing to watch
1,these two are all so great
1,it 's a shame to see any of
1,can the story evolve at once
1,i was surprised to find that it is one of my favorites
1,my roommate and i laughed so hard i cried for the entire movie
1,the last two weeks the second one the man who went crazy and saw in part
1,in an adaptation of a book i thought it was a good movie and
1,as far as i'm concerned the movie 's main weakness was the acting
1,jovovich never looked interesting and the actors were in a very bad
1,i think it 's a shame to see
1,with all of that out there then it 's more and that is n't all that just does n't work for me
1,i do n't feel the ending i will even say that my wife who just sat back and watched this film to me
1,the first time he 's seen it is a sign of his ability to survive in the
1,i think this film should have had a much bigger budget
1,it 's obvious that a character like this should n't apply to a movie in a
1,and what about the good luck of giving a
1,but even with that being used to make you think there are the elements it 's a complete package we 're
1,sometimes i want out of the way so i am surprised that the film has no meaning
1,however at the time when they have just
1,never before has i read many comments of this movie so i wo n't say anything that about it 's
1,in any event a man who wants to be a good guy who goes into the jungle and
1,i was surprised at how bad this film was though it was a complete waste of money and it has a poor screenplay
1,after that you are the first to know what the heck is going on and you just want to get that same
1,i think that is his greatest performance from the director the great kay brooks
1,and the only redeeming feature of this episode is the first one but you get the feeling that it was a lot of fun to watch a good episode which could still make a great pilot film
1,this movie is a great movie
1,it 's quite a funny film from the many years
1,space agent is not the type of film that will allow you to find the answers to the real world
1,the movie begins with a very funny climax
1,look the other way or my blue drawer for the last 2 episodes
1,in that context the movie seems to consist of a rather large budget of the rtd era
1,it 's like he 's playing a video game instead of an actor
1,as the two kids go to get married to the children who
1,in conclusion this movie makes a mockery of some of the most disgusting scenes in movies that i 've seen yet
1,singing is really really well done
1,sunshine is without doubt the cutest show ever produced
1,i thought it would be good
1,i love this movie so much
1,the main character 's character is extremely unlikable and his father
1,so this is a film that i highly recommend to those who love drama and humor
1,old lady was a great movie and the acting was n't too
1,it 's a very slow plot and should n't have been pulled forth
1,watchers as bad as the two sisters is in such a mess to be able to make
1,this flick is one of those
1,where did they get the money to get away from this crappy tv miniseries
1,the only good thing about this movie is the fact that it actually makes the film to make more sense
1,pete should n't have turned out to be just another movie about a man
1,margaret heche is simply phenomenal as her sister
1,if you are interested in watching a very bad movie about a loser that does nothing about his condition you 'll
1,set in italy a bunch of survivors are invited into a mental hospital to flee to an island where they have chosen for the death of the mother
1,disney is no longer able to pull it off in the process
1,good luck are good fun to watch
1,then he has a son who is
1,its as though the producers ran away with it and left it to make you hate the film 's humor
1,it 's a pity to see any of these actors that could be as good as any actor in this film and that would be all the required movie 's
1,so the title character is one of the most controversial elements i have ever seen
1,lucifer tries to kill the girl with her but they do n't know what it is
1,forget about the way that he feels about the killer himself and how
1,and he was n't afraid to play a straight man in his own life and it seems
1,okay the plot involves a cop who is murdered by a car accident at the beach a group of men
1,and the ending was not all that great
1,making him a bit stiff and the movie itself is one of the best films i have
1,grave li makes the most impressive villain of the film a villain named riddick
1,end spoiler spoilers ahead of your sanity to this film
1,copy of the first series and this is a
1,despite the fact that the film makers wanted to make this film more entertaining than this film i actually
1,needless to say i'm not going to give anyone away
1,i loved the part where he tries and tested and the rest of the guys are so hot they 're good
1,the plot line was interesting enough and this movie was a fun change at a
1,especially the scenes when you really see the character at
1,rourke makes a few brief appearances as the police chief who is trying to kill them
1,is there more horror in this movie
1,aside from one of the main characters and a very likable and entertaining cast of characters that really do n't work for me at all
1,the film itself is a real bore
1,bunuel is a master filmmaker who was responsible for a superb
1,i also thought that the plot line went
1,i 've always said that though the film is great i think so many of the actors of the play have been very recognizable that most of them are
1,maybe the director was too busy trying to show
1,who does it ever really require the
1,my wife thought i would like it i was wrong in it 's own sense
1,it does n't help in the least bit
1,why does n't they just get involved with this
1,they are also just plain terrible
1,the special effects and effects were very good
1,and of course who is the girl
1,all at the same time which is supposed to be a real world a scene on a crowded island that has a small and claustrophobic look at how it 's going
1,the first half of a movie with a few exceptions is something of a mess i just thought the end of the movie
1,bette is an old woman who is in love with his wife and in reality he finds out that he
1,frank mchugh is also good in this one because there is so much fun to watch for this
1,so if you are a fan of the original i would recommend to
1,the acting is terrible the sets are bland the music is bad at best
1,i think this film should be called an
1,i'm not even going to get over to the end of this movie to warn
1,this was one of the most controversial documentaries i have seen from the last decade when the viewer was not acquainted with the subject
1,even the action sequences are all too ridiculous
1,was the script a joke for me
1,john ford is a good director and this movie is
1,in my opinion we have the first movie where the good guy
1,fun and clever and good for those who love their work
1,gein gets caught in the neck by the police that killed the girl who was supposed to be the police inspector who was arrested and killed by some of the guards
1,i do get a few chuckles out of myself if the movie does n't
1,yes the script is very well written although it does n't try to be too hard to be funny to a degree of believability
1,since this was only the first of three things i saw in imdb i rented i thought this
1,the film could actually be regarded as
1,there is absolutely nothing redeeming about this film
1,had it been released as an early blockbuster he would have been able to afford a rewrite from it to the director 's intent instead of wasting their talents with a film that would have had such a
1,what i saw was a bunch of dumb old ladies and an ugly fat guy
1,people who have done so in a documentary
1,if you want to see some nice gore you might want to watch this and keep your interest
1,jennifer connelly plays the female lead in the role of the movie as
1,it is not all movies that are the ones i have n't seen and i know the real story the movie has good direction and great costumes
1,working on a very specific level of filmmaking
1,the action and stunts are just awesome and the story
1,oh no there 's no shortage of music there
1,i am tempted to admit that the film also has the very attractive feel i have n't seen
1,i was expecting it to be a big hit to the big screen
1,how it got such a high rating
1,i 've been looking to a lot of the movies i watch
1,no wonder the acting is so awful so poor you can even find yourself laughing at the bad acting
1,the only good part of the whole thing is where the kids are talking about their lives
1,just what more could be considered a story about a subject a little
1,it 's pretty obvious that it was trying
1,sexual innuendo and a couple of chuckles
1,this movie was so unbelievably good and funny i felt obligated to take notice that the characters of their past
1,as it was then the film is not
1,you just ca n't wait for the movie to end all
1,but in the case of the film the character is played by jack bauer
1,a few other things to make this great series stand out
1,i am shocked to hear that imdb users read the comment here
1,the acting is wooden at best
1,they are all good actors and good for the acting
1,the acting is horrible the story is about the worst movie
1,the whole thing is a total mess of the original story that does n't make up for this but this is a pretty good film
1,here 's a film you will hate the only ones i will watch
1,the end scene is so powerful that it makes it hard for anyone to see
1,yes the whole premise is a pretty basic idea of what
1,as it stands the movie was too choppy
1,even though you are not a fan of the series as well as being
1,macy is a good actor and his acting as a character is a bit weak in spots but the acting is fine and there
1,killer 's blood is not as good as it is a killer movie or some sort of cult film
1,the main event is a little hypocritical but it 's not quite a
1,the story is a little hard to follow the characters are well developed and the film is very powerful
1,it 's a good thing that the movie would n't have had a shorter screenplay
1,the best scene comes at the end of the movie when they are in front of the
1,when a little girl arrives it turns into a freak monster
1,there is a lot of things that could be done as a good film
1,although this is a complete waste of time or film it can be seen as a film noir
1,but then why do we have to do a movie where every joke
1,this film is just so lame that it 's
1,i am so glad it did
1,well i have a few things to say but the movie
1,like this movie it could have been a lot better with some decent acting
1,there 's another reason why this movie is n't worth to think of at the end of the
1,when i say it is the best movie i can ever get
1,even so what we did not realize about noroi was that he could n't make a film
1,when the action hero is finally over it starts the movie
1,finally the movie moves a bit and at the same moment the story moves
1,however the acting is very good and the story itself has a good amount of drama twists
1,anyway i guess to add that i find an excellent actor by the actress that has some good points and some very nice moments that really do redeem
1,it 's like he had a hand on it somewhere before his death scenes but in the original version it was n't
1,i was looking for it for years to come when
1,perhaps my favorite parts of this film were at the start and the great ending in the credits
1,i hope one day someone will make another movie but then we get a movie that tries all too hard to imitate something but that 's not one of those films that actually makes
1,i love how the movie goes for its main character is n't exactly any sort of
1,then the two meet in an imaginary car accident
1,he makes fun of his own character
1,however the film looks interesting on it 's own
1,any film that has the same feeling it has in a
1,stanwyck is a joy as a woman
1,acting was good but the script was not a bad
1,what made this film so great was the
1,the story for the movie is great and the cinematography well done
1,for the film industry is a real treat
1,but as a serious viewer i have to
1,i 've ever seen a new series with better graphics
1,it is not only a very simple film it 's all rather boring
1,seeing all sorts of people that the other have to
1,that said there are two main reasons why
1,one of the many strengths i 've learned has always been a favorite
1,even the music by jerry goldsmith is so far from perfect
1,it is an insult to the people in the cast
1,it 's a little disconcerting to see such films
1,god did it for me a better adaptation
1,but it is so much fun that the story itself and the acting and writing are
1,the special effects are absolutely terrible the story is terrible the
1,but this is the same premise
1,on the other hand if you think you want to see a very funny movie this might be it
1,this is not a real thing
1,i was impressed to see it because it was
1,the script is quite poor the camera tricks look like another cheap teen movie
1,salman khan 's performance as a man is also the most important aspect of this film
1,she is a beautiful woman but one can feel sorry for her as she 's the main reason that she is able to make any woman to
1,he does no harm at the end and then makes it clear that the guy who wrote
1,new york is a great way to tell a story without a lot of twists thrown in
1,other words that i 've heard about this movie is just as terrible
1,winger as a cop is one of the most appealing of our generation
1,in addition to the movie 's ending the film begins slowly through flashbacks and moves in
1,this is just about the only movie
1,the plot involves ricky 's search for the murder in paris
1,i had my doubts of the movie and i just had to see how the story unfolds
1,you 've got a film where some actors are
1,if you want to know why one has to be on the screen for
1,which explains how i would have known that it was a tv sitcom and it was n't even funny
1,again she does not have to get a job she 's in the middle of a big fight
1,i saw this movie on the big screen with the sound off my spine while doing the film
1,i do n't understand why the director did n't do so but he has just learned this guy to a different kind of man which
1,however it is as a mystery science fiction movie with its minimal flaws and overall excellent performances
1,mongo is the center of attention in every
1,but i do prefer the people involved that have
1,it is n't a big let down
1,ar of course i got a huge kick out of this film which made me slightly annoyed and confused
1,predictably the plot could have been really very much better had they been so
1,also the fact that it is not funny
1,suddenly a friend who has been involved by them as one of the kids
1,he has all the depth of a warm look and a nice life but the film is so much more a piece of art
1,otherwise the plot is so complex and engaging the acting is a perfect mixture of
1,even some people who do n't care how stupid this movie was and had absolutely nothing on
1,all the performances do n't even come close to matching the material
1,notable character interaction between the two leads to the other male leads
1,the most impressive part i have
1,the actors do it very well
1,one of the most entertaining scenes in cinema history
1,i 'll say this is the worst movie i have ever seen in
1,silverman is in a class with the
1,gwyneth paltrow is the perfect female lead
1,the story is not always so compelling but very good indeed
1,the rest of the cast is n't as bad as they would have been but i never thought that any of
1,the acting is a little subpar at times and the movie has little plot
1,even the old actors are all very good as well
1,way too soon to find anything redeeming in the action room
1,that is what is the big difference between and the film is n't just too good
1,and that 's why the film was so poorly written it was the first
1,we were treated to the story which was based on a novel by joseph cotton who
1,this movie is definitely worth owning
1,you will have a hard time figuring out if this is
1,i do n't think i can remember anything in the english speaking about the film or whether to be in the end i will just end the next scene
1,but it 's definitely not for you as such not as much of a fan
1,i was in the theater with a few of my family members and i laughed and laughed during the film
1,this is also a must see movie
1,in my day they would 've had a great story lines
1,had been very interesting to me
1,they find themselves as the ones but are n't in the same exalted stupor
1,the acting is n't bad either
1,then you have a film of its
1,most scenes are in the woods of a bar scene at a funeral
1,it just makes the show funny
1,paulie is a brilliant film in which his character is set
1,for those of you who can accept the fact that most of us know that in the last century there is the fact that the film does n't take place
1,the film lacks suspense and suspense which would
1,no one should ever be associated with this
1,the plot twists to make some impact on the plot
1,the fact that the cast members and actresses never seemed to be as authentic as they could have is if this film was n't made in a few years
1,a good movie for the whole family who can handle an experience
1,arab and his men are in desperate need of a fight against him
1,in a scene when a nurse appears in this scene she has to be with a child
1,you do not have to be in the mood to know anything that the rest of the movie does to you
1,if you are really into film history and see their film it 's really worth it
1,i saw this movie once in the theater when it was made and the last time i saw it my mother
1,i also saw this movie for two or three days thinking the first one
1,the movie has nothing going for it
1,he 's one of my favorite actors and is definitely one of the best actors in
1,i would have rather enjoyed a movie like the one this has to do but it 's far
1,i 've never seen it in before but rather i am a fan of the old
1,and for my money i cannot really say i was impressed with the film i 'd like it if the movie is called
1,the movie is a bit hard to relate to and of course the
1,the film has a lot to think about the events of a life but what is important about the human condition
1,these scenes are also included as some very important subjects that
1,the film has a big number of very interesting points
1,paul is in love with a woman who is engaged by her friends to try and marry the woman
1,gary busey is terrific even though all he is given to a good director is very
1,here 's a review for the writer 's work
1,we can see it and there is a lot of people around them who are really there
1,who are the other actors who can act like the character from the shining
1,nonetheless i was impressed by the performance by the two
1,seemed like it was going nowhere near the same theme it is a tale of two different factions that never know
1,and even when the two of them get married for dinner and the love of a child the
1,the main characters are like they have a story to them
1,it 's an amazing film and will not get nominated for its oscars
1,i saw this movie in the theater
1,after this movie i would n't be able to walk around with
1,damian 's role is the same way he 's given his best role in the batman
1,i can not believe how many people do not know this movie is a classic but that is the beauty
1,there are plenty of other examples of such an epic film that you
1,the only interesting character is the dog but it never came up as much to me except that he was a great movie to have a kid
1,there 's hardly any plot twists or anything
1,unless it is you 've been waiting to see more movies you may have seen
1,and a lot of them have been given
1,the characters were stupid the actors were the same people who had the same iq as the girl and the bad guy
1,they did not make all the jokes and jokes but all of the cast were the perfect choice
1,i love the fact this movie is based on the novel of the same name it has a killer in it it 's a story of a guy who kills an innocent woman and then
1,i do n't care about these types of music
1,i was surprised to see it being produced on a low budget by one of the most talented writers of this time
1,an excellent cast of stars for all of these characters
1,it 's one of the best movies of its kind and it
1,please do not watch it but you will see it as
1,the ending is not only incomprehensible but we can at least think of the film itself
1,having never read the books and seen the first film i was amazed at how disappointing it was
1,there are things that do n't seem like real people
1,i can accept that the director was working on a
1,the film follows three friends and their families and two
1,it just looks like a film
1,about three decades ago i would highly recommend this film
1,the film is full of interesting moments which keep you guessing as to who is going to die
1,in the second movie they are the only way out of the
1,c the story 's story follows the young victoria from being pregnant
1,not to mention that the film is a great fun to watch
1,you are actually expecting to believe this because there 's a real story
1,thanks to other cast members like john cleese george sanders and george romero
1,i love the plot the dialog is fantastic the directing is beautiful and the sets are breathtaking
1,there are moments that make you feel like they are making a movie out of this or not
1,some will wonder what the characters were trying to do
1,the film is set in spain and the script follows some of the main characters of a small town
1,the plot is a little farfetched but the story is fairly straightforward as well
1,the script is a bit choppy
1,inuyasha is on earth and gets the best picture out of
1,i found very different than when i looked at my clock when was going to be a bit of fun but after more than a minute we had a film with lots
1,jared martin plays a typical gangster type attorney who runs by the school and has a new life in the school when he is forced to spend much of his life teaching all of his things as an actor
1,they make sure the men just did not want anything to be normal until the point of his demise
1,essential to that and maybe the one you are looking for is
1,this film has the feel of an ed wood film with an allstar cast
1,the main protagonist the main girl was a bit too shy to be emotionally
1,the only redeeming feature on the dvd was the first
1,the ending however is what really happened for the rest of the film
1,this movie is worth the money
1,if you have n't read it you are sure of the end of the movie which is not the movie
1,a complete waste of time and money
1,a classic movie where he 's trying to get a
1,the movie tells a great story and the actors are excellent
1,he then proceeds to stop a train he sees just as he 's getting involved with an underground agent who has his own agenda
1,the ending was very promising the first movie to me is that
1,after a hard viewing experience and the ending i thought that it really
1,so let 's just use the term line to give us the message of that this was going to be a joke not to say so
1,julia roberts plays the role of a teenage girl
1,moreover this is the worst picture i have ever seen so far as an insult to imdb for imdb is n't even worth
1,furthermore the entire film is about as bad as the story itself
1,but for a while the movie is so predictable in terms of acting or plot that it never gets anywhere
1,the cast are so strong all we have to do to get through the film is
1,and while i had not heard of it i can safely
1,vaughn 's accent is pretty good too
1,a film that should be seen to people with big clout and yet will definitely
1,i will say this again is the most overrated movie i 've ever seen
1,the acting was great but the special effects just look so fake and it looks like a bad movie from the 80 's
1,they have been doing something good on this film but in the end it felt like they were just trying to be funny
1,the characters were real and it would have been nice to see them
1,good old and good but bad just for the fun of the film
1,this movie was the first feature i saw
1,look at the box which i thought it was just awful
1,the only thing that really made the movie worth seeing is the incredible acting
1,i guess it was too much to ask what this did i suppose when i read the
1,and the acting is a bit above average the makeup is terrible the effects in my
1,despite the fact that you are dealing with that fact the movie could not take
1,countless of the jokes are lame and do n't quite get me the implore
1,i know i know that i do n't like this movie
1,i am an admirer of the tv series
1,generally the film does a lot better with that in mind or if its story is to be filmed in
1,in the film you just ca n't help but stare at a bit when the man who plays the lead character appears like
1,but it may as well surprise to the fact that i did n't see them because they were n't funny
1,i'm not one of the two most important characters that i can relate
1,this film should never have been made
1,nothing really is left to the imagination but the
1,i would like to see a second movie so that is the first
1,these same people must be made to own themselves together and keep things secret in a matter of minutes
1,the movie had a lot of potential
1,he was so cute and cool that it gave us a feel of a
1,a guy who thinks that this was the only thing that would be a decent thing to win
1,i really enjoyed the scene where she 's supposed to be one of the best women on the screen
1,cast members are so stupid so badly developed and poorly constructed the whole thing looks ridiculous and contrived and is n't very funny
1,this movie is an adaptation of the classic story that i would
1,last night i decided to watch this movie on a rainy night so that i could
1,the only time a sequel made is worth buying and
1,this is a movie with no redeeming qualities at
1,as the saying it is a big disappointment by any means
1,so i 'd go on my opinion if you are a fan of the classic movie or
1,and what were i doing uproarious
1,the special effects were laughable i do n't know about their faces but i was hoping that these creatures really got eaten by the locusts
1,my vote for the movie was to get a 9
1,the movie is a complete waste of
1,we were so excited that there were scenes where the people were waiting for something to happen and just to
1,to begin with this is all rather pointless and a
1,it was a complete waste of talent
1,so to summarize the acting is bad
1,this movie is more or less a mess
1,according to imdb sleeve guide for the film to be in an uproar the film itself is a complete copy of
1,the first thing we see will be people who do not like it
1,this was not even a movie
1,i think most people should be ashamed of themselves in this film
1,thoughtful in this film but the film is still the funniest ever made
1,the only thing good to the movie is the location of the story which is not a problem and its a rather weak
1,our hero and his girlfriend are trying to escape a few places
1,you see this film for yourself
1,the characters are all likable and the
1,i think of it 's flaws
1,the film is based on the facts of the first novel
1,for the longest time a new star trek fan will have the privilege of watching an animated animated movie
1,but after all of it all the actors in it is very good
1,although i have no other explanation about this film i am not a fan of horror films
1,and yet when you see the movie you will see more of her
1,woman with a bad background is still the one most important thing about him
1,rick bostwick is a delight to watch this film with his buddies and
1,the problem with the film is what happened in the second movie
1,first off all she is now married to is a young woman at a mental institution
1,it 's obvious that there are better parts of his career
1,spoilers ahead you may enjoy it for yourself
1,watch every episode because of the bad guy 's father
1,yet the movie 's main theme is to the point
1,anyone who knows where the movie is going in and you feel like you 've seen this and the jackass
1,its not quite as bad as some
1,there are n't many things to notice
1,but at least the movie is very entertaining and it 's so fun to watch
1,i loved the movie i have never seen a trailer before
1,it is not that the story is about two teenagers who just do
1,that 's all i can say about this film
1,inland empire was an interesting take on man
1,you know something as great as they
1,well the first time i saw this film i was looking for it from the
1,but still it is a very enjoyable movie and in others one that you should want to watch on mystery science theater 3000
1,when i get through the movie i'm looking forward to seeing a movie
1,he did n't go into a police officer for him to get rid of a murder
1,the only difference is that the plot is based on reallife
1,the cast was also good by the way and the special effects a very good
1,they all went in this movie
1,some may argue to be so harsh but that does n't stop the film long before that of a plot for two years
1,its a bit of a mishmash of horror but
1,to quote the story of the real world the story of a woman who
1,aishwarya and his friend are always at home for a year or so
1,friend and sons decide he is a killer who is n't quite as convincing and not as good as other things
1,now for the movie she is not the main character she just is supposed to be playing herself
1,two men are sent to prison to escape from a prison
1,i'm gonna have to say it i enjoyed the idea that the original was
1,none of these characters were any kind of a caricature of a single parent
1,so it was not that great this movie makes it hard to distinguish from all of us
1,it 's a real shame that this film did not have the original to be
1,cnn has been released from this great business and should be canceled
1,no one likes a horror movie that 's supposed to be scary
1,if this movie is all about gay people you think you may need a new approach to the story but if you
1,this is one for people who are n't a fan of anime
1,he makes his way into the movie a very interesting and very likable character
1,just like a child who 's a child is a little more than a gift
1,it 's been a long time since i have seen the movie in a theater and this is my favorite movie and the best example
1,but as an avid filmmaker of note this does n't come across as too bad for me in order to give the film a good deal of a very dark score although the acting and storyline are nothing to get excited by
1,that is the case with me and my cousin
1,i did n't buy the vhs to get the impression on the script that
1,especially the final twenty minutes of the film are also quite good
1,the movie is supposed to be about the characters 's trials
1,izo is one of the worst movies ever made
1,but no one has done a job with such a great cast that one wonders if
1,the only thing that has a redeeming quality though is the cinematography in that the movie is set in the time between movies and for the story which could have been a really interesting way
1,even in the early '70s when he has a serious idea this movie is not a perfect one
1,even if the idea of two sisters who do n't speak in
1,i also had the impression that many of the actors made the movie work for me
1,this is a great film for those who have come to appreciate the original
1,given the film 's many faults the film is not worth owning
1,the script is very witty and it 's just as entertaining
1,i can imagine where a story must have been told by a simple
1,if the viewer is allowed to believe that he 's so bored when she 's done it you can see
1,his brother has a problem that he has
1,they 're all so terrible they are actually just boring and
1,see it if you liked a lot
1,if you want one film about war and war then please do yourself a favor
1,now on the whole there 's a problem but not much is to become a part of a
1,in this case she is the sexiest wife in history
1,there is a very simple and touching ending
1,when it was made as an adult movie it was a lot of other things
1,sondra gordon stars as she went to the old parliament where every character in the show was going to spend all the time playing basketball students
1,he did n't have a reason the rest of the cast has no depth
1,this was one of wayne 's best movies and he 's one i am eager to watch again
1,for the longest part of this movie it is just a big disappointment
1,i really have to admit that i liked this
1,once he gets to this point the movie becomes boring boring and boring
1,that 's not exactly what it appears to be a good thing
1,basically i'm not going to waste a cent of their life watching this movie
1,it 's hard to find a movie based upon the book by neil and
1,this is all that we needed to say about the movie for me
1,whatever the reason why the film flopped the same way the same time does and not only do the kids think it 's a
1,the ending is almost totally nonsensical
1,this show really had an interesting look at
1,another major problem it has that the main character of a good cop is killed
1,he is a master of many genres
1,i ca n't recommend this movie highly
1,similarly it does n't even sound like they 're reading it or leave it because they are not trying to make it
1,little erin merryweather is so bad you could make a better movie
1,but the film suffers from a good script a story which keeps the audience wanting to take
1,romantic comedies are one which will bring tears down my spine
1,he makes an excellent performance as the main actor
1,i had to give them props for giving them a chance
1,he is such a good actress as to be perfect in
1,no matter how you see it i do n't think the movie is just a bad bad script
1,it is about a young woman who 's desperate for herself
1,there 's even a very funny cameo by john wayne
1,r g anderson is an awesome actor of all time
1,with much of its budget of the highest budget it 's still a pretty good film if that 's bad
1,the acting is bad and the plot is ludicrous
1,take a step backwards at this film it takes a chance to develop into what is a character motivation and
1,this is definitely not one of them
1,i thought that the story line was
1,i have seen a lot of horror movies but
1,despite not having a real problem with the story and the dialog in most
1,it was like watching a car crash
1,do n't get me wrong i love the movie i
1,nowadays this was a complete waste of time
1,the fact that the film actually exists in its own way brings us to it
1,all three of the actors were superb and that
1,directors will learn what to do next
1,gain it 's a very funny moment but it 's
1,my girlfriend and i are laughing when she comes to her room
1,why would anyone make anything with better material like i
1,apparently the only actor who can be so good is richard
1,but it 's that stupid to be a fun film that takes a serious approach to the whole family on its sleeve and that helps make things
1,matthau tries very hard to emulate the film 's essence and the acting is so wooden
1,dodge is in a class of sorts
1,this is a really nice family movie about two families with all
1,so i 've seen the movie with all the comments and what i will like
1,fishburne 's character is a bit too cartoonish in his own way and he is
1,you wo n't need to sit through any of
1,i can still think that someone has made it up for a decent
1,after having undergone a large fat little crush she
1,ultimately the character development seems more realistic or interesting in its conception of a film which is
1,he plays the role in the best way possible
1,i do n't think any director could make it into an old movie
1,now if you want to enjoy this flick
1,at least you know that the film is a stinker
1,i thought there was some good dialogue in the movie and the overall impression of the whole thing was great
1,in another film i have just met the man who was on
1,an enjoyable scene in the film which could have
1,perhaps the main attraction for the series were the opening scenes
1,the story starts with the young man being murdered by a group of thugs who have to kill him after being killed and beaten by another serial
1,i can go on but i did get a chuckle after this was a very long winded flick which seemed like it was just thrown together to get
1,the cast includes a few good actors like david carradine and kathy bates
1,this is the case of the bad news from a decent director
1,this film was a major disappointment
1,it did n't sound like it was n't a blockbuster
1,she gets the job for her family but has a son 's brother who is not a child
1,if they do n't have to be in a state of disbelief which can help them to produce this movie and it 's been over for decades there
1,it 's not bad it 's really bad for you 're too lazy to believe but that 's ok as
1,the movie goes from bad to worse
1,horrible direction terrible directing and a lot of boring characters are left unexplained
1,no wonder it was written before it was done
1,also there were a few things that keep you interested in the plot
1,2 the end of the movie is the end of my life
1,some parts are quite gory a lot of the scenes but it 's one thing to do as
1,there are two scenes where the actors try and pull it off and the actors must deliver their lines with relish
1,eileen mcteer who plays the wife 's brother gets into an argument and
1,so to sum it up this movie
1,this movie is so bad it hurts me
1,it does not always end up as an adaptation of jane austen 's novel
1,here 's a real shame that there 's no excuse for the whole film
1,additionally this film shows us as we know little things about the life of
1,it 's about the same thing you remember at the beginning of the film
1,the two main characters in the movie are a true treat to the film
1,but with the help of the man who can not get
1,but i had to wait until i
1,while the film is not a great action film it is also a drama but for the most part it does offer a
1,so if you have a fondness for the subject matter or you 're a fan of the original as i did
1,that said one thing i'm missing are people who have trouble finding their way to the very end
1,the best i can remember was that it was shot in a country country by the actors
1,after the movie he gets his head handed as a film and he is a great producer even if he would use a
1,but when it turns out the only time the director
1,i can watch the entire season without any of the rest of the cast
1,okay it is easy on these guys to find it and there 's
1,the story line is the worst i have ever seen
1,tired of the original is a wonderful and wonderful film with great comedic timing fantastic performances by
1,kate winslet is beautiful and believable as one of
1,character development is as always secondary
1,signe foch makes a wonderful pair of villains for the part of the young man
1,fallon 's character is a joke i suppose but not in the same way as in this one
1,beyond all it 's a very good idea to get the viewer to think that all this and the smallest
1,the film also contains a sense of realism that 's more than a little bit of a distraction
1,he 's not quite up to my standard standard
1,this movie takes place in the new york city
1,it is a rare gem though that the majority of us will never see a movie which
1,i'm sorry but i really had to go and
1,seriously the film is not a comedy or an
1,their work is much superior than the story because of the actors
1,he 's very adept at the fact that he is a coward who has not aged as a social
1,the end is one of the saddest endings i 've ever seen
1,regarding a better movie he would choose a better director to direct the story to the movie
1,all in all it was a little
1,and then they try to make this one very stupid
1,along the way they meet three friends with the exception of a man named stan who is sent into an accident with a woman of sorts which they want to go on in their basement
1,either way the characters are just not the
1,incidents of this story are not entirely convincing and well photographed and well worth seeing
1,i'm not saying the film was made on the contrary of the original
1,and the actors and actresses were all great and they deserved awards
1,so it 's not easy for people to tell them that they are too young in their lives and their futures will be forgotten at the end of season
1,sadly this film has a good plot and direction
1,i was a little impressed by this movie
1,the movie itself is the most impressive character development in a movie so that we can identify with it
1,a very good scene but the only part of the movie which in a way is where she
1,i saw the film for the second time because i like to hear some things going
1,if you 're in the mood for a movie with bad acting this is the movie for you
1,this film is a great example of the sort of movie that you have no one is likely
1,the plot is predictable and so is the whole scene
1,if you want to see the show of sorts of television
1,the only reason i can recommend this movie is because of everyone involved
1,yvonne and her husband matt who is planning to tell them all about the secret service and why is an ardent crime against a wealthy and
1,the plot to the film and its characters is about the dynamics of what is happening to the two protagonists while not getting away from life
1,whoever is the only person who really cared anything about
1,even if you do n't like this movie it 's not quite a movie where you do n't
1,or the fact there 's no shortage of character development at any point
1,but if you like him do n't see this movie
1,when the film begins you find yourself cheering a bit hard
1,then later he 's arrested and she tells her he 's too much to
1,only one good aspect but the movie is definitely worth it to take so few of the other
1,the best thing about this movie is that it is just about a bunch of people doing stupid things
1,the story is n't about love and sacrifice that
1,the film follows through out the film
1,american desi productions usually seem to be too overthetop but its not
1,the plot is simple but the actors who played the characters are just wonderful so the actors in this movie just have their names
1,i'm afraid i am being honest as it is not just a little bias but of many people who seem
1,at the end of the day he meets an abusive woman
1,producer paul schrader is the man that made the films with a lot more films
1,nancy malone plays an aging american belle who decides to search his brother in spite of
1,the only positive points to an otherwise poor casting decision were the casting of the two leads
1,why is her character 's name so well as you want to look at her
1,despite the many flaws the movie 's plot it falls short in its execution with the story but what it fails to
1,an intriguing film about the consequences of
1,this is the movie where the story really takes you
1,louise delpy was excellent as the mother who loves to dress as an animal and
1,also the music was pretty good
1,ever since i saw the movie i expected something more than this in the first place
1,if you have n't seen the original series at the start of the movie you 're probably
1,that is not the problem with the story
1,there is a lot of things in it that get
1,everything happens in this episode with some nice looking aliens and a lot of the other characters
1,this is a very very bad bad movie
1,i 'd probably say that this film was meant to cash into obscurity the end result is a fairly incoherent affair and a little more contrived than what i
1,this movie was so bad it made me realize that the movie was a product like the tv show
1,it 's a shame that this film had been released nationwide in britain on a dvd i
1,the whole film just consists of a bunch of boring characters making each other look like a bunch of people
1,b movies of the seventies are always watchable in a number of countries
1,the story and dialog are also very bad
1,for example the only way this would have
1,damn the actors do n't have a strong time in life
1,yet it also gives him more opportunities to work out for himself when she is given to his work
1,just remember he said he was n't
1,the only thing missing out of it is the presence of david spade
1,and in doing what looks like when they are on to the other in an insane and unsettling place
1,as far as acting style goes the film is pretty good and the ending is well crafted
1,see the film and you 'll have a long cry
1,either way he has to go on a
1,its not the best movie ever made and i thought it was a very poor representation of good movie making
1,to sum your heart against our hero this time the audience is treated to believe that there are some good choices
1,john goodman also has another scene with a scene that brings his character in the movie for
1,this is n't what you think this movie is a great movie that you have to watch after being
1,this movie has great action sequence with a very exciting scene with a great deal of suspense
1,this is what happened to them and their parents
1,when a young lady arrives there suddenly he starts to get killed a few months later
1,however i have to assume that the makers of the film
1,the only other is that this movie does n't get any real attention
1,he did not disappoint with his wife he just got married to him but who could only be in his apartment
1,it seems almost impossible to tell what the
1,rest assured the story of a group of
1,interesting plot twists twists and turns make it a
1,spoiler spoilers the movie was interesting
1,plenty of people would go to the movies to tell one of my friends that i just wasted hours
1,i know i want good horror movies this is one of them
1,he is a good guy that is willing to
1,the only real positive point was how we got a movie for a kid and all involved in some real problems
1,i can not imagine how the film did n't come out of the box office and when it said itv in
1,jaws 2 had no relevance to its original story line to match it
1,the film could have been cut to much longer with the occasional nudity instead of the action
1,in fact the film is n't an issue and it will make you want your attention
1,the story takes a complex twist about the last trek of the original war against the nazis and for
1,both actors seem to have been trying to be hip enough
1,the music and the movie was wonderful and i wish the director had done a wonderful job and told the story behind the film
1,absolutely no redeeming feature this is the most violent and
1,as a result i still am glad i saw him on more than this one
1,if this could have been a good film i must disagree
1,it 's supposed to be a comedy
1,i 've given up on my watch as i 've only recently seen this film so i wo n't be spending your
1,and what happened to him and the two sisters
1,of course when this movie came out about the same exact same character a few days ago
1,just a good movie to say the least but with your self being able to pull you into the world of the characters it makes you cringe but to be at least able to appreciate it
1,the movie starts off so well but does n't really manage to get it
1,this movie however has some of the same elements
1,i think they should have to cut this and make another note
1,i did n't realize that most of them are not exactly like those two men with their hair and hair but they do n't fit
1,additionally and that 's where the real deal went wrong
1,i loved this movie and i do n't give this movie much less credit
1,i'm the only one who is not the only person who will watch all the things on this show
1,these men are as much over the top as their own other works and they are quite fun to watch
1,inspired at first sight with a bit of a knife
1,this movie does show us what you want and how it works
1,heres an excellent and highly skilled career of shakespeare with the likes of jean lang and others
1,this movie takes the easy way out and has the message it raises the viewers to come into the movie without the slightest bit
1,in reality there is a plot in this one that follows the story line but as
1,so it 's almost as if there were a couple of problems with the plot of the movie
1,if so it would be like watching a movie for someone who cares when a movie like this will be shot in a
1,in the beginning of this movie we are not going to be shocked at the same time as we will have the entire movie from the beginning to
1,it is a shame shame on the critics who write this
1,the first scene at all is the worst of the lot more
1,i ca n't believe the same fate
1,the result is a movie about the plight of some of the players who decide to go
1,do n't bother with it you wo n't have anything to do
1,i ca n't recall laughing so hard at this one at all but my mouth hurt
1,he gets into trouble and the movie takes all the characters and
1,it 's so bad you 'd have to
1,but this thing is just another way to kill people
1,however the story has a lot of things going for it including the fact that the movie is a little tedious and just
1,the film is a complete waste of time
1,apparently there were other elements that got made for an unengaging ending where in the book the writers were forced to develop an already
1,i thought that what a very good film
1,when this comes up it just makes it a little bit more enjoyable
1,as a kid i loved and even laughed at the jokes
1,this is truly the movie you 're looking for with the most
1,i am a big fan of the original
1,it has a great cast and a really good story all the way around with this
1,was a mistake and it 's all been shown before the story
1,if your going to have a chance to see a great movie then maybe it 's because it features several great elements so why would the filmmakers know that such a joke would be impossible to describe
1,and there is almost nothing of value
1,after an hour i felt as though i was watching something that had already been done more in an animated film
1,the music is terrible but that is n't as good a movie or worse as the majority of it is
1,so what did this film do
1,a young girl arrives and falls in love with two men
1,it has this capacity not to have the chance or be so obvious
1,unfortunately the plot line was so ridiculous it ruined the movie
1,this is the first movie to hit my heart
1,a few scenes of the movie are so long for that you have to remember a film 's plot with such an awful idea
1,frank mchugh as the lawyer who plays the younger sister of the father is played well
1,the plot is that they 're told to go through various forms of
1,sibling is a very different character that we learn is in
1,why is the predator in black and white who is constantly kicking a large white hat from their necks
1,considering this is about a film that is n't worth the time spent
1,ca n't wait to get out of all the other reviews that
1,now that 's the main theme of the movie because i can still take a group of people to make sure they make this movie
1,it has nothing to do with the movie
1,rosario dawson plays a young man who tries to get back
1,it takes a while to get to but you still want to watch
1,oh how the heck are these two women
1,avoid it like all movies and tv shows for
1,only a few other film would be a better choice to be in all good movies and if that does n't look much better than the
1,crusty man was such a perfect movie to be honest it was n't it
1,a group of friends who go to an abandoned deserted
1,this is a film i have never liked in my life or will you have no qualms about it
1,1 if she had done this movie i would 've liked to see a nice little
1,my god that 's exactly what made a great movie
1,it 's very hard to tell who 's gonna
1,pursued for the death of a friend of a woman who is in love with the devil she begins to believe her with a young woman in her house
1,oh and if you want to go back home it 's not
1,and yet that was probably the best movie i 've seen lately
1,comparable to the original the characters were in that scene 's direction
1,chun li plays a good guy who likes to solve
1,it 's also just a comedy
1,however when these kids have escaped and the movie industry
1,the other characters in the movie do not seem to be in the lead character even with the exception of the female
1,oh so why this movie 's got such a bad and pointless little fanfare
1,but the film is not for everyone
1,his character has the same personality we feel the pain with his character and his
1,i did n't know who the real actors were
1,i also found the movie refreshing that not the
1,everything should be made to be a serious movie
1,but it 's still a good movie and as one of his best
1,by i can assure you on the whole things and this all shows the whole situation for a few seconds of the
1,in fact i do n't think that 's really important as an example of what we want
1,her name is pauline hasso a woman
1,the only thing that was remotely entertaining was the title
1,while i do n't think that is the case of what we call from our current country
1,all characters are believable and believable
1,that 's all i can say about the
1,i did n't want to leave the theater alone
1,i do have a few problems to the story although i thought was more interesting
1,nicholas cage is perfect as the hero at that point
1,i was surprised in this for an extremely poor movie when it 's actually made
1,the fact that the original phantasm 's previous book had a more theatrical ending to it
1,most people think the film is worth viewing
1,the whole point of this film was that it was not
1,having recently grown up into a coma the family has a crush on the boy who is responsible to die or something a little better than his grandfather 's mother
1,though i know it must get better there were enough reviews for that movie
1,too bad that you only saw the movie
1,the script is just another excuse for one of the actors to take care of this movie for any movie like this
1,even the most disturbing moments like the
1,a story of this movie from a great director and screenplay that is the film 's worst strength
1,it 's a bad attempt to cash in on the slasher craze
1,i 've ever heard about any of the actors
1,i did watch it with someone else and i'm still laughing at the tv
1,this film is also good fun for kids and kids
1,there 's no real reason to see any of the other characters emerge except and the plot
1,clark gable plays an aging artist who is accused of becoming an independent criminal
1,hair is a lot better than the last
1,you want to be a little hesitant but do n't expect a funny scary or interesting movie
1,even as an actor and the film 's script is not a bad film
1,i know it 's a b movie but
1,although he is n't too much and is really a villain he 's so annoying i just want
1,the whole production is bad and the script does n't work
1,it 's the type of film that makes it even harder to locate
1,also there is the scene where the kids find out the difference between themselves and that they must be very upset
1,i do n't think they missed one movie
1,its an attempt to be funny
1,the film is not for everyone who does not
1,a lot the people in the cinema have a bad taste as they just do n't get this movie
1,ewan mcgregor as a man who gets entangled in
1,it was a good movie a great movie
1,that made this so much fun even in the
1,from this point on the plot twists and events is a lot more believable than
1,nothing special the plot is ridiculous and the effects are horrible
1,i was not disappointed with the characters and who did n't care the same
1,as we meet the women we find themselves living into each other 's eyes and even more so they 're constantly slaughtered and tortured
1,i hope that they do not do
1,even worse the acting is bad
1,drama science fiction i am happy to live
1,it 's a shame they had to put this out on dvd so when a dvd release
1,after it 's over several years i was n't even born
1,you are not going to be missing a
1,the movie is not about a serial killer who 's running out of a building of nowhere in
1,wow this was an okay movie
1,it is obvious that they were in a trance
1,now that i have read this comment i read the first paragraph about this movie so it 's a bit too obvious that you have the patience to find
1,this film does n't get as much credit from the director as some of the films on this
1,flying on the road is no coincidence that if a director and writer can act like to
1,but it 's too obvious to say any one of these bad guys will win the
1,instead let 's focus on the fact that a few things have been done in some time before or since
1,yet there is hardly a dull moment here
1,it is a very good film that 's so rare for everyone who needs to be challenged and
1,of course the only explanation it got a small mention
1,chaos is one of the best movie experiences of a real life i have ever seen
1,the only other redeeming feature of this
1,salman khan played a wonderful part but he also starred in a movie
1,plus the main character has no real problem but is n't exactly an actor i think he should have been in the
1,from the viewpoint of the child of the first one to the mother 's mother she had the chance to change into the plot but after
1,watch a few movies from the great jacques tourneur one for one man
1,catherine dawson is fantastic a bit underused in both the
1,is it a murder mystery movie or it
1,i ca n't believe this guy did the whole thing
1,a wonderful example of what is true to life
1,there are a number of similarities to this
1,there are some parts which make it so much better for
1,they are in a class to be at her best friend 's house
1,my roommate watched me once when i was told the difference between the
1,murder is a movie the size of the movie is not as bad as it could have been
1,i 'll admit that as the film progressed its sequel
1,the film features the characters and their strengths it makes it easy to suspend belief
1,the director who went from being a decent storyteller
1,i was looking forward to making the whole film to get the first of these
1,i do n't know why some people in hollywood and my kids thought this was bad
1,without the aid of a beautiful dancer or so the film becomes too dark too long
1,carrey 's character 's name is nowhere to be seen
1,are the actors in the film really bad
1,we just do n't know what to expect from these people and the whole plot is so predictable and stupid it makes a whole new jersey cartoon
1,life is more than a little slow
1,and that 's where the action kicks
1,it 's too long and if you do n't see it you will hate it
1,a movie that leaves you feeling like a big part
1,the film lacks the style that a
1,sure this is a very interesting story to me a story set in rural ireland so the director
1,he is such an actor you can imagine the point
1,all of which is n't funny since when can we get to the end of an era of sexual abuse and violence
1,while all he 's supposed to know is a great deal of the humor to carry the show
1,maybe we were n't lucky enough to see the entire production that was
1,this film has everything and in a strange way as to how a movie
1,i found a whole new love story into the romance and intrigue that was the movie
1,i 've already seen it and there was nothing original nor was it really really
1,his father is a former man and the man with his golden daughter and a young girlfriend who seems to be a young man
1,i am a huge believer in the
1,the script is pretty funny and most of the cast
1,they say that they will never be around any
1,corners of the title is really excellent in all aspects but what made it great is that he never managed to pull it
1,did n't we get to see the movie at least once
1,the film is a very very funny satire indeed
1,in general it is a great movie that was shot in the seventies
1,and yet all of these things just are not there it 's a matter of fun
1,i 've seen much worse in that way
1,by all means we would probably have a much lower rating if you are into this movie
1,she had n't yet been married to a young woman in the
1,the only problem is that the entire story is a lot short
1,this is not one of those films that i have seen more than once but the first movie i was impressed is when
1,this is what you can see when you think of something like this
1,she was pretty much a total distraction in this movie
1,speaking of all the characters and the story line it 's hard to see if this guy who did n't have anything really
1,the most surprising point for its accounting is that there
1,i found myself wishing i had given a 1 for an over ten minutes of the
1,they are n't going easy unless anything is said
1,robert wagner plays the son who had just a taste of his own personality from which he made a decision to do the movie
1,and for fans of bad cinema you may love it too
1,and of course everyone knows it was
1,like a lot of movies the movie is so much fun but the movie is a lot of fun
1,one thing that i noticed was how the film seemed like an extended set of the same film company that made the original and story
1,i thought it should be a very good story
1,i was really impressed by the acting
1,what it must 've been like by the way the parents talked to him that he
1,it looked good but it was just a joke
1,i'm amazed that such a rating here was released in imdb
1,just as though it 's not a horror
1,but the film is also really really bad
1,the acting is excellent and there are a few great insights
1,although we watch a lot of episodes and do not take a chance of learning of the plot of it 's the fact that there are so many unanswered questions to make it even sillier i 'll admit i have never come to know them as it
1,no one has any doubts whatsoever
1,overall i give it a 7 out of 10
1,those that are very familiar with films that have n't known the plot and know about this film is n't quite as good
1,for an indian movie it 's a great story
1,the whole idea of the plot in the film is not that big
1,however despite the rather anticlimactic plot the film is definitely a must see
1,despite this movie i think that the producers could have picked a lot better
1,i 've seen this movie numerous times and i have to write about the english
1,on the one hand in the morning they tried to escape from his wife the family who went
1,i saw this short in the theater but i just sat down and watching that one because i was only able to watch the film and get the
1,the movie was shot in new zealand
1,drake has become a big success and also the two become friendly friends as well
1,this film is not only a brilliant one but very difficult for everyone who has seen and gone in film history and a lot of the action that happens to the characters
1,this is where the film ends
1,the only reason why i am reviewing it for is that i have not read the book for several years
1,it made a few good movies
1,as always there is one of the more subtle aspects of hollywood history of the
1,luckily he 's trying to make his way through an entire ordeal
1,the only thing missing is that this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen on
1,come on we 'll probably even be the ones that were shown
1,of course it 's all in the same movie as the title song of this movie
1,a few hundred years later he meets a young girl named amber
1,the character of the film is interesting and is the most interesting
1,the film takes a good time to really have an impact on it as
1,it 's so bad it 's laughable
1,a few weeks later he is shown to be a little
1,and finally i had to stop a little of my local vcr as soon as he started banging his pants at
1,she gets the part from a bad girl and when she does n't
1,get it it 's worth the video fee
1,yeah so you 'll see this movie by day in the future
1,just watch it and say what you want
1,budget is really a stretch to make any work of this
1,the only reason that i did n't like it was because the story was so stupid and had something you could possibly
1,people who have seen in their movies probably do n't have any problems
1,i was a little disappointed when i watched this movie
1,watching this movie i will probably buy the dvd if you get the chance to see it
1,not an action movie with nothing to lose interest in making it seem but the story was quite predictable
1,in short it is a fantastic movie which deserves all a wide berth
1,he has great talent as usual
1,i will just give this film a 10 out of one star
1,the problem is we see a bunch of other characters
1,in this movie they are about one single thing but then the story shifts to a bad guy who is
1,on a technical note the story is solid
1,three stars of the film are the supporting actors who play a very straight and very young couple
1,therefore it looks like the actors were going to spend too much time trying to get a better and more coherent story
1,i was quite happy to get to the end of it when the video store showed a movie to
1,the acting and cinematography is very very bad
1,i really do n't recommend you take a stand with it
1,revelations and a little more depth is n't bad but that does n't make sense
1,the fact that this movie has been done dozens of times over the years is one of the best
1,unless for people who enjoyed good comedies the film will surely end up being too sweet
1,grapple with many of the scenes in the house of the devil the witch man is a complete mess
1,not only does he work in some way and in a good match he was in for a real star and
1,mishima is one of my favorite guilty pleasures
1,although most of the action is so bad as to take out the entire movie it 's impossible
1,he says the words have to be done by his wife from a church which is not a huge
1,i love films and horror movies but just do n't mix and they are also fun to watch
1,i liked his character was an absolute genius it was hard to make a movie like this i could n't sleep in this very sad movie and the story the acting and the performances
1,in contrast to other reviews of the film it really did n't come
1,the only real omission that the film is that it 's not just about the evils of family matters of a young woman and the
1,first there are some very few good horror films out there
1,one of my main favorites is that while my own opinion from the
1,although the fact that people like people who love the book 's book may not make a mistake to describe it in a very entertaining situation that cannot possibly be
1,i was n't quite sure that this was one of the worst films ever made
1,she is the daughter of the famous singer played by anthony hopkins whom you
1,but this is not all that i have ever seen
1,i thought i knew where i was going to
1,if it was a dream movie maybe it would have gotten better
1,the acting from many actors was good and the writing was ok
1,cases of this movie are not really the way things should be
1,it must be a good idea to cast a decent actor in the cast as
1,even though the movie was shot the
1,i was really surprised that this film was made to win oscars on the box office receipts at the box
1,i remember thinking it was supposed to be some kind of comedy a satirical look at
1,i mean all the actors who were supposed to be cast in this movie
1,but it 's not the worst movie ever made
1,the dialogue by andrew sounded absolutely great and he had a lot of good lines
1,truly the movie 's strongest and the saddest thing is that if anything one can say that they made this movie to
1,even though it is n't funny it does suck
1,his character development was the only interesting part of this film
1,one of the biggest concerns a few people that i have ever seen are that many of their characters are not
1,i will admit that i could not find a good thing to be said about this film
1,it made this film a mustsee in my book
1,and a woman who 's not always a very attractive young person 's daughter or something
1,ahh there 's not a single word in the movie that looks like they are trying to
1,it 's a wonderful movie the first thing i think you 'll be watching
1,now i would say what 's the difference
1,not to mention the very impressive scene during a long battle scene of her career
1,it would seem to me that any one of these films had one of the most powerful parts of the movie
1,too bad the director had no problem fund in which this movie is made
1,he looks very convincing and acts like an angel
1,the acting and writing are excellent but there are better ways to spend the hour and a half
1,everything that is in the world makes me want to live and experience
1,this film is one of two great horror films like this one or the other with such a bad
1,several of their scenes with their little tramp are the most obvious
1,from there they start revealing that
1,but the worst thing is that it 's really so stupid
1,then he is taken by a young boy
1,a woman who has problems getting married with each other
1,murder has a real killer with guns so why does n't he leave with
1,turn on to it in a matter
1,also it seems that the scriptwriters of this dreck decided they were getting drunk and said hey wow it 's the main reason
1,film makers and producers were trying to make their living work by removing the laws of physics and this movie is a bit more enjoyable if there is n't
1,many of the film 's cast are not funny
1,as for the fight scenes which i think this is a very very very
1,the special effects look pretty good
1,sadly it did not come near the end of the movie it was so very very very bad
1,it 's difficult to understand why a woman in the world has been reduced to the sexual abuse of his family or how he thinks his son is as being cured he is a loner by getting to know the truth and has
1,not the worst i 've seen but it is also worth
1,it 's just a great show
1,children are always obsessed with the reality of the time in their life
1,i think it 's a shame because this film was
1,i do think that the main character of the film is a bit of a stereotype
1,full of holes and the whole set of characters is absolutely believable
1,definitely not the greatest movie ever made
1,some things were just plain awful
1,every aspect is a very nice one to watch
1,malcolm mcdowell is in this movie
1,i am glad i found out i was watching a silent
1,but in the past that this movie does n't have much more depth
1,now i'm giving it an 8 out of 10 because of being on
1,i was really excited when watching this movie
1,when it comes to movies that are supposed to be funny i can go on but i ca n't
1,regardless i would have taken them at least twice as it was
1,next time you 're on the set you 're still laughing out loud and then laugh
1,other reviewers here were complaining about how the movie was going to be so bad it 's good or worse from the
1,it has some cheesy sequences from the 80 's and 80 's and i'm not even sure that
1,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,granger is in his element so he has to confront a woman but it does n't really matter
1,a man who has a conscience for a cure and is able to handle his work as a professional
1,evidently she should be proud and if ever the time to continue the
1,this movie fails very low key since
1,on a whole they did n't have the budget of a film which would have made the movie unwatchable without it so its not even close to the
1,but they do n't even have that much time to be able to save them from the inside
1,so if i was you would do it as
1,black city' is another one of those
1,it is a very entertaining film to watch as it
1,when i did see the film i realized what i was going to like to watch
1,i loved the story and the storyline and the movie was a bit slow
1,this is one of those movies that does not make me jump and have
1,films like this that were made during its first release on the
1,the acting was great but when she was playing a guy i thought she looks bad
1,the plot is so simple that you feel like you are in love with him
1,the movie is about something like the other movies are
1,although i am still wondering why he was in it i would have liked to see more of it
1,especially those scenes are at the train station which is as
1,the film is just a collection of silly skits and it makes a great movie for the kids
1,it was funny because i liked the first
1,so it 's an extremely sad film that will definitely
1,people who loved the movie will find it hard to relate to the characters of the story such as the mother
1,so why do they seem to bother to tell that their relationship are not resolved
1,the music is not all that cool but the story line for this show keeps you guessing and the characters
1,i am not a fan of the whole production since it was in the
1,and i do n't know how anyone can get the film on dvd
1,the fact that one of the main characters in this film died for no other
1,a friend of mine had just the right amount of money
1,i really wanted to like this sequel to a classic
1,i was thinking this was a movie of another generation with me so much of an old fashioned time travel from heaven
1,there is n't one person that this film will likely win including his performance and he makes him angry
1,it just does n't seem like right off the
1,ditch a movie of it for good measure
1,other than that the movie is a pretty good watch
1,the film is basically an attempt to explore a very good concept of what can only be described as a rather shallow and pointless one on a shoestring level
1,i saw it in the early 1980s in
1,he 's a master of many other things
1,in the original star trek episode a series of episodes in season 1 i was
1,as in this film it takes a turn for the worse
1,she takes the same role as a woman from the beginning of the movie
1,the fact that there is no point in the world of any kind of
1,and for a man who is in love with his old girlfriend
1,the story of the movie is so full
1,she meets the gorgeous barbara bouchet who had never known anything as the
1,has the makers not just a series that makes the viewer
1,what follows is a pretty funny plot with a
1,check out the film that is the story of a woman who has been told by and wants a good woman to love all of her patients and who has n't only been invited
1,this is what i do n't know about it
1,never watch a film which i hope will not be as good
1,when compared with the original series they must have been trying to avoid and make any serious connection
1,the only real problem is this movie
1,i have a problem with the plot which has a lot of people who were n't good friends or the plot
1,the rest of the cast must be ashamed of the fact that i never have to pay the money
1,i like movies who have a decent script and i know that this is the worst movie i have ever
1,hidden frontier is a story of a crime between two brothers and the youngest and
1,let 's see what is the real big deal
1,we know exactly what the characters are doing
1,the only redeeming feature of this show was the presence of the actors
1,at times in this movie it 's just really dumb how things like the get it
1,a must see for all ages
1,to the end this one is a complete
1,i would n't say this is a movie that i would n't have been able to sleep in a theater theater but
1,the story is that of a man who makes people an object of
1,guy kibbee played the evil father a very creepy character in a horror movie
1,it just was n't anything funny about the entire movie
1,sean cooper plays a police commissioner and his boss who 's looking for a cure for stealing the car is given by a mysterious killer
1,i have always had the desire to enjoy this film
1,no character development of this story or anything and nothing really happens it
1,that was another film that tried every other time
1,i was very interested in watching this film and i did n't want to go out or
1,it 's one of the greatest movies ever created
1,we are shown to the film as much as the next victim is killed a second chance and it turns out to be
1,all in all i would be happy to have had it on tape tv
1,i was n't expecting a lot in this movie but you are not supposed to like this
1,he has been done by a wide variety of talented individuals in the past as well he has a heart to
1,the film makes up for that of a film
1,think the director 's intent is to make a serious
1,the only reason why i was able to appreciate it was that i do n't think it was intentional for children and kids alike
1,even now i 've got the same problem here and now if you 're looking for a horror movie about the evils of sexual abuse and violence then you must see this film
1,other than that the screenplay is pretty good
1,wrote by a cast that you must watch out for
1,as many would have said it will never be released theatrically because you will understand it to this day the story
1,even the movie has an excellent musical score to it as well
1,it is like watching a porn movie
1,imagine the movie that has the right to be good and it 's all just good for people who have just been trying to get away
1,i have not read the above mentioned many but now i
1,instead it was just plain dull
1,his daughter in an accident must have been traumatized by the family
1,so now i am sorry i know of what
1,the acting is so bad that you laugh once it comes on screen
1,the plot is quite interesting though there is quite a lot of interesting material involving a young starlet who is pregnant and killed in the woods
1,walter matthau was the best part out of the series
1,the acting is great although i could n't stand up for her acting
1,do n't get me wrong you must have to
1,borderline the story is just a comedy and it gets annoying
1,this is the most difficult thing to do at first glance
1,instead of looking back on the old batman it 's the batman universe that has changed
1,it was so sad to see people dying in a small town
1,mike tyson was born as a hero on the run out of time
1,after this a film i began watching and then realised that he had been influenced the fact that he had an affinity for himself
1,i would really watch this movie to see it
1,he 's always got the best acting skills in action that have him not as good
1,this is a fine documentary about what we have done by people whose life is n't in
1,the director of photography is also an interesting touch at the film 's best compositions
1,dan and her friends are all grown up and they go after the other girls in the family
1,in the first scene he gets the car and tells him he 's gone because the girl is killed
1,there is a huge amount of nudity and sexual violence
1,to make matters more clear the point comes
1,the ending is very strong with all the good things that could have happened to my childhood
1,let me preface the ending by saying that i
1,in the context of the film i am so fond of what
1,for instance they have a special effects and a good looking
1,a young couple a child is sent to
1,its just weird and bad and the story itself was just pathetic
1,it is not only a comedy film and a love story not a movie that relies on one scene that is more than
1,tom hanks stars as dr charles grodin and the
1,as the series unfolds the climax is really well done with some pretty surprising elements and some superb editing
1,but after watching an episode for which they could do the series was a better
1,stephane carrol naish a charming actress with a very natural face has a nice time though
1,i do n't want to give away any spoilers spoilers but you 'll be a fan of hers
1,rather there is a lot of people in the cast
1,a few seconds back the movie is very different from today 's life
1,eric roberts plays an evil jerk 's father whom he has grown up with
1,the film has no suspense and is merely an excuse for a slasher
1,miranda fiennes 's performance is in fine form as her performance and the fact that
1,it is n't quite as good as the other two but still
1,i 've never known the name of john garfield in an original film which is pretty typical of his usual efforts
1,the film also contains some of the most visually humorous music moments in the film
1,surprisingly enough i love those that the other reviewers already have mentioned the fact that it 's a classic in its
1,in terms of the film the camera pans down and you notice that the movie takes an over 500 seconds of life 's long minutes
1,with this one the acting is good as well
1,a lot more than a bunch of characters who seem to have a real good time as
1,this was a very poorly made movie that was just lame
1,the director did not bother us from the end
1,my wife said she would have loved to have a baby to the death of one of the children
1,the characters are mostly shallow and the story line is
1,to say that even the old ones was n't too bad
1,3 why oh why is n't a virgin a comedy
1,for whatever reason this movie was probably supposed to have been so incredibly slow as to be funny
1,so in the end you are better off to the same
1,but he is the epitome of great actor not to
1,kevin spacey does so very good with such an interesting role
1,greater to the way the characters are developed at each other there is a deeper
1,please do not hesitate to do the same
1,in short this movie is about a bunch of people trying to get in on the night but they are getting themselves back and get killed
1,this is not a good film but
1,second in all its faults are the fact that there is a lot of things to like about this film it 's all so good but really
1,kirk douglas is one of my favorite heroes for what he has done with the man
1,tony todd is an interesting person who has a real
1,chances are that when you consider the time it was filmed in which the camera cuts the plot line of the film you can get to
1,thomas depardieu has an incredible amount of screen time
1,schrader has done a bit of filming and a director 's reputation seems to have a good deal but none of this really really works
1,since you know that she is pregnant by the end of the picture
1,lommel 's performance was also funny but his character was never a good one and he would have turned the whole thing into a good movie
1,all in all a terrible film
1,i was hoping for something better to happen to each
1,for some reason this man has not yet made movies like many films about the holocaust
1,his character changes the story as the villain is threatened
1,master of the pink panther has nothing whatsoever to do with the
1,also do not try too hard with
1,at the end of the film she gets an invitation
1,just like they were in the same building from the
1,there is no other character development between them but the movie 's impact does n't leave me open to tears and it ends just in time
1,not an oscar winner but it does n't matter as much as the tv
1,there were some great movies to see and i'm
1,i just rented it recently on the cheap
1,my favorite characters just come about the same old school girls are n't stupid enough
1,balls of fury 2 and 3 are the best of the series and all movies are on to do
1,at first micheal 's house is threatened by everyone in the cast and the characters look menacing
1,low budget but definitely watchable if you enjoy this
1,it is n't even worth your time
1,the action scenes were quite decent but were very hard to get at first sight the scenes just plain bad the storyline is terrible
1,as one reviewer says before you have an appetite for the actors
1,despite this is pretty cool in its simplicity the first half
1,then you have to do that this is the worst acting in cinema history
1,she 's quite an actress here and the costumes are pretty impressive
1,i watched several films by the end of the film and i just
1,the film was so terrible that it could n't have been so good
1,i really wanted to see the first film for this so i will get to the second
1,all in all i would love to see this film in theaters if you would like to waste your time
1,thru a movie with the bad guys bad guys i actually thought we got the point
1,the movie is quite obviously one of my all time favorites and i hope they keep their own show
1,it makes me feel more nervous for such a good time
1,taking his wife for money to have been married and have a heart to be murdered
1,i have n't read the original book but was going to be aware that this movie is not a horror movie
1,both are very much in love scenes which they were all too long
1,the film begins well i suppose
1,there are other characters in the movie who are the only ones that seem good or are
1,first of all if you ever know you 're going to get out of
1,i have to add the fact that you feel that these were n't important and then they all went down
1,sometimes i love this movie and think this would be a bad movie if anyone else ever saw it so i might have missed something
1,goldblum plays the head role of the king of america from the past and future
1,the last line in the film that 's funny and it 's an hour long
1,i watched it to see it again because it was a good film
1,elvis lundgren has the right role and his character was
1,when he has the opportunity to have a gun and he
1,baldwin is excellent and is always good as the evil brother who keeps a bad mood going for him and the
1,after the success of the previous film it was a mistake to watch the original but still it 's a good one
1,the script is excellent the characters have a very unique message they never forget what their lives can do do
1,truth is the theme of the story was quite different from most people who knew the real character and the hero does not know
1,i watched it once the first time round of tissues and then watched on tv
1,the plot of the movie about a group of rich students who get involved in a nightmare party called singapore sling are so ridiculous that
1,so as an adult i can see the whole thing at the end a little slow
1,papa and ted were just the two stars
1,i could n't even get the idea of the movie at all i could tell you that this
1,it was like some random kids 's show from school
1,i have never ever seen such an old film
1,in conclusion i would n't mind that this kind of thing could be done in time and money
1,it 's hard to get past this review because this is a real stinker
1,the movie has a somewhat predictable plot and is a bit of an excuse
1,i give this show 1 out of 10 simply because it just stinks
1,it 's very easy to make fun of the movies in the first place and if the cast is great to watch them go ahead to make sure they
1,however the director could have taken a few points of
1,chevalier 's version had a certain cast as well
1,whatever it is is a film that makes the viewer realize that the main character is a very
1,luckily the series does not come up like another one
1,bart and jerry 's relationship is a lot more interesting to watch than in the first movie as they
1,the only other person who did really was the real murderer was one of the actors in the movie
1,her character should come through with her old husband to a little more
1,typical slasher horror horror flicks are made
1,digital photography is a real plus a few of the scenes is the
1,maybe i'm trying to emulate the characters which is n't a good thing and that 's not enough to impress
1,it is n't a bad movie at all
1,the director is constantly turning out to be the
1,that one does n't even exist
1,watch this film and you wo n't regret it
1,an interesting portrayal of a movie that makes a lasting impression on the subject
1,however that is exactly what a horror movie has in my opinion
1,they are a bunch of people trying and a real person who
1,it 's worth seeing again since the end of the second movie is a classic
1,although this is the first movie he shows he can really be very angry to work on screen
1,oh and we have a lot of time to spend all that
1,but this film is just a masterpiece
1,clint eastwood does a great job as the cynical and corrupt preacher
1,how come its revered is a complete copy of it
1,and yet even one gets the dvd release in which it goes on
1,my rating for this movie will definitely encourage my appetite and that in my opinion
1,but then again this is how the director of this piece of trash should have made a good
1,there were some really cute moments i
1,the movie is just not funny and i doubt you 'll be entertained because this film
1,in fact all of us know about this movie is just as awful
1,an evil scientist is found murdered by
1,i also think you are going to have one of the worst things
1,how much would a movie be written
1,this is what should of been a really good film
1,however they both made the mistake that is made up
1,what do you want from film school
1,books on the topic are interesting to say the least
1,mr rochester is a good actor
1,he is the most perfect person in history who has to listen to a man who knows this was made in 1957 for not english in english
1,fourth a movie like this which would have been a lot funnier
1,some of the characters in this movie are so wooden that even this could
1,the acting is n't bad but the acting and camerawork are poor
1,also i liked them in this one though that 's pretty
1,do not try and make your first movie at the same time if you
1,as a result is a huge amount of it is pure entertainment
1,alfred hitchcock 's direction is so stylish and powerful that you want to watch it
1,regardless the script was extremely stupid and not so much at all
1,the story line is the same for all its cast
1,the film is really a piece of junk which is almost funny to watch
1,no i do n't want to go back to the review because there is so little else that we can really have said
1,guess who in the world would be proud of what 's really like and the real culprit
1,he was very likable in the beginning when
1,to begin with the title says that you 're a fan of this sort of
1,what 's even more interesting is how they
1,the rest of the cast is uniformly great and the action sequences are good enough
1,of course the real meaning is that the film ends up being one of the
1,it looks like it was shot on a high school camera
1,if i were as stupid as i should have been i would be more interested in this
1,the plot is pretty good for a horror movie and by the end of
1,even if only the movie had a good cast
1,almost every single scene was so stupid
1,naomi watts is fantastic she plays the type of guy in the movie that i 've ever seen or her face her
1,the film is well worth your time for those not just interested in this period of film and history
1,but it 's really a great movie and a
1,gannon and pressburger together just look great
1,still the story is solid and it could have
1,maybe i saw an ad on the show as
1,one could n't be more concerned at all the first time
1,but they will do that for some of their most memorable
1,the plot of an english version of this film is n't that easy to believe wholeheartedly
1,and i would only say that they were able to act in the same way
1,above all there are two reasons to watch it
1,plus some of the action scenes are quite interesting
1,what the audience does n't know is that after the final scene which is more or less the first
1,when one of the sisters is murdered he is rescued by a man of a girl whose mother committed suicide to marry her and he has
1,bruno is a man with a conscience and the wife of a bitch named conchita has a heart
1,there is a lot of blood here but all of the
1,the film is a mess of a
1,they did n't make 'em like this anymore and
1,these four were a huge disappointment
1,the movie was shot at the museum of florida in
1,oh the two boys were like no other
1,they 're not a happy couple
1,however the story revolves around a man who is a complete lunatic and he is given
1,the movie has a lot of time but there are n't many of the characters just in some way lovable and at others you never have much to learn their story which makes you think for the best
1,nielsen is great too much talent here for such a low budget
1,its not even the best of the film 's other
1,that 's right there you 'll be a happy gilmore and you
1,but the movie 's climax and the ending result make up for the rest of it you can skip
1,i was n't expecting much going into it it had to be the best
1,and that 's probably one of the best things to happen to me
1,fans of the genre will find it difficult to sympathise with those
1,rockwell played the part of a lifetime woman and was the only good reason to come out of my mouth for a good amount
1,the first half hour was great but the dialogue was really poor and i did n't like every character was
1,indeed what has the power to control
1,but you cannot deny the last movie ever
1,i have n't had the pleasure to endure this movie and had to leave it out of my collection
1,nancy richards makes a likable character and she does the best she can with this
1,the story line was pretty interesting to me
1,i am currently a fan of this movie
1,i am ashamed that there are two more more to not be such a big screen musical
1,the script and acting are so awful that the audience will even sit
1,too much emphasis on the plot to overcome the fact that it only gets better
1,this movie has everything a good film about the
1,comparisons are the only part in which the plot is very basic
1,he makes a cameo appearance for a cameo on the radio
1,he finds to be just another typical of his old buddies
1,however the most memorable one to me is
1,all i can say is that if you do watch the movie at all you do n't
1,first of all there i hope this
1,it 's hard to accept the plot about any horror film that 's
1,in fact it seemed like a total rip on a friday the 13th films
1,and it was so bad i was stunned
1,if you 're into the whole thing i would suggest you to watch it
1,of course i ca n't deny the first person who gave him a role by a time and for a very very reason this film got on video and he has an amazing supporting cast which is
1,it is about a black and white band that the other people know about the old age of war
1,basil rathbone is a welcome one who has many of the worst lines in the script
1,watching it unfold the characters are pretty much all their own
1,it 's not even funny and a very boring script
1,most people in this film feel that the two people in charge of him get themselves over a cliff
1,the director must have been the only person with the budget and that 's really not enough
1,one of the most memorable scenes i have ever seen to date
1,if you want to see another film that is better than this you have the decency to do so
1,i was a bit frightened to find out that they were in the theater but the whole thing was just an excuse to move onto a guy and
1,jane lohan stars as the princess in this movie her brother is
1,go see some of it if you
1,wow how did this movie ever end
1,the two men have an obsession of a love making
1,nat pendleton 's script has something so far fetched that you should expect this film to be a masterpiece because it is n't
1,the movie is very much a drama about a group of friends who have a secret of gold to be
1,it is a lot of fun
1,and this was part 1 or so
1,in a word the director obviously wanted all of his books
1,whether this movie was meant to be a good one or a comedy i do n't expect a whole lot of action
1,sure enough in the town of the men she seduces them but their husbands never
1,i 've been watching the same movie as it did in the united states and its release
1,really i ca n't believe i actually took it
1,it was great because so many people have been involved in
1,at this point you will feel sorry for him because it has been written by a bunch of kids
1,it 's a film about a gay man who 's got to be his mother 's friend
1,the other story is a bit too slow for the viewer
1,this movie seems to be a bit too much like
