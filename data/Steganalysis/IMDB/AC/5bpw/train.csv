0,a cool film that has a punch at the box office regardless of the stellar madonna as thomas storm although the lack of sparkle in the allies magazine provides more praise than to have 25 cent under the opinion that the creators should know from the other viewers who needed to add boredom to her film debut,a real shame that branagh can possibly put some effort into this film so he decided to give him a minor chance dealing with the conventions masquerading as another film where aaron spelling does discover himself somewhere in the film as the accidental visitor horse that he opens with the angry dapper builders square against them

0,the very end he slipped back after trying so hard and yet trying to predict for himself when driving around it to find out what he was able to do with all of its hitherto unlikable characters,the abundance of people deeply accepting issues of death and hatred and how it can be used against manned associations that keep hoping that knowledge are taken in in the younger non music scene is beyond me

0,it was so long ago that it sure felt to lead to,it should be required viewing to all your collection of this
0,in every words the film tries to tell the story of what happens when combining protagonists story less than in climax schemes and on repeated outcomes,in addition disgraceful donna and her family running towards as irritating and paraded out as a gemser sports outing with a promiscuous adolescent mouthed reverend wife lures

0,i do see robin hood cop one touch,i recommend everyone to see black hop
0,nevertheless despite excellent performances by jim scott and nia yen this movie just did n't work at all it was rather direct to video production that only made it available to modern standards,nevertheless the film does not let the end finished its plot line just the dinosaurs will reappear coen murphy has a warm command that drives it so i had deep disbelief throughout the film
0,from up to impressionable villa boy dr joe dawson for a small grand kicker with mayor hauser don hunter to top the team orange a nuclear peddler on the powell county and end,from reactions is it 's creator to decided to tell us about how badly submachine you can of showing a mistake for either drool or running that country shill 's work forever

0,however there is only one problem,however it definitely feels out of place
0,but is the real tiny crew that,but there is not saying enough
0,stewart is at his absolute best most traits in the 1970s often he depicted a weary flustered mob,stewart looked strangely handsome and married to brett she 's uncomfortable in giving a strong innocent performance

0,not particularly crappy as in some of the other comments i,not the ps3 at all but i would remain here
0,onj 's attempt by appearing to be such a chomp is,onj runs through the film with a younger decent atmosphere
0,the movie also goes into the mill of sheer perfection since david lynch has,the atmosphere is used as paul karlson 's the framing of the penguins

0,great movie i 've seen and awesome summer kids,great cast great plot script and a 3 track movie
0,cary grant is in a league of comedies most notably for looking forward to vis a handful of memorable films that for the most part did,cary grant plays robin hood a deliberate handsome devious john stewart who joins bombing heights and sings one of cesar sanders 's and kurt cobain

0,on the other hand this gives the film an edgy blend of color and atmosphere,on the other side of my comments the screenplay does even seem rushed with lame performances
0,the biting tone used throughout the decades was considered instrumental by not following a film seamlessly or by presenting painful,the innocence level is reminiscent of what is a study of what ally persons 's appetites could have been

0,the secret service one of the most controversial families in,the relative man 's emotions were apparently dead inside
0,the overt lack of budgets tells us nothing about our glimpses by serbs and the robotics that make the us networks in media sales shop were distributed in media imagination,the fx by playboy playmate jack seem prevalent in this show near the end of the wolf outdoor sonic impersonate topless women are a couple of in all shape ever in

0,it puts people accustomed to planner 's amoral ways of his own dinosaur but finds the money and many volatile and deadly treating which is essential,it was an excellent film its 1950 capture to the screen crew to deserve credit for its fine class and by the inclusion of special ops characters
0,the rest of the cast particularly cho really served the bill the voice of,the fights seem like they are filmed but either sometimes affectionate and halfbaked
0,ok so if he had that including him smile on and his fingerprints i wo n't be surprised by some claim,ok it 's too bad the end of the film is a times hinting at stuff that 's no point
0,there are a couple of pretty funny moments played these characters often with a bit of romance romance and horror,there is also one scene where the day of the 19th century yanks open doors on by the men from time
0,if you do n't permeate the movie by hard to figure out which hard thing can send you apart where the truth is you take out the movie you get a cohesive experience,if 94 you wish to cost money with the definitely minutes of the movie bullets i would advise you if you 're interested in snakes they should be defeated by his parents by taking

0,the lone stuff is also hampered if you want to talk about how greg goes through the cafe,the guy who owns the soundtrack creates the crew of children does n't even care about them
0,maybe some serious genre and slight cameos make this a director no legs to emerge from american soldiers in a regard but nevertheless,maybe it was deliberate to let these sailors realize that they were eavesdropping on the truth to celebrate the petition for them
0,nice story and plenty of true,nice and funny very enjoyable
0,the crazed critics vote on this picture for the longest 5 of the year,the death of actor offers random ticks and the cgi dye scenes easily lighting lit
0,the film has n't been set for thanksgiving dinner,the production design by walter blair should have been great
0,billed as a prequel to the western classic from the first three wo n't ever be,billed by the filmmakers here firstly for one scene rudolf is planning a marriage party
0,do yourself a favor watch counselor which is how horror movies look take them out,do we really get sucked into the tragedy that passes at a downward speed

0,the rest of its kids are great and make a serious difference,the movie was enjoyable enough and it was really nice to see morris
0,i ca n't imagine how sure this screenwriter actually seals his work and never directed it in his life,i would recommend it to everyone kids or men families or children with some scantily clad bodies who have no
0,because she is actually finding a real flop in her boyfriend 's life but manages to live up to her addiction and fulfilment and do not escape emotionally through where the teacher is on her,because we do n't likes it just because it seems allot of extreme significance in which it feels like we 're thrust into a film 's world where some pain is put in jeopardy

0,we were n't so expecting johnathan to make it like that,we never see the land seeing norma and hardly together on the
0,he plays far more refined and devious the compelling kindness than his character him and the dialog is acceptable but the storyline requires nothing to do,he is fascinated by jason 's trials and this textured guilt between soon we are in the same joker that happens in the first film
0,the two actors though not trip above caricature,the personalities themselves are faded and making the actors
0,but much of the blame lies from time,but the plot is the most interesting
0,this is a way to learn a good lesson of buying this movie since signing every corp mistake but with the plucky i,this is what we mean abstract events like raymond one pity british neighborhood a kid church and a student around the pyramid
0,it 's impossible to say but the lovely assassin was very,it is a beautiful experience that stars in the limbo
0,very bouncy and smart this imaginative and experimental melancholic ode to preteens such as,very good acting by a cast that falls completely flat at its core

0,that begs the question what message can you do,that 's a bad thing i suppose might be the
0,the plot was so utterly unbelievable that it was unbelievable,the music is good and the performances by the actors are
0,it 's only about halfway through the dance distribute,it 's been n't the fans used to compensate for
0,the soundtrack was so well chosen it makes for an excellent first class and unexpected medical drama and a undiscovered,the old jones is pretty cool and the cast of stalwart actors and actress carrre is truly a treat
0,it seemed dumb throughout and format of this movie was pathetic because of that character,it 's only experimental handheld origins do n't make you stronger to find it being there
0,it 's all so painful to watch,it is in fact and distancing private that
0,wow that 's about it,wow i'm not a latino scifi
0,murdered was what penny 's snake needed,murdered lovers of pay with randomly the snakes
0,the plot is nothing to write home about though another sad role,the poster looked pretty good and it has really good artwork
0,phillip 's got to go kill and everyone 's bali is immediately silenced by the bunch of yakuza regulations,phillip edwards appears to have been doing only a few good films he called his works but slightly better
0,this movie does n't stand out and leaves us squirm,this is a film for streep who worked perfectly by her
0,but man 's opinion it 's a scifi film the dear remains a fair thing and i'm am being,but later here it was elizabeth taylor who applies for dramatic acting and gorgeous rod steiger as angel
0,i ca n't see any criticism until a bravura jury contains this movie,i do n't know what the people who claim to demonstrate but of course
0,lumumba is a great film,lumumba is charming or provocative but
0,i will only list a few things that did n't require that would help,i must admit that the dictator or iii based solely on her movies pretty much
0,yet coyote sends his heart and tries what has to be the worst thing about,yet the worldweary thriller remains one of the few oldtime dramas i 've seen
0,despite great cinematic experience the aspect was quite weak and took my helsing to move my index finger further,despite the tantrums and a few scenes that seems to me the essence of this is intentional badly scripted and
0,then when all men put their differences on the old man 's brain the rex blows them up,then we are led to believe that peter brown is his brother and he spends a few years back
0,apparently he loves crawford and when she is his own and you will just read you could forget,apparently this film was the result of someone knowing that known this movie is simply pure garbage
0,since the shift is depressing or not why the hell did n't they just drag back together in one shot,since 911 is mainly about rookie attitude by films of our lead i courtmartial if unhappy to distribute expeditions
0,okada you 're supposed to look like you know what you 're dealing with,okada is still one of uttering the monster movies that arise to deliver
0,classic acting and directing all across this flick what 's up with the crappy 80s locations and cursing down the toilet with breakfast,classic level of irreplaceable logical stress turns into a thoroughly compelling and provocative portrait of love on any day of the night
0,the script is perhaps for a rarity and as you watch the action unfold in suspense it becomes painfully annoying but it really ca n't be that far as we are,the film starts off as a somewhat sloppy bore with robert englund overacting and a dry biting display of jack lemmon via his camera movements and james bond 's scope
0,all i can say is that nobody has any,all icing returns to riches equal time style
0,without sure the implication could have given him a little reference to previous films in cinema as he pursues the rest of the,without words because of the beautiful cars by the major players of the hundreds they referred to brando as our main character
0,there really was n't a lot of interesting information here a plot and turned out to be a true love to stunts from the first movie,there is a breast fire and several explosives exploding a crisp malls yet it looks as if they hear what looking for joe 's nite distaste anyway
0,michael niven is quite brilliant as what the lone ranger has to do if you can complete the brooklyn skyline,michael rooker 's early movies with bogart he did so many of his factory roles frequently made his performances both potentially
0,half of the movie is spent any real reason it does n't satisfy the need audience,half the movie is yes of a job just watching an episode closely unrealistic if you understand
0,the rest of the movie is a mishmash of boring jokes one leads up against others for a return to the film and the final sequence reveals that in the middle of the movie the ugliness of the conflict between the two men simply did n't make much sense of going behind a visible shootout as a psycho a student some black guys that kill a dozen weeks later,the idea of a divorce being turned into a performer of the annual wb era institutions and we have a character that receives hold of the same hardnosed pageant and questionable yet does provide one race against our society and starting in on a smaller try by waking up thousands of rwandan peasants this film ai n't 'another science or kurt russell but only a year before the great opening
0,from the start this film finally made me lose a dime in the 80 's but that 's all,from these faults cheesy disappointment is n't worthwhile and it is no surprise that it always does n't come right
0,having to choose the blind situation between alan and hank the girl is enough to,having read oscar wilde the reviews and romances of foreign cinema were beautifully constructed
0,lets start with the series resemblances to other animated episode and the slightly unexpected appearance of jon pertwee as diahann 's reallife officer,lets live without violence angry with wife even in the pants of a medical organization which would literally include a term hint of the
0,this fine movie bears unique excitement without resorting to much of coarse brutality and the one portrayed by several giant detectives is putting a remarkably devastating interviews between them,this film seemed to miss luna even mentioned samantha mitchell on early the sunday season cinemax rejected the fat children who were first timers with their eyesight and dishonesty they
0,in fact porky is his supposed muscle friend and a friend of remorse with the ignorant maria,in lisa 's room he feels like a leggy lady if you ask me tell spongebob

0,rather than profit she has to cope with data ends and costumed family situation,rather than a movie intentionally by it 's soundtrack the plot is n't nearly as
0,i did n't like the comprising some trying to get so a message that will and bore but we get to believe that in the end this is a great film and is n't serving very well either,i was totally enthralled this was one of diane keaton 's most recent film in the charlie chaplin collection and with queen rex i had not yet had an argument with the film due to lack of motivation for
0,because almost none of the singers are timeless and musicians spoke french accents,because i believe this he breaks in deep and becomes erect enough to release
0,amenbar is presented as a menacing nonentity who is also effectively human but never he enjoys her,amenbar would stop it most other captured critics must confront our fears our intelligence our sympathy for ourselves
0,but the acting is great films',but it 's to be on the
0,if any one person were impressed by this travesty and not just hated the first one it,if they could have been created by simon this film could have been a nifty franchise

0,i deeply enjoyed that god help the adopted nurse and they are lovers coming,i remember seeing films like scooby doo and 'the trash of zodiac colon this corpse
0,now off to the con man of all trades if she is away from something,now you can play the more russian version of amelie playing chimps like that
0,i kept watching this film from the director and that only left me dumber to the picture that was happening idiots working,i love mind that all movies are sinister to despise since they abandon pierce brosnan or something missed in his films
0,her longing for a stuff though never works,her performance and camera work in fleischer as the
0,perhaps without other ww2 bias this human led a lot of the killer rules and tries to protect the folks that it was based on,perhaps not all but admire most people who make you want to see a movie that will do you love you killed and appreciated thx
0,i learned scorsese 's class in tomorrow and learned about a tribeca musical instruments because the scriptwriters knew more much for giving us had to,i could not believe how crap this flick was but it was one of the worst films i 've ever seen in my life

0,you tell me when you are screaming which those you hate,you know through a window of yahoo that you feel some empathy
0,the rest of the movie contains gory images from the rock witch up until find the vampire house,the film is shot to a young named newland who is now involved in some with disdain
0,for those who think that los angeles 's real cool side of the stone is made a little more noble i ca n't really say much so i cannot say that this is a big flop and they seem one of the worst acting i have ever 're watching,for all the endless age of the bargain bin the film presents carrie a creepy thriller performer who served minor purpose such as male life and physically aborted masculinity annoyed parties envelop a young starving woman on this planet wasp etc although this is much superior to the equally simple
0,this time around to the surface is like one dreary rogue in the other makes the villain more palatable,this also leads to a somewhat schmaltzy final showdown involving robin using one of the dullest suspects to convince us
0,seriously the movie is a path that is authentically wasted with such rubbish but that cynicism cannot in fact bring more emotional emotion to theater seat,seriously enough this is zoey 's early model that she soon develops us often treated and the cast quote is huge and little soliloquies to them
0,being a mustsee but the main subject of the film not the others are forty miles away,being in the crusades preserve the surrounding religious regime behind morbid america of the victimization of mr black
0,classy experiences remain boring moody incestuous sad unsettling yet an unexpectedly unoriginal intellectually stunning film with very good costumes and a plot that might have,classy contact with the irs 's charles durning has given a walk to frank to performing a prison present as a live homicide agent

1,i could n't care less because they were just being too stupid like,i 'd rather be staring through a watch than anything like that
1,i like this movie in a way,i was impressed with the portrayal the first
1,a group of other students find it 's hard to see a woman coming from,a few years later she finds a couple of good points on the run
1,and while the action is n't as believable as the first it is not quite a good one,and there 's a lot more of the film that it 's more funny than i expected and in
1,contrary to me the show is about the life of four friends both of whom are in their forties and are so fortunate to be reunited with their loved family,contrary to the above i 've seen his previous and almost half baked film that is both based on a book by the author of a different man in the same
1,no one would want to watch it and they do n't,no wonder i'm not going to mention how the acting here is
1,they all were killed so that made them lose in the audience,they did n't know what to say which was really bad and so
1,boy i did i was a bit confused with him in this movie but that 's beside him,boy meets girl girl boy guy loses girl loses girl girl girl meets girl girl girl girl loses girl
1,as if i was a good person with the right analog humor this was an extremely very good movie,as a longtime musician i have no doubt that the movie has been a little long and if that does
1,i'm not even trying to be objective but the script does n't do justice,i'm glad i 've finally got to see this film and not only did the
1,kal ho naa ho or you 'll have one of the best parts of the movie,kal penn is n't in it for a long time but the fact he was n't going
1,joel mccrea is a wonderful actor with a wide range of charisma and a charisma to spare but she has so many great lines here that you get the feeling he 's going to be very good,joel mccrea who was a great director had a few moments with mr bean but he 's still trying to get one of his films but none of his scenes are a great deal of time
1,our sympathy about the plot in this movie makes it a very interesting movie for a rainy evening,our protagonist is the last man in the moon and when he 's in the same room he is
1,lovers of these types of movies are going,lovers of bad movies will be disappointed
1,before i wrap it up i am just to say that i laughed for the first,before the end is it any surprise that they would want this movie to end
1,you might just say you have some great laughs,you get the impression that we would n't know how
1,it was n't really that bad that it did not end at all,it 's the same way of being shot the way the director of these
1,if you want to call a great film based on a true story of a bygone civilization,if you can even call it that of the original it was n't a good movie
1,the first segment with the famous music of the two assassins that made me cry by the movie though i was able to understand the fact that it,the movie is supposed to build some sort of action but the pacing is boring with lots of pointless twists which are no more ridiculous than usual
1,for a film of such lengths it 's one to see if i could go on and on about the movie,for years of the movie 's release of its initial release i viewed it tonight and was curious if you will please
1,while we know what they are talking about i have a question about the story,while i agree the same old story is a bit too much of the same thing
1,if they had to take this movie back to the basics and made it look more ridiculous and the actors had the same attitude they could have used another,if you like your movies like 'the adventures of sherlock street' you can appreciate this movie you 'll want to check it out because you will love it
1,the movie would be a total waste of time,the most disturbing aspect of this film is how the
1,ted 's character is always funny a little bit too much for the story of the younger sister of her father,ted tries to make a living but the way he goes after them to get a job makes the whole show to
1,with a film like a few exceptions from the beginning it would have been very funny to watch,with the title character as a big fat man it 's interesting to hear him tell this is n't
1,there were a few moments that i could n't find most amusing,there were a few nice surprises in this film but the final result
1,or the fact that she does n't have the chance to show she has her,or maybe my favorite scenes were the one with a friend on the bus
1,the film is so bad that it boggles our mind when i watch the film,the movie was a fun romp although with many other points i felt as though i
1,and the worst of this is that it shows people the real world,and a bit of a love story between two very different characters is not
1,from the acting of the cast the music comes a beautiful touch,from being a fan of david lynch it 's a shame that this
1,if you have ever played a real game it 's worth mentioning that the one with the other films are also quite funny,if you are in the mood for a real scary movie watch a few of the actors that you 'll really see
1,how to make a movie about a,how can you go to like
1,i was impressed more than enough and after watching it it did not help,i 'd say i 've ever seen them in a cinema and a few other
1,this could be done well in a nutshell,this movie was made on a very low budget
1,now in an old city where the,now who was that old enough
1,no wonder at all it 's all so bad and boring that any of,no one is really bad enough to remember to have a bad show
1,it 's not funny its just a fun to watch,it seems that someone could n't even act at this movie
1,dug up with the camera it was very disappointing,dug up in jail is another classic example of a
1,it 's a beautiful movie and one of the best of the 80 's,it really shows that people think they 're going to be different from any other
1,many people have complained about the plot of its release or a combination of a real story of the oppressed and,many of that i have n't seen it on tv or dvd release which is a fine thing to view
1,every single character in this film is so ridiculous,every time i see the movie i will just get
1,kinda in my opinion an incredibly bad movie was the bad,kinda it seemed to be the norm of their characters
1,overall i was disappointed of what the,overall it 's a good movie
1,a lot of the supporting actors are,a must have missed for insomniacs
1,because of this it is a true story,because of this you ca n't do this
1,the movie tells us what people are all about and what happens between them and the same,the best thing about this movie was that it showed the beginning that is how people would actually
1,then he meets a woman who has a crush on the family,then a bunch of friends are being stalked by a car
1,but the film never takes its title and its characters are the type of people that is actually used to,but i do n't like the movie it was the weakest of the bunch and the movie lacks energy
1,more likely i should mention his facial expressions were more believable than a comedy that i,more like a bad acid from the beginning but it is not a complete masterpiece
1,we are talking about a bunch of other characters from the first couple that they go through at a dinner where the family,we 're introduced to these characters and the director and his actors and then to help the movie as the series opens
1,i can see how many of those movies have seen or if they are n't necessarily bad,i had not noticed so much about the show since i had read the book and thought that
1,one thing about this movie that i'm betting is that,one of the worst films i 've ever seen
1,so if the film does not flow very well at all and the characters themselves you,so you can see things in the right frame of mind but nothing really happens
1,it is a shame that many times i have lost the opportunity to watch this movie i regret it and it,it was also a fun to see her perform her lines like they were all that is the first one
1,the music was pretty much good,the plot centers upon a pair of
1,i'm glad he managed to create a new monster,i'm sure the people at guantanamo bay did n't pay
1,great music and nice rock soundtrack,great acting great acting marvelous directing
1,we just watched movies like the godfather a little thing the girl with orange and a lot,we are supposed to find some kind of sense of reality but it becomes increasingly obvious
1,an old cast also starring the very,an entertaining movie that 's all
1,the acting is also pretty bad,the whole premise of an alien abduction
1,for a few laughs this film was really funny,for me the best movie to be the last two
1,he was n't that kind of character as a human,he wants to play a new character or just the love
1,it is unfortunate that a guy who does not,it is one of his best films ever
1,it reminds me of the first movie where i felt like i had been diagnosed on the big screen,it is in english and i love it but i cannot say it 's only a bad film
1,there he learns an accident and soon decides that they all be killed,there is not a few scenes where the plot involves a few things are
1,if you like the kind of films it deserves then you will give this movie a try,if the action sequences are n't anything less realistic and effective the second story is pretty predictable
1,3 he is one of my favorite actors in this,3 this is a great film and worth seeing
1,it 's a pity that a film with subtitles like this actually works,it took forever to get the word minimum but it was only soso at
1,for those who care about the whole thing you should have some time to spare yourself and my family,for example it would have been nice to see a more sophisticated picture of a serial killer but the main
1,i saw this movie today in the theatre and it was the best,i think it is the best movie on television in recent years
1,after that it seems that all the passengers have made this effort but they know it 's not what they used to do,after the first film i was able to identify with the characters and the characters but this was n't the only one
1,in the film version he gets some counseling and eventually turns into a vigilante and proceeds to kill her for it,in fact you know you are from the same period as in other disney shows and even so do n't watch the
1,i do n't think that this movie would be made for television but it,i do n't know why but not enough i can see his performance
1,give me a lesson when the main,give the filmmakers credit for that
1,if not for the bad news you are looking for,if you have n't seen this flick you can see why
1,the problem with this movie is that it,the characters of each actors is perfect
1,i ca n't stress why a movie is such a waste of time and money,i just saw this movie at the sundance film festival and i liked it
1,bottom line just do n't get me wrong this movie is absolutely horrid,bottom line i 'd give the film a chance a 110 on the imdb
1,the dialogue and the acting are so bad that you really ca n't even laugh once again,the characters in this movie were very different but the way the story was presented is all wrong
1,most of what was considered as funny and entertaining as the story is for sure one of the best in the world,most importantly for it 's performance was the performance by john doe who 's just been reduced to the role of a famous
1,we do n't think the movie 's title refers to that,we 've all been used to better describe this one but it
1,that 's all i can say about this movie,that would give the impression that i would n't like
1,i had no idea how a movie by director gregor lerner could 've pulled the rating of the story around and,i had to watch at least once a little over but my brother and i still got a grip on
1,hardy fairbanks has a much more serious presence and is the only reason to,hardy is a wonderful actor even when he gets to do the same
1,mark rydell stars in the movie,mark hamill does an excellent job as
1,i ca n't wait to see what people have come up with,i have always had a movie about the plight of the family and
1,some people just say wow that person is gay but it seems the opposite that is something else,some of the jokes such as it were for some reason the previews on the back cover that they
1,we can find that 's no doubt and if you like this,we learn of the way the two react in the present
1,but there are many things that make the movie a good show,but the plot is too basic and unrealistic of the film
1,do n't go on to this movie just to say that the entire premise of the movie is so bad,do n't misunderstand with the first two in my book the wrong comments but this movie made me angry
1,john huston a great actor on the cover was a fine actor,john woo made a great effort but it is hard to believe that
1,i had to rewind all my problems and,i would n't say more of you
1,this movie was a great idea,this was made at such an early
1,the story is n't entirely original but the movie also fails to,the characters were all real enough to understand and care about
1,lovely movie that should be watched by someone who has,lovely in color the picture was just very bad
1,if he 's going to work with some real actors then i ca n't imagine a problem with the film,if you want a good thrill ride for the horror genre that has nothing to do with the killer then maybe
1,i know it was in the theaters but this movie was really awful,i think the real talent behind these films was that he was supposed to
1,something about a kid who looks absolutely great to him in an attempt to be his old friend,something is n't really a big deal by the end of the movie the whole picture is the main
1,lots of fun and well made it,lots of blood and plenty of blood and
1,i saw this on local television and could n't find it on a shelf,i did n't care for the younger brother because of his sister 's death
1,other than that it 's a pretty bad,other than that the film was horrible
1,so why the other reviewers seem to be the gist of the show was that it seems to be a satire,so i watched this movie after watching iti heard the great and the first thing i knew was the great soundtrack
1,shows the man being the most important and human genius that i have ever seen and i do n't care less,shows a bunch of people dressed together like dirt and having a conversation about everything they can in the process i was
1,marshall is a quiet man and the movie is a dream for an average writer,marshall plays the role a little and does it well i can do the same
1,so in a sense of the term that has to,so there 's some great reason behind this movie
1,miss marple 's best efforts in the,miss marple is a brilliant actress
1,the only reason why this film is worth the time out of it is not to watch the actors,the movie is a bit slow but i feel that this story was wasted in all their own life
1,while the rest of the cast is excellent,while they were in bed by a few old
1,this film is about the human spirit of,this is where the show gets going
1,there is a bit of the movie that might have been edited to be seen in a few days,there is only one problem it 's that it is n't so much from a plot or character as in
1,the dialogue is quite trite and the whole affair is n't as bad,the two guys in the film are the exact same guys here
1,you ca n't help but wonder why,you want to love this movie
1,it 's a fine performance by a young man,it has a great story and a perfect cast
1,pitka does n't seem to care if a child has to run away from his own,pitka 's father is very naive and not convincing in any way shape or form
1,congratulations this was a terrible movie,congratulations to the writers for producing it
1,i thought that the director was making more sense with his own style than most others,i know that the movie was just terrible it was n't until the end when i was
1,oh yeah i ca n't understand the plot line of this movie,oh and there 's also the obligatory sex scene a rape scene featuring
1,would n't it be this way,would n't believe him for anything
1,this was definitely a great movie,this movie reminded me of one liners
1,when i saw it as a first time in the theater it is not the same,when i realized that at age 3 for the first 45 minutes was the movie itself for
1,basically a lot of things were put together but did n't get better as you,basically it takes forever to take a lot because the story is just crap
1,my son and i both laughed as though they were laughing as i cried at the jokes in the movie,my wife a friend to watch it because i have never walked out of age or gone to bed
1,the ending of the movie was good but at times it seemed forced,the most stupid part of this movie are from the fact that the characters
1,why does he pick up a girl out of the blue or does they use her,why is it that when i watch this movie on reruns of my childhood to try and
1,the plot starts off slowly with a twist ending that,the dialogue is good but not at all consistent
1,aside from that this film is a classic,aside from their efforts to use a certain plot
1,but she is too dumb to be taken,but the movie is a nice surprise
1,i like it but i am really upset and will see,i do n't know how my life is like this
1,however not only the two characters seemed like it might appeal,however the movie is very good and really good overall
1,in fact it is also interesting to see how the film industry would have a similar film,in fact in this instance you just have to get to the end of the movie
1,give the man the time of day it 's a wonderful movie,give the actors a run of all of them just to see how
1,i'm also surprised to see that the film had been a bit out of touch,i'm sorry not saying what i want my parents to be and that 's how i
1,instead they discover that this is the only good thing they can come from this movie,instead of being the main character his wife is a very talented person who becomes the master
1,there was a reason for taking the story of an evil witch snowman who turns out,there are a few good lines here and there and the movie is pretty good
1,all at first the story is simple even though the main story deals with the possibility of a couple of problems,all through the movie you are supposed to root for the characters to feel for each other but the film develops very
1,all of these things were n't just ignored so they were n't,all in all this is a classic of its own and i will
1,last time i watched the first episode of the new series this was the first animated movie i remember,last the movie is a mess of sorts of the first ever before and with no redeeming factor
1,a group of students find their parents in a very wealthy household with their hands closed,a good action film that 's about two guys who get arrested from a murder mystery involving
1,i thought this was a great movie,i have watched this movie countless times and
1,i thought that the movie is about two families at work,i could have gotten a little bit of money on this film
1,after reading the comments and see the new episodes that aired the story of cinderella and the stepmother the king of israel was n't as,after having seen the first three films i can say that i am very glad i do but this one was definitely the cutest
1,dylan mcdermott has always been a joy to watch though without his characteristic appearances in american,dylan 's character seems somewhat to be the villain of an already troubled serial killer
1,i have no idea to comment on these scenes the filmmakers seemed to be reading the lines and it,i was surprised by how bad the acting in this one was but i have nothing to lose
1,that is the only explanation in the movie to give me more of the sense of the character having just begun to,that 's really the only aspect of it that is quite memorable and i think it 's very funny at times
1,paid for a little bit of time too far,paid from a small budget was not even cheaper than
1,do n't misunderstand to the director director for the great talent of that poor production of these kind of movies,do we get to think that the man has the power of his own death to die if any of the
1,and i have no respect for this movie the director or the people who said that the actors were so stiff,and it is quite a shame that such a wonderful series ever has such a shocking affect on our protagonist
1,i'm surprised by the vast majority of the comments that this movie was based on,i'm surprised that i saw a copy of this movie when i was in prison and
1,for starters he was supposed to be the most decorated of all the main character 's,for some reason i was at a theater theatre in which she looked good and this movie
1,too bad a film does n't have to be done and it goes beyond,too bad it did n't have a much lower budget then it was
1,i was surprised at how this film turned out to be a big waste of time on my fellow idaho,i am so upset that i could not see this film because it was one of the most entertaining moments in
1,screened with an 8 budget of 25 million of 10 bucks the film follows a group of characters into,screened in the last 15 minutes by a few and good performances by christopher plummer and joan crawford
1,i do n't understand it was too much,i ca n't believe my eyes even if the
1,perhaps we 've watched that before this film we have n't seen another actor who looks so much like he 's on it,perhaps this is the first film ever made i have the patience it has to do with me i have never had another film
1,the other thing that makes this show work is its obvious disregard for the characters,the best part of the film for me is to see a great score by robert
1,in fact i thought most of the movie was a little too far fetched,in terms of quality i could do a lot better of this film if that
1,i really ca n't tell why this movie was such a horrible film,i had to watch a movie where there were three scenes that could n't
1,wow she is very well known by a small majority of her peers including an adulterous witch who is constantly a victim of a woman consumed by,wow if you love movies that want to be loved and make fun of and then get what they are trying to see you could enjoy
1,the most famous character of the movie is the young man who plays arthur and does not want to be there to help her,the plot is quite simple given the ending but by this end things do n't turn out as a matter or even a very good
1,it 's all about how the story is,it 's an amazing movie for me
1,feel like it should be seen as one of the,feel this was a good movie with the actors
1,my father rented this expecting the title of his review for it it was like a play the story was n't so bad they should have done better,my suggestion is to see this film and do not bother to watch it unless you were on either a stage show or a waste of talent
1,it 's so boring and you ca n't help but love,it is a very simple story of a young boy named angus
1,a movie that does nothing for laughs at the box office,a friend and his friend who meet in a train raid by
1,it 's easy to relate emotionally for these elements,it 's pretty funny for a lowbudget movie and pretty
1,the movie is a mess in the first third it shows its not only the same thing but it 's,the movie tells and feel better and more as a matter of pace than usual from the previous entries
1,so it 's got enough entertainment to make you laugh out loud,so what 's so good about the film the most interesting and accurate
1,the movie is about an assassination mystery in the us,the only reason i watch this film is because it is
1,thomas and his girlfriend lisa may not be the most memorable child member i ever saw,thomas and lisa are not as good though but the real star of the movie is the
1,kikuchi is really an excellent singer,kikuchi 's direction here is very well
1,my friends were trying to sit on the same bed during the movie,my main problem with the movie is that its lack of budget are not
1,ah i forgot how to describe this,ah yeah but the worst i 've ever
1,though the plot is a bit weak it should be a sequel to the novel from the same era of a similar path,though the actors are n't the best it has ever worked and the screenplay is awful the acting is awful the special effects are
1,also starring in the movie are charles bronson and john carradine,also of course they seem to like them when they do n't
1,while we see the events of september 11th 1994 with them both it 's the latter the first one,while on another level it is clear that this is one of the finest movies of all time
1,mayo made the effort to use a film camera to get his hands on a little bit,mayo 's direction of the movie is very impressive as is the story and the locations
1,i 'd say more than just that,i had to watch it to be very
1,though the idea is a bit preachy it has a lot of things to say about death the plot is pretty decent and very well done,though the movie was supposed as i do get to see what it meant about the movie and not a story it 's actually entertaining
1,however as a film it fails to impress in its way,however the film is the only one that can make it even
1,were i glad i did n't write a review here,were they trying too hard to give us the typical suspects
1,this is probably the worst movie i have seen,this film is a complete piece of crap
1,vincent dunst plays a bad cop who is a guy and he,vincent dunst is a decent actor and a perfect little actor
1,the only way i was able to find this movie had been to take it to,the script had some good special effects and one with several good actors in it
1,then the story evolves into a lame,then the two become the same
1,it 's like that one person said to me,it 's just so bad it almost unbearable
1,if you 're looking for laughs and then you should n't bother me please check this out,if it had been released in 1970 it looks cheap and has a few good laughs but it
1,well this has nothing to do with the movie in the slightest bit,well if you are not into the history of the world in which a
1,ok so it 's a complete waste of time and money,ok maybe it will be a bit easier to comprehend but the
1,this is what makes them interesting,this is the first film i 've
1,if the first half of the film was n't all that bad i would n't have made it anyway,if you 're into a zombie subgenre or not of science fiction you want to see this movie
1,this film was a really fun thriller,this movie made me laugh a bit and
1,through the entire movie she becomes conflicted that she would do nothing about it,through the years of watching a film that 's not as good i 'd give
1,it all takes place in new york in the first place of the story,it is a great film that in spite of its shortcomings it is very well
1,now that i have seen my comments,now i did not like the film
1,fortunately none of the actors are convincing,fortunately the story is just too stupid and
1,my advice to the writers do n't let anything that makes,my son and i could relate to seeing a movie
1,what i did see is the first of the old godzilla films that is being made in the,what was there is that there 's a scene about the movie and the film 's denouement
1,the script is so horrible that it makes a complete embarrassment by the viewer at all,the music is not bad as it is a song and a rock song contest
1,they make another one of their shows of the year,they have to be used and there are movies like that
1,zellweger is excellent as the main character,zellweger 's character is very likable and even
1,clint eastwood is so good in the role,clint eastwood and john lithgow are fine actors in
1,the last twenty minutes of the film are like the,the script has lots of funny twists and turns
1,for an example of the film 's brilliance there 's an attempt by the filmmakers but here it 's a tribute to the other films of the 80 's which have,for me the worst kind of movie is that it was actually made at some point where i realized in the beginning and the camera pans on to the director
1,a classic horror movie that features a very attractive atmosphere,a big screen has to go on and on for a
1,maid betty walker is perfect at playing lovable character in a movie from the,maid snowblood is not an action hero and a bit of a disappointment
1,i know it was the worst show i 've ever seen,i love the new york 's of the titanic that was filmed
1,i liked the movie very much but overall it was very disappointing to watch,i saw this film on the big screen it came under the impression that it
1,it 's a bad film because it 's not for the whole reason,it 's about a young girl who is caught the grandmother who is her
1,do n't bother watching this movie if you have n't read every book,do not expect more from this one or more than just a little research
1,the film has very little going for it,the story has been done much too many times
1,the story was pretty stupid and just felt rather contrived like many twists and turns but it,the movie is very slow from start to finish and never lets up until the end
1,his character in this film is very funny and plays his role perfectly,his son is in the movie and it is his obsession with the movie
1,the story moves aimlessly into oblivion and i have lost count of its imagination at every turn of events since that point seems pointless,the film opens with an ad campaign being cut off on a collision between two people which means they are a good party
1,i did n't really care about any of the,i love the way we like this film
1,probably the worst movie i ever saw,probably it may help me to get into
1,absolutely no one in the cast seems able to convey the intensity that they should all,absolutely no explanation on the way there were any good ideas for this sorry film
1,they were both annoying and unlikable,they do all of it well that
1,it was a lot like the rest of the book and that was probably the intention to make a,it 's so bad it 's fun in every department or the funniest moments of the whole movie
1,val kilmer plays a very believable character yet i hope his character gets an oscar nomination,val kilmer has one of the finest roles and that 's exactly why his acting is so
1,c aubrey smith plays a woman unhappily living as a woman as a woman,c aubrey smith stars as the man who was trying to locate the evil
1,she is given a chance to change everything and she gets some good laughs from her,she is the perfect villain for the role of a man in the new yorker
1,barbara turner who played the role of the daughter seemed to be on autopilot,barbara stanwyck plays the wife of one of mrs young 's greatest assets
1,for those who have not read the book it will be very difficult to tell whether you see the film or not,for a few odd scenes he 's not a hero but with the fact that you are not going to go into this
1,set in the late 1800s the story begins to develop into a complex story for our hero a young man 's struggle to be reunited with the,set in the future a huge variety of movies get made for two chapters and this film proves that you ca n't find an obscure movie
1,once it tries to prove the truth it 's still the darkest film ever,once there hinted at their lack of realism this film was absolutely incredible
1,she is also a witch a princess and a young,she 's not the worst actress she had before
1,the main character is a typical loser,the story is somewhat basic though there is
1,joan blondell 's character and her mother in a more substantial film are the way,joan blondell is great too and one wonders where the film is going next
1,this is one of those movies that actually stands out,this has to be the worst movie ever made
1,do n't let or to expect much of anything,do n't you think there is something to be sure
1,those looking for an early movie of the same genre do not watch this,those who say a little too much would have left up at the film 's
1,its a good way to waste time with the kids who are in this movie but it 's fun to watch,its not the worst movie i have ever seen but you just ca n't get enough to keep myself wasting a minute
1,good luck of course is that this movie is in a class,good grief is a love story between comedy and action movie
1,hell it 's a good idea for a movie,hell i know this was a low budget movie but
1,we are treated to a single single solitary and a complete lack of emotion,we never come to see these characters that i assume are so bad they just
1,erroll is sent to a wheelchair to,erroll did n't do it again
1,perhaps it 's too bad that the filmmakers,perhaps they have a more successful director
1,the movie also gets a bit of a twist because it 's quite scary at,the movie tells the true story of a young man who is a child
1,she tries to get the best to eat out her enemies but is still on the other side,she was the perfect choice the young girl of all the world is the epitome of life
1,they could n't be more intelligent the audience were forced to identify,they 're not the only ones this one are so funny
1,however the movie is n't bad the jokes are n't funny either,however all and all this movie is a very good movie
1,goals are always the ones who seem to like to think we are a,goals are always in one of the most successful movies of all time
1,bbc news reels are not that graphic there,bbc version is really hard to find
1,miss marple should be more interesting,miss kristel a young woman who is
1,the acting does n't make much sense and does n't seem like the writers should have taken it was made the show and the characters,the best part of this movie though is the fact that it took the life of someone who did n't see the other things
1,goodness the whole scene with tom and the two heroes,goodness is more than what i would call you to the
1,in his role a young young woman with an uptight boyfriend who seems to have the most unflattering personality but only,in the end his character does have a chance to get drunk by her and he has a nervous breakdown
1,i hope they will get their heads on the same show,i was expecting a big star from my local family and their
1,in the end we 're told the entire process of a good life story in the universe,in a way they should have given more to what had been done to the max
1,he does n't get a clue from,he was so young and attractive
1,this is the film to see with the kids and the girls themselves they could love and make a real person,this is the second movie that i have seen so many of my favorites have the right to walk into laughter
1,the plot line was not good but it was interesting,the first scene of the picture is not funny
1,he is not the only child from,he 's not one of them
1,second it is a film for those who like the idea of,second a man is arrested from their family and being shot
1,thats a bit odd to see,thats one really thing the film needs
1,the characters are all good and the acting all the supporting actors look great,the rest of the movie consists of the bad guys getting shorty and the women
1,by the end i like to get it on my face,by the end of the film you really would n't care about
1,you could actually see his talent here and that 's what,you can watch a lot of movies like this one
1,the movie does not feel disjointed or contrived,the plot is a mystery in terms of how
1,mr bean has done his role,mr blandings was always the great force
1,the story has some of the weakest characters that i 've ever seen,the dialogue is n't funny or original it 's just plain stupid
1,this has to be seen as a dark comedy,this film is a mustsee for those who are not
1,the movie also features the same old footage of people that used one of his students in the first,the problem is that the film is set in the middle so they do n't get it right
1,ronnie taylor played wonderfully by james mason,ronnie 's character is a bit stiff he
1,everyone looks great but he 's a guy,everyone on the show 's acting really is funny
1,it 's just a bad movie,it 's hard to tell which a
1,it 's one of my favorite movies i,it is quite an achievement to start
1,the film has a great score by john grisham who will put it through some creative context,the acting is fine and there 's something special with this and i could watch it again to
1,nick nolte plays his character like he and tom cruise is,nick stahl is a comic genius as the movie hero
1,if you need a good scare or anything you should watch this movie,if you 've read the original i would have recommend that someone has read
1,there are several twists and turns,there are very few memorable things about
1,however this movie just is n't going to be taken seriously,however despite a little bit slow moving and slow moving it still
1,when i read the summary for this movie and decided to rent it the first,when i rented this dvd version i came across a copy of this film
1,it 's a really sad moment to go with a woman in your house room the same night,it 's not all really that bad but that 's what you 're watching in this movie
1,these are so many questions you ca n't make of this movie,these two actors give the film their best and is very likable and
1,the characters are not believable but the cast that work as something different in this movie is the,the story begins with the first of the two girls and their love for the older couple
1,i love this film its really bad and i really wanted to know more about the movie,i 've seen a lot of movies in my life and this has to be one of the
1,all the actors seemed to be in production in,all the things we have the recipe for
1,take another look at the film in a small number of different languages and i can tell you that,take this show to a local new level it just wo n't be over to get so good
1,it 's one of those movies that you see when you 're talking on,it is like that it made you cry so hard while watching it
1,give me the creeps on my hand,give this one a pass to my friend
1,however the action sequences were not the greatest,however the rest would n't be there
1,a nice film with a bit of blood and gore and some good acting,a man and two people are trapped together together and they are killed
1,it 's just a small bit of propaganda,it is a long way from that
1,the plot is so predictable it borders too much on the same themes we used only seen in the first,the movie is like watching an american version of the french film of which the russians are speaking german
1,unbelievable stuff but if the film does n't,unbelievable but this one is very funny
1,it has a very dark and depressing,it 's too long for that
1,the only reason this movie works so well as not because the script is so weak and badly edited and contrived but it actually takes away from,the only way it is a real human being is because the director has such fantastic talent that this was a movie that i found intriguing
1,the best parts of this movie are the acting and the direction,the whole film has no explanation to speak and there is no sense
1,when people are saying the fword that is used that makes it work,when it starts raining it takes over all sorts of people from the different
1,the rest of the cast is excellent here and it shows very few of us could,the movie was a little off of my list and i feel the need to put myself
1,perhaps i just thought they would add a little bit of thought to know the truth to these two guys and maybe they should come out for,perhaps it is due to the fact that the film does n't work very well in the film and it will be hard to tell anyone
1,the music was terrible and looked like the film was shot with some cheap camera video camera used with a sound budget,the ending where a good cop and the hero are both killed and the woman comes close to being the real reason this
1,oh and did i mention that it did n't fit,oh but they did n't even have a proper sense of
1,and that can make you think of any film produced directed film,and the scenes between the boy and her brother are so unrealistic that
1,this movie is very dated in my opinion,this was one of those movies that actually had
1,he seems to be in the right place at all,he has a few problems with it just because of it
1,it is a great mix of drama and drama,it did work a part of life in the early
1,harry dean stanton gives an excellent performance he was believable,harry nilsson is a genius on screen for sure
1,the whole thing takes place in a castle where one is a bunch of guys,the only drawback is that it 's not going to make any one laugh
1,like most american films you 've got to love the plot line holes but for the wrong reasons,like i said i was expecting one to expect at the first 75 minutes of this movie and i
1,i 'll give my vote the best of about the same for the other side i have to mention,i do agree one person who does n't have any sympathy for all the people who have a sense of
1,the story is that of a lot of people who think that people who come along and take care,the characters are n't real yet their actions are very good enough and the characters are really good
1,also this is his funniest character 's work,also notable are the characters and the very very
1,that 's the only explanation for this movie i have n't seen it since the last time,that 's the point of view all over the place and that 's how i felt
1,i had to see this movie because i liked it,i could n't stand it in the whole film
1,the script is a bit corny,the characters were shallow but the story
1,i 've seen more bad acting and you have to wonder if the actors who are trying to speak is so bland this is just another reason to,i do n't think i 've tried harder on this film than that in a horror movie as it was so much more than a horror story
1,mainly it seems to be from his own imagination of those who do n't even,mainly its one of those pictures i like and i could not bear it
1,lament for those who were involved in this travesty of,lament the point to his character was an accident
1,rhames in the end makes the whole movie stand out from the rest of the,rhames 's character and her boyfriend are all good because they are so annoying
1,if you 're interested in the genre do n't worry to purchase the movie,if you must see a movie that tries to look good it 's nice to
1,i found it rather difficult to understand why a film about them trying to make us believe that they need something different and different from the characters and not,i had seen one of the most ambitious movies i liked the one in which one of the actresses with this one was the ones in the movie
1,writerdirector alan shepard is probably a great artist but even he,writerdirector tom berenger has worked hard to make another comedy
1,over the years she could have said something she does n't want to have sex with her but a woman who is willing to go,over the course of a time there was one scene where the killer goes down in a bar to retrieve a pair of hostages
1,there are a few good moments in this film,there 's a small problem with the production company and
1,there is a scene in the film where the director and his crew,there 's the usual plot summary which is a lot of fun
1,the plot involves a man who kills himself and kills her,the first ten episodes though have n't really been much different
1,anyway we will soon forget that a lot,anyway i did n't find it funny
1,i watched the first 15 minutes of the movie which i did n't know about because im sure i could n't have even read it,i have heard several about the people who liked it but i could n't help but notice that it was a movie in every way the
1,though its great fun and it never does that is worth it,though i think it 's a great movie it 's not a good
1,why does n't they have no legal problems,why did he always work so hard in the
1,it seems that the script and direction are so low that,it had so much promise as to be very enjoyable
1,also there was no real character development the script acting and,also the cast members to whom you could care less
1,a good looking movie just made it out to be complete garbage,a good idea though is a movie that is supposed to be an
1,the fact that we all know that,the whole plot was pretty poor
1,90 minutes of nothing and then you just see the beginning of the film until the final twenty minutes of it all and the movie,90 years ago i have never seen a movie that has the guts to be a good thing with a story that is good
1,try and find something similar when people like those who,try hard to stay awake for a long time
1,as a result the plot is also a bit of a bore it 's actually a good movie to watch but if you 're going to go on to grab you to,as the film progressed we learn to feel helpless and care about things and even when there 's an unusual amount of explanation to the character we care about his character
1,thus a lot of this stuff had to be called something terrible and i found it to be a fairly good little film,thus we have the idea what happened the first time round to a movie about the killer carriage that was a bit in a
1,faye dunaway is amazing the young woman is very strong and the story moves along you 've long,faye dunaway in one of her best roles has the ability to turn away from this movie
1,also the acting is awful and the script,also i really enjoyed the whole movie
1,ms walker is a good actress but she does n't,ms moore should have been nominated for this film
1,it 's a pity to see john goodman play a character or a character he is never seen,it 's obvious that this would 've had some legitimacy as if they were making a movie about a
1,snoopy was a bit nervous by the final scene as he had become embroiled in a car accident or something it was an exercise in it,snoopy is a bad actor he 's not even bad that the majority of the supporting cast are wasted with the exception of john carradine and george
1,other times as the movie goes on its characters seem to be drawn out and the film 's overall,other than that the movie was well directed and acted and could have been a lot too much
1,she is a very good actress who,she makes the film even cooler
1,similarly it makes more sense than many other films of the fifties and 50s,similarly the film is a bit of a stretch of a true to life but
1,okay i loved the first one because i do n't remember a few scenes i have to laugh,okay maybe one day a movie would get the oscar nomination for best screenplay and its cast
1,this is a shame he has done the best things that i have n't read in,this is one of the best films i have ever seen and a complete tribute
1,just as his wife is being sent off to the hospital at a school and being,just think about why the two heroes are the way they 're in the first
1,at the end of its story there was a strong plot twist that really happened in,at first it never feels like a drama or a horror film or a drama
1,even if your like me you 'll probably never get to see this movie and if you are in the mood for a big laugh you 'll probably,even though a bit of the violence would be an improvement in the beginning we might forgive any of the cast with regard to such a character
1,the characters of the story were more interesting,the problem with the original film is that when
1,and a film where you like to know more about these characters,and a man with a brain is a guy 's girlfriend
1,there is plenty of blood and gore some scenes that are n't,there seems to be little or no interest in the audience
1,pfeiffer was a strong actress and this film is one of the best i have seen,pfeiffer is a good actress and as a result in her small role she seems to be
1,while the film is a masterpiece of its own it is n't so much a horror as a piece of paper,while a lot of the film 's plot involves little children in africa to find the girl she ca n't speak to
1,despite its imperfections and overall its the best of the genre as its most underrated of the genre but the first one with three exceptions in all,despite the poor direction she did n't have the skills to do the first half in it and i found that the acting was very poor
1,in fact some viewers have commented on it because it really does n't seem like it 's a bad movie,in fact she 's not a single mother at all the same is not enough to watch this show
1,then i was sitting in a cinema and thinking this would be a,then one scene begins from him another one in his early words
1,then we come to the story and we follow a group of three friends,then it all takes place and it looks like a bad zombie flick
1,there 's a lot of movies about a young couple trying to,there are other problems with this film which it 's not
1,another one that is supposed to make me wonder that these two have had the same honor for these characters they are n't,another thing that is really annoying about is that this movie is not the sort of film that you ca n't watch
1,movie like this would be so much better suited to those of those in hollywood 's shoes,movie is worth mentioning that a movie is made with some people involved in the cast and it
1,a movie for the people who think of a story which was a really stupid one,a man who has to pay no attention for the life 's end of his life who
1,the first time you saw this movie i have to say i 'd never heard of it i have,the film tries to be suspenseful and it is so much so that the film is just unwatchable
1,the characters do n't make sense and neither are,the film could have used a better ending
1,the special effects are all there and i am looking forward to seeing them all in the future again,the story is about two young people who live in england in the late 70 's in the late 1960s
1,in fact the film is quite as good as the others,in conclusion this is one of the worst movies i have ever
1,bill nighy and his son are the real,bill nighy makes a movie worth mentioning
1,chaney 's character is a man and,chaney 's character is so obnoxious
1,why did i waste your money on this stupid piece,why was this film made by a wide margin
1,both men are supposed to be about the men in this movie a bit,both of them in the movie are just as believable if not less
1,cotter does his job to tell us how to deal with those who can,cotter is always a great example of what is he in the end
1,the best scene comes when a guy falls to,the ending was a bit of a downer
1,director john agar and screenwriter michael j lewis have brought us both a drama and a tragedy,director stuart nelson is also good at it but his talent is to make the movie feel as
1,the rest of the film involves the very annoying,the movie opens with a very long monologue
1,another point he makes no difference is his ability to be a hero and is a completely useless character,another thing is i wonder why i did n't watch the movie till i discovered the preview it was just
1,a few minutes later the audience is subjected to another clich show,a film that just did n't get me at the video of it
1,now this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,now if you are one of those guys who want to see anything
1,the movie itself is a bit more than just another movie in all its parts including the most interesting thing about,the movie is very good at points and is worth watching for those who enjoy watching it with its replay
1,but the best in the history of this movie is the fact that it is a,but this movie is n't a good movie it 's worse than the best movie
1,i guess this film was an absolute hit,i saw this movie with the hope that it
1,as a result however it 's a lot of fun to have to watch this movie for anyone with one to laugh at,as for how it comes in the late 80s he goes on and has fun as the embodiment between sex on the sexual side
1,i 'd recommend this movie to any horror fan,i thought it was ok since i saw the movie
1,the problem is that the writer is trying to make out with an,the plot is full of holes and continuity the script is dull
1,the only other good thing about the movie is the,the movie also has a couple of good laughs
1,why does any of the actors make this watchable,why did the killer 's mother get a huge and
1,her performance was excellent and i enjoyed the movie,her husband and brother were murdered by two sisters and
1,at the time they went on to,at first they were not funny
1,so if you want to know who you 're seeing in life then you should know better,so there is a scene with the main character that he is forced to walk away from the
1,when it was shot it was still pretty funny too,when a movie like this could have been made it might
1,anyway we all know that it 's just a story of two people,anyway i know that this is an extremely accurate movie but i'm afraid that
1,all of the characters in this movie were not the same,all this leads to a startling look at the nature of love
1,well i'm the only one who was,well do n't worry this movie
1,kathy bates did a wonderful job as the main character but,kathy bates is the reason the movie is so great
1,my family was n't as moved to the film as in the first,my sister was a bit traumatized because i liked a few minutes of her
1,another thing you 'll remember is a,another classic about an italian village
1,she gets out of danger but falls in,she goes to town and finds it
1,it is a complete waste of time and money,it makes a point to how good they are
1,i thought the acting was horrible,i was n't impressed with the movie
1,i was n't impressed but i have to say this film lacked everything,i guess this is one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen
1,the only difference between the movie is that you do n't really have the chance to sit through it,the two young women get together and each other and they go into various other lives or meet each other
1,consider my first impression is it that the makers of the movie had done and done so in the first place,consider it a comedy for kids to learn from its own and be very stupid and ignorant by adults who just want
1,includes the most notable of his career,includes that she 's not a woman
1,he was able to play the role well,he is n't a bad guy or two of
1,either way you 're the sort for the film,either way you 're so out there that you know
1,i would probably want to purchase it on dvd because it 's one of my favorite horror icons,i think he is a very capable person so he has to use a method of talent that is
1,as soon as it is over they run into it,as i stated it does not take itself seriously
1,all i can have is the soundtrack and cinematography are very good and the film is just stunning,all in all for a long ride to the old adage they 'll never really go into their roles
1,we also see the characters talk and say they are not the same,we never see the original it will be better and not it is
1,yes this is a bad film,yes the plot is very original and
1,and he 's an all too familiar character,and it 's not quite clear whether to be
1,last verdict i am not saying you should watch it,last week i watched a lot of movies made in 1982
1,well it turns out that it 's been a long time ago but now,well now i will get an idea of how it 's all done
1,i would rather have my ears diagnosed,i loved the scene when he was making
1,it has n't yet been taken to the next level in the movie as a whole new meaning of humor that does n't take it lightly to make,it 's a real shame because some of the actors were so bad i wondered why they put into the story so many people in the movie
1,one of the most interesting roles ever the actress who played her sister in the first movie has more screen time,one of my personal favorites for that i loved the other a very funny story line and some brilliant acting
1,in fact the whole show was shot on,in other words you 'll be disappointed
1,the characters are quite realistic though and the plot is completely different,the movie is as bad as i expected it to be
1,but it 's not the story of a man finding out,but the plot of what she has to go through
1,not to mention some scenes where we can really do a number,not to mention a lot of the songs to this movie
1,basically it makes no sense or even dared to use the words of the main plot line to describe what happens,basically it 's a film that 's full of suspense and the performances are fine especially the two leading ladies
1,pity to point a decent one,pity i would not want to watch
1,this film could have been a lot better but the director did n't,this film was just plain hilarious if you want a real laugh
1,now for the most part it 's almost impossible for people but on and on,now there is another aspect of this that makes that much sense if you are a
1,do n't get me started about the ending,do n't be taken this out by the director
1,now we are in all kinds of movies such as,now who has a heart warming sense of guilt
1,the film starts on a very long path as is the main question behind the whole story of some,the story is too complicated for most parts with a lot of plot holes and gaps in that
1,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen,this show made me forget the most of them because
1,what a shame that it 's been shown in public as,what kind of a great idea that this movie is
1,it is the latter film that makes it worthwhile viewing a must hand in front of all those,it was a real treat but not really enough and was n't for the faint of heart
1,2 out of 5 rounded up for the dvd box,2 the girl is one of the most gorgeous i have
1,the film is a bit slow on the gore and for the few laughs there are plenty of gore scenes to satisfy them,the movie was so bad that it would actually be an insult to a movie that is not bad but only a select point
1,oddly enough the plot is so real and predictable that i have never been able to connect with it in,oddly enough the film does n't try to focus on action itself in any way and it fails miserably
1,each week after many decades has begun and the same fate is the movie the film goes beyond being a good story of the conflict between,each of a sudden has some minor issues in mind the ending of the film is just too long and the ending is a mess
1,the fact is i 've noticed some of his previous films and i have seen all his films in the future but he can certainly,the film 's narrative is the same and as in most of the key stories you can watch it without resorting to anything more
1,weber 's is a bit of a drama because both of you get a glimpse of the events that are in place through the screen,weber 's character was so onedimensional that it could n't be a good idea for someone to be offended by the lack of real logic
1,the first scene where of the movie 's theme song of the famous song was a lot better,the whole movie was an attempt to recreate the film noir genre that was released in 1978 when the
1,cohesiveness and the beast is a pretty good movie,cohesiveness is not the most important thing about it
1,this is an interesting movie to play out like a thriller,this is a good idea a good one in the genre
1,leon and his pals get involved in a threesome and murder for a murder boss,leon tries to keep his tongue out of the blue and get himself to be the
1,we never get to hear them say a word i do have a few words which,we get to see the real woman die she and the daughter are in love
1,either these men did n't care their hair when they first glimpsed that guy on the prowl was the worst acting ever to hang in a camera,either way it could have made the whole thing more difficult to follow if there was actually some really scary movie to be a great horror movie
1,i can identify to find that it will probably last se but i can honestly say this film 's a complete gem,i do agree with the other reviewers who gave this piece of crap a rating of 1 because we had nothing more than
1,however it 's hard to believe that the,however this is not one of them
1,and for the rest of the movie rommel was a poor liar who could have pulled the,and then he finds a bag in the paper where the sun turns into a fly
1,it was an excellent idea not to mention the great acting from all,it 's so bad they 're like watching a cartoon on halloween
1,the plot is rather standard and it takes a few minutes to develop it but the film is a great blend,the acting was horrible and only mediocre one ineptly acted and filmed acted and acted with absolutely no real reason
1,do n't worry to read the review,do n't be fooled there is this odd
1,the film never really reaches a chance but there are a few moments that are,the actors are all in it and that 's what it 's just about
1,amy graham plays a dumb teen and who goes through this time that she ca n't seem to decide whether to get her in the end,amy astor as a young french boy with cerebral palsy at her most haughty and abusive was the best the film makers of this film are to
1,yes it was a bad flick,yes all we hear about life on
1,the acting is atrocious but the script and the script never really gets,the film opens with a young woman named angela and her assistant
1,i have no problems getting into believing that people are going to have a better life that,i thought it was a great movie and one can watch it every day on tv
1,it is also a love story between a man and a woman,it is a shame that in the end the africans are given nothing
1,i watched this show and the story lines and dialogue at the movie 's conclusion is the worst i have ever seen,i thought it was interesting how the actors had been in a movie about this film and even that would be good for
1,it would be nice to see a movie in this topic,it has the exact same feel as it should be
1,as if it was done a bit in time to come by the same person in this movie,as the film continues it 's just a story about love and the city of love for the life
1,i'm pretty sure that there are some similarities to the great films of the 80 's like that but it did,i'm trying to tell you that you might be able to relate for something that is true for this film
1,harrison ford makes a tremendous team and the supporting cast is n't so good,harrison ford as the president of the united states is just plain wrong
1,what a waste of time and money,what the hell is the girl with the
1,do n't miss out on that,do you know what to say when
1,as one of the most overrated films i 've seen in the past decade,as the world 's resident st gadget has been the best of everything in the
1,of course we have to say that all the films they use as much as each other,of course he did the job in the first film and was the only person involved
1,you know what 's worse chamberlain is just plain bad,you have the ingredients for these two movies in general and
1,although it was obviously intended like i 'd say a great action movie it takes me,although it may not have got that it 's made a bit hard to comprehend
1,this was the most popular of the three films the main character is a former scientist who,this is a must see and for anyone wanting to learn about one person 's life
1,mary 's dad tells a tale of three girls who are both men who are n't afraid to stay close to the one man or one other,mary is the girl in the movie so he goes away from her mother so she has to come to an abandoned man 's home where her husband
1,and this is certainly an insult to every person who gets a good laugh out of it,and finally that being said in this case is the fact that the movie itself is the ultimate
1,robert davi 's role was a total,robert culp plays the lead character
1,oh god i could n't decide which,oh what he lacks of success
1,the last scene is almost the last one,the only thing that gets better than this movie
1,but what was it meant to be a funny and funny piece of work and as a result i could n't possibly go wrong,but that makes it seem that all the students have written that the film is not about the evils of the human being
1,now i do agree that this guy is the most racist,now the movie is n't terrible but this is it
1,joe and his family try to get a friend to sign in the old man who 's a friend of the man 's uncle and his,joe mantegna and the two women have a very different persona here but one that seems to fall in love instead of the old men
1,at a friend 's pace he gets his attention from the first scene the film develops the same tone for several,at the time the mother had to do it for a year she was still being able to do this
1,the acting is n't as bad as many the characters in it are just not,the film opens with a long monologue shot on a chalkboard of its own
1,this must be one of the best,this movie is a must see
1,along the way there are a lot of jokes including a few of her former tormentors but this is the film of a few,along with the original the story of the young man from london has been reduced to a mental breakdown the other one could be forgiven
1,but it would still be a better place for a film or if the cast can use that,but the rest of the cast is either that of a bad man or an actor but for the
1,just do n't waste your time,just do n't waste your time
1,the first thing that makes most of the show are the way the family is introduced to the,the story has great special effects and sets but by far the most convincing and most enjoyable
1,the film is about a young girl who works for herself and is taken to,the script is good also as is a good scene in the original series
1,the director was trying a very very hard edge and it seemed to be very difficult to see how,the film tells the story of how all people have to be the first film in the world
1,the film just gets an extra star and one who does not take it even if you do watch it,the movie just goes out of my way to get the plot in a ridiculous way and in the end it
1,however the movie does n't get much interesting nor is it very gory or just plain boring,however the film is not about a very complex or thrilling or engaging movie in any way to
1,i ca n't think of a better film in any,i think what was it a very nice movie
1,john wayne 's character was so bad,john krasinski is a real winner
1,it 's not really an action movie,it 's like someone 's got another idea
1,in terms of cinematography the action sequences are so stupid it 's actually,in the final analysis this is the film of the same title
1,apparently people are just going to be the best fan you see in,apparently this movie should not only be made but if there 's a chance
1,a little known for my own age but the way this film got was a testament to,a group of young actors seem to have had a rather difficult time to do so
1,first of all the film is filled with clich and a bit of romance,first of all this is an awful movie by all means watch it if you
1,everybody is great the actors who play this sort of game but their parts,everybody who has ever studied the original or simply ca n't compare that
1,i could go on about how this film affected to the benefit of the screen,i found there is a rather depressing plot twist when the woman is rescued by her
1,i also like to get past to the film that we 've got to love this movie,i love this show even if it is nothing better than it was a film that i like
1,we see the director as he does in order to survive his own thoughts,we all know there was n't a movie for a good budget a low budget
1,life in the south is the key,life was always going to happen
1,a lot of these movies have been made that much,a good choice to have been an aspiring director and some
1,this movie is just plain bad bad just good,this movie tells the story of an american boy who
1,there were several many films that were not even funny,there is no mention of the real reason why this film
1,i saw it in a preview on tv back in the seventies when it was broadcast,i am sorry that many people will love this film and i really want to say that
1,the other reviewer is already very irritated about this movie too,the end was an incredible surprise from the usual dutch horror films
1,it was fun and there was one big twist,it 's just a poor movie that never had to
1,then the camera pans up with shots of people walking in a room,then there is this film in the beginning with no good reason
1,what can be said about this was that,what 's more in the first movie
1,i was in high school years watching a movie based on a true story and the characters had a great story,i have n't even heard of the two stooges in this film but what i liked about this film was the ending
1,to conclude this is a great movie,to me it was a waste of time
1,chalk up the worst piece of the world in,chalk up the story is a bad one
1,that 's what i love about this film,that is why the film is in the same
1,anyway this movie is the most boring and stupid one i could have seen,anyway the story line sucks and i think that 's a mistake to bring back
1,i mean it 's like the music is a dream and that would be a lot more appropriate,i found a movie that i could n't forget about but this one is so much better
1,lucky that if this was the only reason why the movie ended up being filmed up to,lucky to say that it 's one of those movies where you have to see it
1,at two hours this has a strong feel to it and it lasts so long that,at some points the film turns to us as a comedy it just goes nowhere
1,which is an element of the film,which i thought very funny though
1,i really wish i had read this article,i mean this film did n't make sense in
1,in the end it becomes apparent that the people in the class were,in the final analysis it was an important part of the film
1,great movie about an alcoholic and his,great and the cast is fine
1,when the movie is done you know you 're going to find the killer with this idea,when the woman who kills her in a car accident asks her to shoot herself at a wedding
1,use of the word is the real reason,use are done the hardest they can
1,ok ok the movie has some plot holes and the acting was terrible,ok i'm also quite fond of this movie because there 's so much more
1,but not everyone is the target of a big joke,but he had no problems with being the same man he
1,if you are looking for one or all of a good plot or the characters look at the movie 's flaws,if i wanted to show them why it has been rated to an extreme and higher it 's just like me
1,william sadler is very good as the villain and that 's,william holden looks great though his performance is somewhat stiff
1,see it as a gift for the comedy,see it if you can find it
1,and finally to make a short film about a real subject in the first place,and the characters were so funny so it made me sick to my intelligence
1,i had read the book so i could n't have been a bit more,i 've seen more movies like this by now and then the other
1,with a sense of realism a scene with robert carlyle and a brief glimpse at,with this film is in my opinion one of the film 's biggest successes
1,on the upside you 'll be a little surprised to see it on its own,on the whole this film is a lot better than the other entries but no that
1,it 's interesting to note that the filmmakers make some weird,it 's a complete waste of time it is boring
1,a bad movie is n't even worse,a man who can not afford a wife
1,when all is said and done the movie is worth owning or buying in it,when one of them says to one of those in fact the audience is getting a
1,i do n't know why i give it a,i have seen this movie a million times
1,i do n't think they did anything wrong with this movie but the best thing came in that of a bad acting,i have n't been a big fan of the series since but when i saw a episode of the show i got hooked
1,the most important things about the movie are the special effects are a complete joke,the main theme of the film is the development of the story which is a bit
1,this is all rather predictable and that it does n't even seem interesting,this is a good movie for those who wish to see a better gangster
1,everybody seems to have no control in,everybody 's pretty stupid and boring
1,the story of the family is a series of flashbacks and turns,the actors are excellent and the story is a real lesson
1,first off i would rather like a film a few days ago,first of all the music sucks the whole film is just plain stupid
1,it 's easy to believe that the director,it looks very cheap and poorly written
1,the story the animation and the music is just beautiful,the fact that this film was released is such a shame
1,although we also do n't need her help her at face value of this series she has a tendency,although its fun to hear it that is the kind of film i 'd love to see more
1,in the first movie the camera work was used and lighting,in other words when you are a fan of the film this
1,since the director is so bad that it 's actually not even close to the truth and even worse the scene,since the film was directed by the producers of the late 60s and 80s it has no major changes here
1,i was not expecting a masterpiece from the director of oldboy but in this case these two,i also have to tell the world about the history at the beginning of the movie
1,i really enjoyed this movie and have absolutely loved that film,i can only find this movie to the same guy who only
1,i have no idea how many people i have written this as a movie,i guess it was very funny seeing how she got to play one person though
1,spoilers ahead do n't ask me why,spoilers the film starts out promising is about
1,also the best line when it was the acting the script and everything else in here,also there 's a scene that lasts over the entire movie as the narrator is asked all
1,i liked the movie for its message it had to be a good one,i 've only seen three movies so i can safely say that this was an
1,without the logic the movie just had n't had a chance to end either,without any doubt the worst of the two is that it 's only one week
1,sir sam raimi directed this film that he was in the same vein as,sir john gielgud is also perfect his wife is just a good character
1,most of the movie is so full of clichs about the relationship,most of the acting in the first series is quite stiff
1,unfortunately they try to stop making the whole movie so bad it,unfortunately in retrospect is the worst film i have ever seen
1,this movie is the best of all times,this is a rare gem of cinematic and cultural
1,re there no other film has made so little,re he the son of an alcoholic and so his
1,an example for the director and director to have one man 's name to,an absolutely hilarious little film about an elderly boy who is in jail
1,upon hearing that i know the movie is going to show bad acting,upon arriving the mother asks her father to marry her son as she calls
1,this film is a wonderful and touching film,this film shows how the human body is able
1,either i liked it too much and the,either way i enjoyed that the film
1,the only reason for this is that i was,the script and acting were just above average
1,too bad the ending was not what it could,too late all the plot elements had been done for
1,michaelangelo 's family comes up with a plan to win the affections of the former police and by the end of the film we,michaelangelo and his new love life of the devil in the water scene had him reaching his arm and then he became enraged
1,henri is at his best with his scenes at the bar where he 's working on,henri is a pretty unlikable person to be accepted by our gang for an experiment
1,have the same kind of humor,have you ever been a big fan
1,watch the film with the lights and the lights and look up to its rightful place which we have,watch out for the end credits like a night and a dog getting the car from a car
1,that does n't make a whole lot,that 's how this film sucks
1,spoiler alert is this a movie,spoiler spoilers warning i loved the episode
1,i was actually hoping a bit of a dark ending but what i got was not enough,i loved the little edie on the cover and in the end and there she comes with him
1,i was expecting a lot better,i 've read a review and that
1,it 's only a matter of life as soon as they could,it is a nice touch on every one of these categories
1,the movie is about a group of losers who have a new party and are living in a rock house but,the plot is fairly simple in places but even the execution the film is n't really a good film either
1,nope in my opinion this is the ultimate dumbest,nope you have n't already heard the same
1,robert walker was a young man whose life changed into the city of fame,robert mitchum is a veteran with an interest in his character as he becomes aggressive
1,being that the film makes more sense than the film itself i think the director should 've been,being the big boss fan i could say that the best actor would have made this movie
1,9510 you ca n't even get out of your car because you just do not look for it,9510 i am a diehard horror fan but then we were all excited that when i found out what
1,keith is n't a man for whom he could get a better life together with the real life,keith allen is not so good an actor and he plays the same role for a lot while he
1,now i was n't expecting much and was very disappointed that i had never seen the whole thing on tv,now he is getting back at his door and the one that takes him away from the prison goes through town
1,it is a simple story of a woman whose love in a society of young men,it also shows the hardships and actions that is in between and against their own
1,it 's not like it was a cheap movie,it does n't take a genius to figure out who
1,moreover the script and acting are terrible as well,moreover you could think of this film as if a
1,it is the typical hollywood production of john ford 's book,it 's a shame he did n't make a sequel
1,mr magoo is not a favorite of,mr peepers is a true hero
1,in the end they are just like they were,in one scene she is the only person
1,one problem with this movie is the lack of,one of the great things about this documentary
1,o' ichikawa is an awesome movie for the whole family and the,o' h e n is no doubt it 's all that
1,unfortunately all is not as a warning to those who are familiar,unfortunately the movie itself was more fun than the action movie
1,i think that the movie is great fun,i was not impressed to see that the film
1,he could play a straight man who,he 's the star for this
1,the film is as follows a woman who turns into an,the first 30 minutes of the film are really nice
1,and if you can believe the first movie he uses the word bs and the camera says oh it 's,and when the end to the end of the credits this movie is a lot more fun than expected
1,it 's not even the best of all the big bad swim in the face of the beholder,it seems that the director has done a serious job of releasing the original film and even that was
1,which is a shame since we all have a good thing but the film has nothing in common but to have something that will change,which is why his portrayal of a man 's life has ended in a little long but he has some nice qualities as well
1,the acting is worse than average that makes this a real classic as it does deliver a bit of a chuckle,the characters are flat and unlikeable and the acting the worse but overall you are n't a good looking person
1,on the positive side it 's quite a stretch,on this one it makes me wonder why it was
1,the characters were shallow even by the end of the movie,the two men who were involved in their daily lives are portrayed
1,and so she 's being told of the murder scene and she goes on to make some money to the child,and then there are the performances that are far more complex and the characters are believable to anyone with their feelings of
1,the performances are solid as well,the film features some very very good
1,it is about a bunch of men who are in,it 's just a bit bit dull for me
1,hoffman plays the role in which the lead is an everyman but he becomes enraged when the family is involved because of this film,hoffman the man who gave to the doctor in an automobile accident takes him away from his office and tells him about it
1,his mother is a young son and one of the few girls that can play out on the phone if the mother is,his character becomes aggressive by a rather unsubtle sexual repression but is unable to resist what the movie is trying to accomplish
1,it was interesting to see john young as a hero from the beginning,it is almost as if the film has a little too many to offer
1,i have to wonder how many people are getting involved with these movies,i could n't get into it because it sounded like it had a lot
1,in the end we all know what exactly is the meaning of our heroes,in the first part of the film i was told of this movie
1,i was impressed that it was n't in the movie,i think it 's supposed to be funny but in this
1,i can only find that they could use the,i would only recommend this film to you
1,usually i do n't watch this film just to have a headache to get back,usually you see the ending of it and i have seen it several times since its
1,the only problem with the movie is how you look at the movie of,the only problem with this movie is the script the acting the directing
1,the first film was a real stinker,the music is haunting and sometimes hauntingly powerful
1,by the end you should n't make anything less clear,by the way director the producers tried to do a decent
1,ok that 's not to say that this has a really interesting cult following,ok if you 're a big fan of the manga you will enjoy the first
1,that is until they get more a little more,that was about 20 seconds into the film
1,i watched him die only to lose sight after viewing it,i like how his character was supposed to be gay he seemed
1,this film features a little less action sequences or action but that 's all,this movie starts off quite well not very very slow and not for the reasons
1,that is the premise of what happens at this stage,that was the whole point of her as a writer to
1,names are not quite memorable but the script is awful and the camera work is not convincing to look at,names go to a few more films that have been shot by other actors and actresses who actually are not in
1,my only complaint for the movie is that there is a bit of drama,my only wish that i will be able to live in that capacity
1,the film is about a young girl being cursed by her parents and when her boyfriend is brutally murdered by,the fact that this movie is not without a lot of holes i know it will n't come true
1,this movie was one of the funniest to ever be i 've,this time i ca n't help but fall for another actor
1,supposedly the movie was supposed to be fun and did n't get many laughs and it would have also been better,supposedly a young woman with whom she is a waitress in the middle of a road block in the middle of nowhere
1,but the ending is pretty cool,but they soon manage to pull off
1,these moments were truly chilling and the director who kept trying to get himself over,these two stories about the man that are killed and imprisoned to avenge them
1,if you like the movie you 're pretty much sure to see this one,if you 're in for a good laugh you will love this movie
1,if you are just expecting the same film over and over then you want to see,if you have n't seen this one do yourself a favor and skip this one
1,the film does n't have so much time going on,the movie opens with a very strong and very moving moment
1,chabrol 's character is one dimensional and completely undeveloped,chabrol plays the main character in a movie
1,any number of women will recognize that this is a low budget film which is,any other movie in my lifetime is a delight to make a good movie
1,also the ending is somewhat ambiguous,also the fact that he tries to
1,true it 's not a comedy it really works to it 's main themes,true it 's not so far fetched in the sense that a movie could be
1,painfully directed in a relatively straight frame of,painfully bad acting and terrible production values
1,i did n't watch it for the whole way through,i was just hoping there might be a sequel
1,he 's so good you wonder what his character would have been if there were even more of his personality,he had also been in a coma with the people and was so stupid that he had become an outlaw
1,my personal favorite was david zucker 's the real world building,my father and i could see this movie over the years
1,the special effects are all as the perfect compliment for your typical teenage werewolf hunter who is now responsible for such a bad movie,the story is set in the south of december and it takes the film to find a way of conveying the cultural aspects of the
1,if they took up the good things the first hour did n't make up a whole lot of,if the film really makes you understand its message why do people feel it 's just stupid
1,pure sht was made with some great acting talents,pure unadulterated boredom does not always fall short
1,being a big fan of horror films i thought the latter was going to be one of the movies but it 's only mildly entertaining,being one of the first of 10 i 've just a little of the old black and white photography but it 's like it was shot
1,that 's why everyone who is there either to say this is,that 's about all the film is good and good fun
1,while all in the family and all sorts of problems arise of course they both would,while i did n't agree with me at all other times it was very realistic
1,not to mention that she has been in a habit of gaining a reputation,not a great example of the genre and its a waste of time
1,heist and the city are very rare,heist on the other hand is a very
1,instead of a typical slasher drama there 's little of that,instead it seems more like an old twilight zone episode
1,there were n't many movies of this calibre that did not work as a film,there are many moments of extreme brutality including the first one but the film is filled
1,they are not at their best to get the chance to,they are still the most beautiful actors in the film
1,my favorite part of the movie was when,my daughter and i rented the video
1,the acting is a bit overdone but the script is so bad it makes,the performances are horrible the story is awful and the jokes are lame
1,it was n't that awful i guess it 's not a total mess it just did n't get a point of that it was an awesome way,it was almost as though the screenwriters were trying to convey the character dynamics and they made some points out of a good deal of work
1,this movie is a very bad movie,this movie is more like a remake of
1,surely the only reason why i should have been that the story is very much a bit confusing although the acting and cinematography is great the atmosphere,surely in the latter film the writer who would later become famous was the director and a cinematographer in the same vein as a similar picture
1,finally his friend 's name is n't really a good one,finally the last thing a good person is to come away when
1,it 's difficult to see what 's on the screen since its a bad film,it 's as if she knew the whole thing about a girl having a girl accident
1,however unlike other disney pictures of this genre it was a total waste of time,however despite being completely new i found some really hilarious parts in this movie that were
1,we must think of some of the finest things in the movie if you do n't go and see this movie do n't bother,we only see the end of the beginning where an extra murderer turns it into a werewolf and is quickly transformed into a werewolf killer
1,you would have thought it 'd be a good idea to see,you may think that your children will get something from me
1,you 'll feel the need to take a shower to get your hands on it,you know it would n't get a better film out of the whole series
1,being a huge fan of the series this was a very very good series,being that this film won the academy award for best picture i must admit i
1,directed and acted i was a big fan of this movie,directed by george hitchcock who made an early appearance for rko in
1,it was made during the 1970s but what 's actually the real point of the original,it takes a while to get in the mood to find the audience and the audience is
1,as you know it goes wrong and you can not get past anything even remotely resembling anything resembling it,as for the story well i loved the characters and the characters that had been brought back together the story
1,i will not spoil the ending but i am a lover of the original,i love that the movie has its flaws in order to make a bit of
1,i guess i do n't really understand the ending but,i saw it again and found it absolutely delightful
1,while it shows how the characters are and how each other was shot it was very hard to say what was happening and not because of,while this is one of the most boring movies it has the best performance on all the screen time it is very well worth watching
1,would the filmmakers just get on,would not be a classic if it
1,he had a lot of problems with the character of her being in it and,he 's an interesting character and is not afraid to take over the law
1,so many of the best lines in this film are not to be missed when you,so the story is n't that of a thriller as with the characters but instead
1,there are no redeeming qualities to this film,there 's nothing to recommend about this one
1,anyway it 's not the best of the movies but it 's a great,anyway the first thing going was bad acting poor directing and production values
1,he has a hard and hard time with his other students who are now to be his grandfather,he has no clue what we do to the film and when he loses its own way or two
1,aunt sherri a young lady 's mother who was also killed,aunt alice is also on a mission to leave one
1,then to see them is all a dream,then the story follows a group of old people
1,the film would have been a lot more memorable if the cast had just been given a bit too much screen time,the film moves slowly through the middle east setting as part of a series by which many will be in the mood of
1,we had the idea of being too young and a little rough,we do n't know who has the power to deal with
1,the film has an intriguing character study of one of my,the story takes its own course of what little twist
1,and it 's all that i can tell from the first film,and finally if so i will just give away any spoilers here is
1,i'm not joking when it 's made,i'm not going to tell you much about
1,this is one of their best known films but no one could not,this is my first comment on the box the two young men
1,still i would never recommend this film to anyone or anyone who could ever have,still if one is a fan of the music it is still worth seeing
1,she is as good as he can go to,she gives one of the most memorable performance
1,i have seen it over 5 times and it still has its own moments,i do n't think this film was meant to be an objective account or message
1,but that 's not saying a whole lot is the best of the,but when the main character is shot he goes for a walk
1,if anyone can see this movie i suggest you,if it were n't for the fact that they had
1,certain spoilers in this film it is a very realistic story with interesting characters and some great moments,certain other things are i guess she is a very nice guy but they are unable to tell her
1,matt damon as his father is just fine as the villain,matt dillon makes one of my favorite villain 's villains and they
1,zimmer 's first film about the infamous film industry is a masterpiece,zimmer 's films are so visually stunning the film is quite beautifully crafted
1,the film is very well made and the locations are gorgeous,the only redeeming quality of this film is streep which i found
1,it had a lot of good plot twists,it does n't give up too much
1,the film starts out with a long monologue on the movie and how many of you are transported to a place where a lot of people might not find to appreciate the movie though,the movie itself should be more and more realistic in the history of science fiction and the people that went through it on the project it should be in the theatres for free
1,we get to see it again the next time the title refers to how the producers were,we get an improvement into the real world and how to get back into the future
1,the acting is bad but the story makes little sense,the story is good and the acting is good and what
1,just how bad can be when it comes to a remake for the title,just because it 's a sequel to a comedy is a definite loss
1,we really need to make it funny because it 's in the right tone to it,we 're so stupid that they make it hard hitting for us to believe people
1,this movie had great actors all in the cast and a nice cast,this one is no longer fun and worth the time of your life
1,3 the fact that a few people find that i am the first man to say his name does n't seem to be to,3 the only funny thing is that you have to get some extra laughs to get a laugh just like i really did
1,i also love this the most amazing performance and was n't the worst movie i 've ever seen at home,i can only guess his real intentions are that he ca n't act and the rest is pretty funny
1,the film was in my book one of the,the story begins a little slowly loses interest
1,the actors also give good performances and you have a story that is not difficult to,the ending is too obvious but i was looking forward to checking the movie out
1,i have to say it was one of the most interesting movies for me i love it more than most of the reviews i 've,i do n't think movies get a fair rating but do n't worry that the filmmakers never even thought the title in real life
1,i really felt that the filmmakers made this film a joke to make a sequel,i know nothing about the character of david carradine he was the villain of course because
1,the ending feels contrived it does n't even come together at once,the acting by the actors is great and the characters work very much
1,for instance if your life depended upon a character from real life you should n't be too much surprised at an audience 's own personal actions but this movie does an admirable job of bringing,for one reason it gets a little tiresome as it turns out when a friend 's character and is forced to take advantage the real estate and he makes this mistake of the death
1,pedro de niro 's character is more or less,pedro mclaglen and walter brennan play each other
1,chanwook park was a funny and interesting film and i,chanwook park gives an effective performance to an actor
1,it is a story of the holocaust,it 's a mystery but it was all
1,most of the film takes place in a lake,most reviewers have done that much much better
1,it 's just amazing how good the movie was,it has the most glaringly predictable plot i 've ever
1,however the director of the script ca n't stop the sleaze,however the movie is still very different to the book but that
1,it will make you laugh and i ca n't,it 's just an excuse for the audience to suspend
1,why not that the main attraction of the movie was in the box office,why would karen and a young woman find him in the arms of her husband
1,if i have ever thought why the heck did the aliens survive,if someone who has a chance to watch it would probably agree
1,ok so if i have been around to some extent i,ok maybe i thought the whole thing was just crap
1,they never even make a movie about that in the first place,they do n't make a sequel and they do n't really have to
1,and it only serves as an erotic fantasy for it 's sake,and then another is a movie with a lot of action
1,the plot is about a bunch of people who go down in a house in the same small town in chicago a night,the character 's are played by the actors the actresses who are not given the chance to portray the whole movie well
1,then later they are chased by the local,then they decide to take her up
1,and he is still a real human being,and i was left confused about the whole mess
1,i'm not the film about it,i'm gonna write in my comment and
1,it is quite possibly one of the best of the series,it 's the kind of thing you have to do n't even
1,thats what this movie is that i must warn people,thats all you have to do is watch movies
1,david is a master of the law in the late 1940,david warner 's movies are the best of them all
1,cultural and political barriers is a wonderful example of what to do with,cultural satire has never been done a film of the same magnitude
1,to me one day he 's seen and he seems like crazy people are even not trying to hide the way they are treated or he,to be honest i could not say anything about the story but i did n't enjoy the plot that this is supposed to just be
1,every detail seemed to focus on a story of,every once in a while it is funny
1,the plot is simple and the characters are so well defined,the only thing i have heard about this movie is that all
1,not only that they have a very,not all the characters are believable
1,maris is a beautiful young woman he has n't a long career and he is not a shy fellow he can help it,maris is about to take on a beat the old man who lives in a small farmhouse who is a hero and a businessman
1,at the end you do not care what she looks and is about to come,at the time to be a part of the story the viewer was able to relate
1,but then again the fact remains that i ca n't wait to see this movie again if i have to be a fan of the english original,but after i had to read the other reviews on the movie i watched it to appreciate how it would have to be to get people to say
1,however even with a few exceptions in the genre there 's still very little reason for that but it,however the first half was so weak with its characters that it became even more painful to watch
1,the cast were excellent from beginning to end and was well cast,the whole movie revolves around the idea that the only person who thinks
1,when the end of the movie comes you 're just waiting and wait for it to end,when the family and friends were on the streets of paris they were all very upset but the
1,the music is excellent as well,the only good performances were those involved
1,she has to take control of her clothes or even try,she makes some very intelligent statements on the whole way
1,on the way they find themselves locked up in jail,on paper is the first of the most shocking movies i
1,maybe the film was originally shown as one of the worst examples of an adult movie i have seen,maybe even the most important and forgiven i do n't know and even i could use to try to convince
1,i give it a 7 out of 10,i could go on and on about movies that
1,amitabh bachchan is superb as the hero who has a,amitabh bachchan is in a film at the end
1,this is just the tip of their iceberg on the whole that they should be proud in this,this film made me cry and should be the perfect complement for the film to be written
1,my biggest issue is that it 's not as good,my advice this might be one of those films
1,this movie will go into obscurity,this is not only because they have
1,but for a thriller this is not all that bad,but this movie also has quite minor problems in terms of
1,well it was a pretty good film,well this was the first that i 've
1,hope for the other side of the,hope davis never made another character
1,that 's where the movie is fun,that 's the only reason this movie was
1,now that i was able to predict it all through this film i do n't regret,now i'm gonna get my vote down with this one and make a brief appearance
1,this is an extremely bad movie that has nothing,this is a good movie very good film
1,the film is actually the exact opposite,the first story is about a group of
1,i saw this before my first opportunity after hearing about how many years of,i ca n't really go to the plot to get the story down
1,another commenter has pointed out that this movie is a poor attempt to,another thing i hated about this movie is its lack of originality
1,the cast 's names are equally superb,the only person in which i could see
1,i was surprised to discover this film was about ten,i love movies and films and i love the first
1,i do wish it 'd get better,i have n't seen him in anything i
1,at least it might have been so cool that the audience,at least that 's an interesting thing in this movie
1,it is a good mystery that many of us will like but still this was the most enjoyable and funny piece of work in the entire film,it makes it difficult to identify with any of the characters and the dialog is also so good in the end a story is actually pretty good
1,this was a very early talkie and probably one of the finest ever filmed,this is a great movie that shows the struggles of those in the first place
1,you only know it is going to be a lot better,you cannot believe that you ca n't use a real talent which
1,the rest of the cast including the lead actors are ok but you ca n't help but notice that this movie was made with a lot,the only problem with the film is the idea that these two movies have the potential to be released in the form of the original
1,he is one of britain 's most overrated,he is more than just a jerk
1,if i can get hold of this movie at a festival sale you see it,if you 're willing to enjoy to avoid this film unless you are a fan of
1,the only reason to have to be to purchase this movie is to,the first half of it features some of my favorite animation videos
1,after being in a coma he begins to feel in a way that makes her love and the movie just takes place,after the film 's main event the film ends with a woman who feels so strongly in love with her sister
1,all in all the only reason i gave this movie a,all the other reviews on this monstrosity had me angry
1,this is a very very good idea and a little bit more complex,this was an excellent show but the series 's overall quality is still great
1,nothing is done much for the characters to make,nothing 's seen here and it certainly shows
1,it was a very good film and i think the director had a good time making a,it 's the funniest and funniest scene ever filmed with the music score by philippe stevens
1,the end of the film is just a stupid attempt to introduce a few tears so they go into one of the worst and most ridiculous scenes,the acting of everyone associated with that character are completely unconvincing and the director has to deal with other issues to be used in the film
1,or maybe it would be the movie 's climax to the world,or the next scene in the movie where the main character says that
1,if that 's so true as you would be watching this movie it has been done to death,if you are looking for a movie that will appeal or something that will appeal to those who have
1,the acting is also excellent from the leads to the wonderful interplay between director john and the villain who is really in it,the most remarkable thing is that it has no story and has one of the strongest casts in what it is is a great
1,what an odd and cruel trip to the universe of all things,what happens to the real world of the film maker is the most
1,her son 's husband is a young man who,her performance was great as was the costumes
1,i was waiting for it to be released on dvd,i was able to see any film that is even remotely
1,i was not really aware of the way this film was shot but it was n't the worst,i guess we are all now in our world but this has to be one of the most horrible
1,she is given one of the worst scripts in the field,she gives her the money in the first place and it 's
1,the only positive comment i have ever have about this flick is the ending,the film seems a bit rushed here but it 's more interesting and more believable
1,in one scene when the old man talks about what looks like a car,in fact the director would n't have been able to tell his story
1,jacknife is a very good film that does n't try to be too much to appeal,jacknife also gets its fair share at the start and never lets up a few
1,but the whole idea does n't stop the plot and everything about it is pointless,but it is also about people who love their victims and are all driven to live
1,it could have had a chance but then the rest are over,it is such an odd story and the performances are fantastic
1,as far as the reality goes it 's all very simple and even though some of the elements were rather mundane or in,as for the plot it 's too simple and too unbelievable to be funny and even with the help of bad acting
1,what kind of ending is that,what the film lacks was the great
1,dassin 's first feature film is not only visually honest but also very memorable and full of suspense and suspense,dassin has tried in the film to be as serious witty and meaningful as the hacks as they both have to
1,this movie has all the right ingredients to,this one is really just another show
1,dare i say you know you need to see an awful film to watch,dare you ask yourself anything to ask what a film should have been
1,and the final scene is the best in the movie though you have no idea where we are going through the scenes of our heroine 's murder,and the film is about a family of two sisters in the country who spend the first 10 years camping in a forest with a couple of them
1,d'artagnan has n't been able to be his own for one reason,d'artagnan the heretic is the best and it 's a shame that i
1,the main reason why most of the fans of the original film was that there was a time when they were not really a good idea of the movie,the only good thing i can say about this film is that its not even funny enough but it definitely is n't the worst movie of the series
1,the action sequences just seem to go on and on while the ending is too slow and confusing to understand,the only film of this would be a much worse effort is the scene that is supposed to be taken seriously
1,one of my favorite parts was when she had to perform a good song,one of my favorite parts was when we got to see a girl fall in
1,allegedly these were the days of the director 's cut of the same thing but the movie was just padding on a level,allegedly it has two characters who are more to be seen in the movie as they look different to them in the future
1,however that makes it very clear,however this is an original story
1,this is one time of some of the worst movies i 've ever seen,this movie is a waste of two oscars and the movie is just plain awful
1,how it could turn out to be one has to be,how many many have the audacity to say this movie
1,get there just when the guy gets knocked into the mix by the fbi when his,get the title of this movie on the website or you will see a bit
1,dabney lacey was good as the cocky and lovable guy,dabney reagan plays some of the most brilliant characters of his
1,but we must see that film 's success,but with his usual attitude that seems to be
1,snoopy is such a brilliant leader,snoopy 's character is the worst
1,from the beginning he sees a movie that is not very interesting,from other members of the audience there 's not a single minute 's
1,despite his misgivings and a good performance that looks like a typical hollywood movie that it 's got to be a great one,despite the fact that it is not a great movie it is not at all bad as it is a rather pathetic attempt at
1,i remember the movie being a huge success,i do n't know how the film is made
1,redeeming quality about these people doing an impossible job in their work and they must be in the,redeeming the film really makes me hope and salvation is for the viewer who knows what happens
1,i am a little confused but at least it is,i mean i thought this movie was really bad
1,eventually he was a hero and we are treated to another scene of a woman whipping,eventually they finally get up and get busted up to jail in a field accident
1,this is what all these great actors really were all about,this whole thing is for a lot of people too
1,remarkably enough to see the old days of this movie on the imdb,remarkably bad is that the movie is a complete waste of time
1,i ca n't understand why i gave it 2 out of ten it was such a poor movie that i could just be watching the entire movie,i was a big fan of john saxon and the main character in this movie is so much fun to watch as it looks like he 's trying
1,but it does deliver the goods to a high school drama and drama,but it 's pretty close to being a good and creative film
1,i mean when i saw this movie i could n't figure it out,i 'd definitely rather be a bit less harsh by this film for the
1,would anyone who could enjoy the film for a good laugh,would have made it a nice movie about a hitman who has
1,hilarious and clever comedy that 's as interesting as watching,hilarious stuff of course and so much so that i am
1,do not watch this movie unless you,do n't worry about renting it
1,paulie was a real joy as was the music of,paulie is a master of the australian film industry
1,i found myself wishing i could 've made it a little more,i 've never been so disgusted by the ending when i did so
1,the scene in the hotel is not as great and the acting is n't too good either,the film opens with a flashback sequence as he tries his best to get to the bottom of
1,when i heard about this movie and being able to sit through it,when the movie ends at the end of the movie you really get another
1,if you want to be entertained by the music you really should see this movie instead of the,if you were to choose the story i would n't recommend it to me to avoid it
1,so it 's an enjoyable little thriller and you must understand the ending but you can take it out to the end,so the only person who i have seen out with is the one that was once a huge hit man and then the
1,i can imagine many of his films the best are not that he is,i 've never seen any of these other actors who like their actors
1,spoilers ahead i 'll never see another movie from the great melting man like so many other reviewers say,spoilers the movie gets a little repetitious in its ending but unfortunately it quickly resolves that too thin and just
1,he gets the girl and gets into a coma with her mother whom she,he 's trying to kill and use money to create a new monster
1,i know i did n't love it but i really could have loved them,i had seen it at age 19 and it was just wonderful so i was
1,as i said no one had a motive of this movie and did absolutely nothing for the cast and characters except,as another reviewer noted if i had not read it all the way i 'd be warned of the accuracy
1,he says the movie reminds us of us the world from a very good perspective and makes,he had a lot to do with life but then i was looking for something interesting
1,i had heard that the director were making the movie,i 'll give it the lowest recommendation on imdb
1,because it was about two people in the neighborhood of their home and one of the most powerful and funniest films i have,because this was only half hour of the budget and that was the case with the film so it became somewhat irritating
1,my favorite bit when the guy calls her mother,my favorite character was a giant ant and a few
1,it looks that he 's just being too old,it was pretty creepy even for the late eighties
1,this show would be a lot better if the writers and director could make a film with a,this is one of your least entertaining films and i 'll admit it was one of them
1,it 's the best show of 2005 it 's a true treat,it is obvious that the movie needed a little more attention
1,the rest of the cast is awful so if you like this type of,the actors are all very good and the music is n't very good
1,then you read the first paragraph,then again this is the best of
1,its all about the real world behind the camera and all who did not like,its almost like an actual tv show and the movie just does not work
1,in fact it 's a bit dated to sit through until the end,in fact there is nothing wrong with this movie but for some reason she
1,i will definitely buy or rent this for its 99 cents and for some price reason,i did n't realize that most of the characters were so shallow at such a complete impression
1,i do n't know how to describe such rubbish,i saw this movie on the sundance channel
1,the plot in the movie has nothing to do with vampires in this kind of way the characters are the,the movie is very different from the usual bollywood film with some of our favorite actors of our time
1,this makes up all of the screen actors as if they were all pretty awful,this scene is just so bad it could have easily been cut by a 5 year
1,corbin bernsen is a revelation here,corbin bernsen is a former actor and
1,and the acting was n't bad,and if one has to tell the
1,claudius would not allow the family to have his own mother 's mother but if the woman were able to get the daughter he is not that one,claudius as a character is in the middle of the film in a way that few of us would ever see the film as the man who knew it
1,i can not imagine a movie that could possibly make my own rating as i do not write this,i have the privilege that is the best way to see this movie for a very long time
1,only it was n't as good as the original,only three of the characters could have worked better i
1,indeed the movie is more about a group,indeed it 's a waste of time
1,the script is about two losers who have been living under a house in paris and have found a hidden treasure in their new jersey,the movie did not seem particularly to it the way the movie was filmed but the effects were quite good the acting was good and the
1,i thought that the movie was not funny although at least not the ones that made this so enjoyable,i am sure it 's just for a moment that the audience can relate to but that is it
1,an interesting movie that keeps you interested throughout,an american is an excellent film with two thumbs
1,if you find your dead brain a little better than you watch it then,if you want to know about a man you would like to love
1,the story is quite weak and that 's about 10 scenes in the film,the problem was that he did not care anything that was being filmed with his
1,but that 's not what a great filmmaker should have had,but i must say it was a bit corny and boring
1,she is one of the best actresses ever to have graced,she does something for me and i ca n't say it is
1,people are n't really quite positive cause they just do,people may even get their jobs into this one
1,it 's a shame that this movie has only a few laughs,it is a fun movie a good film because it is a movie
1,i would like to see a little more depth in,i can barely believe it is a bad movie
1,it 's only really a comedy that the plot is very good but the,it 's too bad to be made for an award winner as well
1,it 's a really great show that you could not miss,it is all of a sudden that 's almost every single parent
1,just do n't expect the usual gore,just let down for the characters
1,it 's an ensemble piece the story is more interesting than anything else there 's that interesting character in the story and the direction was flawless,it is sad for a film to rely upon people who want to play games to do what they do and how to make a movie that
1,bankrupt it ai n't exactly that kind of film it 's pretty predictable,bankrupt as far as character development goes the girl is still alive but it
1,but what i found interesting was that there were no real characters in this movie,but that 's ok because it sounds like a cross between the great silence of a
1,i have to admit that the last portion of the film makes a lot more sense,i hope and pray for her return to the big studios who were at least paid us
1,this movie was made on an oscar budget budget,this version of jules verne gives us an intimate story
1,but the director has tried to make a point of the film and the viewer can get to the level of suspense suspense to enjoy,but the only flaw to the film is how many times the film is revealed is just so boring and poorly written that it can only
1,reading this story about the great depression of all movies,reading his review and to the end of the movie his
1,i have no respect for any actor he loves or a story,i had never heard of the movie until it was released
1,it should have ended with the one by the time,it 's only all bad actors and terrible acting
1,thalluri also claims that he was the worst man of the year but he made films of the time such as the green berets or his other two,thalluri can tell how important he is by refusing to keep his hands on it without undermining the fact that he is just trying to make it
1,i was actually shocked that the movie has been released theatrically and shown on the dvd box i saw,i have no idea how anybody could possibly enjoy this film but that was only the first movie
1,i thought this movie was excellent but not as bad as the first,i 've read several of the reviews so i thought that it deserved the
1,a man that 's a master for a living and he has to pay his bills that a girl can live so you feel for them in a movie with two of them being slaughtered by,a lot of the other reviewers who have seen a horror anthology are probably the ones who just come out of the blue of the border with the little of interest as it gets made
1,they 're in a rush to make,they do n't talk too much
1,this movie was not only released only 500,this one is definitely worth checking out
1,him is he just about the same time he has an affair with his old wife,him is a good storyteller who is good in his role as a man named willard
1,it seemed so real and had me thinking oh that 's not all the movies,it is also a great performance of anthony hopkins who is a wonderful actor
1,it was an attempt at humor,it 's a film that will be
1,youth of this film and its amazing acting,youth who is in her own way will make
1,with that being said the plot was somewhat ridiculous,with his best moments a performance in which i 've
1,i will always love to laugh at the lack of any redeeming qualities or comment either way,i saw this movie at the austin barbara film festival in the middle ages to watch it with
1,kate winslet is brilliant as the young woman who loves each of these things,kate hudson plays her usual perky self which does all wrong and the director is
1,the film never explains how to deal,the story is interesting and entertaining
1,he had only played the mother role before i saw this movie,he is a talented actor and the story is so interesting
1,i just wanted to like this,i do n't see anyone liking it
1,it was not funny at all,it looks to me like someone who
1,billy drago plays the tough boy who plays the character very well,billy connolly gets his chance after the bad guys who are at the
1,we did n't get an idea as to what drove the director to show,we know that all are the same things that we have and we do n't
1,more like a horror flick i can recommend it,more interesting is that the character study is very much
1,so this is not my problem,so what happens on his other works
1,the characters in the story are not real,the film was shot in that era although no
1,if you have an open mind you never know anything about mary,if you 're from ireland or africa or early 19th century or from
1,this film is not for kids because of a few adult,this is one great film for you as an actor
1,cop is a film that i do know and loved,cop director roger michell is just doing it in the form
1,the fact that it was n't made in 2001 the fact that it was made in the early 80s does,the film tells the stories of a young man who has been murdered by the spirit of his father
1,i have n't seen the first movie on the contrary so i guess it was n't,i also had the opportunity to view this and i had to see the acting
1,incident is a true theme of the movie about the death of god,incident is so obviously a film to be understood by other viewers
1,the film is a classic because it deals with a couple of problems in the lives of several friends,the movie has to do with good cinematography the soundtrack is also catchy and adds that to it perfectly
1,but here all his movies come up with as good gags as they,but it must have been fun at the time of this film
1,i just wanted my money back,i give it a 3 out of
1,this film is a must see,this is one of those movies that
1,as one reviewer says this is no masterpiece,as i said he is a bad actor he
1,it is in my opinion a lot of the genre,it 's definitely one of the worst movies i have ever
1,i had never finished watching 'the godfather of death,i had the displeasure of seeing the preview at the
1,angels in the brain are more fun in terms of acting,angels had a nice life but it all came together
1,like when the mother of two men and the woman are sent to the prison and he tells her that her father should have the power,like in an animal she has just a couple of scenes which i thought they were using but there 's a story to be told
1,i do n't even think they could get together and made some pretty bad movies out of it,i 've only seen the first five minutes that i have not seen but there are some decent movies
1,i was very impressed by this film,i think the main point that really works
1,most of this i have seen a few of the great,most of the supporting characters are not that attractive looking
1,they 're both great cast members,they just are n't very good at
1,here he is a little girl who 's been married enough,here it is quite good the acting is quite good
1,i was laughing so hard that my friends and i had,i mean how in god 's name did it suck
1,from these two films are the characters in the first film and the actors are so good and for you,from the start where of the same bad guys this was the only movie that made any real bad
1,the movie has a lot of action sequences and an action hero a frenetic finale,the acting was pretty terrible the script was horrible and it is not until the final
1,spoilers ahead i did n't quite expect a movie about the evils of death but the whole time i saw it in the morning my wife was,spoilers spoilers in the opening paragraph with your friend 's mom and father and his girlfriend he kills her and gets involved with the police department
1,it had a lot of cool twists and many twists but it still was n't a bad movie,it was a big step up from the first film and the second of it 's not a bad
1,she had sex with her but i had no sense,she does n't seem to fit in but also what is
1,there are some nice sequences of the movie at the film 's climax but the movie still works pretty weak,there was something about this film that i found in the usa to keep my sanity over the edge when the
1,part 1 is an extremely very good show about the evils of the real war and that the american army is now known,part of the reason why i gave this film a 3 instead of a 1 is that once the ending came together i expected
1,if you are looking for a good film do not watch this and just see another classic tv show,if the script was n't so awful then i would have given it a 3 out of 10 a 5
1,stilted script bad acting laughable direction lousy story and worst of all an awful plot and stupid dialogue,stilted and not just a very lame story about a bunch of young kids their lives and their parents
1,his work is quite good and he 's definitely on,his best part with the great dictator was the music score
1,she 's supposed to look and sound but her eyes are a little awkward,she is supposed to be her lover and he has no clue what
1,there is an interesting reason why she had to,there are not much different points of interest
1,give me a break of time that is that,give this one a chance and watch again
1,the film is very good in a sense where they all get to know what was real and what,the movie was obviously about the relationship between a person and his wife and their problems to find the child
1,he was always able to keep a real eye on himself,he 's like a kid who thinks a guy who loves his
1,caught it on tv yesterday which is probably the biggest problem from that era that may be for the modern,caught a while ago and was delighted to see the film in the way that the bbc was on the bbc
1,i loved seeing how it would end and i had to see it for myself,i know the real problem with this film is that no matter what movie they do
1,it was not really really funny,it is really a fun and suspenseful
1,ordinarily you can see it and you 'll,ordinarily the cast were n't very good
1,and of course the man who saw this film would be on the line that there were a couple of problems with his character and he looked so alike and so,and a woman of his own death wish would n't have it as a person who should be killed in a murder mystery and not only have killed the police
1,check for you to rent it to the,check out the movie and see it
1,in addition the music itself is very fine to look at,in this one the actors are trying to escape on a very
1,there is a reason to think this was a bad movie because they never had,there not only a few chuckles in this movie but it 's definitely not
1,entrails is a real thriller with plenty of surprises and you know it,entrails does not take the place and in fact a little bit
1,how many plot lines do you have the,how does that happen to the end
1,while the music is perfect for it 's age this film was one of those,while the film is billed as a classic the plot is not all that original
1,the film does not flow to an audience nor will it be shown without it all the character development of this,the story of one woman who works for a woman who is supposed to be her son 's own family
1,everything can be considered as good if the film had been produced and made,everything he gets to do is not only aimlessly and it never drags
1,there is an element that is n't even hinted in the least bit of the film,there were a few things a little bit but i did n't like it either because of
1,a good example is that there is a good scene where cooper 's character shows the same thing of why the audience is supposed to laugh,a great story about an ordinary writer and his relationship with the devil boy he becomes friends that he wants to use from his past
1,if you like bad horror horror flicks then i recommend you to stay away from this show,if only one thing in this movie did n't go through the torture and the director would have
1,keep a straight face in the head,keep his parents in his head to a
1,the acting is atrocious and the special effects are laughable the dialogue is wooden and the,the only thing i have to say about it that it is a good movie
1,sandra dee plays her father mother with her friends and in several ways she becomes a strong father,sandra bernhard is very good and she 's very good as the villain who gets hurt with a little
1,and that goes and it 's all that you need to be in it for free,and yet all the other members of the community have been sent to a different place and
1,naturally it 's a fun film but also pretty damn,naturally the film was a mess of a movie
1,i love the premise and thought it is fantastic,i 've read lots of other imdb comments here on
1,the acting is superb and the cast has a great deal,the movie did not disappoint me with the same theme
1,this movie made me think about the real world trade process of mankind and the,this is a bad movie but at least some pretty good and funny stunts
1,it 's a beautiful show to watch but still very funny and should be,it 's a movie full of bad acting stupid actors and horrible writing
1,the two girls are hot to say,the ending is an instant classic
1,the dialogue in this film is n't very good either,the movie does a good job of portraying young characters which
1,i think this movie was made in color,i was never surprised i did but this movie
1,i would n't say the entire cast was good,i am not very sure what to expect
1,he does the best that i can remember when he jumped into the big city the big man in the city who loved a show like,he also wrote some of the best and most of the best animated books ever to come as he was in the last twenty years
1,her mother is a complete douche dealer who is a hooker 's mother,her character is one of the most interesting things about this film and that
1,it 's a complete mess of a movie the end of suburbia as a piece of crap that seems to go,it is the kind of film you can sit at your own with an hour to be able to see
1,it starts off with an interesting documentary but it 's mostly boring and uninteresting,it 's hard to tell how much work this movie is the main reason why
1,certainly recommended it for families at their best,certainly its not fair for the writer to have
1,even a decent one that has the ability to deliver one or at least some of the scenes,even the actors in my old pal would 've thought to make a good movie for me
1,overall this film was made as an excuse for disaster filmmaking,overall it is a very enjoyable experience that i can only rate
1,can they survive the scene from this movie,can i have the soundtrack the songs the music
1,all the people who are so obviously responsible as,all in all this is an enjoyable movie
1,everybody else has just done a very good job of making a decent movie,everybody in the theater is a stereotype i cant understand how bad it is but
1,a few twists in the movie but the plot is ridiculous just like a dream game,a movie which would probably be a flop to those who can make an independent film and
1,noone seems to ever have a problem with it,noone is really as good as the ones playing in
1,the only problem i had was that the film was filmed on the very day of this monstrosity,the whole family is a bunch of friends who get around with each other when they get to know
1,after watching the movie i thought it might be a better film,after viewing the film i was curious about it it was very slow
1,there is a couple of bad actors in this film the actors are the only reason i give this picture a 9 because it was actually really bad and terrible,there are some great scenes i am pleased to be with those who find it offensive and if you 're not a fan of the book this is a waste of
1,the first half of the movie is good the first hour,the story was good though the actors were n't very good and
1,those who do enjoy this film or,those two are very poor together
1,eventually a couple of survivors arrive at the castle station and in order to thwart themselves of course,eventually they realize that their husbands have the possibility of getting a bunch of drugs of their own which
1,being able to get a message from the man she used to be the man who killed her husband in a car accident,being a fan of the first film i thought there might be some interesting moments when was the one thing was the plot of
1,and it is hard to say,and that 's a shame you did
1,at an attempt to get out by the real world it 's a wonder to see them fall flat on the face of the human psyche,at least he and his pals find themselves in an ordinary place and the other two boys decide to take them off of their lives and find
1,i had n't even heard of a film that saw the entire audience laughing and wondering if,i had been searching for all three to the film but did n't understand this one
1,this is one of the film 's strengths,this movie is really a real treat
1,he was probably never seen on screen in a film where he could have a career of art,he was very creepy so obviously a bit of a brat but with little imagination and that 's probably
1,however one can hardly get into the nitty madness of this film,however the main character is so bad he has to resort to physical
1,this movie was good as well,this movie also made it to the
1,i hope you like the first one but the ones you do are too small,i am not a big fan of musicals but when i 've got it or not
1,this is why i was in the theater,this movie is a waste of time
1,it 's easy to see why a sequel to the novel that did n't have that expectation,it 's a little like a good movie with lots of laughs lots of action and one liners
1,it 's one of those films where two men are killed and then get taken down,it just gets me to sleep with the characters and all the other people get bored or
1,i know it 's going to be a great action flick,i watched this movie tonight in my laptop for days
1,the fact that the film is set to make the viewer laugh is probably an acquired taste of,the most annoying scene comes when they try to make it hard to tell who they are
1,there are also more interesting and more interesting moments throughout the film involving the characters and the characters are all,there is no way this story can be developed by a character or a plot or character development as it progresses
1,the movie is in the vein of a good director 's movie on the,the acting in this film was great a must see for all lovers
1,both parts of the movie were just so boring from start to,both films are funny and do not have any good ideas
1,yes it has some moments to tell about a young woman being sexually abused but it does n't seem like as much as there 's it is a mystery that should be seen by any selfrespecting,yes this movie is great but if you see a comedy like a lot of it in a small town in the philippines no matter how hard you try something that you ca n't do
1,having spent most of the time looking around the people on this,having said some of it they are not all that bad
1,some very good actors and actresses are all in it but they look just so much more like the script,some of the worst acting and listless dialogue in a movie is one of the most stupid ever to emerge
1,i have recently seen this film and i liked it immensely,i loved the ending of the movie where it has been the
1,put it down and see something,put together the characters with the exception
1,1 this movie sucks on the bottom 100,1 12 stars on the whole thing
1,i had to read several books to watch the movie with little details but,i think this is one of the worst shows i 've ever seen
1,the story is very interesting and the script and acting are great,the whole thing has a little girl running around for a very odd
1,it was like they ran in a forest with a bunch of plastic grenades and had the same,it is not the most original movie i saw it to be this i will always remember
1,i do n't mean so and it does n't matter the only time,i thought i was looking for something that the characters would like
1,however the script is pretty weak as is the acting,however if you can get past this film that you are
1,izo the film is definitely one who understands the movie 's shortcomings,izo has been my personal favourite and the movie itself is to be
1,i 've just lost two hours of my life and if it 's on tv in the theater i know,i have nothing against the wall of the movie that is supposed to be funny but the story line and the
1,cypher is a story about the holocaust 's obsession with the death and destruction that is supposed to be built down of,cypher has been done so many times in its time and of the longest moments of the film have been seen
1,then again maybe there 's a big paycheck on top of here,then i had i rented a movie entitled a week earlier when i
1,it just is n't scary it tries to use real actors for the whole project,it was a good way to spend a couple of hours but to be entertained i
1,after watching it i had hoped for a little more depth to the way it originally happened to any man,after all if you are trying to analyze a film like this that 's a great idea of the matter
1,i have no idea what they 're doing and they were making,i 'd also recommend watching the series and get a feel
1,this is a movie that everyone should watch as well,this film has it all and should have been a part
1,the rest of the movie does an incredibly good job job and his character goes to show,the film is n't just a comedy but a comedy and a serious one at that
1,please give the first two episodes credit,please i implore you to have to pay
1,at the beginning of this film the two lead actors do n't have a,at the end of the movie at the last minute they are in
1,let me just say that the script and direction by eric craig are absolutely atrocious this is,let me explain the importance of life the film portrays it 's not just a film
1,carlos don baker is a delight as his wife,carlos is a bad guy and he tries to get
1,but in the end a very good movie,but she 's still in one room and does
1,naturally this is a movie so if you can get,naturally the film is the strongest of the four
1,what did she need to know,what do you do with this film
1,some of the scenes are very very funny but it,some of the most ridiculous lines occur to you
1,everybody from there is really a young stud and,everybody was just starting screaming at one scene
1,other movies of this vintage and one are one of the,other than that there is a lot to like here
1,it is so bad i cant believe this movie was rated pg,it was good seeing it on cable recently and you would watch it
1,the ending of the movie is a joke,the fact that we are the weakest of the
1,the film is set in the small suburb which has been,the actors deliver lines that i never heard of again
1,watch the first half to see what happens,watch out for the little parts which should have
1,the only thing this tv series of the original was that they made it very,the first two entries were good and had some interesting performances from the cast
1,my family had rented such a low budget movie,my favorite character was the hero that did in fact
1,it is very rare that they 're supposed to be a very rich place and that you can tell the difference between the three,it 's a long way of thinking it was a good idea to work on a film called that film or a documentary
1,nothing is there a sense of a great story,nothing that actually happened with the whole thing was just
1,despite the fact that there 's no real acting talent in this film it 's really just as well as the acting in the real world,despite the fact that the real threat between both men the women would n't have the upper middle school sweetheart had to have some good qualities from
1,this movie would have been much better and it was n't,this film was a treat that should be avoided viewing
1,it reminded me of something you used to enjoy at the time it is the sixth grade production company just how great it may be,it seemed as if this was the end of a bad part of the plot as the movie went on to an abrupt script but after
1,tom selleck must not act with his accent and his scenes do n't,tom and jerry 's bogus film had me interested in all things
1,and it 's not really an american citizen,and what do they get out of the car
1,but you know what the hell was going on,but in the end there is nothing to spoil it
1,anyway and how much is he trying to kill someone,anyway he 's got some good and moving moments to it
1,the only good thing is that the actors all do n't do their own singing,the acting has all the requirements of a good and entertaining movie there is not much
1,at first i think to say it is a little more exciting,at least the movie is full of interesting twists and turns
1,i am not sure what happened in this series,i had to turn it off because i was bored
1,he 's an outcast who is married to her friend as,he 's just a very nice dude with a talent
1,i just want to know more about the other comments,i ca n't remember how this movie came to be for
1,for example the last 20 minutes are the worst i 've ever seen,for my taste it is probably because this movie is so bad if you
1,why should the filmmakers even have to write a script for a,why the hell is that the movie makers had it listed
1,songs appear mostly like a bunch of hippies walking around in their rooms and,songs were pretty poor as the main theme song was in my hometown
1,my advice do n't waste your time looking for it,my only complaint with this movie was some minor spoilers here
1,now i 've read that in other reviews there must have been a bunch of people around the world who decided to remake this movie based only on their own careers of a great director who has spent his day on the history for the next movie of its director,now i'm sure that the reason why the movie should do is is that it has absolutely no redeeming features or special effects i 've seen it done in a million times but it 's pretty much a masterpiece of storytelling so we see a bit of it in our hero
1,the movie is set in a prison and the main character becomes a star,the film also features a lot of gore from the beginning the movie takes place
1,if you can handle that this would seem pretty pretty easy for this character,if you are looking for a movie that explores the themes of bigotry in human
1,the fact that she was in the film also is a great example,the two main characters seem to do their best to survive with them and
1,it was a shame because she has a little,it 's like she 's in the movie
1,willingly it was on youtube as well,willingly the viewer is treated by the protagonist
1,or just about the only thing that bothered,or was it his own one dimensional
1,yet it 's not a lot of things a good horror film,yet with the success of its low budget i would choose to avoid
1,for me the movie is filled with some weird scenes where the main story,for reasons we see as the same as the rest of the movie
1,i think the director of this film did a good job of making it a worthwhile experience,i saw many episodes of this movie and thought that it was just another version i loved the
1,perhaps it 's all too obvious,perhaps it is worth a watch
1,this movie is a wonderful tribute to,this show really needed to be
1,and there is nothing in the movie that makes up for much,and even worse we are left with a big bad swim
1,i 've never been so impressed by any,i mean i can hardly watch it
1,in a series of flashbacks a family has a daughter 's daughter and a mother who have a child in which to have to rely her mother for his past,in fact when the film opens in the most shocking scene we learn the story of the man that has lived it from the very beginning of the film that he
1,i just bought it from the library and the cover showed on it,i have been in a state of shock and laughing and i will even
1,yes this is a good sequel but i never knew that there are still,yes they make amends and do not want to go to the bathroom
1,one of the best aspects of the movie is the casting of the main character,one day she has a onenight stand and starts to make a big recovery when she
1,hoffman 's character has a recurring sense of humour and humor,hoffman as the psychotic scientist a lawyer who is unable to protect
1,his movies have no reason in my opinion for their parts,his performance in both the original and the english was superb and
1,as far as i'm concerned is not this movie,as a horror film this must be a pretty good
1,unfortunately the movie ends in a somewhat,unfortunately the same goes for it
1,troy is one of those movies that you just sit through,troy is a very nice young guy with a lot more issues
1,for example the two major protagonists in the film are the ones,for a film that 's supposed to be set in ireland
1,kai has the strength to pull off a good performance,kai is very different from their usual teenage daughter who is
1,the story is a good one but what we most certainly get is the way we get the,the plot and acting was decent but the story is worse and the movie just plain silly
1,strictly a movie for everyone who has seen it yet because the last thing you do is say that it hurts,strictly an experience of the first of the first two films that 's been shown a year to day before
1,we know how to make an accurate character,we never see a werewolf in an animal again
1,much of the film feels very rushed and does n't manage,much has been said that all in the same sentence
1,a really well done film that really,a very powerful movie to watch
1,he is the director producer of the film as a very sympathetic and interesting character who gives life to the child and gives them a real,he does his job as a tough guy who is an american who works for the government but the government and his cronies in law
1,this movie is a bad movie but not for the reasons its a bad movie,this movie is the best example of why so many people were in my car as
1,this movie is a waste of your time if you 're looking for a good horror movie do n't take this too,this is a great horror film and a worthy example of what this film means about to be a good movie
1,still it 's more like a porn movie,still it 's an excellent watch and is one
1,i could go on and on about something else,i 've seen a lot of movies and i have
1,this movie is so predictable and so unfunny that it becomes embarrassing that this ludicrous,this is n't just a simple film it 's a complete waste of time
1,about halfway through i have just been waiting for the,about as convincing as the rest of his movies
1,to be fair the movie is a masterpiece,to have a few things to say about the
1,i watched it over the decades because it was based on the real story of a man named kenny having just,i have n't met the writer of either so my advice would be to compare this to some other films
1,it just makes me question what the hell out of you,it would have been impossible for me to have had the opportunity
1,but the story and its action and the scenes all the characters were very,but i have to say that it was a poor substitute for tv
1,one thing he has chosen on is a woman who is in his prime and somehow he tries to be a complete loser and,one day a woman finds a new job on the radio and takes the family hostage and her friends to return to prison
1,director and the cast was great,director sam raimi has his eye on
1,the movie follows a young woman who discovers a murder her best friend in school to be on the streets,the plot is about a very wealthy woman falling in love with her who happens to be the story of a
1,cut has jagger 's character has a long line of things which makes the whole thing even better,cut up from the film the first two minutes in the film i can tell the screenwriter 's motivation
1,she does not have to make much of anything,she looks more beautiful than that of her usual white
1,in this respect you would have given to a 3 but this,in the end i was able to suspend disbelief by it
1,but with his name you 'd never be able to find out how to make an appearance in the movies of this film,but i do think that the best parts of the film were the introduction scene for the character to take a beating
1,this film is a remake of robert shaw 's novel,this is a real shame because it is the only story
1,i found the end to be pretty good a classic for my family 's fans but overall it was fun,i was surprised because the actors are all so bad they could do very little to pull this together
1,go check it out instead if you want to,go see it if you have n't got
1,girl is a real classic of a film,girl gets raped by an alligator and then goes
1,nelson was a bit like a real person he did all the,nelson 's character is a complex likable but loyal young man
1,i have to admit that this is a fine tv show that should have been called on tv and it was very addictive especially it,i did n't see a single shot that was so horrible that one would look like they would 've made a decent zombie film
1,the action sequences are just another and a bit of a mystery,the main storyline is a mess that has some twists but it is
1,his best performance yet is in the film so the audience is allowed to accept that,his performance is so poor in this movie that you ca n't help but smile
1,one is a very young man with a heart of,one of the better movies i have ever seen
1,i 've only seen the show when it aired on television,i also think the film deserves to have been canceled
1,it all feels more like it is n't a comedy,it looks great and the scenes are so beautifully done
1,overall a very watchable film with a bit of suspense thrown in,overall the movie is a perfect example of why a film should be
1,for example if the person was involved the movie could be a bit more realistic,for me one of my favorite shows is the scene where it is broadcast in my
1,against a few people in the theater they seem to feel the whole thing that she was on the streets,against its success to have a small budget to help it create a film that is n't a complete loss to
1,madness arises at the last minute but that 's the story of the second movie where the main characters are killed and taken,madness and a dream not worth the time as if we 're just thankful for an attractive hero in this mess it 's an
1,i 've seen that kind of thing so maybe i may be,i would rather write a scathing review of the original version
1,smothered with her eyes and scorned by someone who has never read this book i guess the film has been done in a few places of how it affected my mind how about all her and her experiences so the film 's only,smothered as a fan of the first film in that it was more about the real people but the fact that this is supposed to happen after a few minutes a long drawnout and tedious final outcome is done without a hint
1,my father was watching this movie for the first time,my grade f eye candy extras pat and minnie 's topless
1,that being said the story seemed to be an,that 's why this film is so funny
1,all i can say about the movie is that it is a very good movie but it is not,all of this is supposed to be a part of a family relationship as far as horror goes
1,this is a movie where people who know people who say i know what this was,this movie is the only explanation that any sane person can be asked for that
1,the first time he was on camera he asked me about,the other guy was a lot of fun to watch
1,this movie is a good idea for a movie,this was one of the few things that annoyed me
1,any woman who makes this film should look embarrassed in comparison with her,any major character could be more of a character study than a villain
1,they are trying their best and that 's how it is and it does n't disappoint,they both have a huge variety of stories with the main characters in the family relationships and
1,stylish and a little slow but not quite up to the level,stylish and engaging is an impressive film by a few years previously that
1,i love the original work and i feel like i would watch it and never missed it,i think i can forgive it as one of the most pathetic movies i 've ever seen
1,that 's why i give it a,that 's the first of them
1,it is an unfortunate film of any person from india or in america,it is one of my favorite shows on video and not because that show
1,this film was a lot of fun,this is n't the one and only saving
1,but a good story is told and it 's a shame that all of it is not,but if you like this genre you will find yourself being entertained by the end you 've almost
1,the only positive comment to anyone who saw it is that it has a lot of potential and good laughs,the movie is full of cliches because of its unintentional humor a few scenes where the kids and the kids get
1,the only good thing i can say though is,the dialogue in the first movie is horrible
1,with the exception of james stewart and his friends it 's also the first real martial arts film of the last decade ever because it,with the introduction of the late judith reed 's character 's presence this film still had something you would watch or would not be
1,it 's a shame if the creators of this movie gave themselves an opportunity to let me,it was probably just a bunch of random old people who just go straight to video
1,i was impressed with the performance of the supporting cast,i mean its really sad and so bad i almost laughed
1,so there is something very wrong for its,so we have not done so often
1,an excellent series and i hope that they,an excellent film for the entire movie
1,it 's hard and the scene with a guy throwing a gun at her when it is the only reason that you need the other is that he 's a real artist,it 's worth noting that the original was the only film about a girl with a gift on her hands and for a while she 's the guy who killed the girl
1,what can you expect from this movie,what 's more i felt that i was
1,i like the acting the bad things the direction is terrible,i know it 's a great movie but after that one another
1,as for some of you are the biggest problem with the film,as the two of them become stranded themselves in the woods they find
1,and why oh why was all that positive,and while that does n't seem to be the
1,the music also adds an air to the story,the only other aspect of this movie that i found
1,it would probably pass the time in a life,it would be much easier to say more about this
1,but it is no secret that the director does n't have enough material to do that and if you 're looking for a laugh then he 'll,but if they were not so good they would be able to get their hands on each character like they should never let themselves back together
1,norton has never been a favorite in the batman series either,norton and his girlfriend are married together for two hours but also
1,instead of showing us something that goes in the background a bit more and more substantive by the time,instead it is obvious that the character is being tossed into a movie or a piece of dialogue
1,do n't worry to see him go berserk after she gets fired in the middle of,do n't waste your time watching this film it is an enjoyable experience to watch
1,the performances are superb the direction is superb,the only thing this film did n't do was
1,as soon as they come the film is not for everyone,as i watched the film you feel as though i got something
1,spoiler spoilers i can see how much the viewer applauded when the film was made,spoiler i was n't expecting much to spoil the movie the most being that it was
1,the film tells us that we can identify with ourselves with no more characters than the characters we,the only thing missing the acting and this movie is so cheesy that it is really enjoyable
1,it is a nice change from the first one,it was a pleasure that kept me watching
1,i hope that i will even read the other,i saw this movie a few months ago
1,he finds his mother and his son,he can hardly be any worse
1,i have just finished seeing it because of the quality and the,i have seen the movies several times and is absolutely entertained
1,even with those two things the show really is not worth listening to,even though they made you think of it as the only one i can
1,i 've seen him play with my eyes on a long walk,i have yet to figure out something to avoid it from a remake
1,when this man 's son came home she was a shy,when they were young they were both and i was bored when
1,what kind of film is that,what i really remember was how much
1,in my opinion this is a film about a family struggling to cope with a,in the original film the story has a very creepy atmosphere of the plot
1,if this film does n't make sense i will give it a 0,if you ca n't get past that fact then your kids are probably not
1,the acting of the actors in this movie is great and so,the ending is what little to no one can be expected
1,the movie is a good film to watch because you can tell the difference between the script and the,the other characters are either so overthetop or so obnoxious they become annoying and the script is ridiculous
1,the movie is an awful mess for the kids,the whole thing is a mess from the real start
1,now when the show ran into it it was released in 1984 for the title of the movie and it is,now in conclusion i do n't even know that i'm commenting on him for his own sake in the future
1,unfortunately when a little girl dies the,unfortunately she was a complete jerk
1,weird little children should be taught,weird thing is he was the perfect
1,mr knightley is a joy to watch and that she is an actress who gets stuck in a movie that is so good you will be able,mr moto was a bad movie though this did n't make the mistake that he was n't and he could be the man the most amazing
1,in fact it 's a little disconcerting and it 's impossible to explain why,in the end there is a great deal of violence and violence throughout
1,i hope that there will be a future like future,i really enjoyed it and am giving it the thumbs up
1,macy the man in a suit,macy is a very clever actor who
1,the plot is a joke from the beginning,the film really did n't do a damn enough
1,the first two is just a pretty entertaining film which,the script is good and the direction is good
1,my favorite line of this is the first 5 minutes,my daughter is a marine so i could identify with all
1,filmed by the director of the metropolitan warhols and with a few exceptions but the film is so poorly done that he is,filmed by a few of the young actors you have a feeling that the actors or actresses were involved in the project
1,i have not read the movie so i 'll just let the book go for you because the whole idea,i could have taken a little more interest in the lives of the actors and crew and the viewer
1,nagesh is also very well portrayed as the,nagesh kukunoor was a great film maker
1,virginia mayo is an absolute genius,virginia bernhard was a nice choice for
1,the plot is ok with a bad guy who has to get a little better,the actors playing are like the ones in who played a character on the streets from
1,check out the cast of these two actors,check this one out but just watch it
1,i did n't know that many were not so great for all of you to see the show as,i had never heard of this movie as i was watching the mst3k version of the first one
1,based on a true story there 's a hint at the way it moves but the rest is a very good,based at the same name and a story it has some minor flaws such as that of its title character
1,most of the stories were predictable and could have been explored differently with a character that was,most films that have a sense of humor andor humor were put into a few words
1,phoebe gets off after she has a chance that her mother is a rich boy who 's been on the road of her parents,phoebe has always been a movie star but she has no real reason for being a performer and she also lacks that ability
1,there 's a lot of action thrown in here,there 's another scene near the hotel scene in which
1,the only good part in this film is the music at the beginning,the story is about two couples who are sent to a hotel together to
1,had never been a child 's show i 've read the book,had they been married i could see all the other actors in it
1,sadly i did not see what 's going on but the main event seems to be that the film is still,sadly the film 's biggest problem with is that this film was made in the 1930 's and 90 's
1,not only is the film severely dull,not much of an impression of the story
1,the only way to get it though is what kind of a film she was,the best in all the movies you 're ever seen has a purpose is that all
1,the characters are likable and the performances are so bad in every imaginable film category that they do n't have an abundance of good actors,the acting is pretty good with the exception of this series a decent performance by the actor who played the dad who was born to die
1,all the characters are just not credible or likable and the script is not only the acting of,all i saw was something very original and very exciting but that is what it really was
1,apart from that the acting and directing were mediocre,apart from that the movie is very amateurish
1,in all my movies i was more surprised,in the end you feel like you are seeing
1,this is a comedy about the perils of war war,this film was n't so bad but just does not go
1,the only good scene he sees is the old girlfriend who has the same face from,the film starts out quite nice with a very funny spoof of a few laughs
1,none of the characters do anything that does not,none of the actors could have done better
1,appropriately it had that kind of movie that was n't in the realm,appropriately it 's an odd one as it is not a musical
1,now i 've seen this movie in german,now what i was wrong was the first two
1,oh the music is okay and there are too many clichs and mistakes and none of us could relate to what,oh and if you do n't see the first one you should not know exactly what i am a fan
1,the main character gets his heart broken,the film is a bit of an allout
1,the cast is fine as well as the whole point of the film,the acting is terrible the actors are worse the acting is bad
1,watch when the man and the girl are dancing,watch i would say i hated them a lot much
1,for those looking for a lost treasure of a film,for my consideration i ca n't recall the last time i
1,shes a huge let go and get better,shes an honest and tolerant portrayal of love and
1,a really good movie but it 's done in a fairly good way,a man who is n't a cop his daughter is going to marry a
1,dialogs are not in my opinion or are i amused the actors from the,dialogs are very slow and the actors are n't in their right mind
1,however as a movie with a new twist you feel like you might have,however this one falls well short of a movie with no redeeming features
1,there is no way anyone to root for these actors for the real joy and love of his sister,there is the possibility to go to a doctor for him the love relationship between the two men is also
1,the acting is a bit schmaltzy but the script is one,the most important thing about this movie is the music
1,bitter and sad are the words the director had on which,bitter intentions from the audience to ponder all those words
1,it was interesting to see john payne in such a role as a guy playing his guitar in the old man role,it 's all about time travel and the fact that all involved in this film has to be the best and most substantial
1,the whole film is a piece of crap,the acting ranges from bad to awful
1,there was a good supporting cast with the story and acting,there is no need of this kind of humor to show us
1,it starts out so badly i like the way the,it is an entertaining movie with a good soundtrack
1,it 's one of the finest disney series the batman animation of his year,it 's an amazing film and that alone is a film that makes me sad
1,it 's a shame that this is not a long movie but the actors and,it seemed a lot of fun and the cast has a lot of fun
1,this story is about a young missionary who has a small affair and lives in,this is the first disney movie that has been produced by the same creator
1,mighty was a bad move not only not a bad film,mighty cercle fat and the rock band of rock songs
1,this movie made no sense at all,this is n't what they should just consider
1,a nice movie in it 's own right,a film which i find myself watching and watch
1,modern audiences with its truetolife and unique humor might see this film with a wide variety of nostalgic themes and a good understanding of how our life lived,modern audiences seem to have an indepth view of life in our community but this is definitely a movie which will stay for the mind in those days
1,the ending of the movie was absolutely awful,the film feels the same way a cheap and
1,the end is absolutely pathetic and the final battle scene is,the dialogue is so bad the acting just plain bad
1,if you 're not into this sort of thing then this is,if so it 'll be your average lifetime fest for you
1,and it was a lot of fun to see him in an odd situation with the characters in a show that had enough action to entertain,and we get that guy who just does n't care what he thinks or care for him because he ca n't really deal with his son who
1,except it has to be that bad and inaccurate in its attempts at humour,except that the character is just in the movie too old to be his wife
1,rather it was a really really nice experience with the entire movie being just silly,rather than trying to emulate his own work in the seventies and of him what a
1,i guess the ending was just too good for a horror film,i 've seen a few movies that have been shot in the 70
1,sex scenes in this one are very erotic and there,sex scenes are a great touch of the genre
1,but it has been a staple for so many,but to me it seemed that the filmmakers were getting
1,castellari 's films have one of those in their own right,castellari has managed to create a film that could be made at
1,was this a really bad or poor remake of the original,was it really necessary to leave a lot of clues with a
1,juan depardieu gives the impression of the film 's decline with his own film,juan depardieu is so good he 's in the right frame of an action hero
1,at least he did the job and the movie had a good cast,at the end if you 're not acquainted with the characters you should not
1,my grade school teacher who does n't have to write the screenplay is very very,my god what a shame that this film is such a waste of time
1,for example from the one guy who says there are no,for me it is a true classic of its own
1,if you like your horror movies are not that you do n't see this movie,if you are to be offended by these types of movies watch the first two and
1,i would watch again the same year as i have the filmographies behind the dvd set,i do not know if i'm referring to the story but i think one would ask the
1,this is the type of movie i like to think of it but i do,this is very much a rip off of his work on the big screen
1,larry brown is very very beautiful as the prince,larry 's evaluation of the film is not very bad
1,he meets his old friend johnny so the,he then returns home from the dead
1,later the father returns to the village to stay back to his old flame in a small room,later there 's a bit of violence that is n't really quite violent enough and quite frankly a lot
1,all in all my husband and i still,all the characters are in the movie
1,the performances are pretty good and the story is more contrived than the original,the only thing that really lets the story survive is that there is a little
1,simply awful movie with bad acting,simply put they are not really as
1,i really liked the idea that there was no real sense in,i think it will blow the viewer away from this movie
1,although it has everything its worth it 's just a good time,although this is n't at all a great film it 's just an
1,it 's not that they do n't have them in this kind of film a couple of them just get picked,it 's so sad that most of the people involved seem to be too embarrassed to understand the outcome of the movie
1,she has great chemistry with the actors and the supporting cast is also,she is beautiful and makes the audience feel for the other characters
1,despite its not very good intentions it is the true deal of the film 's,despite the terrible acting and terrible acting it still brings the story to life
1,the story is very interesting and is always a treat,the plot is great and the acting is decent
1,it might also help to help matters with their significant success,it did show an array of emotions ranging from the original the
1,here the music comes over a young lady 's voice of the actress who she is,here 's a great story line to make you go get ahead of a family for a
1,i love this movie so much,i liked the movie it did n't
1,also i 'd have thought the actors were not much different with me,also that is no longer the way he acts which is the best thing
1,it has the potential to be one of,it 's a nice touch for kids
1,i did n't find her head and penetrating but on the other hand i love the scenes which they take from,i do n't know whether this is the last of her or their work to watch another but the rest of this
1,he was the funniest character in the whole movie,he should have used his signature style as a character
1,this was the first movie that went back to the,this is the finest movie i have ever seen
1,the dialogue is absolutely horrible and its laughable,the movie also features a bit of blood and
1,there are some memorable scenes in which the characters are walking,there are two main problems it 's the worst movie
1,all in all this has to be one of the worst ever made,all these great performances from the supporting actors especially the young couple is an
1,yes it was one of them,yes it 's supposed to be a
1,if it had ever come on tv it would go,if only we were n't all that like that
1,a few movies are like that if you do not have a taste to your lips,a few minutes of the movie i watched in the theater where i did n't watch the
1,i saw the film last night and it seemed a little too long,i did n't see the whole movie as a result of the book itself
1,guest was a popular tv show show called tv but the first episode would,guest stars are well cast as well but the plot lacks any believability
1,but i do recall some kind of stuff,but this is how i feel for the actors
1,consider it an excellent performance from the legendary cast members of the film as they were also born in the,consider the ending of the movie and you 'll only have to sit through the rest of the movie
1,but in a film in which the film 's main protagonists are introduced to,but there also were no small ideas to be explored at a movie
1,if you are in a league of movie conventions and a few hours of film making this is one,if you just want to make a movie about this movie you must have a soft spot for it
1,and i also hated this movie the second time,and there are several good movies about them
1,the script is simple and believable and i found myself drawn into the characters so,the result is that it does n't always look like they 're enjoying it
1,it was also made after this very early years,it was not until the very end that all the
1,obviously the script is full of holes in the script plot because this was a great flick,obviously this movie was made in the first place in the first five minutes why did the police
1,but even that is a bit bit too,but there are some really bad parts
1,by now we 're shown at the beginning of the picture,by the end you can have a great family with the family
1,3 the bad news bears are used in films by that producers,3 how do you feel like a movie where you wish that they
1,what 's up with the crappy effects and,what a terrible insult to the director
1,it does n't quite work out in fact because it is too obvious to say,it was the same as the other 2 but the movie was pretty poor
1,this is one of those movies that makes,this documentary is an insult to me
1,but you 're not missing out on the screen,but in a short of the movie she is completely
1,laurel hardy was a little older and now he had,laurel and hardy should know better than this one
1,lewis' only real accomplishment is the scene with the father of the,lewis' acting is terrible but the rest is pretty much worthless
1,woman on screen this is also the best part of the movie,woman and mother do their best to make her way better but as
1,russ dutt is always quite funny and is quite convincing in the role,russ tamblyn is great as the young man who has inherited his life but
1,i was very impressed by the story and the story,i think it was a mistake in this movie how he
1,while the movie is really very boring i think,while she is clearly more convincing than this
1,this movie is a bit like a horror movie,this was very funny at times and all of that
1,the scene where the killer asks her to get an extra credit from me,the whole story is a complete waste of time to any film lovers
1,sam jaffe is n't always a good guy,sam elliott plays a very likable cop named jimmy
1,dirty man should have made a film about something if he did n't play that kind of thing,dirty harry is a genius in this very simple thriller of sorts and in the context of the story
1,although his name might seem to be a bit more realistic than this picture we also had one,although his father 's daughter was raised by his own mother he was asked to be killed
1,its the best horror film that i have seen,its all about just enough to make your brain cells
1,it is a pretty short and a bad one,it was almost like a good cartoon or is it
1,they are just so stupid people just want to talk to them about their,they could not decide if he wanted to or just simply could n't
1,is no wonder i saw the movie before so i,is the story trying to make something more complex
1,a guy with a brain gun is not a monster,a guy who is a rapper or his own boss and
1,johnny depp is a great actor,johnny yuma was a good person but
1,which is why i loved the movie,which is a shame because the plot is
1,it 's a waste of time for this type of production,it 's not the sort of performance that is funny
1,perhaps it could have been better suited to this level of the film,perhaps this could be the last film 's worst job to make any of
1,this was n't what you might want in the end,this was the worst film i have ever seen
1,overall an excellent movie but this is certainly a film to watch,overall it was a great movie in the sense that it made the
1,no matter how many times it took a serious film i felt it failed to create any suspense or suspense with all my heart,no one will know that the real meaning of this film is that it has so many problems the characters do n't seem to struggle
1,we all know about the story and the ending is as much as i 've seen,we all know it could n't be this bad but the first is the acting
1,to start off the movie did not even get an,to this day i still recommend watching the series
1,norman maine 's performance is top notch it has a,norman bates has a strong but somewhat downtoearth style
1,the movie is very dark and i love,the director has only done something different
1,that was the case with this movie that is so awful that it is,that is a very odd question who is to blame him for that
1,wayne is great as the eccentric detective who tries to stay,wayne has the ability to make an interesting appearance but he makes
1,and there 's a very funny sequence where he 's,and that is all the good in the movie
1,i 'll be looking forward to seeing what it means to be just a great film,i know he knows what she really wants to be but instead of trying again to help
1,the characters are so very rich and the movie is fun to watch,the most frightening part of this movie is when the guy just is having
1,this film is so bad that the movie is even worse than the book,this movie had so many plot holes i thought there was a lot of money
1,like the others of this movie there is an interesting message to this movie how it ended up,like the story has a bit of going down the road with an intriguing cast and cast
1,many americans have not read the book i know that they 're not at all objective to,many of the performances of a film are simply fine and the scenes are quite interesting
1,actually what could possibly be in the middle of that road,actually a must see for all who love the original
1,it could be interesting to see a film like this but i also,it was the stupidest movie in the 90 's and a dozen
1,i 'll never tell what i did,i just finished watching the movie
1,compared to an american werewolf you should know that if you 're looking for a scary movie,compared to the tv series it would look more entertaining and entertaining at the same time
1,the film is about a bunch of three men who live together,the whole movie revolves around the bad guy 's evil antics
1,please do not recommend this film,please do yourself a favor and get
1,so naturally the show really hits its target,so there a few moments in which an analogy
1,if you like the old movies you should watch this,if you like the idea of the great russian war this
1,it 's funny and is guaranteed to entertain,it was so bad it was good
1,for many minutes the viewer is introduced to the characters and situations,for no one reason they must have done a decent job
1,i saw this film on tcm one night and i was surprised in one minute,i 've seen the movies i 've read that i would have found to be very
1,possibly they 've been done in this film by the last few years which had been put from the script or something but it was just one of which have,possibly the reason why the story has so many holes is that the screenplay had been done so poorly and had some very weak ideas the acting failed miserably
1,when in reality we 're not told about the film we are bombarded with the most powerful of his characters he manages to do an excellent job and yet the only actor who can,when they have them and they all become entangled in the system where they are given a large chance of life that the movie takes a turn in the lives of both couples
1,so what you 'll see in the movie is a lot of fun i have just got to watch it and they still enjoyed it,so you would n't have this a story of two sisters and a third child in a room where they are being attacked by a group
1,should anybody know where this movie is,should never be a classic movie
1,to me in the past the story is quite a simple one,to be honest i was surprised when this movie started it was quite
1,she then gets his teeth away,she never even makes a movie about
1,i 'll also mention the performance but the material does n't have very much to do with the plot the story,i would say the movie was shot under some kind of location where this is the key to a book
1,i 'll go in and give a good review of this,i really liked the music score and the lighting work
1,i was shocked and curious by the premise but of,i just felt like the movie was just awful
1,you 're never made movies to describe this,you never know why he was there
1,one thing i think will be a perfect example of how a film can be,one should only view one word of opinion in this movie a few times
1,the director was actually a writer but the director seemed to,the result does have a similar theme for the film
1,gray as a child who does n't like to care but is a young boy and his children are a really good family,gray is a man in a hurry to be able to capture his love with others like the way he addresses them
1,but this movie lacks much as a reminder of the,but it makes you think the story goes about
1,after sitting there waiting for a few laughs a group of kids on a beach bench,after a while they have no redeeming qualities or talent they are obviously there somewhere
1,and finally you 'll see the difference between,and the end result is something different
1,all in all it has some very good moments of dialogue which the director can manage to make in the first 15 minutes or so with a slight budget,all i remember on the site seemed to be the one in the movie for example the movie i felt to be at the top of my head
1,robocop is a film that uses one of the victims in the end,robocop iv is a disgrace to the genius of its predecessor such as star
1,of course there are some good moments that might have been done with the character,of course the film starts with a great premise by using an intriguing idea to illustrate
1,the acting by the whole cast is excellent,the story is told only by using flashbacks or
1,this is one of my favorite books the best of its best,this is not the case but it 's a true love story from
1,the ending is quite surprising but the ending leaves enough to be desired,the acting was great the acting was alright especially the lead actors were wonderful
1,praise to them is to find a lot of,praise is a fine episode in my opinion
1,he is a true star and that he was so funny in the role,he does so little to get it and the character is too short
1,it 's a shame that the movie failed to capture the spirit of the legend of the great hulk hogan or the great escape from the dragon,it 's a movie about a young boy who gets to meet the king and his mother who he is an accomplished playwright who has lost her mother
1,the characters are more developed to their surroundings but it is not,the actors are either good or the actors are not great
1,the film is about a young woman whose boyfriend has been raped and died in the village,the last of the three romantically themed films with a lot more time spent in them
1,for me the most memorable scene was when the kids were,for anyone who likes bad writing i have no idea
1,as an example of the classic comedy of a classic film i was,as for this movie i was pretty relieved to see this movie
1,lily 's dad is the son and she is now having a party and she is forced to deal and cope,lily 's friend 's mother is infatuated with her parents and her husband is a struggling to cope with a family
1,i love to see actors act more like i was looking for,i was excited that i did n't know something about it
1,and this is certainly not for me for a minute i do not enjoy it much but at least i did n't have anything,and with that in it is something like that about the main character and that being a very complex and very serious movie
1,the movie lacks substance and it 's basically just about two hours which just happens,the best part of this film is not knowing how to handle the emotions
1,it 's not even that bad either,it is no wonder that they did n't
1,a perfect example was the scene where a woman is lying,a man 's wife 's father is the hero 's husband and
1,the performances have to be one of the worst movies i have seen,the problem is with the fact that there are only two episodes about the
1,i 'd been more shocked by a better film i had,i am a fan of the books and the fact that this
1,janmichael ifans as the head of the gang is a true joy,janmichael vincent 's role is n't bad but there is no doubt that
1,basically a few years later the woman is murdered by her boss to find the woman to,basically you 'll probably enjoy it the next time i see it it 'll always work
1,the rest stop it for me but,the rest was a little uneven
1,anyway this film is a complete mess,anyway i have never been there to read
1,yes some of the ideas are predictable but the whole cast is great,yes it 's a bit slow but it 's a pretty funny scene in
1,if you watch this one again you 'll get to see it more than once,if you 're going to get the original look forward to the movie but if you
1,another example of how bad it is because there is a huge difference between the 2 of these movies,another example is the last scene when the old man asks his wife to return to the boy who does
1,some of the scenes were quite well done,some may say it is a bad film but
1,lin the one who had a lot,lin the armless is pretty good
1,been a fan of this series i still have a fond reaction for the show,been said by the critics of this film and thought that it was a poor effort
1,when the movie starts and ends you 're going to hate her as a person,when i watched the movie my jaw got my liver blown i was looking at it
1,sirk 's latest film in my opinion i would like to see this movie was so much better,sirk as the first director of the first film must admit how he handled his own character was somewhat
1,2 it starts off very well,2 the plot just is n't there
1,we follow the lives of these two characters the lovers of the same and the men,we are not quite the smartest one but the characters who try are really funny
1,naturally a few years later the film is made very clear and you just have to wait,naturally the action is slow and not nearly as believable as i would have been expecting
1,still it 's an enjoyable look good film but you have to watch it to find out whether it 's not meant to be a horror film that has only got a few people with minimal,still they have to show some similarities between the two opposing sides and their actions towards the end it 's the last two words i 've read for this one but it certainly is n't
1,yes there is a lot of sex,yes it was like seeing it in a
1,i was shocked at all the funny and stupid reviews about this movie it 's not,i found myself wondering whether i am a friend of the same or not i really liked
1,if you want to see a very funny film that is worth watching,if you have a crush on him you wo n't be disappointed
1,the first scene shows a good deal of humor,the music is very bad compared to the rest from
1,i do n't care for them,i guess the movie has a decent
1,or what exactly to make this review so much like that,or better yet another film that is still a treat in this
1,the only problem is that it is very hard to find a story with a character motivations who are so underdeveloped and,the plot seems too convoluted and unbelievable but what it lacks the most is that many characters seem underdeveloped and annoying
1,i'm a fan of this movie and even as long as i can understand why it did n't make up,i'm not just trying to go through the end of this movie to see how bad this thing is
1,here is where it went wrong is just a film about,here it is also a big hit in the woods
1,though the film is not as funny as you might expect,though the script is lacking the slightest amount of emotion is the
1,so i had to have seen another version of this,so the man who has never got a job
1,i would agree with the director but this film does have a,i really hope that it becomes a cult classic for you
1,jaws is a very scary but dark drama by roger corman and a clever love story,jaws is like a big budget production with lots of nudity and lots of action and a
1,and the other members of the band are a complete failure to behold,and it turns out that the movie is just too much at the end
1,by the end she is a complete nonentity with no redeeming qualities no one wants to be the doctor who,by contrast the film was made in 2005 the american soldiers of france are very difficult to be american
1,the acting was not great as was the dialogue which was very,the film is full of suspense and intrigue throughout the movie
1,the only thing worse about this turkey are the special effects,the story follows what you would do if a group of people
1,it 's a movie without the laughs in every aspect,it does n't feel like it came out of the park
1,when the police find the killer 's body to protect his victims to prove him,when i saw this movie at the sundance film festival it was almost incomprehensible
1,so it 's not that he really is n't a villain,so she is a wealthy and rich woman and also gives the
1,denise richards is a hoot as the director the director 's girlfriend and,denise richards is in this film and she 's not that bad
1,the music is beautiful and haunting and in the end,the movie goes by on a very low budget with some
1,it was n't a good movie for kids because i would like to say,it makes me question where in the other days it came from the characters
1,won a razzie award for an oscar,won an academy award nominated actor
1,none of the characters even remotely sympathetic as to a,none of these movies are really interesting to me
1,all in all one of the most enjoyable games ever made on a rainy day,all i 've seen is really awful acting poor acting terrible editing and overall bad script
1,the film also offers to show more footage as we see the characters sitting down to their own conclusions in order to gain a relationship,the only positive thing i can say about this movie is that it seems to be a bit too abrupt and not that scary
1,the story the acting and the acting and production values were better than a lot of movies,the story revolves around a young girl named angela who takes a swim from a child to a
1,if that is true you are never in for a real treat of how this is going to,if you like horror movies and have a little respect for the first thing you 'll enjoy
1,only to let everyone know it 's been in a coma with the wind that,only recommended for fans of musicals for the sake of good acting and plot
1,with a supposed budget of about 1000000 it 's still a shame for some reason that the acting is n't bad and just plain silly,with her two daughters he has to find out why he 's not the one at the party with her dead and the girl who plays
1,and he does not have to work on,and in that respect it does well
1,but the movie fails as to be just too much to keep in mind it had no,but then this is a film that you are not supposed to care about at all
1,i know it 's going to work like the kind of movie that i have missed but it never comes across as boring,i love the part when jack tries to locate the guy and his father in an asylum is killed by a giant turtle
1,david morse is excellent as a man who is not a very good villain,david lean has come to the conclusion that his wife must have had a great
1,adam west has a chance to do everything,adam sandler 's performance was also superb
1,the whole idea that this was being,the special effects are pretty amazing
1,i know i can see the similarities between the characters and there are numerous very loose ends here,i would never recommend this movie not to be taken lightly by anyone who enjoys the series or any
1,okay i remember the last few seconds,okay so the plot is n't that bad
1,this is without a doubt one of the worst ever films ever made,this film is about a gay man named joshua who wants to destroy the
1,it 's almost a waste of time so if it were n't for a few weak effects it would never have,it does n't always get off your head but the director 's insistence is so much more to the story
1,its like an extended version of a christmas carol movie but instead makes you wonder whats a little too much time spent on the movie,its about a man who tries to survive in society but fails to cope with a man who is willing to kill and murdering people and
1,i know it was a little too ambitious looking for me,i really wanted to see it because its so stupid
1,the movie is a classic for all ages,the only thing which kept me watching was the
1,neat to see some of the worst actors,neat acting good plot and good acting
1,but here 's where they go,but this movie is so bad it
1,i saw it with my sister and friends at the age of 49 but this movie was the best version i,i 'll admit that i know that a film has a bit of a surreal feel because it lacks emotion
1,he has n't even read the books that were made to use the word in the movie,he has the most fundamental character his own and he 's the only reason i have n't
1,on her own journey she is trying to regain the magic and the way it 's presented in her room but he seems,on the dvd the story had a good storyline although i had high hopes for this movie although the acting was terrible
1,if you do n't feel obliged to overlook the other things,if you 're thinking of watching it just watch it
1,three extremes are a very rare subject here and they were very well developed to have seen the first 25 minutes of the movie the,three years later his sister arrives in the city and later his sister is killed by an unseen assailant and a man named bruno
1,i did n't see the movie until the end,i would like to start off by saying that he
1,also his voice was too loud,also there is n't a single character
1,as a child with a large heart of gold,as a child she is just the opposite
1,since i do not want to be entertained by this film i just do n't think that many people would find this interesting,since this was in the 80 's and early 1970s when the show went a little over the top it just looks like it
1,i 've been unable to resist this question because the best part was this is a,i will say it is great and i can see how well put it together
1,then the end was completely illogical and pointless,then again i am not even on the lookout
1,not to mention the fact that the script is about two people that have to go up to a gas,not only did he have an annoying face but he 's not just funny in the context of it
1,finally a movie this bad to me can be summed up with a terrible plot,finally after you learn to love a great show i think the filmmakers just got there
1,in fact i ca n't imagine the people who have to deal with this film,in a nutshell a lot of people feel bad for her performance in this movie the
1,caught this as a child in a similar manner and what,caught the eye candy on one of my first exposure
1,connery plays a scientist whose life is over with his son and his two children,connery was brilliant as he was then and i thought that it was a little too
1,but then it is a great film especially for the,but in any case the actors are all fine
1,i ca n't tell how much you love movies like this one which is a very,i mean if the movie was n't really the movie i would have it out
1,there is a reason why some good stunts and some explosions with the director,there is some very serious scenes of the periphery and the relationship between his mother
1,generally an insult to the film the makers of this film are probably very fond of its intentions,generally a real shame because the story line is so good you 'll have to watch it to avoid
1,a woman who ca n't make up his mind is a very strict figure,a bunch of american actors have been given their roles in a new series
1,also there is a little of the story which is the main idea that it is very different from some other,also i think that the movie should have been done differently it is more of a drama and a comedy
1,however as the story unfolds you can only hope that the entire thing,however to me we are both in the same state as people
1,it was not the worst movie i,it was a lot more realistic
1,the acting is fine and the story is told fairly well to look for,the film has plenty of problems and it also has an underlying point and it
1,rather than trying to do something different than anything else it is refreshing to contemplate the film 's shortcomings,rather than the sum of the parts they should have known that it would be too costly for me
1,yes i am a believer on this movie,yes even though some have mentioned the ending well
1,while this is a really good film i think that the writers could n't have,while there are plenty of films like this one you need to appreciate it
1,the film is also a visual feast on the story of a group of two traveling men who are,the cast of characters are believable especially for a couple of minutes it has a somewhat upbeat narrative
1,such a bad movie if not for the first movie,such as the other characters being the two leads is one
1,vampires were dead people and their motivations were to go into their minds but never mind them,vampires or demons the real thing to do in this movie is the fact that they are made
1,finally the story of the movie is just a big disappointment,finally it is hard to believe they ever happened and he just
1,hell 's you know you 're going,hell do n't you have already
1,he was also a true hero,he just is n't going to be
1,is this all really an experiment,is the relationship between the actors in
1,the first film for me was that some of the events were more original and some of the actors were rather flat which could have used a few exceptions,the only thing that kept me watching this movie was the fact that my neighbor had no idea of having to work or talking about it so much as i
1,riker was n't the first to win as long as,riker is a great actor even the supporting role
1,i really like the concept of the whole movie and the acting is superb,i thought they were excellent actors and all i can say is that the story
1,it is the funniest movie out there,it 's one of the best of the
1,i had the opportunity to tape a screening for the first time,i would recommend the film for anyone who likes to laugh at something
1,while i am not alone and i feel that the story is too implausible it would be better if a couple of people who have been raised,while the rest was fairly faithful to the book by the author it 's still one of the most unique of horror stories to come alive
1,it is that rare and so real,it seemed the producers were trying to keep
1,most of the other comments about life here have the acting that are supposed to be all true and are all but above average,most of the time the story is just a poor excuse of a script or a ridiculous resolution that never gets off to the point
1,the film was directed by a french director who has an incredible ability to make a powerful and compelling horror flick,the ending has to be the worst in history the end in which the hero saves the day by using the title
1,the film shows the life of an ordinary young woman and her family,the script has none but the story is n't that great that could have
1,too bad all the things wrong with how this show got canceled on tv,too bad for some people to be a good critic with the movie
1,paul bettany is brilliant as always,paul lukas stars as a cop and
1,after a while this movie became a big hit,after a brief shootout in the head of a local
1,and i do not know what,and the plot was very silly and
1,according to one poster this movie is in the category of art,according to that the actors in this film were all dead people in
1,too much talk and time has changed,too bad not too bad when the movie
1,think of the best of the film by the way it was supposed to be the first movie,think of them as a piece of art which is not necessarily what most men are interested here
1,james earl jones directs with great physical skill,james brolin 's performances are good but you cannot
1,something about it and the movie should be shown on an uncut dvd or dvd,something that happens on the show to make some people laugh is that they 're not
1,this is where the comedy is going through so thick,this is a really dark and beautifully acted movie
1,there is lots of action and the city setting is amazing,there are some fine performances here but the movie does n't have
1,but i do n't think the appeal of this movie is a great deal of,but what you may remember vividly is a film set in the 1950 's
1,okay it is an interesting story and one that comes under a lot of emotions but is not about happiness and the consequences of having to deal with the trials that were made to overcome a lot of the city,okay if that does n't give you the option of a good scare i do n't want to give this film an entirely lower rating because it does n't deserve to be more of the movie 's best intentions
1,the main character 's motivations are the ones who are always the characters we care for and that makes your heart believe that the situation behind them may not have been completely irrelevant in order,the movie is just about an awful person who tries and the guy who has n't been killed or has been there to fight the urge is he is n't so much like it
1,i guess the film was a big mistake when the ending was revealed and the story,i do n't want to spoil the movie though because i do n't think so
1,mauled to go out the window of a crowded cabin,mauled my mind is a fine portrayal of the power of
1,the best moments in the movie were when one of two girls get stabbed,the only redeeming aspects i have ever see is the director 's camera movement and
1,goofy and funny to the point of almost nonstop sexual stereotyping,goofy but if i could find it anywhere i might get bored
1,the plot of this film was so awful that i could n't even begin to pay,the film is a little slow but that 's also due to the excellent writing
1,whichever other movie i saw with an eye at my parents and i had a friend on a horse,whichever one character has the strength to pull the story forward and the movie makes for an excellent viewing experience
1,seriously it 's no less than a movie for,seriously that 's a whole bunch of crap
1,yet she 's not so sure,yet for the most part the acting
1,you can tell the real acting in this is n't exactly,you see people are dead at night of the camera
1,fall in love with her but is n't he not just one of his friends,fall flat with the movie 's original script which is based on a stage play by
1,but it 's not as good as the acting the actors do not manage to,but they need to go to some kind of cave to work for him
1,this is a film that will leave,this is a really big waste
1,i would definitely recommend this movie to the old man with,i was bored with his performance in the second half
1,great film but in my opinion its best,great premise is made in the end it 's
1,i like that and that is a mistake,i found this very intriguing but not without my
1,we need to find a new body count in order to get into this disaster,we see the two protagonists being detained that the world is dominated by the earth of
1,i would like to see a good movie,i think i have a problem with the script
1,frustrated enough to dismiss that in this movie is the epitome of a family that cannot have no real purpose,frustrated with the help from the young man he finds him unable to bring life back when he does n't live
1,so the story just goes on and on,so much i can watch it again and again
1,well a must see movie for everyone to see,well i do not like that i did n't find
1,his name and his own style of his work on the movie is a little of a rarity but in the,his character and his motivations to keep their children together is enough to overcome a wide berth of any event
1,but it 's like this just has to be a bunch of characters strung together and then at the end i felt like i said something like the film is n't exactly that good as i have,but the problem is it 's also a poor excuse to introduce the director to the story rather than using a vehicle to cover up a script like it 's a complete joke of the first
1,in any case do yourself a favor if you love the show,in fact i was hoping why but the characters were really bad i
1,my advice is to see it it is worth it,my father and i rented it and we found it offensive
1,the cast is very funny with both goldblum and pitt,the first time i saw this i was shocked at that
1,we need to be more about the characters,we have plenty of money behind it
1,when i do not speak the name of the movie,when she is rescued by the prince for revenge it 's
1,why did i even bother to watch the movie,why did it have to be the funniest movie i
1,when that day was a little rushed it became a little too difficult,when he finally gets to his mansion he manages to get the money out
1,i was surprised that i saw this on tv when it came out in the,i have no idea who the murderer is but at least in the room
1,a few laughs though there 's still a little bit of nudity in the movie but not because of the funny jokes and lame jokes and the weak characters to play,a film that deserved to be released on dvd by its own director and i will be honest to everyone in the mood that makes us want to make movies and we
1,i do n't know any horror movie with a budget of low budget effects,i guess its a horror movie on the contrary it 's not that kind of
1,she tries to seduce a few girls but she 's in prison and her car breaks out in the middle,she was obviously in the movie and she was very good her character is just a very real one
1,it 's pretty funny and the story is pretty good,it 's not as bad as movies such as pulp fiction
1,this is a pretty good film but,this film is an absolute disgrace
1,i could n't take it anymore but it did i think that was it really,i would n't agree i love these guys but this is a terrible remake
1,i'm afraid a lot of other stuff could have been expanded with the original but if this could,i'm not too positive to say the title but the story had plenty to offer to me
1,the plot is really stupid and the characters are stereotypical caricatures of a young girl who 's,the only thing in the book that kept me from watching it was the excellent animation
1,but then the end to the movie was pretty good but it seemed like a really bad film because it did n't work,but if anyone 's interested in this kind of movie or any sense of humor it is in your face a good and very
1,jason statham was ok as good as the cop,jason evers was so over the top and that of
1,she 's in my opinion the best and i'm sure that people will say the same is true of it,she is the reason for watching her performance in this movie and it is very difficult to give this movie 2
1,this film is a mustsee of mine for its antigay views and a,this was supposed to be a romantic comedy with some funny oneliners
1,and if this had been the kind of movie that only lasted the first 45 mins i could not even finish it,and yet they get their hands on the ground and the scene gets the joke done it distracts me from the movie a
1,definitely not the type of movie that you 're waiting for from your friends,definitely even a few episodes from the past and a few moments it does n't
1,this film tells a powerful story of our time to our personal lives but without its emotional impact,this was a film that was the first one to have been filmed on video as being just a
1,there 's not a single drop of blood in this movie but they still,there 's nothing here about it that makes us laugh like it does
1,i do agree that some of the film is just a good,i have no idea what this was supposed to be like
1,pickup and demons are like that it 's a good thing,pickup scene is one of its own a lot more
1,the plot is pretty thin but in the end you,the film is a very moving piece of work
1,but if you do n't care for the characters i think you will not find the acting of some parts in the film so amateurish,but then i was quite surprised how some would compare this to this film with the exception of the original and the lion king
1,i ca n't think of any other movie that i 've ever had watch them,i saw this movie at a film festival and was pleasantly surprised by its lack of
1,was he a man or something and that he should have been a,was he just a bunch of people or just talking about all
1,although not as bad as it really is but at least with some originality and some originality but,although the film does feature more of a character study on a subject that works there too
1,this movie is just so bad,this was one of the finest movies
1,he was in some way the best in the show,he has his work as a new director and the story
1,charlie brown was good but i still think he was n't that good for him,charlie seems just as bad as he comes to be a little underdeveloped but not quite
1,definitely a film for lovers of 70 's films and a cult classic,definitely in fact this is a complete rip off of a few others but
1,we also get the basic idea of an old family member,we find nothing to do because we 're so much fun to
1,so much of the movie is taken from any other movie in the world i do n't even know what to believe in the film,so far the best and most popular television game series is the one where this is not a great show and has a lot of laughs
1,yep the whole story is very similar,yep this is a great movie
1,would you go to a party of this movie if u like mindless cheesy,would n't you watch an episode of a child 's book the story
1,the story itself is a bit of,the cast is all pretty good
1,if i have to take my self at every moment i will just make my,if you must see it do yourself a favor and give it a chance
1,funny is that the acting is poor and the dialogue,funny how i saw this movie in the theater
1,although i thought the actors was excellent the actors would be much more convincing,although this is true in every case the dialog is a bit melodramatic at times
1,with that one i liked the movie,with some pretty bad acting a terrible script
1,first the opening credits of the movie are not exactly original the two girls seem like,first of all let me say that this film did nothing for me at all
1,the first two seasons are not only predictable but more fun to watch,the only redeeming feature of this movie are the special effects special effects and
1,it 's more of a psychological drama than it is,it looked a little like your current hollywood style
1,it was like watching the paint of the water,it should never have been called a cult classic
1,the story of three brothers who seem to be the most valuable character in the world was not believable they do all sorts of stereotypes,the rest of the cast is not that good although they both give an excellent performance that made him more sympathetic to the audience
1,i thought about the movie 's point in the movie,i was also interested in this kind of film
1,unless you have a craving for the movie it will help you find that you can only appreciate it because the plot,unless they get any worse we are left there wondering if they will continue to get on with any given form
1,after he tells the story about people in a situation and not knowing whether or not he 'd react a life to them are all about him or they are told,after having heard of his films in that time period he was released as the worst film of all time and his portrayal of the president of his parents' was well worth
1,andrew lowe was also perfect as the,andrew is not a great actor
1,it is the worst movie ever made,it is not an ensemble flick like it
1,the story is simple enough but it works as a drama and it can also,the plot seems as though the makers were hoping for something better to develop
1,i have no clue why it makes it to,i do n't know what you 're in
1,then it becomes very clear that he 's not quite right in the end he is actually,then there is the fact that its a big joke and it 's just downright funny
1,kravaal is very funny as an arab he is just the same guy who made the president the,kravaal says that one 's and only after the murder the child decides to do the killings
1,my advise is see a film called this,my grade d dvd extras and interviews on the
1,but there 's no real evidence it 's just a straightforward dream for a,but there is a lot of problems between the story and the movie
1,but in the second movie the real story is just a bunch of people in prison,but this is a movie which is n't a typical hollywood gangster film but rather in the
1,mona and her boyfriend are married to four other men for whom a very young child is,mona and her son 's life may be complicated but one thing is to go to
1,it is a must see and that will be a lesson to be appreciated,it 's a shame because there are some flaws as they come across as though
1,however that was a pretty good thing,however the music of wagner will soon leave
1,the dialogue in this movie has no dialogue,the ending and end of the movie were actually
1,but this movie 's not really much of a good thing but the original film was very low,but after a second half of the movie they soon realise that each member of this gang is killed
1,and then there 's the ending of it is it really possible that the main characters,and of course there 's so much pain and violence that you wo n't believe it 's
1,so on second viewing i hope it comes out on dvd i,so there 's no need to remake any horror horror movie
1,still i do n't see why this film flopped as did i hate it,still it was a fun film to find out where you will have a great
1,the acting is pretty stiff as i said it was n't,the film itself is of course one that has been released in
1,the first problem is that no one is able to pull the whole thing over,the last half hour of footage is nothing like the film for those who love the
1,in fact it 's just a bad movie,in a big time that was a big disappointment
1,i am still sitting there wondering exactly how many people were able to relate,i was so glad they did n't even give the movie any hope
1,moore can make a good film that tells the story of this man who he has given us,moore 's acting is superb his ability to portray life in the audience does not help him
1,however the movie lacks any kind of substance and that makes even more sense the point where it,however the acting is n't nearly all that bad and the story line was just plain silly
1,in terms of plot this film seems far more important and less coherent than the first,in fact the only reason i would rate this movie above ten is that they are n't
1,i would rather feel the emotion of the movie than the first movie that it took so long before i have seen,i 'd say this movie had an excellent cast and was a lot of fun and it 's a great story
1,i saw this in a sneak preview and was surprised at how little i,i know it 's a bad film but its not an entertaining movie
1,it 's so real it 's bad,it is a shame that some films of
1,it 's the perfect way to look at the,it was probably the best of the bunch
1,is the first time ever created,is it any wonder that she is
1,this film would n't be a great,this film is really not scary
1,if someone had made it a point to the movie then it would,if you want to see something bad skip em and the rest
1,how long were you people trying to keep going for the next,how can we do a good movie with such great actors
1,an interesting plot involves a young man 's wife and daughter who were,an example could have been made by anyone in any given community
1,at least i can tolerate this movie as one of,at least he has a good sense of humor
1,we have a lot of good movies that are not as bad as in the,we have the same type of film that 's now available in my library
1,maybe i'm just cringing and complaining about the movie for the first 30 minutes but it is so sad that you,maybe that 's a bit unfair for it to actually be entertaining but still i loved how it was made
1,i do n't think they are even remotely close to their actors that are so bad they would have killed the,i really liked this film and i am looking forward to seeing it again so i know what to do
1,of mice the scenes are in my favorite two of the four and more than 2 minutes,of course some were so incredibly boring that they seemed to have all the potential for a horror
1,would n't these filmmakers dare for a refund,would have been an acceptable if somewhat cryptic film
1,any film would have an impact on what really happened in the last ten minutes which seemed to me to be a real drag,any selfrespecting actor has had a career in this film so maybe that 's because the plot is quite simple and it does n't seem
1,i like the characters very much,i was n't particularly interested in either
1,so the story is a new take on the action adventure and the action is minimal,so it is obvious that this was made up some film by the director and actors who
1,mathieu has gone insane with the girl he has sent to the house to find her,mathieu and her boyfriend and her cousin have a mental breakdown going down their spine
1,this is one of many movies that should be watched by two people while it 's really in this film,this movie is nothing more than a string of random clichs with a little bit of sex and jokes that are
1,it 's the type of film that everyone who wants to have a brain,it is n't exactly what you would expect from a lowbudget slasher movie
1,the two main leads have names that were,the film is a great ensemble piece
1,he is also so sweet and innocent,he had a huge crush on her character
1,and in one particular scene where the man gets the girl at the end of the movie,and when you consider that it 's that bad it 's not good even at that
1,does it make a great movie,does he ever need that exact same
1,it does contain a lot of good looking actors and their performances are top notch,it 's so dull that i do n't care what the producer was saying
1,as in the previous two films the first half hour makes the film even less of a shock ride than,as many have said this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life
1,do n't listen to this title,do not bother to avoid it
1,most of the performances are horrible too,most of us did n't even know what
1,this movie is like a documentary about a small town in the late 1940,this is a film for those that are interested in foreign political beliefs
1,but not exactly what they would have done a,but that 's the problem with this movie
1,gabriel is one of the top ten columbo movies,gabriel is played by the excellent jack palance
1,there 's some nudity not a story,there is a lot of great gags and
1,those who have never come close to the truth should know you 're too young to,those who are into the movies can do is to be entertained by this movie
1,i also found his wife 's innocence in the book to be more interesting than,i 've found it very funny and i thought the movie had good intentions
1,this is a movie not the bad,this movie is a little confusing
1,well i have to say that it is my best movie ever,well done to everyone especially those who are lucky to be able to
1,it is a shame that such a bad time capsule will go to the movies on dvd so i ca n't even begin to accept it 's,it really shows off the quality and the music used with the music and background music and the scenes where it hits the camera that much
1,ignoring every single character in the book they are really good actors that look like they 're having a party,ignoring the film 's first two major faults in this film you are left wondering if the director did n't go
1,are they ever making one of their own movies,are they just to show this to us
1,watchable this one could have been a lot better,watchable movie and this movie is about real people being
1,no it 's a real movie and if i had to go on to the real truth to this film i could have,no matter the genre that is this time and a lot of the dialogue is all over a little slice of dialogue
1,i was a bit concerned with what they were going to be but,i would not have liked this film even as a movie noir
1,it reminds me of the real american film of the late 1960s,it has a very good performance which i did enjoy watching
1,so it is n't like i was expecting a spoof of a remake,so they are left to go up the stairs and a river
1,one can hardly tell that in the beginning but the characters themselves are not really believable,one of the best examples in the entire movie comes from a group of men being trained
1,deeply speaking the film does n't allow many,deeply entertaining but not quite good enough
1,where they live was the best part of the,where did one of the team come from
1,definitely on a par with the first film,definitely recommended for fans of early 20th century exploitation
1,poor script weak storyline lousy bad fx,poor acting that made it worse
1,the director is one of the best actors alive,the film is very long in the long time
1,i think that this movie is the best film ever made its best performance,i do n't know how this is possible but i found myself asking myself if
1,so what if the film had to offer to the audiences because no the killer,so far to cram away the tension between the two guys and each other
1,the plot is pretty basic and boring but as it goes along the film moves in with lots of drama and suspense,the scene lasts in the movie and a guy in a suit says she is one of the most beautiful and powerful characters
1,hollow is another fine episode of the classic cartoon that was supposed to be the twilight zone,hollow is one of the first movies i 've seen in a very long time but i must
1,the problem with the film is how he got a few points out of the way,the script is ok the script is horrible for some of the characters the acting is terrible
1,spoiler i must admit that she 's a good actress,spoiler alert the characters never talk about this plot
1,if you must for a new yorker at the video store rent it now,if it could even be a parody it 's a pretty good movie
1,her performance and the performance is pretty good,her mother is an annoying woman so who can
1,but what the heck is that,but the movie is an ok movie
1,but i think that this was not a good movie,but then again what can he say and tell us
1,a film based completely on the story of,a great deal of time and money
1,if you want to watch a lot of movies do n't miss this one,if the acting were not for the poor actors there 's nothing wrong with all
1,why did i call the doctor a deafmute and an expert,why do n't we see how stupid i can say that
1,crummy in its execution and the story seems very good but at it 's core the film does n't have to turn up too much which does,crummy actors would be given the chance to give this movie a bad rating only because there was absolutely nothing about this movie that was good
1,in real life the hero and the killers and the dog in particular are the good guys which is n't all that much of the action hero,in other words a woman is treated to a man who believes a woman that has already been brought to the hospital she knows by the book the
1,the first 20 minutes or so are good,the acting is terrible the script sucks
1,the story unfolds well as you see the main theme of the story where the story of,the director and his crew were afraid to make a story that did n't make sense
1,the music is very memorable and the story is about a man who 's mother is played,the film opens with the first two young men in the countryside who has an argument
1,i was impressed by the cinematography and atmosphere in the film as,i saw it a few years ago and never liked it
1,why have n't we been more affected by the,why are they so angry about these things
1,a great director of this caliber of comedy comedy,a good deal of it was n't worth the purchase
1,with all these faults you still get the feeling that the director wanted to,with great songs the music and the performances make it all work well
1,in the end i knew exactly what to expect and i,in fact it might be the worst movie ever made
1,the movie does n't seem very funny at first but then there 's some kind of crazy gag,the only thing i would give it is that a great deal of actors can get a great cast
1,a great movie as well as i do n't mind,a few weeks of our local new yorker but still a
1,surprise and very little is the best one,surprise to a young boy who is in the
1,slug in the attic is the worst movie i 've ever seen,slug is a very good tv movie and the acting is great
1,that is the only explanation to his character,that 's a shame because this film has not
1,today is the typical hollywood fare that the discerning director has been used to and yet does n't necessarily manage to create a movie that,today the film begins with an awkward voiceover sequence between the two men who live alone in an apartment room to find their partners
1,i do n't find the explanation,i have watched this at any rate
1,what is most important about watching movies are,what was so special about this film
1,the film is a big piece of crap,the plot is as good as it should be
1,this guy is one that is a,this movie is a total waste
1,i am glad to be able to make a movie like this,i think this should be at for an oscar nominated film
1,even now that they are trying to save the day they ca n't just kill everyone in which there is an old black woman,even some of the characters have a bit of personality but there is also one aspect where they become the most emotionally unstable
1,small spoilers you can feel about seeing some of them getting slaughtered,small spoiler in the movie the man is stabbed in his own coffin
1,they do n't talk about love but they ca n't decide because it 's the same thing and in,they do n't make much sense in the first half but they just did n't get the joke
1,at least my favorite song of the film could be used,at first glance but with the most obvious scene which is the
1,in the end he finds that he 's,in other words some kind of weird
1,but in my case this film is a major problem,but of course it is n't so much as a musical
1,i am glad to see this show on tv as,i had just read a review of this movie
1,and the ending when his friend is being chased by his mother by an abusive father is the,and i agree with the others above that the movie was made in a very low budget
1,this is certainly a one in a long line,this movie is an excellent piece of entertainment
1,yet the movie is a complete mess,yet these actors must be very believable and
1,well let 's talk about his work so i guess there are some problems in watching it for its,well written and acted a great performance by the same actors and not a bit else of course
1,the action scenes are well executed and the story line makes up for the,the result is the worst movie i have ever seen where are they
1,the film also has some truly chilling shots of,the rest of the movie is very good
1,i'm sure the director is supposed to look for the,i'm not a fan of the original series either
1,the only interesting thing i had to say about this film was,the characters are so interesting that they could all get together
1,it is the most hilarious movie i have ever seen,it is a long story of how a lot of people
1,the first film which i have ever seen about it but was,the movie starts as an exciting suspenseful drama that really begins
1,sarah silverman has the feel of a role model she had done,sarah smith and the rest of the cast are solid and even though
1,sure this is not the best documentary,sure it is a great show
1,the film is so poorly shot that you wonder,the film is n't really a horror film
1,at times we see the director 's views on the scene the camera slowly zooms apart from it 's camera angles to the scenes in the movie,at the end of the movie i was looking for revenge on the nerds after the death of the boy was n't as much of a threat as
1,best of all a few times in the,best in all he is a genius
1,also the music is pretty nice for the era though i did n't want,also the soundtrack is very loud but sometimes it 's a great movie
1,she has to be one of the dumbest actors i 've ever seen if not every actor,she meets maria in the movie and says to the girls that she is n't dead
1,i hope it will be canceled,i had n't a clue that she
1,in fact a whole slew of other characters have an esoteric problem,in his own good way the movie was released in germany as well
1,brent tries not to be good but his two men are both attractive and funny to watch,brent is also a bad guy to whom i have been in the press for a few years
1,harris did a great job as his wife and although i'm sure he has a lot less fun than a few of his scenes in the movie i,harris as the police officer a fellow student gets involved with a local drug lord in the small town of his office who 's in a bar
1,and it looks like it was made in the early 90 's so that we have the budget for low,and the only thing this movie should have in theaters was a better place to live in the time
1,obviously there are no other actors who could get to act that way,obviously the only thing in his life worth mentioning is the cinematography of the
1,which is the sign a good movie,which might have been a bad idea
1,another reviewer said that you have watched the whole film,another character of the movie is not only annoying and annoying
1,so now i 've heard that i am very excited that i,so do your local coffee shop or at least see her
1,she is not an actress who just ca n't,she is a little suspicious of her parents
1,hayward is an ambitious actress with her heart to her mother,hayward was still a very good actor so i was surprised by
1,this could have been more appropriate,this movie is the worst thing i
1,it was a very slow and slow ride,it made me feel a bit confused and embarrassed
1,i'm afraid this is one of those movies where some of the,i'm surprised when a small town is in a foreign country
1,sure i am a sucker for such a great film and when i get a chance to watch a,sure he has done some work in the western genre but he 's just a pretty good actor
1,a very sad movie and one of the worse movies,a very powerful movie very funny in both aspects
1,it is a bit of a rip off and certainly not my cup of tea,it 's obvious that the film was based on a novel that was n't a good
1,this film is really just another bad joke on a chalkboard,this is one of the best comedies i have ever seen and
1,i am a fan of the original and loved it,i watched this at blockbuster recently and i love it
1,while at the end of the day the only ones who can see that it will be at times in,while it is true that the plot line is n't that good it was made on a cheap afternoon
1,the film ends abruptly but at the end of the,the only real merit was that of the characters
1,nam 's work as a filmmaker and it was a good idea to get me to the big,nam the movie is just a little too much of a mixed bag between these two movies
1,if you 're a fan of the game you could not find good,if the film did n't have to be in the end it would have
1,the first of them is a bit slow,the problem was that it was on the other
1,then the guy tells himself that he 's a man who must have been a murderer in the process,then we see another guy running up a flight he runs away after the crash that was released before he
1,not that any of the actors can be a bit funny,not worth the film it was just too old fashioned
1,all around the characters were not bad acting bad dialogue bad direction poor direction and worst of all the screenplay has no flow but the script is very,all the people involved with the production design of the film and its production and design to make a proper presentation of the human condition look authentic
1,those are the reasons that the movie is so good,those unfamiliar that the two main actors did a good job
1,i have to admit that i can remember,i think it 's a great movie
1,a good movie for people who do n't have as many issues as those two movies,a few scenes i was n't impressed by but this was so poorly executed it seemed pointless
1,the film has some interesting parts and moments that make you jump out of the cinema as if,the film really had a very slow ending where there is n't any sense of the acting
1,end of spoilers at the beginning where the doctor tells us all we,end of spoiler the acting is all poor but not very good
1,spoilers ahead the film is a typical western slasher melodrama,spoilers ahead this is one of the worst movies
1,i 've seen some of the other guinea pig,i give this one a 1 out of 10 if
1,there are many moments in the film that are just plain embarrassing,there 's a lot of nudity in the story and the scene where
1,this is the worst film i 've ever,this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
1,i can see how bad the movie would 've been,i ca n't remember so much of the movie
1,everything is predictable when she is caught up in their,everything in the film was done to a degree
1,about as much of a great fan as i think of the classic horror films in the late 70 's i was somewhat skeptical,about the same time there really is an explanation for one of the most beautiful songs i 've heard of a broadway play
1,i mean i knew where the film was going to be so poorly done it was boring,i hope that it was n't a dvd for some reason and one should not see the movie
1,in fact if this movie was any good it would just be a little too funny,in fact this does n't mean much in it 's faults or at any rate
1,bridget seymour 's character development her performance in an interesting performance is also very good,bridget wyman 's direction was just awful and the production value was pretty poor as many
1,i really like how the filmmakers had developed it and make me feel,i know this is no longer a comedy but i 'd have been so
1,i saw this film yesterday on dvd,i would definitely recommend this movie
1,the movie just goes on like one of those scenes that,the acting was awful and the plot was pretty cheesy
1,but the story takes thin turns of a plot and develops it with the subtlety of the original and then it is very entertaining,but when he does n't want to take up the loan room he is invited back into the home by the middle of the story
1,but the idea of a woman was never fully developed,but he does n't want to stop the family
1,every once in a while a good guy just looks like a guy with a high iq iq,every time they are at the camera you know how to see characters and they do all sorts of
1,alongside the odd death scenes but still one,alongside the acting this is what i do remember
1,you get to see a real guy from the start of,you will find out that it is the perfect sequel
1,customers go to africa to investigate their problems in the us the future,customers will not regret anyone 's opinion they think this a movie that should
1,this scene was one of the funniest things about this movie,this movie is one of the funniest and most successful film i
1,it has all the elements of a great movie but it 's just plain bad,it has everything to do with an entertaining love story that has so much to offer
1,it was n't just a movie with such names as the famous humphrey,it did n't really go together but the end was so sad
1,tarzan is a good actor a good and likable guy with no,tarzan and lugosi go along far more than they already did
1,that 's why i gave it a two,that really was n't as important as the plot
1,overall the film is great for the whole family,overall the film 's story line was very good but
1,did n't get the best lines in it,did he have anything to do with her acting
1,and in conclusion i think that anyone could ever see this film as a poor man in,and a good deal of the film in the same vein is also in this movie
1,there is one thing i liked about this movie if it had been shot in the early 90s the city would have been better to make a living,there are no surprises to go to and there 's something for my friends but i have to say that i was totally disgusted by the film
1,i thought it was pretty cool and the acting was very good,i 've heard that when seeing a movie like this i have always
1,defense of the camera is one of the best episodes of this movie,defense of a series of gruesome murders at a house is quite possibly one
1,thankfully this film is all that with,thankfully not for an audience of the genre
1,i'm in love with a guy and his sister,i'm not really a fan of those films but even
1,the main reason i think the film is,the special effects could have been worse
1,i'm in my teens 's room of the movie,i'm in love and she did n't care about her
1,richard widmark played the wife of an eminent young french actress who had been rejected by the germans with the help of men,richard attenborough a favorite actor is his usual hollywood and makes this film the perfect mix for those who just want to see the
1,somehow the film is not the same as the previous two,somehow when the director is making an effort and the audience is
1,a perfect example of why this is a waste of film and time,a good movie and a mustsee for fans of horror cinema as well
1,king kong the most popular scifi show on tv with his trademark,king was just not funny and i'm not sure if the movie really
1,no one i 've seen this that i can remember the little girls i loved,no story in that genre has nothing to do with the main premise of the movie
1,rita hayworth was very sexy as rochester but the rest of the cast is just as bad,rita hayworth gives a strong performance as the mother and mother mother 's manipulations towards the end
1,i mean that all the characters just seem like they were filmed,i was surprised that a film where such a young innocent woman would
1,but there is a way too much and you can only,but for a little girl this is a poor film
1,in the movie the narrator is told at his own point and he,in short do n't waste your money on this pile of crap
1,vin diesel 's character is an old guy,vin diesel is great as a sheriff
1,the cast is a wonderful young lady with an unusually very strong future,the only problem with the show being the acting is that she is so
1,and the scene where the girl is being evacuated is n't all that bad,and as much as i loved the novel and knew what to expect to read
1,the ending is totally satisfying because it is not the final showdown which leads to the final confrontation between two brothers,the plot revolves around a widowed wife who 's taken for her family home and who is supposed to be a very
1,sorry but the one in the movie was very similar to the one in,sorry to be a bit of the mst3k animated musical score at night
1,this is a movie for kids,this one was made for one of
1,europa was a good show from all star trek,europa 's one of the most disturbing moments i have
1,drama is n't going to make sense but it 's really good for the two girls who had,drama and action are very good at the end but the film lacks any of the flair
1,what is the purpose and what it really is,what is the point of watching the film
1,one day a movie is made with its own dialogue and its so incredibly beautiful,one scene where he goes from shock to the next morning and is sent to another
1,the first problem is that the film does seem to be a bit of a spoof of the original,the plot is n't great but it shows a lot of it is a little bit too much
1,at the end i think its the most boring of the movie,at times i think the film is a big success for the eyes
1,cry 's father is n't it,cry inducing death of a couple of
1,a great premise of this movie,a man who has gone through life
1,when you watch the movie with its nonstop plot and you have to wait for the movie to occur,when it begins there is a feeling of emptiness in the narrative and the plot is well done
1,meeting a friend on the same day who the feds must deal with the truth to the,meeting a woman in a very similar role and he 's given an exhibition of strength
1,why does someone make such a good movie,why ca n't any other movie director make a
1,well the movie is actually very well done,well that 's about all you see
1,you just had to see it for yourself,you get to see more of the characters in
1,there is little to enjoy here,there will probably have an air of
1,the story of three men who live for and their lives of their father by the,the director 's direction is a bit weak and even at times the film moves
1,this one has that same rhythm which is also what,this is by far the best of the movie
1,ulises is one of the most powerful character actors today,ulises and watson were terrific in their roles as both men
1,the plot and direction are just as,the music does everything to go
1,this film is definitely one of the better of the night and if done right then you 'd be a good looking movie,this movie is really hard to understand how people have to behave like i want to take a movie a movie that is a
1,hubie 's wife is an unhappy man who has an eye for his daughter,hubie is a beautiful young lady but one that does n't seem to be a
1,not a good movie but worth renting,not only did he not deliver a better
1,if you have n't already see it do n't bother i hate to put it in an almost forgotten context of,if you have not seen either do n't read the book and you wo n't know what it really is
1,does n't make it much easier to say,does his character ask him for making things interesting
1,a few good oneliners and some good jokes ensue this,a real person on this planet with good grades
1,wendell goldwyn is one of director joseph gordonlevitt 's most famous directors like tarkovsky and the famous shaw,wendell molina plays the hero with a bad taste in my mouth this is his best role
1,also the whole thing works so well that the filmmakers make an appearance that of,also the director 's name is very much like that of a tv show
1,i watched this movie as an adult,i thought i would have been very impressed
1,its also a lot of people 's ideas that,its a bad example of bad movie making
1,the story and characters are good but the script is really terrible,the plot and dialog is lame the dialog is predictable and the story
1,so many of you would n't have been thinking it could have been much better without him,so is the relationship between these men in fact their relationship is very natural to our own problems
1,three years ago i saw both the dvd and vhs in,three young kids from new york who get their heart
1,there is a brief line of comedy and i applaud this kind of movie so for any one movie has seen it one should try to,there is the whole thing unfolding by the characters that are supposed to be in the movie and we do n't know why we care
1,i do know all the words from people who have been warned on this page is n't,i thought he was pretty and in need of a lot of credit to his character
1,but i ca n't think of a good one i think that this was,but after seeing the entire show i was just wondering how many movies
1,if anyone has any complaints about the movie 's plot there is nothing original in this film at all,if you have seen the film that you like to see is one i will not go watch it
1,and so there is no need to be involved in a more linear version of the story which can be excused,and of course when they are on the other side of the law they take a ride to the ground
1,the whole thing was shot in three different days and the film,the plot seems very contrived but it is n't very different
1,he is given a cold and tumble and,he gives it a very good taste
1,except for what is the reason for that this is the type of film that will always be remembered in the,except for a few scenes in which they are not a patch of the story it 's an entertaining film
1,do we have to learn the meaning of a man 's life,do n't watch this movie the first time you see it or you
1,i 've seen it numerous times and am ready for,i just finished watching the series after season 6
1,i would say though that this movie is very close to the worst as far as being more than a lowbudget horror film,i do n't know why it felt like i had to buy a used vhs copy of a copy of a vhs copy when
1,truly hilarious and funny as the lead character in this one is a bitch that is not even a hero in,truly the scariest of the bunch and that is exactly the main idea why it 's so horrible and silly
1,painful to see was the last 20 minutes of,painful to watch with a lot of action
1,i think they were the only people who cared when this movie,i 'll make a difference but that would be my problem
1,she is beautiful but she just gets more screen time,she was so popular in the role in this part
1,some people have not seen this movie yet it 's not an average attempt at something like,some scenes are far fetched but the film is too long to put it mildly engaging
1,not that she does n't get to look like the man she plays he ca n't be,not that there was ever a sequel from the first film by the end of the first season
1,if they did n't show it as the first place to get through the whole movie i missed the point where the story line left me dumbfounded,if that is true i do agree that the film has the same effect as a clockwork orange but it is a good piece of work
1,the only other person who really wanted to be a guy was his name for himself being an attorney who does n't really have,the main character 's character is just unbelievable and a little irritating it 's the same as every other element of her body
1,some may find it hard to believe that you could write a film,some of those films that are often the same the first is that the
1,that was the problem with the story that the movie had was actually a bit better,that 's the first thing i can say about this movie that 's not bad
1,yes i know it 's a good sign but there is n't much of a plot it,yes this film looks like the real rushes back on the island was a better film
1,today 's films made on the cheap or rather limited budget,today we can say that it 's a terrible movie
1,why did he have to have a movie that is so bad,why oh why not watch it again sometime to be a big box
1,more than this one has the feel of a child 's life and the acting itself as he sets her on fire is not as,more that would be a perfect example of how in the world and many of us who do n't like to read and write
1,ther are no spoilers at that as you wo n't ever know,ther are all sorts better movies from the early 90 's
1,this movie is probably the funniest part of the movie,this movie is like an episode of one of abc 's
1,there was no way that a group of scientists got involved and that a local officer was killed,there 's a lot of funny jokes here and there but these are actually some of the funniest and
1,nine seconds into the film i knew i had to be a,nine months later the two boys get hit after the road
1,your life really does n't make sense anymore,your main character is a very complex character who
1,kitty gets on with the girl 's life but she is afraid of her friend being an angry husband,kitty 's parents are a real treat for them and her love for her and her family friend is what
1,wayne 's character is played by sean connery,wayne was the character of jakob of england
1,i 'll keep it in my collection but we all know there 's much worse to be,i thought this might be the film where this movie should have made it so boring
1,you 're either a little unfair nor not,you feel embarrassed for the kids and the kids
1,the film features excellent performances from all,the director of this film made a big
1,while the film does not do very well it 's a nice movie,while the script is not a masterpiece of the book the adaptation was pretty
1,grayson is great as the manipulative dame,grayson was a joy to watch
1,a good actor by all means his character,a truly awful film with terrible acting
1,most of the time this just made it look like there was n't,most films about the holocaust are the most dangerous films ever made
1,you really wo n't be disappointed with it,you 'll just wonder how this film got made
1,gee i 'll never know if it would ever be done by,gee the movie tries to be witty and fails to deliver
1,i really loved this film at the time,i could also forgive myself and leave me as
1,the ending is just too sappy and predictable,the two of them fall in love with each
1,when an evil man threatens to commit suicide as a young girl he attempts,when it comes i need to say that i will always remember her
1,hubby is very funny and not quite convincing in the role of the cop he always does,hubby has a few problems he 's having an affair with the family and tries to convince him
1,i would suggest that if someone wants to make a show that show how untalented and pathetic,i have also found a point that they do n't have enough money to make it
1,double entendres also have a fairly funny part as if you thought it had a real good movie it 's going to be the,double harness was not the case though the end of the film i did n't even get a chance on an actual film
1,lots of twists ensue throughout the movie,lots of blood and gore and guts
1,during an eclipse with his old friend the only one who could get him was was a man who knew,during the entire first half of this movie the entire film seemed to be a total waste of time
1,they have a bad cast but one day a new kid is trying to stop it and,they 're even less effective about the film than most modern comedies like a good deal
1,franchot tone should have a very good name,franchot tone is a pretty good movie
1,for that matter i was laughing at the,for the very reason i rented it
1,when i have seen this film several times i think that it may be a spoof piece,when they arrive at the house there 's a huge pile of a rock band consisting of the
1,social stereotyping on an already limited scale the film does not work if you 've never seen it on the telly in,social conscience that is never known for example is a film about the political history of the time or the politics
1,excellent action adventure of course all round,excellent casting and some of the worst acting
1,anyway i give it a 2 for the acting and not for 05 stars,anyway i have read a few comments before about his life but the only thing
1,first off i want to comment on it,first and foremost this movie is so bad that
1,the character 's are all very unlikable but this is an odd and tragic film,the movie is full of clichs that are somewhat reminiscent of previous comments of horror films
1,every person who dies on the movie has a small idea of how,every single scene is hilarious in a way that makes no sense
1,can you say anything about the plot,can be a lot too dark
1,and with the exception of the great score by max steiner the movie has nothing interesting no atmosphere and it 's a pity to see the,and i love the fact that everything is shot in black and white but it 's done as a movie and they can get worse
1,in this one it was a little disconcerting but the real life of the characters,in summary if you know what i did by the end i really just love his
1,her performance as a stripper is quite convincing and convincing,her mother has been hired by her younger brother and she
1,that 's it a shame you cannot do the kleenex,that 's exactly what its called director and his other movies
1,if he was n't so much more than that the actors would die,if i had a choice for the show the characters would not have come
1,of course that would be a lot of different problems,of course there was the obligatory twist that was probably a
1,however it 's also the one and only way to play the role of these characters,however the director could have done a good job with it if done properly or with a
1,this movie reminded me of a similar tv show where there 's not a bunch of them the majority of them are just doing some,this is one of the very few of the better known classics in the same genre as one of kurosawa 's most contemporary films
1,the fact that this film is n't about the evils,the story was well crafted throughout several other episodes
1,it makes me wonder how it went to theaters,it is definitely worth watching and it is great for
1,welcome this sequel was the best that i have ever seen,welcome to the next day of the living dead and the first
1,the story centers on the family 's obsession to save their lives from the evil dead girl who,the action sequences were a bit overdone but they did have some of the gore as well
1,wheeler is just ok and he manages to keep the rest of the cast together,wheeler plays a lawyer of a woman that is taken by her husband who turns her
1,cosmo does a wonderful job in the part,cosmo finds the perfect crime for himself to get
1,all in all a movie that can go away as a bad movie,all that it has is a fantastic and beautiful movie by an actor who
1,not even a great film at work,not only are the songs with the music
1,the film is really all about the journey of a couple 's victims and the world,the other is this film was made when i came across it in the middle of the
1,joe pesci is superb in the role of sam,joe dante stars the guy in the white suit who
1,in this case you 're in for a good time,in fact all of this is quite a contrast
1,10 people were killed in a very brutal and inhuman way,10 years later i am aware that a man 's life would
1,towards the end of the film they are forced to try with both of their friends who do n't go into the house,towards a time of a nation they are so dumb that they are really looking like a bunch of cardboard cutout characters
1,the first one which actually made me feel like,the music is the perfect score of song
1,i ca n't believe so many people think that this movie is bad,i would imagine the title refers to a little more info on the film
1,when this movie came out there were n't two men on the cover looked good,when the film started it was a bit slow but the film became tiresome and boring
1,the main characters are so incredibly evil that it 's impossible to root for her when the story is revealed that there really is n't,the music is horrible the acting is bad and the plot seems to be about all the characters have ever played in their lives
1,over the decades when the film opened i do n't want to get more than just one thing i,over the top 50 of this film you cannot say that one wants to be a complete idiot
1,the story in the movie is a real hit and it takes place on some island,the movie would have more experience if it took a new light of the drama
1,although i do n't see him walking around to this dimension no one has been in,although the original version aired on the back of his version of the the film is one
1,not the worst film ever but it is not a total waste of time and talent,not much else about the movie was just so much fun and the whole premise was interesting
1,the story is so simple and so simple,the whole movie is not the same
1,you have to watch a movie that really is n't there,you wo n't want to miss this show because it requires me
1,that is how he 's portrayed,that 's what made this film interesting
1,and there was a lot new plot which would be the movie,and i have no idea why anyone would like this movie
1,bergman brings us an insight into his country and his life,bergman has crafted such a wonderful portrait of a man
1,this is one that i wish you could 've seen as a,this movie features a lot of talking from the old men
1,harron was known for his work in the same film as this miniseries which he obviously took from the classic film,harron 's a short story about an aging child named luchino his wife and daughter and the story 's writer
1,even if you ca n't be more honest than the one by antonio k the director,even as a kid who enjoys cats and animals they just do n't have much personality
1,giovanni ribisi has an amusing cameo as the cop who works on a large scheme in a local morgue owned by the,giovanni ribisi was funny as the young boy in this film his character development for his part is a perfect example
1,the movie is a little bit of an exploration of it or maybe because the people,the first part is not too bad one is a spoof of a great movie
1,the acting was very good and did n't do it for me,the result is a film that does n't hold the ability to convey
1,this is one of the best american movies ever made,this is the first movie made by a man who did
1,this one is a complete mess,this is a great film to be
1,so for those who have n't really had the pleasure and want to,so what you get do n't take this a step of film
1,unbeknownst in the us this could be seen as an insult for a few,unbeknownst to the first one on the site the characters were well chosen
1,i really wish i was there with the other side of the,i did n't really get a chance to love this film
1,the first story is about the battle of discovery and the effects,the first segment of the movie is like the other two characters in
1,but this is definitely a movie with some of the best special,but when the bad guys come they get to see themselves
1,this is a must see if you are a die hard,this is a film for people who love this movie
1,so many elements of the film include the fact that it 's,so why do they need another movie called so badly made
1,it is like watching a tv documentary,it 's hard not to waste a cent
1,the rest of the time this is n't a good action film,the action scenes are poorly shot and they are merely terrible
1,one character is shown briefly in several short shorts,one can find the book about halfway through the entire
1,there are more people out there than you know and will have,there are two things that are funny in the whole film
1,roar of the living dead' is a film,roar is a fine and entertaining movie
1,michelle pfeiffer is brilliant as a woman who always falls in love with her,michelle pfeiffer has n't really been a great actress but she 's so much better
1,fans of this show might like it but its not the same,fans of the series will enjoy his work in the past and more
1,there is some sort of violence and gore the occasional violence and nudity is minimal,there is a story in the film at that point and it is n't enough for
1,nor was it to get nominated till,nor is it a great movie
1,if we ca n't stand it there 's never one as if it was that the film,if you are looking for something to watch then it 's pretty entertaining to think about
1,why is she that is still not so bad,why this was called a cult classics it is hard
1,this is a wonderful film to look at,this would probably just have been a good one
1,then another is the good guy called the black,then there is the acting is pretty bad
1,despite the fact that this movie is only 80 minutes long it 's about a bunch of people,despite his efforts to reach his wife the two of them fall victim to the same problem
1,i do n't think that the filmmakers of this movie really made the real mistake of it,i can only assume that the director got the job done so that he needed a different direction
1,another reason why the whole movie is that it is just plain slow,another film with a very long amount of action but not without the rough
1,there are moments where at one point they actually have a conversation,there are no memorable sequences but they are very different than it could
1,anyone who has seen this has a taste or can i believe the same mistake,anyone who has a real sense of humor needs to have a good laugh
1,of course there were some fine fight sequences and good acting,of course he 's not a new yorker one would expect for
1,it all ends when you see people in action and fighting scenes but,it is not as if they were the two in the morning
1,the rest of the movie takes place and goes into a warehouse to,the movie does n't take itself seriously just a cheap production design
1,the acting ranges from average to dull and without even the slightest bit and a really cool scene in the,the film was a nice idea however in the end it 's just a very poor character 's film
1,in my opinion the actors really should 've given it an 8 if not all,in this one he plays a bad part of his family and his acting skills seem
1,just when you think the man is,just one of my favorite movies
1,although i have n't actually paid some bucks to see it i can see how much i disliked the acting and script in it it made a good impression for me,although you are still playing the games i can see it 's a lot of potential not to be a fan of the show because it is n't that bad
1,in the first film he meets an orphan the beautiful girl of the same motel where you do n't,in his first movie is an extremely slow and unnecessary movie that 's never to be made about
1,i have seen quite an enjoyable series,i am sorry that my parents
1,the character and the story are a complete mess with the same amount of atmosphere being the same the colours that you can imagine are all over the place like we are watching many people being slaughtered in real life,the plot concerns the doctor who finds himself at the mercy of a gay young boy who is supposed to be the town of one of the girls so that there may be a more accurate part in this series
1,ice age is in a sense not,ice cube is a fine movie
1,later this little film fails miserably in its promotion,later after being kicked into the mix to a remote
1,on the plus side though it may not be,on the whole the film is a mess
1,the cast is very bad too,the first halfhour was very bad
1,i was not a fan of his character in the,i did n't feel any sympathy in the theater
1,here is a great movie for my own,here the cast is very very good
1,it 's a movie with plenty of action sequences that make it so enjoyable to watch,it is not even possible for the children to come home after they are forced into the
1,i do n't know how many times i 've seen this show i was looking forward to watching the show and when i,i could n't help but laugh at how she was supposed to show him when he is confronted with a love interest
1,in addition to the above many of the comments here posted it and the reviews for the film about this film are just,in my view this is one that i would advise anyone to see the movie to believe something more of the movie
1,all his fans give a good performance,all i can say is wow
1,the only problem is that the characters are all too shallow,the director 's cut is just cut to the screen
1,but the fact that it seemed a lot of fun for one 's own right is not enough,but if you ever want to see a movie that just does n't have it at all it should
1,although the director has taken such a bad reputation that makes it almost unwatchable because of his lack of talent it becomes more obvious that he spent half of his whole movie trying to convince the audience that he 's going to suck just because it fails,although not as great as the others but in the beginning the two films have a few good moments although you can tell there is one part where the main reason this movie is so long was that the plot is too weak to be good
1,if i ever saw this movie on a tv i would have known,if they did n't know what they were making was they all went crazy
1,as i watched the movie i had more interest in the story than i did imagined in the film,as i sit and enjoying seeing this movie i must stress that it was a good move to watch
1,the film is n't scary and not funny at all,the acting and direction are pretty good though there are a
1,and i loved the film and was happy to find,and the ending leaves no sense in the movie
1,if you are looking for a good movie with a lot of laughs and a laugh track then try and,if you 're trying to make a good movie with your friends watch it but in general you have
1,this one however does n't have a redeeming factor but to be honest i just wish,this was no masterpiece that came to me as the film went along the way
1,the ending is too much and the ending which leaves the whole scenario very confused,the first thing i found a second version of hamlet 's story is that it 's
1,she is so annoying she just looks like she can only act without any facial expression,she is the son of a famous artist whom she has given up by the young woman
1,i did n't see a movie and was n't going to have to endure,i saw this short film after watching this movie a few years back
1,as far as being concerned of his obsession in his previous films the filmmakers manage to make,as well as the overall storyline the movie has a lot of potential for the viewer
1,it 's the first that got me mad,it is a true story the effects were superb
1,there are a few things that make me laugh,there were no real surprises of plot and characters
1,some are really nice with his movies,some of the jokes are so lame and
1,it is not a comedy in the slightest,it might even have seemed to have been a
1,so if you have n't seen this you 'll find it interesting,so many people have said there is nothing else to say here on
1,if a movie has so many elements of life the story itself is just a bit too simple,if not for the fact that it 's a film that 's supposed to be some sort of horror
1,the acting was ok the cinematography was okay considering the budget it 's low budget i,the director wanted me to find that way in the long good friday the 13th
1,peter boyle who could be in this one is n't the better lead actors to either you or be the film,peter jackson directs a very entertaining film about racism and corruption in a new country where we live to tell
1,the first 20 minutes of the movie are,the movie just did n't work together
1,rent if you want to see it at the beginning of the movie because i,rent a clockwork orange if you have not seen this movie on the shelf
1,this movie is a mess to me and i recommend you to watch the mst3k version it takes a,this time the movie is very easy and it should not be the same way a stranger is
1,well done by all you and i'm really impressed with this one,well after some years of this film for the last ten years i
1,such an excellent film it is not so much a film as a book of which there are n't several good scenes,such as the man 's daughter who loves him and her mother and his heart at the end of the film
1,mediocre movie that never had anything at all,mediocre special effects and a good plot
1,i guess it did n't work,i liked this movie and i must
1,sure it is a typical film but it works very well,sure the plot is about a guy who starts with an escaped
1,this was the worst movie i have ever seen,this does n't make an iota of sense however he
1,there 's a twist in my stomach for a few,there just are n't anything wrong with this movie
1,no real horror film or scares or gratuitous violence,no one expects the viewer to care much about the
1,this is the main thing it has so many layers and many layers of logic that make,this is one of those films that you have to watch with your buddies and watch
1,why were they in the middle of the pack,why did they make such a bad movie out of
1,this film has the most disturbing elements a horror film could muster,this is a good movie and a good one at that
1,caruso has one good role as the mother although,caruso as the title character is a revelation
1,there are things that are pretty good to the movie the script is quite good and the acting is ok enough as an effort to do with,there 's something about this film that makes me wonder if the director or producer could have taken a movie that was shot anywhere in time
1,1 was very bad and i wonder if everyone were making them,1 they are trying to save the world so their parents
1,instead it 's a bunch of kids and a bunch of people on a ship stumble across a,instead it 's a poor attempt to make a movie look like a really badly done home
1,if you are looking for some fun to see then pick up the,if a little over the top i 'd have to say this
1,if your a big fan of a few more than the standard horror films or,if you have to see the movie then you get a lot of work
1,i would n't want to watch the film again as i,i have never been more disappointed to watch this episode
1,sadly this time soon transformed to an unknown relationship with a couple of people who ca n't,sadly this time around in this film you ca n't help but feel for the characters
1,photographs are cut together for an interview with a few minutes long and the main character and a long takes are two hours into the,photographs the first part was made with a little of a story but it turned out to be a very interesting and memorable experience
1,i was expecting more of such a crap but the fact that it starred a child who has n't,i like how that kind of quality was in here on a saturday night with it 's creator
1,in the first of the two men are in a club of five or four who,in conclusion they 're very different and have no more laughs or even their personalities
1,it is about a girl whom she does to his daughter and is not afraid to care about the other,it seemed to be a spoof of the first film the acting is good but i was expecting something more more
1,the movie starts with a bang but we never see why,the film 's atmosphere is not particularly compelling as long as it
1,a good mix of good actors,a very well done thriller on this
1,have you ever actually seen someone sitting there pretending you 're the main reason i rented it,have you had a root canal in your time you have to make the right film
1,a woman can learn that she 's a woman,a few minutes later the movie starts out with a
1,in fact the actors are very pretty talented actors from whom the actors were in,in a short short running away of all aspects of a war flick he is forced
1,instead she becomes obsessed with her character 's life and her attempts,instead we are treated to two dimensional characters trying to convince each other
1,is this film supposed to be about the power of,is she the director or that i am exaggerating
1,in the movie it was a very good movie,in a similar scene of the two horsemen
1,it was made for tv so that,it 's not your favorite movie
1,but i do n't want to be anything other than the fact that it is n't an interesting story,but to be honest i 'll just say the first shot on the show was not bad because i thought
1,jean bates is a revelation to anyone whose only contribution to that role has him,jean claude van sant 's performance and his timing to the film 's first class and
1,ross 's performance on the box sounded quite good,ross 's wife and wife are at the bottom of
1,that 's how i came to this movie,that is the best part of the film
1,there are a few flaws of these two,there were many elements where the film could have
1,with its aim it is still a decent film even if,with this scene i thought i would get another film
1,the movie is quite funny to watch and a great deal of time,the whole movie is all over a long long and boring exposition
1,i just saw this film when it,i mean it was n't bad
1,the only problem i had with the film was the fact that despite the fact that it was a,the story is about two families who have to cope with an ancient family to assassinate each other
1,jacques audiard 's music score was wonderful,jacques sewell is a terrific director
1,from the first minute which i thought it was going to be a joke,from start to finish this film was a very enjoyable ride at a cinema the
1,this is a perfect piece of work that will make you laugh every time,this leads into several sequences where we see him running rampant to get married and
1,i was expecting a lot from this,i will just say that i was n't
1,his girlfriend is an innocent man is a man who thinks it 's a suicide,his character is the embodiment of a good guy but his role is very limited and
1,in a way the script is very good enough to be interesting but the movie does n't make up its,in his late husband 's chair he is a natural boy at the very core of its emotional existence
1,so it 's not a complete surprise though,so do you know who who is that girl
1,it is not that hard to take so many minutes to figure out,it 's a shame it only made more money in america and not only
1,but at least they 're made to appear in the film,but then again i must have seen a lot of movies and
1,the story is very very simple and the music is beautiful,the problem is it 's not going to be a movie
1,its just a bunch of clichs like the last,its the same film from a different perspective
1,there is always a possibility for the viewer to realize what a young child is,there had been a part where a character called a girl who was pregnant with the
1,but then i realized that the film was a pretty standard action movie,but at the very least a bad film is a bad move and one
1,in addition the film looks quite good and the,in the end it seemed a little confusing
1,i found it a pretty decent movie but you will be disappointed,i just ca n't believe how this is going to get good reviews
1,any movie that features a cast of characters from the,any selfrespecting film watcher should be ashamed of themselves
1,better yet the film had the exact same effect and the rest of the characters were completely unsympathetic,better to make a good film with some good action movies good special effects and excellent characters
1,the actors were a bad bunch of unknowns that had no real reason to run on screen,the other movies that the director of the film have also seen on the same theme make the
1,sparse story for the very start it does n't take any other,sparse script and a few of the characters from that novel
1,do n't waste your time on how stupid this movie really is,do n't waste your money or time on this waste of celluloid like
1,the movie goes into the territory to make a point that it must not be too boring,the plot is simple and you are n't sure who it is and who will get
1,that 's the main theme here,that is the question of whether the
1,why did they give us the biggest name out of,why oh why the heck did she do so
1,but that was the case with my wife and they all stayed,but i think that the movie would n't be so good to watch
1,he is quite a good guy but he does n't,he takes it home and puts it into that
1,a man who 's married is married to a,a fine movie that i enjoyed very much
1,if you look at the film 's quality it is worth watching but it 's not as well,if so it would have been a perfect success for some more successful films to get released
1,even with many similar points to the show there is n't a single element of originality,even with all things considered bad this is just a film that makes you think
1,when he decides to go through his mother for money he goes to his apartment home with his buddies to make this happen,when the film is in color it is beautifully photographed but that 's another reason why i would n't watch this film without seeing
1,he is now a little nervous but the story and action sequences are just dull,he 's so funny you wo n't be thinking twice watching this because he 's never
1,needless to say i saw it at my first 10 years and would,needless to say though is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,something for those who are into movies and films of the late 80 's you did n't find this,something that should stick to someone like myself who never lived in the dark ages of this film
1,this is one of those movies where,this movie is a bad movie
1,who is paying for the same to die,who is the leader of the family
1,thus as the film progresses it stays clear that the characters themselves are caricatures and have a greater impact with their backgrounds,thus the film follows the story of the journey to an interesting new world where the hero has an adopted daughter
1,finally i can see what else happens,finally that can be used for the final
1,i liked this show and think it is a masterpiece,i 've never heard of it before and it is probably
1,to start with an end this is not a bad movie it 's just boring,to sum it all up i could care less about any of the main characters and
1,magic or not you 're a movie enthusiast,magic for example is the fact that most women
1,the movie is n't worth it,the music was so nice and the
1,it was nice to see these actors so very different,it was also hard to feel it the ultimate intention
1,all three are not even likable at the end and they never see each other,all in all this is a fantastic movie if you like it that show the great
1,the ending is just too stupid and predictable which makes some of the,the best part of the movie is the ending the great music
1,unlike other people this film is a complete gem,unlike when a group of kids accidentally break out of
1,even if it has that stupid quality it never lets go,even some of the things you notice are from the movie
1,the movie 's story is quite easy to follow,the other characters do not know the difference between the
1,some of the special effects were pretty cheesy for most of the movie,some are the scenes showing some of the characters which really do n't appear
1,herbie 's the killer is one of his,herbie has a cameo in this move
1,knowing nothing has done the trick it 's done in such a small cast,knowing the budget is too young to give this movie a good deal
1,undoubtedly it is the fact that it feels to make me laugh,undoubtedly the film could have been trimmed with a shortened or nc17 rating
1,oh yeah so i 'll just make out to them,oh and the main protagonist has a beard and looks the
1,still it was really enjoyable to see a person who did not look as good as the little mermaid and who made him lose his,still it 's too late for the director to go to the stage with the original cast and production but that 's about it
1,this is the perfect film for you to watch,this movie is like it tries to be clever and
1,no explanation in the film you 've,no wonder it did n't win
1,the film also includes a little twist about,the whole thing is an utter mess
1,how does she get to see this crap after a few minutes,how does the young girl manage to get pregnant by her
1,i will never stop talking at the end if you,i can remember this film from the sundance channel
1,that 's why the director wanted to get to the house as opposed to the film 's climax,that is the main reason why the only one who is a favorite of mine is the fact that
1,i do believe that it 's one,i 'd never seen it again
1,asian cinema was made in germany by james toback,asian horror movies are supposed to be good but this
1,the plot was ridiculous the acting is horrible,the first two seasons are really excellent
1,the problem with this movie the plot is so thin so banal you wonder at your local library the next day,the cast seems to be having a good time playing out their roles to play their role especially at a young age
1,deathtrap 's final third is the best,deathtrap a classic director with a great knack
1,if there is a problem you will see that this is a film made by people who are fans of the genre and the movie benefits from the book,if one of the guys in the movie is a female lesbian is so lame and ugly and the character he played would yell i wonder why he got to
1,for instance she has his father 's sister,for the ladies and people out there it 's
1,it has been one of my favorite movies ever so,it 's been on a plane somewhere on campus
1,it was so good the actors even had an excellent chemistry,it 's the story of a woman that has fallen in love
1,i am not a fan of movies but if i did n't give,i have watched this movie many times and never tire of that
1,if you have n't you can forgive this with other reviews,if you like that kind of thing then you are missing something
1,the characters in the movie are just unbelievable and i am glad i did n't spend to,the movie is full of plot holes and i was hoping that this would get better
1,dean cain plays the same role but there 's the best,dean stockwell and david duchovny are the main two characters
1,and this is one of the few gems,and the acting is n't bad either
1,even though it 's a really great film to show how badly photographed or edited these sequences are in the movie they are in a class of,even in the last few of its scenes the film takes a turn into an enjoyable sequence filled with an enormous number of other classic moments
1,through the movie they manage to build and make the film interesting with the plot,through the first two episodes of this film the characters come and fall on the same
1,believe me you are a fan of horror movies and i can assure you that this is,believe me i love him as a actor but do n't let it be a movie
1,well the one big thing is the casting of the characters,well after all that one the director and writers of this show
1,the story is so disjointed the dialog is awful,the film shows a lot of how to make a
1,i know it was a low budget movie but that 's ok,i have always been there for my time but the movie does n't
1,i ca n't tell what is the plot,i could not get enough of her
1,one of the best of the year that was made to explore,one of my favorite moments is when he is forced into a chair
1,ultimately he does n't even come across the character,ultimately the story is a lot more interesting although one
1,police and her sister come on the case of the killer but she is left to fend,police detective paul has to decide to escape from prison to rescue his girlfriend 's murder
1,i ca n't say how bad it has to do and that 's not only the,i can only assume that people can really act like they are in this movie
1,anyway it was a good idea about this film and the special effects are ok even for the worst of,anyway i 'd go to the video store for this movie is a bad bad excuse to get away
1,the scene where he walks and is not at all scared is just embarrassing the worst is the fact that,the acting in the movie is excellent the writing is just so great and it 's a great film
1,i would certainly recommend the majority of the movie,i was surprised but that was not enough
1,have i seen the new movie of this before,have you seen these two movies coming from the great
1,the cast looks like they went over the top and filmed a lot of them because they looked like they were having fun,the story itself is about a bunch of people and their quest to make life on them the same way about the fact that
1,this made for tv series is the best and funniest one,this is the second worst film i have ever seen
1,not the worst movie i have seen,not much of the action scenes are done
1,the end result is that the writer who is obviously trying to find it 's own inner logic,the script is horrible and boring the directing is a disaster it must rank as a 10 out of
1,a very good story of a young woman who starts to seduce a young woman of hers,a good thing if it were n't for a few of the scenes and some of the few
1,it 's difficult for him to believe but i have to see what can i say,it is a film that everyone involved can watch and if it were n't for this one
1,first of all this movie has no connection to,first of all that 's saying a lot
1,this is no less than an example of that,this was the worst adaptation of a musical
1,then there 's the story about who the killer is,then you begin to question the fact that he and his
1,start at least a little deeper than that,start off with the first ten minutes of the
1,what i liked about this movie was the fact that it was so terrible,what this man has to offer is that it only exists when a child is
1,it 's a very well executed and very funny comedy with a subtle cast that is,it is also the same message you will probably see that these kids live there
1,it would have made a great cult classic,it 's a wonderful film that shows how underrated
1,alex is a very likable and talented actress in this film,alex does everything it could possibly be about the man a young
1,adding to the movie he says that they can actually speak about their past but they must remain in,adding to the mood that is used as a whole the story has some interesting twists and turns
1,she also finds some of the nastiest acting that i could relate to,she was the only one who seemed to have a decent time just to
1,it 's not a perfect film but its definitely worth the watch,it is a shame because i did n't see all this crap about
1,i just saw the movie in the theater in the first movie,i 'd rather choose someone in my opinion than they could for ufos
1,but the worst of them are the names,but as in the first movie i knew nothing
1,words and music indicate what this show,words were bad as were they
1,the first thing i love about this movie is the way it ends up with a plot,the first part of the movie is about a group of scientists in the same location of some
1,all i can think about about this is that for the most part they did have its head,all in all not a good movie if you love and care about the history of love
1,the music is very impressive and the editing is top notch,the movie starts with some promising characters and good characters but in
1,oh and do n't get me wrong i love good movies,oh and another thing they did have sex in the plot line
1,but when the movie finally turns out the film makes a point,but this is n't the case and its just as bad
1,charles grodin plays a very likable supporting character for instance when he gets an opportunity to be a murderer for,charles perkins played it like he was not even in the movie he 's just a bit bit stiff
1,bender is a little stiff that his parents cannot act his,bender is his last feature performance as an american actress
1,the best scene in the movie is when the young son 's son,the only other actor who played in the movie was john malkovich
1,also when it is n't as a joke it just makes you jump,also when they make an appearance of someone who gets killed by mr toad
1,just like the previous reviewer i saw the film recently and found this,just one big piece of crap that i thought was a joke
1,he 's a man who 's not very likable,he takes part in the world and is also played
1,it was a film that made the rounds not a good,it looks like they were trying in a different way
1,i have been waiting for this film to happen in a series and it 'll leave this one wide open for more viewers and have some of the,i had not read yet the first was one of those rare movies that made me think that they were in a good mood and needed them
1,if anybody who actually watched this is not impressed then it,if you like mindless movies this one is for you
1,the acting is not bad in this movie,the acting is horrible and the plot is a
1,sunny deol 's acting is awful from the getgo to the plot even the scenes in the,sunny deol who wrote the play should have been a big star and an experienced actress
1,what makes this a good movie is,what a waste of this film
1,as for the movie 's main highlight why did the movie just keep a secret to the novel,as someone who has seen the trailer knows it at the beginning of the picture my sympathies are that
1,he was a quiet man with a heart,he should have tried to make a career
1,but the plot is ridiculous and they never seem to try to mix that and,but as a thriller and scifi movie the movie just does n't go anywhere
1,dw griffith was also very strong in the title role,dw griffith is the sole protagonist of the movie
1,it 's a shame for the filmmakers whether it be a good remake or it would be,it is a nice change from the typical hindi film that is n't the big thing
1,cross country tells you what you call in the background a lot as to why the hero is being told,cross eyed man gets the man with black hair to spare him from his father who can find him
1,he is the best actor in this movie but his performances were good at times the,he can be funny but i have never seen this type of film until now
1,mature for her character is the film 's strongest character although he did little for the role,mature women have great chemistry with powell and his friends who are constantly trying to make them all
1,the acting was terrible the story completely implausible and the special effects were terrible,the acting a little stiff but the script by the late dear andy milligan has
1,we 've all laughed our asses off as if you are,we never do that is supposed to be a mystery
1,the two of them were good but the main character was the girl that made me mad and i hate to go back to her old,the film begins to fall apart for the viewer to realize that the people involved with the film have little to do with each other
1,otherwise this movie has got to be the weirdest comedy i 've seen,otherwise no matter it 's one thing that should not be taken from a
1,i do n't know why she gave this one a solid 2 it 's a little hard to be expected at all in front of,i do n't want to spoil her and all the other comments i can tell that 's why i'm not a fan of her
1,rehearsed the characters have no depth or are left in the shadows,rehearsed and written to be a masterpiece to make us aware it all
1,it was one of many things that i just,it does n't seem to have a clue
1,you will see the same thing happening to me and this movie really does n't really,you do n't see her for a long time and just look at the camera
1,gena rowlands is also wonderful as a woman,gena rowlands was brilliant as helen collins
1,but if you 've seen it you have an opportunity to be very entertained,but i ca n't understand how the show was going to be funny and it
1,the actors are uniformly superb and the camera work is,the film has an awful pace and bad acting
1,altogether the film has a great cast and it will help you to laugh once during the whole time,altogether the plot is n't so bad its funny in that it is a very poorly constructed film
1,when the show is over i'm sure i do n't,when you see what has nothing to live with
1,first off a small portion of the film was shot like a bad porno set,first i have to agree as for the plot the effects just make a good appearance
1,anthony hopkins has done a brilliant job,anthony quinn plays his usual lovable and tough
1,olivier does n't even know why he thinks it was supposed to be a joke and the way he did in all films is,olivier 's character seemed so confused and that we were watching the whole thing but was n't sure that he wanted to die
1,like the book it seems the fact that the acting was not terrible but the story was very good,like the first movie it seemed that the people in this movie had a good idea and i just got
1,during the whole movie the dialog is just awful and the writing is horrible and bad,during the opening credits of the film you do n't even feel like that in their movies
1,the movie has an eerie atmosphere,the music is excellent the plot is
1,his life in the movie is perfect for me and,his performance and all the emotion is really good
1,the best actor in the movie was the voice and voice voice by mr robinson the other way you feel for those,the only reason i went to see this was because of the fact that it was based on a true story
1,which would 've made this a great movie if only with a couple,which is to say that it is funny and it is n't
1,a few of the characters are also played by a slightly interesting,a great documentary of how life has become a human being
1,jessica lange was a complete delight in the film but the story was just so stupid and i wanted to vomit,jessica alba and her partner 's sister are both a pretty attractive girl but their parents do not do drugs
1,do n't even watch it alone if you get a chance and do n't have,do n't let me tell you that this movie made me laugh out loud
1,a movie like in the early sixties and it was never the last time that he,a few times a little awkward which is what the characters do in the film
1,so she was not only able to make it to the end but her character,so here 's a list like a bad remake of the original the grudge
1,it 's a very enjoyable film in places,it would be a shame if the actors would
1,i found the characters intriguing and believable and the plot was so well done,i have always been a fan of peter cushing movies and he 's usually very
1,seeing her the first time she has a wife the other kids and the woman she is are the one to blame for their lives and their families,seeing the movie the people playing the game in which some people get bored are the same kind of story things that made me hate them all the way
1,i saw this for the first time and still i love it,i thought there was a certain sense of humor and it did not
1,dated is one of chaplin 's better efforts,dated in the same movie with the main protagonist
1,there are too many characters who are given what this series takes place in,there is no explanation for this but what is the reality really like
1,and we all did that same thing in the first place,and while many of the actors made the movie seem bad at
1,in reality that 's a bit of a good thing,in those of the most famous roles in hollywood history are
1,firstly these films are n't even suitable and so are only for those to care about,firstly i must admit that this film seemed to be made up by a 12 year old
1,by the end the great melting man is the worst film ever made,by now the main attraction of this movie was the way the camera pans
1,i do n't want to do anything about the plot except,i could go on but i really liked this movie
1,a very fine and funny drama,a lot of the movie takes place
1,710 rated r for what he has done,710 a lot more than an 8
1,i ca n't believe i watched this show when i saw it in theaters after hearing and hearing that he,i love it all those who watch this movie are still in your own teens sitting in the theatre
1,i was a bit disturbed after watching this,i guess that 's all we do about this
1,the characters had a lot of potential,the acting was fine for a change
1,it was so bad that you could n't take up your eyes for a,it is so stupid it 's so bad its almost painful to watch
1,but to say that was a good thing to see was probably,but there are some things that make you feel this bad
1,it makes you think so many that you ca n't make things worse in the end,it is one of those movies that could have easily been picked up by a couple friends
1,you have no idea what he really is,you could n't even hear the dialogue and still
1,this is a really wonderful movie from my childhood,this film should 've been more enjoyable than it would
1,anyway this is a very good movie,anyway there have not been a few hundred
1,quite a thing to say that the film makers are not aware of how,quite frankly i think it 's the worst movie ever to be released
1,now i know the whole history of the plot is that what it lacks is a few interesting twists but i think,now it seems that this is how this film is made as well as many other movies for about 30 minutes
1,thank you that you do n't want to watch every episode of the film which is so bad you do n't know,thank goodness so many of the people in the movie are still talking about the consequences being on the side of the dvd
1,the characters are all very well written,the story itself is quite basic
1,but even more so there is some great acting and direction,but i just did not watch anything that was funny
1,she really is very talented in this movie,she plays a great grandmother who is able to
1,fortunately this film has been made and that there should be much,fortunately these are two characters and that 's all it means
1,and i did n't know what was going on but the movie was boring,and the only thing that was n't clear about the film is the plot twist
1,david suchet plays the cop who 's in the film business,david and his friends take a bath trip to their place with
1,lane 's character is the only person you do n't care about and the rest of,lane is really great in a cameo role and he never really fits the movie
1,and then there is the acting,and i'm not sure if it was
1,each of the characters was also played for the first time a year in which the older kid was played by charles band,each of the characters is not a problem as they 're a little too young and too shy to fully develop their own relationship
1,all in all there is not much to recommend this film,all those moments and the movie 's message are a minor event
1,there are several more twists along the way,there is also plenty of beautiful and very funny
1,it is one of my first favorite films,it 's just plain bad to watch
1,reminds me of how the characters are in their place and their situations are very believable at times,reminds me of it a bit too far fetched the film is a complete mess but it 's worth
1,this film features an interesting story about life and death and what,this movie should be seen by everyone who likes action movies
1,30 years later the two young women are still on for each episode 's first episode of the film because i would 've liked to have more to explore the tv series a la series,30 minutes into the movie the characters do n't exist to begin any plot or narrative but the performances are generally solid and the plot is very interesting a bit thin and really boring
1,the characters and dialog are very very funny and this,the story is a little bit contrived and boring
1,anyone who has n't lived at sea in a theatre and you think that 's the right word,anyone who has n't watched the original series of tv series should see that it is not the finest
1,it is an interesting movie and not quite easy to follow,it was the best movie that i will ever sit through
1,or the fact that at the time the world was a success the other actors had been on the run decades,or maybe that was why i went into this movie not expecting anything from the director and it would be funny to
1,tom hanks and the rest of the cast are excellent,tom selleck a former master of police detective is not too
1,i do n't even have to write spoilers,i have a problem with the actors they were
1,the movie opens with the young woman at the nightclub of a beautiful wedding,the story starts out rather weird and is then quickly descended into a story of
1,after the fact i did n't quite find anything redeeming,after all this is the one movie which i wish for
1,this film is a bit over the top,this leads up to them being about the same
1,their lives were so ridiculous it did not fit until they made it to the screen,their work in all those made the film look like they were made out of stock class
1,usually speaking in some scenes like this film the camera work is,usually you ca n't really feel any empathy for the plot
1,it 's a good combination of humor and humor,it is true that even though the movie has a
1,screwball comedy is the best of all the columbo story,screwball comedies are made no one can replace this is a
1,it 's a little boring for it 's audience,it 's almost a movie with a cast that does
1,as for the story it 's a mystery all the way,as for the other actors in the cast you have to take
1,it is a movie that shows how important human beings can be and should be happy to see what they want but they were not,it seems that some of the actors involved have had the most important names and they do n't even deliver up a believable storyline
1,i mean that on every corner they have a gun in the,i have seen in a number of reviews about her character
1,moreover this is not only a horror flick but rather an epic with no blood and guts to hide on,moreover she has the heart and charm of an experienced member of those who are being seduced and the film 's
1,no this should be seen by anyone who is a fan of the original,no one else can be blamed to anyone but it was very entertaining
1,personally i would n't be able to watch,personally i'm sorry to say that it 's a
1,singapore sling is the best that 's ever put to film,singapore sling of course is just a very funny show
1,if not one to miss the chance of renting this film you 're going to enjoy it,if the script is lacking any depth it seems that the screenwriters never intended to focus on the
1,maybe that 's because i'm sure there 's a point to all the people involved in here,maybe that 's unfair but in the first place not that the film really takes me in to
1,i think it is probably the finest film ever made,i would have enjoyed the scenes at my local video shop
1,this film has a very funny look at the human race,this movie was made for a year ago to be viewed on
1,my vote for the acting is that we see the lead character character who 's supposed,my father told me i was not in the mood just wanting to watch it
1,henry is on a boat with a couple of thugs who like him but have an excuse to make,henry czerny and christopher lloyd are in great form as the two siblings and an interesting family friend
1,yes i really could n't stop laughing at the lack of a story line but i have to confess,yes this review is very much a part of this film 's relation but the performances are poor
1,i do n't remember seeing a documentary that 's so,i mean do n't forget that this movie stinks
1,i would n't want to go to a cinema where the characters get their comeuppance in this film,i did n't know what to do when i watched it but i'm relieved that the actors who played
1,it starts very promising but the script is not,it 's all in the film making one
1,i do n't know how bad it looks but it is not,i was n't disappointed in the first 15 minutes of the movie but
1,on the one hand you 'll not miss him as much as if you are,on a side note it 's hard to watch but not a bad movie
1,the best way to keep your attention in your seat is when you 're doing the same you will have a sense of humour at this is the way it is,the actors who have just been a household name in the past must come back to face as if it is n't a good idea to watch this episode or at least
1,the ending of the movie is as bad as a sequel,the two leads are good and the music is beautiful
1,the problem with the movie is that there were things just plain,the ending of my memory to take my word for granted
1,the movie was a very interesting film the music was good the songs,the problem is the story and the dialogue are weak and uninteresting
1,i found the film to be rather bizarre and i thought it just got quite an issue as the movie was shot to a halt with all too weird as well,i will never get this comment to come for the fact that it 's about 3 minutes in unmatched in this film and it still stands well in full scope
1,of course there are some problems that are good and all,of course that 's the best of all this film
1,they made it up on the spot but the people who made it and the other reviewers complain about the ending left something open to interpretation,they are not even close to the slightest threat we are in the audience and our hero who is a little bit of a jerk
1,the film does attempt to explain to us that all human emotions were not a very important topic,the only drawback is that this film tries desperately to emulate a lot of its themes and succeeds in
1,sometimes you think to yourself the film is about a woman on a woman who can live in a world that,sometimes the writers and director of this movie did n't get any real meaning at all or in the end
1,but then again maybe i 'll have to remember if they do n't get the chance to see a better film than this one,but then again it must have been a lot in the late 1980 's on that show so i was surprised to find out
1,a film that was made to capitalize an audience on the popularity of the original classic,a story that could be told on a budget with no budget to be had
1,though he does not deliver at the end of the movie they never,though it 's not as good as i expected it to be
1,okay the ending was good for a few,okay this movie was a total flop
1,this is a good movie for a rainy day on the way you want to,this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time
1,i do n't remember any other characters in this movie like,i 've read the original book and do n't know who the
1,director john frankenheimer has made a good movie as a young boy that his wife could not make for,director john waters 's director who can use some of the better tricks of cinema of the time
1,and he has a very funny cameo on the cover,and then another one is the movie it 's almost a
1,the film is the kind of character driven in the style of acting in the,the only reason i watch this film is that it was an instant classic
1,hard to imagine if this is the same premise,hard to write a word to describe it
1,while the story is interesting and has the usual action action elements the action scenes are just as memorable as they come and get on with the characters' personalities,while they are being chased and the people are in love with the police academy in the next step there is a certain hint that the girls just want to
1,it would be better spent if the director should have known that the film might,it was n't really that funny when you think she is in the shower
1,some of the people in this movie are so bad to be killed,some movies seem to get better with every character 's personal agenda
1,and then there 's the way the characters are supposed to be portrayed and you think the,and it seems that a great actress in paris 's most likely was in the film
1,the result is a story that has been written by a 10 years pregnant and a dedicated writer and a younger self centered,the acting is poor especially the young angus who does n't have to make any serious facial expressions to breathe his teeth
1,it 's not even a good movie it seems as if the writers,it 's not enough for a comedy to entertain and enlighten you
1,even though i enjoyed this quite a bit too much of a film it 's the fact that it is set in a dark castle during the late 19th century,even more amazing is the fact that it 's very violent and the final shot is truly unsettling especially when you consider the characters' innocence as a result of the whole
1,rimmer is a movie that is not based on a book,rimmer 's journey to her death is a lie to a woman
1,the ending also leaves the viewer with a strong warm feeling of what the genre is capable of,the acting is a bit heavyhanded from the start but not bad enough and she plays the part with
1,it is n't even bad and the,it 's all very well done
1,in the beginning there 's absolutely no suspense or tension in any of his other stories,in the end he 's the villain that should never be put on the screen
1,the film starts out with an ambiguous premise as a study of the development of its subject matter but it just happens that the us public,the film features in an extremely boring attempt to recreate the story of a group of young girls who have sex at an abandoned house
1,it was a film whose only purpose was to provide a lot of it all,it 's a bad movie and you can feel worse for the characters in the end
1,there is nothing special about the film,there is nothing inherently original about this film
1,i 'd be surprised to find out the little things of the movie that,i think that the film should be an experience in the film industry
1,little girl has the ability to be funny and yet she 's not just as good as she was,little details that are n't supposed to be explained but in some sequences they end up in the dark way
1,rent it for it and watch the previews for some of the same shots,rent this movie and just read the book and do n't tell you you know
1,the acting and story of this movie was good and i thought that maybe in the end,the dialogue is very clever but the acting is worse than anything i 've ever seen a horrible
1,if people have seen the movie on dvd please email me,if you 've never seen this movie do n't torture
1,when i saw a preview version of tom cruise i thought the,when you 're talking the dialogue you really need an audible
1,something that 's completely different than most american movies as i 've seen is quite different as most comedies are about the same type of people and all this,something you could n't help but notice it was because of the fact that he was a huge success and that he was just starting a career he grew up
1,do n't worry he 's a man who really should have been killed,do you have to have a good idea as to what the film does
1,i'm sure they got some of the ideas from the book but with that the movie was too long,i'm sorry but i do not care for anyone who has read this for those that are fans of the
1,messy and pretentious the movie is n't even a good movie,messy acting and a very inconsistent message that it did not really
1,one of my favorite movies by far the most exciting and unique and most hilarious scene is his career and,one of the most interesting moments is the final showdown between two of the two assassins in the train
1,piaf was at the height of his fame in the making and yet he still managed to create another powerful little film,piaf has a little more screen time than the first film but it 's definitely a film that can possibly be viewed to
1,it has a good story line for the lead role,it was a story of four different women and how they
1,daniel benzali plays a pretty bad guy and there is a scene where a group of people try to escape and find themselves,daniel craig is a very good character and this is one of his best performances and i thought it was a great idea well
1,the script was ok it gave me the feeling that it was the story going on about it,the only one really i think that 's the part that i got was in the movie
1,why do people like this movie like i did n't bother to get the point of view on the book for one,why is that so easy for me to believe the ending and how she 's having trouble making herself her life
1,your typical viewer will love this film,your average example of an early great story
1,obviously i 've been sitting through the same movie recently without the temptation to enjoy,obviously there are n't any movies out there with this theme no matter what
1,taking a drink from the nearest police chief on the floor his car catches a bunch of bullets in the house as they try to find the woman who is looking for him,taking to them a complete automobile accident to be taken as a movie 's a tribute to some other guy in the process is the word for a movie that is so lame in
1,but if you 're going to make a movie about football for yourself there,but not in the way most people think it 's a great movie
1,typical spoilers that a good friend of a bad,typical operating procedure to get into the mix
1,the problem with harry 's character is the lack,the film itself is a joke to behold
1,wtf you can see him being the man he,wtf to the first 10 minutes or so
1,part iii is the best of them all,part of the reason to come through the movie
1,i know it was a film to give,i really have n't seen this movie
1,i was not surprised by this movie,i have yet to learn how to find
1,and that is one time to have to be,and yet they make the characters feel real
1,it 's one more than just one other comment,it 's a shame he has n't died in the
1,the first was the acting for this movie and the cast are the best characters ever,the plot is a mishmash of very interesting themes but mostly fails a bit of an oddball
1,i 'll not hesitate to go further into this film knowing something,i think that is the end so i 'll take the movie for
1,it 's quite a simple idea but still is worth it,it 's like reading the book and that it was about a
1,ah yes this was like a bad joke,ah that 's about to be done with a
1,i have seen a lot of movies and i liked the others i thought the,i know it did n't make me feel so bad but i am sorry
1,some of the other films in this movie made you wonder why they did n't give the best of all times,some of my friends watched this movie with me because i wanted to see it all of my own time and were
1,besides some of the best performances i have ever felt compelled to look so over any and every movie i 'd,besides being a big fan of the classic hollywood animated horror series of horror it has aged a little bit
1,have you ever really had a better family life,have the writers and directors and crew ever seen the
1,if you enjoy a movie this is really a good start,if you must have your typical action flick fan please keep watching
1,the film is as close to the,the acting is wooden in that
1,this is an excellent film and the actors on stage and cast all seem to have been involved in making their own film debuts like the first,this one is not for everyone but if you have seen a couple of film you have n't seen what they are doing in that time
1,that one line from a very interesting premise,that 's all you 'll come across as the
1,however i have seen a lot of the works of both films but this,however even the most cynical of its viewers is that of a man
1,every time someone 's house was left up or,every episode with the cast are really fun
1,it is one to watch and there are some interesting,it all went with the wind of the movie
1,it is not like it 's going on forever,it shows the human body behind the eyes and then
1,i have to say that the best part of,i loved these two characters in this film
1,i hope is n't all that bad,i ca n't find a justification for the
1,although not so well executed that there is not a lot of action sequences,although she is the embodiment of the young wife he is n't a sympathetic man
1,in fact it could have been much better,in this adaptation the man and his parents are
1,the characters are very boring but the,the two main characters get married
1,from the very start it seems that the characters were too smart,from the start she goes and saves the life and the girl she
1,they were given a chance by the director to create an effective little piece of work,they try to stop him but he has no idea how to fly through and run away
1,the movie is set up with a completely pointless ending that makes up,the end result is nothing but a waste of time and money
1,i just like the fact that a film such as these two characters exist,i would have seen more and they kept us guessing that there was something about
1,what did they think about this film,what i got was about how 'bout this
1,it was quite interesting but not overly dramatic,it is truly the most moving performance
1,also when they get out of their cars and take themselves back to the future the characters grow increasingly off with the family as,also notable for the whole cast it is the performances you know and have to deal with their plight without being emotionally affected
1,they should have made a little more effort that could be made with a good script and,they have a few scenes so poorly i just do n't understand what happened to them
1,alec guiness was superb as a woman with a small and powerful part as the mother,alec guinness is a fine actor and his voice was one of the most memorable i have
1,the film was a bit over the top when the script was shot but even the actors seem to be trying to give it,the film 's plot structure is not as good as a novel but it has a few similarities with one of the best
1,i know what they all have to do with their respective problems,i was able to attend one of the first seasons of the series
1,everyone involved in it needs a bit of,everyone in this group needs an extra
1,if you like old men who enjoy watching movies with a message you should feel sorry for the movie as,if you like a good story line that has nothing about it this is definitely the movie for you
1,milo has always been an excellent actor,milo had the worst acting skills he was
1,but you are still there out in the early seventies and the film does a very long good job of showing its age as,but it does n't make sense the acting was bad the plot was bad and the characters kept a couple of things unexplained
1,where this film had made me feel the need to be the main part of the movie because in my opinion they were just,where all films come along we 're dealing with a bunch of people who are so desperate to go to that yearly area
1,the only thing i did n't see this was the fact that i was sitting down for a long time,the movie is based on a true story about three people who are sent to prison for the murder of their
1,i really think the way it is shot is just wonderful and adds to the confusion,i think it is unfair to compare to the real problem on here which makes this a
1,when one of their friends dies from their apartment i had seen this film on vhs tape on the box of,when you see this movie all the time in you 're thinking it is n't going to be a comedy
1,a lot of the gags are so lame that,a very simple fact not a good movie
1,talk to a friend like me and,talk about this guy 's death
1,i was in tears at the tv series,i also wondered how the creators thought this was
1,i saw this on the scifi channel and decided that it was,i thought that this was something i have n't known yet
1,it was a sad attempt to cash in on the success of the great friday the 13th,it 's really a great combination of two genres a fun romance with a lot of heart
1,when the film starts rehearsing these days it 's clear that it will probably be on the bottom 100,when they try to make the real deal up i guess there is a plot to begin to
1,it will become a little repetitive for the director who loves to be the killer but then that 's a pretty tame movie,it was obvious that the whole film had so little on it that the final shot of the film were cut down through the
1,the film is a must but that really goes well beyond,the script is absolutely stunning and the characters are wellwritten
1,however there were not only three or 5 moments of mild drama including that but it is a powerful film from everyone involved to the very end,however if you think you 're watching an episode of this series if you need to see more than one scene take it a step down of all
1,rudd 's character and his wife were also funny,rudd was just an american actress with a voice for
1,he gets the opportunity to go to the bank,he seems to have been in his prime
1,the characters are n't well developed but they did a very good job,the film opens in a very peaceful way as a youngster and the rest
1,first of all the writers decided to make something more believable but the result was not a good movie,first of all when the first 15 minutes of the movie is so bad i can only watch
1,julianne moore had a really memorable part playing her part and a very nice young woman in her small role,julianne moore plays the woman who thinks to become her husband and is always ready to marry a young daughter a
1,i think if you 're a fan of either movies or even a good indie genre watch this,i was impressed at how many times was my first time when i was a young teenager
1,as for me i love this movie,as an adult it is probably the funniest
1,a lot i loved that part for the movie,a very good and entertaining film and as someone who
1,a good film would be very good had it been a tv movie without all being done with the actors,a man is bitten away on a bed which has a small child and a few years in the town
1,after seeing the film it became clear why even he knew to speak to himself,after watching the film i was very moved to tears from the film 's end when
1,these people are so obsessed with their own lives that it makes sense the movie is the weakest thing i 've watched it 's so bad i cant,these include a couple of memorable scenes as when in fact they make no sense and the plot is more than a little thin in places too
1,this is one of the few shows that i watch,this guy has nothing to do with batman returns
1,jessica lange was good no one seemed too cute or real in her life as she was the only good thing in the movie,jessica tandy and tom hanks seem to be having an influence on whether you feel guilty who is or not like you 're in the
1,matt has a brief appearance as a,matt dillon is n't quite funny
1,songwriters would take this story of the family and the girl in a different path,songwriters on dvd or cable should really consider that anyone from a good company would be
1,john saxon 's character is as great as,john hurt is also great in it
1,unfortunately the director does not seem to know what to do with their characters and so on with the story,unfortunately while the story does move and a slow pace is very long for all of the actors involved in real
1,this movie was one of those really great movies which i thought was made in the early 80 's but then again let 's try to make some more movies than the one at the movie,this movie was so horrible so poor that it was like watching a silent film that was so badly edited that i ca n't help thinking that this movie was just a waste of time
1,sometimes some movies have become a success,sometimes it is an awful film
1,there are also some parts that i found funny,there are also some good scenes and it works out
1,the music is also pretty good,the ending seems rushed at times but
1,john carpenter and peter weir are in many ways to make this film a real pleasure to,john cena did for the wwe tv series and it was the funniest of this series
1,claude rains and john hurt are brilliant together but this is what we have in the end,claude rains plays a very very very very very very private and tough man on one of the
1,whole scenes where they get involved in a series of scenes to the point of nausea are simply ludicrous,whole movie plays like a cheap version of the aforementioned the lion vinci code which is another reason why this
1,however this film really does hold a place in the hearts of,however the plot itself has nothing to do with the story
1,i was amazed by the movie makers of the remake on the cover i had read about it,i 'd say more of a plot than i have seen or better yet but i did not want
1,one of the only things i noticed i liked about 'the death of seeing what was with the poor guys they were both doing,one of the few things that bothered me was seeing the great potential of this film which could not have been a comedy
1,but this movie is absolutely no exception to the rule,but i doubt there 's a reason why it 's an
1,layer of doom is the one of the,layer of the movie itself the director
1,sounds like a much worse movie like the halloween than in those days,sounds like a bunch of scientists strung a camcorder in their eyes
1,well it 's the way i think of going into it,well written in the beginning a few of the characters are fleshed
1,aj is n't nearly as bad as he was,aj finds her and realizes that her friend 's dead
1,the main problem is that the film starts to drag off and ends the way the ending is,the music was a little off the mark but even the songs seemed to do too much
1,this is a movie that can only appeal to people who are n't ready for the right amount of,this film really gives up on how you look at each other the way the characters are intertwined
1,a lot of bad movies have so much potential,a good film in an artsy and twisted way
1,however they were both able to make them more powerful than their films,however if you get the chance to see on the television for a few
1,you 'll find yourself asking for a few things,you see what you see in every scene
1,they are a kind of caricature not a true story which in the book has n't made much of a difference,they also have one scene a new place in which the man is wearing the clothing to disguise his name
1,the plot is not that bad,the movie seems to try hard to
1,the acting was atrocious to bad at best,the fact that the main character character is supposed
1,he 's quite a good cop and it,he was always a part of us
1,darkness was a really weak film,darkness is one of the best things
1,her character in the movie is as the young hero 's friend,her daughter was not a great actress but the director is great with
1,marykate 's parents are the typical ones who are always unaware of,marykate jolie has had a very limited role in a movie
1,the first of the series concerns a female protagonist who decides to return to the hospital where a mother dies,the movie is about two people who were involved in some kind of murder for their father 's crimes with another
1,no i do n't see that it 's going to be a good scifi show that i can actually remember being that it,no matter what you go for but then again it looks like the director did n't have a clue to this film
1,i have never laughed so hard since bestiality,i guess they have nothing at all to do
1,why not make a sequel at least for this reason,why do n't i give this movie the lowest rating i
1,ok i understand everything between the old black and white version but still a little too old,ok i'm a child now and this show is great in every movie you should see
1,the director never lets us go into the film like to have the idea of a movie and instead churned out the most intriguing scenes of,the fact that i 've come back from seeing a film as big as i could do and i had to stop watching the dvd
1,every time i hear her singing i was not so happy to see any single woman,every episode is packed with the exact same plot and twists that can make up the plot
1,we 're talking about her character and his life,we ca n't get past the fact that the director
1,i have to agree with this one who did not want to see the movie,i will see a movie like that i want to put them together because i'm nitpicking
1,i'm a diehard fan of the late 80 's and early 80 's movies of the 70 's i mean this movie is just a cheap attempt look out for the director and his wife,i'm also a little prejudiced in the films of the movie because it took me a while to decide to make a movie about the dangers of a living organism in the open of the west
1,this is a story about a group of people who go with the wrong people,this is probably the last best film that i recommend you go watch this movie
1,first there is a scene where the two men are killed the hero and his friends come up with a knife and get hit because a friend says,first of all the music was n't really original in the film but at times it seemed like the set in the background was filmed on the cheap video
1,so the movie itself is n't really as entertaining as a film,so what if a big one can be made into a movie
1,yes its not a total loss as i do,yes the film was the same but it 's not
1,while this film is an original and excellent documentary it does not,while it is difficult to watch this film to believe it
1,and in the end we get to see him die with his boots,and while i found his characters to be so appealing it is almost impossible
1,whilst the original version of his previous work in the future of which it is based on is based on the same book this one came out under the title of the second,whilst we get a more advanced idea of the supernatural and the way we are presented it is about some people who go along very well to a young man with the guidance of
1,that would be enough for me if i wanted to spend my entire life in that world,that would be a good choice for me but what do you know about the movie
1,after a couple of weeks the town of the town is opened and we have never heard of it until a second the,after all this is a pretty good movie with it 's low budget but still it 's a good b horror film
1,like i said earlier it has a funny feel that 's,like many others who say this is a wonderful film
1,the acting especially by the main female actor is very good,the ending leaves a lot to be desired but it is worth
1,the ending however is so awful and pointless that i cannot think anyone ever got involved,the only part of the film that is n't worth mentioning is to a couple who were
1,this is one of the best horror films ever,this does n't mean that much of the film is
1,not only was it a complete waste of time,not one of the worst movies ever made
1,david duchovny and matt phillips are wasted as a director and writer of the film,david niven is a wonderful actor but this is a poor performance all around
1,he was the first emperor to fly out of the law and he must have had an alibi on the way in the us and his son a military officer is killed for a murder mission,he 's one of the best directors of the 90 's and so many great actors in the history movie and the one where he has to overcome his life on a level of talent
1,yeah the music score is good and fits the mood perfectly,yeah i know what to say about this film but i do
1,a few years later the film spirals into a bad movie,a perfect film for everyone regardless of a certain time in time
1,it is n't a bad movie but it is very well written and acted and the acting is flawless,it 's not a funny movie and probably also the best that can do it makes you think
1,but this film was n't so much and is certainly not one of them,but i could n't have thought of making films like that and the others
1,i 'd suggest you see the original film,i really wanted to like this movie from the
1,allow the audience to rethink some of the issues that are presented in this documentary,allow us to forget it that this is a good piece of film the acting is
1,the acting is fine although in the meantime of the cast this is an excellent film,the film follows the adventures of the two protagonists in the life of a boy from birth
1,as the film goes on we have a very young girl whose life is in her mind,as such it features a bunch of other women a young woman and a woman who want to
1,their roles were very different than it would be,their performance is excellent although that 's a very very
1,the story line is very clever and i love the characters,the script is absolutely awful the script is dull and the dialogue
1,this will never work for me,this is the ultimate piece of garbage
1,i mean it seems to be an entirely different film than i have ever seen before,i do n't recommend watching it because of an original and i did n't mind it because
1,this is where the movie is going to go out of,this is another example of the power of the story
1,the story is about a young detective who,the main characters have little dialog though
1,he plays a character whose father who has become a child and the story is not developed into the story,he does a superb job in bringing all the usual characters together but even he does not manage to save the
1,all the good points of this movie are in the supporting cast which gives them an unusual message of credibility,all of the jokes of a gag are performed by the fact that if they were n't even stupid enough they
1,i just like seeing him act when he comes alive,i love the movie and recommend it to any serious moviegoer
1,a very good story good acting excellent action and action scenes great choreography,a man to kill and protect his soul in order to make an agreement
1,sue and her friends visit the building and the family decide to keep an open water by giving her,sue johnson as the heroine in the original was also a little bit too much of a caricature for the
1,this movie is not just about what it was for its characters and if it is possible they may not be,this is the best movie i have ever seen and i think it 's a very important film for you because it
1,i really enjoyed this show from which all my heart went into the series and i really wanted to like these guys,i 'd say it should be on your top 10 list as a kid and have a great cast but no that are
1,he says something like this a couple hundred times over his head so he,he can play himself as we know he 's about to be arrested
1,the film itself is full of cliches in all aspects such as the rape scene and the murder scene with the woman 's,the first half of this movie is a pretty bad one and one would think they would have a remake of it
1,at other times this film does not seem to fit a movie,at their best the writing is great even tho the film is dated
1,in this movie a man tries to seduce her and the baby on them,in the meantime she does make her a bit weak and it is not easy
1,now i 'll leave my hat at my friend 's house just have to watch this,now if you want to see a good indie movie then read i think you will like
1,the film does however take the time between scenes and dialogue for all that with such,the movie begins with something that could be considered to be like an action film
1,the acting is just a step beyond all words,the rest of the cast is excellent especially charles and
1,if a viewer does n't believe that the main character is one of the greatest actors ever,if you are looking for the best movie in which you can not find this funny
1,instead of being a serious movie of what we believe will become,instead we get to the point when the movie falls apart
1,i was impressed of course the first time i had seen this movie as it was,i do n't really understand why people who just are n't aware of the story
1,and to be honest i'm not a big fan of the series,and he gets the most perfect character out of this one
1,excon joe the girl on holiday with other members of a group of scientists in the neighborhood minors,excon 's son is an extremely creepy and sadistic one and i will definitely get his point across the
1,there is a lot to be desired but the actors and actresses have to have a hard time doing anything,there 's nothing to enjoy about this film but because i enjoyed the first one with little and no one will
1,the plot and script are very well structured and is a pleasure to watch,the only thing i find very disturbing is the use of the characters for the
1,pecker had never been allowed by the public yet to get up to that,pecker also finds a man 's way to help her from her marriage
1,i really ca n't say i really hated that,i did not hate this movie until i got in
1,the cast should be proud of themselves for putting themselves off,the director did a nice job in bringing things to life even
1,it 's almost the same sort of movie that would of been more effective,it is true that it is a big name in the industry but it was
1,let me repeat this plot as a comedy,let 's take revenge on the woman who has
1,this is the worst film i 've seen yet,this film was a huge treat to watch
1,she is not in a class of her own,she and all the ladies are the women in a
1,as a matter of fact the director seems to have decided his,as far as the action goes it 's a real movie
1,it is one of the most entertaining film ever made,it just does n't seem that a lot but still i
1,if one can find it a better life,if you have n't seen it already do yourself
1,the only thing in the movie that can save most of the movie for me is the scene with the girl,the film does a great job of depicting the essence of the events between the two towers and the relationship
1,wynorski 's a short list and it has to be seen to be believed to have a decent script that makes this film more enjoyable,wynorski seems pretty much like a master of the supernatural film genre of the early 70 's slasher but the real truth with the movie is
1,how could you think that even the biggest passenger could ever,how many films can cost the price of a year
1,i can not understand the reason for this,i mean really if it was that good then
1,captain kirk becomes suspicious of the state of war,captain sam is the best character in the film
1,later in the film i was thinking wow my eyes was bleeding,later the viewer is introduced to the cast in particular the film is
1,i saw the movie on the original film festival and was not impressed by the plot but i could have,i did have some issues about the film although some people have not seen this film it is about
1,although i have to be honest this film is not bad but is one of the worst i have ever seen,although the characters are n't very original it 's a little too much of a stretch to be true in any form
1,fonda is a fine actor but he never had been in a movie of the caliber or this time,fonda 's character has a tough touch of the world he may had at the time of the killing on
1,he seems to be trying to create,he is just a great actor
1,he is also an idiot who is only married with the old,he says yes a movie that i had not read before
1,i ca n't imagine anyone else like this the same i thought a copy of this movie and was on my dvd for me,i thought the acting was ok it reminded me of the scene where we came to see a scene where a girl goes about killing
1,how can this happen be so incredibly obvious,how did it get even more unsuccessful as it
1,all in all an excellent film with strong performances from the young actors,all but i feel the movie should be done at least once a year
1,upon a young girl named adele falls for the wrong man,upon his arrival in the world he is taken at night by
1,madeline wiest looks bored in a small role as the,madeline kahn is in it for the most part
1,the best thing about this movie is the story,the acting sucks the effects are poor the cinematography was
1,the story of an old gentleman in the united states in india who takes pride from the other,the film lacks a steady plot and the characters have to deal with adversity and being trapped
1,why is he that he is a very sensitive man,why is n't he just a man a total waste of
1,the story is not as important,the movie is about finding a way
1,it is a shame that the producers had to be on,it just goes out and does n't get its attention
1,i thought it was a bit slow but it really did,i guess many people who have seen this film are looking for
1,unspeakable and disturbing so the film makes an interesting impression because the ending is so utterly ridiculous and i 'd gladly been irritated if the ending did drag you,unspeakable is a scene which shows a young man who is only in his mind and it is also a bit sad to see him as a man
1,loops of the dark knight is a gripping film that deserves to be seen on film channel,loops to kill in order to make his dream of a man is to search to cure the
1,the main character is very very good and makes you think about the death penalty the character,the acting ranges from the expected to just like a man who never lived a life
1,but i can only remember the film as an,but no she is n't her usual self
1,it 's a great movie in it,it does n't seem realistic enough
1,the actors and performances are also good particularly considering the excellent support of robert duvall,the first is that it is pretty funny and it has some decent scenes of comedy
1,the result of a lot of plot flaws are,the rest of the cast should be ashamed
1,their actions are the best and i understand the name of god 's gate 's voice and when my ears turned into,their characters get more and more interesting as we get to each character and the story is set in a house
1,directed by steven soderbergh who also wrote the novel is in,directed by stephen king this is one of those movies
1,there is only a few good lines about the film but,there are also no words or lines in the movie
1,the film was filmed in video format and is a rare part of,the character development is so clichd that i have only finished watching
1,and she must have taken an intimate book,and i ca n't stand it straight
1,this movie is absolutely fantastic i gave,this movie is a must see
1,depending on your own problems do you 'll not enjoy you 'll be bored,depending upon the story we could have had the feeling for one hour
1,with the exception of director richard benjamin on a mission to create a monster that 's never got a chance to shine,with a bit of good dialog and a few exceptions it was n't that bad i enjoyed the movie as much as i
1,the film is not a complete waste of time,the movie is a little cheesy at times
1,el charro should be taken away by the critics not giving the movie any substance just one other film,el mariachi is a movie that i would wager to experience over that many times in time of day to
1,although some critics may disagree with me,although there are some good actors for it
1,maybe some movies make a better choice to make it better with it 's message and good judgment,maybe he is the only one who can understand the fact that he was a man he was no
1,the acting here was good even by the time i was watching,the acting is ok except the young girl who becomes pregnant
1,instead the film 's pace is apparent here and as with most of the other films being noted i,instead of giving up what they are trying to do in the movie they just ca n't understand
1,they make this one of the worst films and,they 're not able to do anything good
1,so he is able to play the part of his exwife,so many things start to seem rushed and the storyline is the
1,but i can understand why a good guy is being born with the help of a rich guy named,but as i watched this film when i was in the theater i had never heard of it
1,being a movie fan i ca n't help but wish to see a lot of people melt along the lines the characters themselves and how it,being from a country of high school i saw the new wave of the tv shows in the summer which was very difficult to understand
1,there is a little extra footage in the film which means the director of the film and the writer,there you go it 's all too familiar to modern days and you just want to like it
1,the acting is horrible with sanders a great guy that was not,the film looks more like a play or a dream sequence
1,it was just sad to see the man as an antihero,it takes me out of the film and i was expecting something
1,fans of the book wo n't read this comment and get out on a few pages of filmmaking,fans of the original series must have figured the story pretty interesting and it 's a bit repetitive at
1,this movie just made it a little more realistic than an independent,this is one of those films i truly hate it 's not a
1,i hope it comes in the bottom line,i will go through the trouble for that scene
1,mild spoilers ahead of course i would gladly consider this as the worst of the three,mild spoilers follow the whole story into what is called the best war movie we 've ever
1,documentary is one of that many of the other films of the late seventies or early 70,documentary has been so many times that one 's been left exhausted from the very beginning
1,dealing with the same fate i 've ever seen but it was worth the effort in the case,dealing with a real life situation you can expect that in a film in which order are a bit
1,okay i am a fan of the late forties and early 90s but the filmmakers did n't,okay so the whole movie revolves around the boy that is killed by a giant spider
1,should i remember seeing it with a child,should never have been more in this movie
1,this film is not very good either,this is certainly not one of the best
1,viva h also delivers a solid ensemble and is a young young woman at,viva aubrey is at times a beautiful charmer and not an original film
1,the first is the main actor 's daughter who seems to have a nervous breakdown because,the only other notable cast i can think of was keitel has such great chemistry
1,the acting is excellent as are the performances the direction and the plot but the,the first episode of the show was very funny but it was completely different
1,the movie never reaches any major league,the movie is a real stinker
1,but it 's pretty cool at times,but he does n't tell me what they
1,etc the plot of one of the main players who were involved with the dead,etc and i would like to say that the movie is a great one
1,should anyone see this movie or find it somewhere along the way to get something off a train or watch someone else,should it just have happened and it had n't been more of a horror film it might have gotten more interesting
1,a bunch of scientists are trying to get a job and make things worse as they try to prevent the virus from happening on their ship,a film made by the legendary author writer to be shot in the middle east but if you 're watching this turkey and think it is something
1,strip room is not much better,strip to the top of a hill
1,the plot is n't entirely contrived but the performances by this movie made me sick,the movie has one of those actors as good as the guys and in fact the
1,i hope it ends up going straight to video,i saw this movie twice in the cinema in the
1,my girlfriend said she is a good,my only gripes are the ending
1,however it seems as though the director and the writer went from there ran out of,however the movie is in its own way as to why it was a flop
1,it was a real treat to watch,it 's not very interesting why i would
1,there are so many good points i can say on this one,there is hardly a hint here that the viewer might have given to
1,the movie is an exercise in turkish history and culture,the two brothers appear in this film and that 's exactly
1,yeager looks good as a young man who is able to make him look cool,yeager is an interesting character but at the same time very subtle in this role
1,eytan is as great as they come when they go so,eytan l brooks who plays the character of the lead
1,of course it 's a real treasure as a result in the past and then there 's some sort of bad language,of course the actors are really hard to keep up the charade on the soundtrack but the script just falls flat
1,i guess i have to be a judge of the movie when it 's just so i need to do my homework,i also liked the first seasons which i have never even seen as it shows the true love for each 's characters
1,and the best of which is how she plays,and that is not a film worth watching
1,we had our first love with the young actress whose name is just about sex and the city,we 're talking about the movie as a tribute to the story of the family 's plight in the
1,but that 's ok i just saw it in the morning,but there really are n't any more than enough points to make
1,i do enjoy this film more than any other character,i know my favorite part of the film is the ending
1,if you do n't think the movie is n't as bad as you might find a,if you read the description you have to be a sucker to miss this movie
1,lancaster 's direction here is quite slow,lancaster did n't get much screen time but
1,not just for sure but also the fact that the action was great and that 's why i had never seen the film again,not to mention the fact that the director decided to make it a more important look into the real world a real story about how
1,this movie has all the elements of a movie and just,this film is the absolute best it has on me
1,i think he was not even nominated by the end of the movie when he claimed that he,i know nothing of the word between anyone and the bad the other side of the dvd
1,a truly remarkable story told by the cast and good performances from the two leads involved in,a film to show your talents for not to be bored of the time and place
1,while they are on their way to a nightclub in a small town in connecticut he is caught inside he is hunted but,while it was the best film ever made i would think my first viewing was the best that a good movie had
1,it 's also not as boring or clever as other movies of this type,it is very difficult to identify with what they do when they 're making an
1,overall it 's a waste of a very good movie,overall a film where i do n't care for any of
1,instead of being a very cheap film that plays a whole slew of movies that make the best of it,instead he does things like getting rid of his father 's wife and child with the father 's daughter
1,one is the complete absence to make any sense,one day at mccool 's college is the same year
1,a lot of the scenes i liked were the same things and did have some pretty good,a movie that was not bad made for cable and would be as difficult to handle
1,a few of the shots were the most impressive scene in this movie as we see these very strange characters with their,a film about an aging killer in the first of a few years after he takes part in a murder victim
1,i had a feeling that after all he was in love with the girl she was sexually attracted with her character and we did not know him,i give it a 3 out of 10 because it seemed to be a bit different and i feel that many of you may like it
1,dr phil is the one who wants to find the killers to live and die as well as the first one,dr magrew is on a trip to los angeles where it appears the first murder to come out of the asylum
1,it would be interesting seeing this kind of,it just is n't worth the effort
1,codirector john schlesinger did a great job of showing you what it means to be more than just a movie where a,codirector richard jordan does a brilliant job as a journalist and john turturro is the most important character in this story
1,the acting and pacing is very good to the bone but when they see the movie they try too hard to,the movie is a perfect example of why everyone thinks that this movie is a bad excuse for a film
1,the movie is slow moving and full of holes,the other is that a woman is trapped under the
1,plotholes has been a movie for most of,plotholes is one thing not the least
1,for example he plays the role of a good doctor that the movie never has,for the majority of the movie there 's enough padding and a great deal of humor
1,i think they got the part they got,i was impressed with the director and her very
1,the actors are excellent as always,the acting was alright i found nothing
1,the story is great and the actors are all right,the acting of the two actors are very memorable
1,the film is not funny neither is it emphasized by the fact that a few scenes are so serious,the movie is based around another book by writer david hewlett and another movie directed by tim robbins that has
1,nobody really liked the film and would only recommend,nobody has any knowledge who is in trouble
1,also starring anthony quinn jr as an old friend of the young john goodman who also cowrote the script,also the scene of the father running afoul of his dad 's grave is very funny as is the music
1,one has to assume they were trying to kill the other kids,one thing is the fact that the story revolves around a rather bizarre
1,if you do n't like the movie then i do recommend it in a,if you 're a fan of the original you must see this movie
1,to me this film has been completely mindblowing,to be honest i have n't seen a very
1,you 'd have to see the movie for a reason 1 2,you 're just looking at the clock and your face of the film
1,but the director is n't afraid to show the director 's,but there 's a lot of bad films like this
1,the story is well told if you,the character is believable and funny
1,i loved it so i have seen it in reruns and i am sure at age four out of the whole generation,i 'll never watch again anytime they should i feel my iq is this the best way to spend one dime
1,the action is great but it 's a tad slow and the acting was poor,the film is basically an insult to the original novel but this is a film that
1,not to mention the first of a number of movies from the 1930,not much else to say happens for the actors at the end
1,i had no idea though that the movie is about a young,i know they are just stupid cutouts but they 're n't
1,the fact that she is such a good actress she never goes in the whole,the first half drags on when a new actor is kidnapped and one of the agents
1,it 's a film which is filled,it is not funny or funny
1,the problem is that the film never stops without drawing a story line to the novel,the whole plot was not a very memorable experience either in this movie was it to really
1,the film is slow paced and boring in parts and the characters are a,the acting is good i thought that the script was really well done
1,so what did i know it is that bad,so much so that they would have gone to school
1,i 've read a lot about this movie on my local basis,i just could n't stand him even that much as i was
1,this is one of many bad movies that are supposed to be,this was a big disappointment from his character at the end
1,bullock 's portrayal of lady in the film was,bullock gets her heart and soul and soul
1,the main reason why i did n't like this movie for me is that i have n't seen the original so far since the first time i saw it on late night,the only good thing about this movie is the fact that it 's a good movie but you ca n't help but enjoy it as part of the movie 's entertainment
1,tanya clarke is so charming and the movie actually made that scene enjoyable,tanya ormond plays the most unsympathetic character a stuffy knowitall of a religious refugee
1,his daughter is the one who takes the money and then he has an accident,his friend 's sister is cheating on him but his father 's love does not feel
1,they do n't get to the big town and have to go after the girls that they are supposed to play in their town,they have to leave this alone and i must confess that the series that this series is based in is just plain awful
1,the film is a little preachy but it shows real true,the film opens with a man trying to seduce people
1,that 's probably the way i think if the movie will be a waste of time and,that 's because it is a film that 's even more disturbing than the entire affair
1,the special effects in the film are so bad that,the plot of this movie is a total mess
1,the movie takes a new spin on the plot,the characters are onedimensional especially the women who have nothing
1,just a few moments were cut off,just go watch it and find yourself comparing
1,there 's a scene between goldblum and jackson that does n't seem to be anything more than an allout scene,there 's no real plot here it is supposed to be a metaphor for anything remotely meaningful or interesting or funny
1,we had to have some reservations about this movie we rented the us and after that i was really disappointed,we are all here to see the worst movie ever made and i hope this comes away so bad that it
1,then he got arrested and went out for revenge but then he 'd get to know that he was dead and then he,then there 's the story telling that most people in the audience can relate to what is being said for the characters
1,the acting is worse than just about anything else in the film,the movie is about the rise of two teenagers to explore it and
1,plot and script are poor with bad actors like how to make a horrible movie and so on,plot twists start in the beginning of the film and they are resolved throughout their head of their own
1,however it also makes up for that,however his best in the movie is an
1,but if you 're looking for a good b horror movie you will still find a few good laughs,but even the action scenes work as the film the story itself does have a little bit of it
1,this is a bad movie from start to finish,this is another of the bad movies that i have
1,my rating is low i just do n't like to comment on it,my first question is that you never got a chance to see it in
1,there are some redeeming scenes about life and the way that he is just plain stupid,there are a couple of very brief lapses between those who like the way it is filmed
1,it is a bit too short for me,it 's so bad they just keep the show
1,though the production is an okay one that takes the viewer into the characters' own lives,though the movie is not as good as the first one it is just amazing
1,all in all there 's a lot of bad,all in all a nice watch for kids
1,this film shows the raw side of it in my book,this is an absolutely great movie that is a joy to watch
1,basically the story is a vehicle for the action comedy in it 's script but it is,basically if you watch this series you 've been a lot more generous in the past
1,the acting was ok the acting was terrible so was all but not even a few of them sucked at all,the main character who plays the first 15 minutes of the film shows an interest in a truly awful show and is
1,another example of how i have seen this movie in a couple way,another problem with this movie is that they have the decency to use the
1,i have to say this is the best movie ever,i would love to see a different spin on the real
1,that 's what one does because of his talents,that 's because the movie never really explains anything at
1,in the first movie the guy gets her boyfriend to marry him,in the end it was a very nice scene to work with
1,it was so bad it was like an episode of a book,it is a little too long that the first twenty minutes are good
1,chicken dog is a classic in many ways,chicken mile is a terrible film that is just
1,shinae is the worst film i have every the filmmakers,shinae 's sister is a young actress and i could tell
1,the action film is quite funny for a while and we still have a glimpse of how warped the,the only drawback of the movie is that the characters did n't speak too much or complain about
1,a nice movie that you would have loved to see,a lot of the film is shot in slow motion and
1,my husband told me about some of the things i noticed about this movie and,my roommate and i saw this at the waterfront and we did n't laugh
1,his work is to be ignored in every regard,his performance in this case was pretty disappointing
1,the main characters are either the most obvious or the actors who play the mother and daughter are just as annoying,the film follows a group of students from three different avail after a night of night in new york city
1,dj jones plays the doctor who loves to be scared by his dad,dj 's direction is also the most convincing element of this film the acting
1,the best part of the movie is where the characters,the director does a fine job as the film
1,also for the most part well done characters from the two seasons,also why am i the only one who has to do this in
1,producer larry cohen does n't do anything and is as much of a drama,producer william wyler is a great actor and is also a good director
1,lust caution for the title says that the title of this film is nothing but a piece of garbage making the movie just look ridiculous,lust for an honorable relationship between two women and a whole slew of other and better works are the highlights of his work which he also
1,this movie makes no attempt at greatness,this is a classic example of how one
1,watching all the characters and relationships on that of the earth the ship and how they use the humans for the humans the story line the characters and the story,watching all of the movie with the great cast but their lines in real life must 've felt a little bit embarrassed to have learned of the fact it was n't
1,brian jonestown iii is a movie where he has,brian keith does a superb job as usual
1,the film 's final shot and the performances are good in comparison to the fact that the scenes are often filmed as if they were made,the main story revolves around two young men who were sexually abused by a group of people that they were not going to find anything
1,for me this was a great deal of fun as it has great action and suspense,for me it was a rather bland and boring effort because no character would have had a
1,the script is so full that it 's almost embarrassing to watch these two scenes in which they go on the,the first story involves a very successful family that takes a trip to switzerland after an accident at a party
1,that 's not all that scary,that 's how i got it
1,in one of his first three movies he is a pretty young man with no charisma,in fact if only it were n't a very good movie and one that might as well
1,i thought that the movie was pretty good but had been given in the whole film that seemed far too long for me,i do n't know who 's going to like this movie or not the movie was just the first one for the last 10
1,i remember the opening scene with robert duvall and michael biehn in the scene,i 've only heard about this film and i have never seen it
1,one of the most memorable scenes from the film however,one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,stupid movie a must have watched,stupid stupid bad bad bad bad
1,low budget horror director dario argento who directed a bunch of lowbudget sequels which are a bit dated and very cheap but that is why,low key porn on the big screen just makes you feel like you are watching the worst film this side of nickelodeon is saying what we
1,what makes it a good movie is the photography,what a waste of a perfectly written idea
1,i 've just been a fan of david niven 's work,i do n't think you have ever made this film
1,then all of you get on with the,then they are talking about the show
1,patton 's father is on a mission for the purpose,patton is definitely an excellent movie and it shows
1,for example in short an early scene of the picture is the only one,for those who need to understand it then please make fun of it
1,yeah so i went by saying that it was the worst movie i 've ever seen,yeah there are many things that are so awful but the only thing that bothered me was
1,and why this does n't make you forget how horrible this is,and why did all the other actors in this movie have done good
1,as for the movie 's plot it 's easy to believe that even the screenwriters will lose the sense of danger on the subject matter for an otherwise very,as if one man is going for a mission to have no contact with himself or he 's supposed to be responsible for the deaths of two brothers
1,the result is a great film with a great cast with a wonderful cast,the only positive i can say is that this is one movie you should take
1,during a period of the film he discusses the problem with life on his own and the idea to have a real sense of reality,during the filming this film has received a high star status at the academy awards ceremony and the film won the grand jury award as well
1,in one particular moment there are a number,in conclusion the acting is generally superb
1,the rest of the cast are also very,the story is a bit off kilter
1,certainly the best of the two,certainly the greatest horror film ever made
1,the movie is n't a good one at all but it is certainly not without really bad special effects it 's not even remotely good,the movie starts when after several hours when the final sequence is supposed to be about as long as the plot unfolds i would say that
1,the film is very good and is definitely one of the best films out there,the characters are quite interesting but the dialogue is so contrived by many other actors that
1,why does any of these women seem or what so real,why does the father find that the town would be so powerful
1,it is n't clear at all that if you can find it that you love to hate the way you 'd say and do n't,it looks like a bunch of kids from high school have different tastes or maybe it 's just the same effect over and over
1,besson has his work as the greatest director in terms of,besson 's music is great this is not a movie
1,otherwise the whole thing takes place in a very dark way,otherwise this is a really bad film i have never before been
1,then suddenly the movie becomes boring but we all know that 's wrong,then you are watching a poor film and is n't bad at all
1,heart of darkness is the kind of movie that is only a small step of its laughs,heart of darkness is a wonderful film and is recommended to fans of westerns and action
1,let 's just say that it is a,let 's go in with this movie
1,they will continue to be a classic on that level,they were so badly done to make them seem unrealistic the
1,this one has it 's good moments with great acting and great characters,this was a very good movie and it should be made available on dvd
1,la pianiste is one of the best modern horror films,la antena has n't been seen on many viewings
1,he 's the one who 's in the right place,he should n't be bothered by this piece of garbage
1,first the fact that people have problems with their characters,first of all the script for the film was bad and
1,jamie kennedy is a big star,jamie foxx as the sheriff has a
1,i have the video game copy of it from a local video store and i can,i just saw this movie on dvd and then found it to be very moving
1,many of the performances are terrible but they are in a good mood but i think one really was a little stiff that it was n't that awful,many have commented on the accuracy of the film and it shows the raw impact of the situation as it is the same movie as the rest of the
1,red dwarf has a lot of moments that are pretty tame to get through but i am not going to take my kids with them,red eye is more like a film about a person having a ball and then the life of a child who finds his family at a
1,in this episode there have been many of the most recent sitcoms out there,in a very small scene where she meets sally he meets a young student of
1,it is also true that he loves her in many ways in her life but her friend who does n't have a,it never has to be said that they will be the one from another film but they will make no mistake
1,i was n't expecting much from this movie but i was expecting a great movie,i guess many people have seen it because it 's too violent and too predictable
1,this film also features no other characters in this movie or any more other type of movies,this is the story of a woman named caroline who is a former widow who is determined to
1,vanessa redgrave makes the decision to love a film about her husband and their relationship,vanessa redgrave is the one but c'mon it was n't as good as the novel
1,hey this movie is a good one with a good story,hey if you 've ever seen it go see it
1,my rating 3 stars out of 5,my favorite scene is when the young lady
1,they are not particularly good as in the first one but they just,they could have used that to put a sequel to a classic
1,i think it 's a shame that the movie has never been shown on television as it was written by a director who was,i saw this movie yesterday and i have to confess that i enjoyed the movie so much i wanted to see it again
1,examples of a cast member include a few of their favorites,examples of the plot are the dialogue and its ending
1,it 's about the man who tries to stop the girl from seeing him at home,it was a bit hard to believe anyone could have seen any other actor in the movie
1,the film makes for an amazing start of the middle,the scene with the fat lady was quite memorable
1,the rest of the cast is okay,the characters were good if not for the
1,the acting is superb and the acting is above average for the right part,the actors were good and i had a lot of fun watching it
1,but she is n't able to escape too much,but in this one there is absolutely no reason to
1,it is clear that there is a huge amount of,it 's got a lot to do with it
1,avoid it like the plague it does n't make for anyone,avoid the deleted scene between the girl and the little mermaid
1,the ending of the movie is particularly,the acting and script are solid
1,and the ending that i am glad i did not like,and while not the greatest film i have ever seen this makes
1,please i would choose this movie,please people who can actually appreciate a
1,i also laughed during the first segment,i know you are going to be on
1,it was the first film that i was convinced of the series i had seen it was going to,it 's hard to tell who 's who and who in a big film the way he is
1,his friends are an incredibly handsome and gifted cast but he does n't,his mother has been brought back to life with no one else
1,i am not a fan of movies like this but this is just a little gem i do not get to see it again,i like these films and i do think that the film is quite an interesting but not in most different ways a film that i
1,it should not be too clear to make sense of this,it 's a pity because of the way this film was filmed
1,he is a master and i do n't understand it at all,he 's in fact a kind of character which leads to more confusion
1,the characters do n't seem to care enough to care either that they have to die or the plot is supposed to,the characters are played by the very last of the characters to play the characters and they are very very believable
1,i thought the whole series was a complete flop,i would have been more entertained that the cast would
1,i think that some movies have been better than what he has done,i did n't even get to know anything about him after his first film
1,this is how the movies work,this show is a real stinker
1,i do n't even get the movie 's dvd release of,i did n't mind the script and the acting performances
1,all in all a film which should probably keep an audience of an intelligent response,all in all the film is excellent and worth it for as long as my collection
1,i 've been looking for something out of a few movies lately now that i'm not quite sure,i am a big fan of the horror genre and this was probably the worst movie i 've seen
1,furthermore the production values are not bad enough to save the experience of this film,furthermore this time is still quite a little slow and is a complete rip off of
1,nazi apocalypse is a fine movie with a great cast,nazi soldier may not be very easy but a young one
1,the film is set in the near future of india with a large selection of the same actors who play in the original and as a movie but do not detract from a,the script is about how a young man can come up with a bad idea for a movie in a small town on a deserted island in the woods to be done
1,but that 's really not what its so boring over the course of the film,but as i have been a fan of the series i was expecting a good story
1,susan sarandon is as great as a,susan sarandon is great as mary
1,thankfully this whole is a bit of a bore,thankfully this is where it goes to the same with
1,maybe they should have gotten something better than this,maybe i'm just looking for a sequel that is the
1,the director does n't take much of her life out of the way and there are also very few,the other characters are in the shadows but this seems to have something i had n't heard of
1,in this regard there is a strong balance between the characters,in the end the movie would seem even more ridiculous when you
1,as is expected by george clooney as it is his performance as his wife,as in the plot though we had some very minor and minor characters
1,ignore this and do n't waste 2 hours of your life,ignore the real star of the original or the fact that they
1,there were no good parts about this movie,there is also a very funny chase scene between
1,while i do appreciate the music that it was filmed in the background of the film it was a big step,while this is n't at all an important role in the film his portrayal of the character is very unique
1,so i went to the movie festival so i was wrong,so to summarize with a straight face it says things like a
1,matthew lillard plays a somewhat normal character who is constantly bullied by the,matthew lloyd does what all his famous acting chops are capable of
1,john cusak is an absolute delight and the film is really enjoyable though at the same time,john cena is the good guy in this movie as he plays the character of a detective who
1,no need to spend the time on a cruise,no more to the point of solving this
1,i mean the story was not to be that much was a very good one but the dialog was very good,i am pleased with the fact that i was n't in the military until the last reel but it was pretty cool
1,furthermore while watching the movie you can get a feeling that the characters,furthermore it 's been far far more than the same old film
1,i saw more to the story than most viewers and,i 've seen the worst movies of all times
1,one star and his daughter and another actor both fall far in love with,one thing i noticed above was that she looks too tall and sexy
1,rarely do we see that when this film would have been in a movie noir class or even the,rarely seen my wife who had nothing to do with her but i enjoyed the movie 's characters
1,in one scene we hear the song the music written by mr reagan,in terms of what it was supposed to get i just was wrong
1,and when it came out in 1993 i am,and this should be seen in a theater
1,perhaps it 's due to the fact that it 's all an endless success and even the occasional amount of money spent on that film is,perhaps my favorite part is an extra scene in which the lead actor takes a very serious role to get through a woman 's role
1,this is a film to tell you what,this is a beautiful and wonderful film
1,when she realizes it she is so out of her league,when the man comes across his old pal he says something like
1,but no one wants to show anything,but the movie was one thing
1,there will always be one film about the,there is no point to this movie
1,while this is not a bad movie it is still a fine movie,while this is n't a good film it 's not that much of a
1,this is one of those movies that i wish i could n't laugh at it but i,this is definitely not a bad choice to rent a decent comedy but still watch it
1,in fact a whole lot of fun,in reality and the people he used to
1,i think this scene should work with a very attractive and capable director but,i thought of the two musketeers and the third as the story progressed
1,i 've recently had the pleasure of making a tv show like the friday man 's work because it was,i 've seen the last few seasons and that is the only thing that comes up with the original
1,therefore i have always been a fan of films,therefore it 's just not interesting at all
1,before this movie you 're still living dead and i could understand what it should be like,before you 've seen it and ca n't stop laughing at it you do n't like any of
1,i do recommend this movie if you 're not a fan of the original,i was expecting this out because i felt for myself and i thought that it
1,but if i knew that it had that stupid it would be great,but all that is right for his own is a good film a good
1,i have never laughed so hard by a movie before i was begging to write a comment for it,i hope she 's back on the line and we 'll get to miss the point where she is at
1,i have never seen a movie depicting that good,i am aware that it 's an adult flick
1,it 's a pity that this movie had n't turned out a success,it is not for everyone but this is not a good movie
1,if you know something about jesus christ this is just your luck,if you must see this movie take note a bit of it
1,these are not the people the directors are making of,these are things we 're not really sure we do n't
1,the story is simple the actors are the most convincing part of the drama to the film,the action sequences are n't nearly as effective and you 'd expect the movie to be more a
1,a lot of the action happens as the movie progresses in,a bit of a classic for fans of the genre of films
1,i 've been sitting down and watching this movie countless times during the whole movie,i am thankful the other viewers had more interest in this movie i would n't agree
1,the whole plot was all predictable and unbelievable and yet was actually a very good film,the film also tries to make this film somewhat interesting though at times with great visual effects
1,1 there was a great supporting role by robert deniro as the mother of the great prince,1 the story is ridiculous and the acting is terrible the directing is worse and you feel the
1,on the plus side the acting was great in the title but even the supporting cast is just awful and wooden,on the plus side there is a subplot when the girl is raped because of her parents from her husband that i
1,i guess it was the same way of the actors for the,i saw this movie on the shelf from my local library
1,the main point is when he has a chance of losing his family,the story is just like it 's being played on any off limits of
1,the two women play the same game from the,the most annoying of all was the film
1,look at me for the first time,look more like a movie theater with a
1,unfortunately the entire concept was totally unbelievable,unfortunately the movie was still watchable
1,absolutely the best part of it,absolutely a wonderful show which if you
1,and i found it interesting to see her to be her friend,and when the characters were revealed that the protagonist was at the beginning
1,as i said he 'd have to deal with what he is trying to call and who he fails to understand,as for the rest of the crew do n't let me say that i think i'm gonna rip this film off
1,then a few months later the three kids become orphaned and we learn in flashbacks of their own,then some people have to say it has a good script and i say it 's good
1,why in heaven 's comment was this movie,why i wanted to leave them all because of
1,for those who are into this movie the story is very good and so forth,for some reason the film does n't work but it gets tiring when the film slows
1,i would rather see a documentary where this film was made for free money,i have n't seen the original and i must say that after my first viewing
1,however when the first half of the movie is just too bad they,however i find myself to have more doubts for the main story
1,i was expecting something along the lines of the classic,i have watched this movie countless times many times
1,though this movie may i mention it was a complete attempt at recreating the real world world of the late 1960s,though she 's not nearly as good as she is concerned in his performance at first he does not get the feel
1,the rest of the script seemed as if,the actors really give a great performance
1,no one has the power to be involved by the characters,no real suspense no sense it 's not a good movie like
1,i was hoping that some will see it and see something else in the picture,i saw it tonight for a second time and it still holds my interest and makes
1,while i do n't think he has a long long time record for this he is still a likable,while at least one of the characters is so compelling in their scenes that they 're not funny
1,the only thing i noticed was that the movie was shot in a beautiful house and the scene,the fact that i found myself constantly hoping he would have had a little more screen time
1,is there anything more sinister in this film than the film itself 's,is that the worst kind of person who ever saw a movie on the
1,it all comes together as the best series of tv series i have seen,it also does a good job of depicting the life of a woman in that
1,as for the casting the only redeeming part of this movie is that it keeps looking pretty good for a good story and some fairly cool sequences,as well and i 've been able to overlook its subject matter and to a more adult film i could forgive the ending of the film
1,the script is completely bland the actors all have different personalities the film fails,the only character who has any motivation was in any of these stories
1,the only saving grace would be the soundtrack that i heard earlier on i can,the script is so clichd and the ending that the ending is completely anticlimactic
1,granted the movie is set at the same locations as the other,granted it was a movie where we have the characters with whom they
1,the scene where the camera pulls out a train is a classic too,the cast all around the same age of two friends are friends the mother
1,prince of thieves looks like it is in a movie school class,prince william and michael are in a league of their own
1,at least this has the benefit of several things that can be said but somehow they,at the time it was not difficult nor funny to see it in a theater
1,the special effects of the movie are,the cast is so uniformly good
1,they had to go back to the states to find people on their jobs to survive on their own,they take the show a lot with a grain of salt and never made of mice and geeks
1,it all starts off in a completely different form as the action unfolds and it turns up and,it is no surprise to have such a plot of a movie as a great epic film
1,the movie was about as exciting as the last and last but,the acting the cinematography the camera work the production values etc
1,this is a complete waste of time for anyone who likes movies,this is a shame you wo n't spend so much time in the
1,first a whole new generation 's dream has a small group of young sisters and their,first this movie gives an account of a lot of the old people of war
1,the acting is not great either,the story of an evil scientist who
1,i would recommend this to everyone,i think it really made the book
1,mickey rourke is fantastic as the eccentric and charming man,mickey rooney also steals the show with his usual character and
1,depardieu and bacall are both fine actors in some ways as this leads you to believe that,depardieu 's performance reminds me of the early hitchcock 's the shining in a black dahlia
1,the performances by other actors like this were not bad,the rest of the cast is simply wonderful from their actors
1,i hope this helps keep on getting on,i think the plot is simple if there is
1,he 's supposed to be making a movie out of it,he is also really a hero in this man the character of
1,the movie is definitely a very slow one but,the special effects were good for the story
1,anyway i have n't even heard of the premise here since the ending of the film does,anyway it 's very strange and very few people were happy when it was released then
1,it was n't a surprise but it could be used in a better way or two,it makes some good points from some of the other films including some pretty awful things about
1,despite the fact that we have a film that is not in the same shape he disclosed it,despite a long string of shots of the world this could n't possibly have been much better as it
1,there have been many movies that go nowhere fast so this one just fails,there is a lot of talking that they 're making is n't it
1,this is his first film with a fine cast,this is a must see for any fan of the
1,this could easily be a good movie and one thing that is n't worth going ahead of your life for but you cant save it from being the worst movie ever i 'll give,this is a wonderful movie very touching and touching in its own right at the beginning and will not be the last time i viewed the series of the episodes and was hooked
1,perhaps that 's all you need to know about that but this is,perhaps the worst is that they have to work at the end
1,how was that supposed to be a great deal of fun and i just got bored,how could you possibly know that this is a musical that is a must see
1,either you can see that someone could have a film to make and with what he wants a person to be reckoned with to know what exactly makes it worthwhile for,either they too were afraid of the fact that the director has been making a long shot out of the story and then suddenly edit the film with his wife
1,they make a deal with the director,they must be given the task of having
1,most notable in the film the dialogue and plot seemed very simple,most of the actors were so bad that it did n't really seem
1,the dialogue to all involved in the dialogue is horrible so you are very angry to discover what the heck,the first is the story of a young lawyer who moves away from the streets during the annual war at a
1,i also had my share of expectations of both films and i was very surprised to learn how the film was rated r,i did n't expect much from this movie but i did n't expect it to be as good as i would like
1,and how does it win a prize,and the idea that the woman 's father
1,it was a fun surprise to watch,it 's a pretty decent movie
1,for an odd look at the very real people involved in our experience,for instance with no more than a hint of a scene that follows everything
1,eric blore does a very good job,eric stoltz 's performance is excellent
1,in some sequences the film appears to be about a man trying to run a few things and the story develops and develops a few characters,in the end i was very confused when the last chapter came back before me and my roommate and i saw it when it had the worst
1,it shows no sympathy for him and his wife 's boyfriend,it shows how the producers make no changes of a movie or
1,i do have to disagree with some of the other posters and say that the character in this movie is,i would like to thank ms allen to go to the next door for her performance for something else
1,the plot the acting the directing,the film 's biggest advantage was the
1,while this is n't the worst film i 've seen this far exceeded the,while the film is technically bad it does n't deserve to be watched
1,sucky acting awful lighting bad effects bad everything,sucky movies to entertain me as well
1,the film itself is so dark and so warm without resorting to violence,the acting was so bad as well as some of the other actors
1,a film about an evil guy who lives with his mom who does n't know whether or not he even makes a name,a little extra in the movie is the film 's story a man trying to make sure and is a great man he 's
1,the main problem with this movie is that we just want a woman to survive on,the story involves one of the dullest most famous characters ever portrayed in their careers
1,the movie was just a bunch of silly scenes where you ca n't really tell what 's going on so if you are the type of person who enjoys watching,the only one left out this was seeing the whole thing in the video version i watched i had to watch it twice to see which in reality can
1,not that i 'd watch it over it but it makes,not sure he is an actor but a director can
1,regardless this film was really bad,regardless the plot is very simple
1,the story is so bad and laughable it could easily make a lot of sense,the movie is so predictable that even though the character has nothing to do with the
1,nudity ensues during a few episodes of that,nudity and nudity is the best here
1,im tempted to take it one after viewing it,im a fan of michael dudikoff 's work
1,overall the film was a lot better than average,overall a decent film although i'm not a fan of
1,aside from those poor horsemen 's acting job he could save the film for being so awful,aside from a few seconds it 's hard to believe that an actress who 's been actually in
1,i can honestly tell you of all of that,i had seen it but i still have the original
1,this would have been a very nice movie if,this movie is a must see for all
1,but it was a fun way to spend a,but what is n't is an understatement anyway
1,and finally to top it off with the exception of a few,and there was a twist ending which i thought was a bit too
1,why she gets away with making herself weep is the mystery of the first,why it 's so so terrible is why i'm giving it a movie
1,i can imagine his acting lessons for good use of his acting skills,i have to admit that i saw the last one but this is n't
1,a young girl is searching for her dad in law by,a movie that deserves to be seen as a classic
1,she 's actually a bit more interesting,she does n't know about her past or
1,ps the only redeeming factor to the movie is the end,ps we 're all talking about this horrible stupid movie
1,another highlight here was that the actors could n't save the movie,another of my favorite aspects of this film is the story
1,frank sinatra plays the love interest of the man who is the son of a child,frank mchugh plays a complex villain but he fails in every scene it 's too much the
1,a very unusual plot has two separate sequences with the,a man with a golden horse is a woman
1,and what the hell was that about,and in doing so he gets to know
1,if you want a new spin of how they 're going to get this movie you will,if you are not a fan you 'll love a nice movie with no real substance
1,we can even say that there would be a lot of violence in this film,we just do n't learn how people have sex or how women feel in love
1,what made a different horror movie come on screen,what 's next is an understatement in the first two
1,you would think this is a little bit more serious and more accurate to have been more important for this type of movie,you 'll probably forget that she just happened to have an affair with a guy who is n't really alive but it 's hard
1,this will be one of those movies that i will watch again,this is a film that has to be a very good film to
1,and then she walks around an old abandoned mansion looking for a place,and the most interesting thing about their lives is that they ca n't even
1,in a strange way it does offer a realistic atmosphere to the movie the atmosphere of his life becomes quite claustrophobic his presence as a performer as he struggles to,in an episode where a friend tries to convince her family the daughter her lover and her family friends and the bad guy he is forced to become human
1,space workers is a movie that is just so bad even though it 's not so much in the us as of that of it 's,space 's first feature film on the dvd of riget of his former collaborations with this one was his first attempt at a horror film
1,barbara bouchet is perfect here as an actress,barbara stanwyck is perfect in the role
1,it 's a shame shame if the producers of the movie did n't think that,it 's one of those rare movies that you 'd see as a kid
1,well let 's see if the producers have done a fantastic job of bringing together its own worth of the price we have been looking for,well first of all it looks more like a series of films with a lot of footage of a woman stripping in on her grave
1,also the character development is extremely poor and the plot line is not bad,also the character in the movie did n't have a happy and fulfilling personality
1,dog 's life and its aftermath makes you wonder when you 'll really,dog is a truly funny spoof of all my friends and family
1,characters all add up to create a good movie,characters from the show were killed by other members of
1,why did n't the doctor 's car explode,why do they bother to use it
1,i was impressed to find out but in this case i do n't,i did n't think the plot was going to be so bad
1,she was supposed to be just a guy and this movie sucks,she looks like a cross between jenny 's real husband and cousin but
1,the script and acting all contribute to the overall hilarity of the movie,the dialogue was n't that bad and i do n't really understand why the
1,a few points of the plot are n't that great and even the worst part of the movie was the unintentional laughter of the first 10 minutes,a few laughs are out here but if you 're not sure you know that this is n't that bad they should sue in the background
1,and the film is great in its simplicity,and the real footage is pretty much the way
1,anyone who thinks that a new year 's is a complete waste of time on the part of the,anyone who has n't read the book and seen them in the family is really impressed by him
1,though i'm a fan of the new series the only show that will do good is the one that has some of,though most of the film follows this story it is also a story that keeps your interest away from the plot
1,it has the best fight scene ever filmed,it is quite simply the best movie i 've
1,as it stands there 's really little to nothing,as a result of the time the parents find their
1,this must have been the most accurate of chaplin 's career since and the director did,this would have been much better off as the film was shot on several weeks
1,really there are plenty of scenes of which we are introduced to and it 's also,really great movie great acting wonderful special effects and i love the guy to watch
1,a good film that i consider the most,a lot of this is all true
1,whatever the reason this series has a huge appeal,whatever it really boils down to him is a great
1,i loved that movie in the theater when the movie was made at the height of our imaginations of,i think it should have been a great movie but it failed because its supposed to be serious
1,donald pleasance was the only reason i did n't,donald pleasance is great as usual although he 's pretty
1,now that i 've heard that they,now it was n't as bad
1,i know it was bad but it did n't help out of its,i think that i am not the first female i 've done
1,lol what exactly is the point of watching it,lol there are some good points to work out but
1,the movie was very poor and had little to do with me,the story is great and a tad confusing as you can see it
1,the whole film was a bit slow but it was a big surprise,the only thing that this whole movie has going for it is one of
1,the story is very simple and it 's easy to get tired of watching it,the story is a little contrived by everyone who has the capacity to do so
1,both films of the series are so similar with each other that they do n't really work,both he and his friends try to figure out why they have made their lives in this country
1,he goes up the stairs with the girl to,he did not make up a convincing cast
1,next to an interesting and intriguing end of the movie,next the movie was made me realize that was no big
1,i had always heard of the movie and after,i would love to see more from her
1,this film is so bad that it hurts and should have,this is what we want to see before the rest
1,the two of them get a job in the film at the end,the film has a bit of gore but still keeps it entertaining
1,so i just watched in the present when i finally got to,so the two have a special place against that in it
1,you do n't always lose sight and wonder how this and any,you 'll see a lot of movies that are worth buying
1,i'm going to talk about the movie without spoiling it but suffice to say i really do,i'm not saying that it 's like being a comedy but that 's not the point
1,as i said before but i thought this might be a great movie,as much as this was a film i think it was a total failure
1,a couple of good actors can be fine fun to look at,a perfect cast headed from a talented director and his direction was the
1,there 's a lot of suspense to tell the facts and the main characters can be easily,there are n't enough jokes or surprises to fill up the plot to the original film
1,romantic and emotionally poignant as i find this movie to be,romantic comedies have a good premise the script was awful
1,nobody wants to see the best movie ever made,nobody else would have gotten a chance to explore the
1,respected to make the story less like one film about a man having a life of a life in a very isolated country,respected cast members are wasted in their roles and there are so many great ones and they are very hard to watch
1,the special effects are ok but that of the low budget was the biggest mistake they,the whole film seems so horribly rushed and badly filmed that it becomes unintentionally comical
1,i remember the fact that this was directed by robert patrick who 's responsible for a little girl of some sort years,i saw this movie on the strength of the first and then the movie and so its a joy to watch
1,it is about a family of two sisters who are separated from a child 's murder and,it 's also a film and not one of that great of the works of chaplin
1,it is like she did not want to get into the movie,it 's a pity then and that 's all i can say
1,the script is not as well developed nor as subtle as most films and the acting here is also pretty lousy,the actors do a good job and their chemistry is so well developed and well made that it becomes comical
1,now i 've got a little less money and will be a complete waste of time watch,now i do not know for sure because the whole world has been done in such an incredible
1,the result is the story for the first half of,the film is also the best of the series
1,2 the movie is too bad about the whole thing,2 the plot could have been done much better
1,he is in trouble at the time of the murder,he 's just trying to kill the hell out of us
1,i really enjoyed the first movie which was a wonderful one,i ca n't decide whether it is the director of the original
1,the only reason i'm giving it three out of ten i 'll give it a 2 if,the movie also deals with some of the most common themes with many twists and turns
1,i hope this comes on now,i think it is a lot more
1,buuel and his cowriter and cinematographer have a lot of things going on in between the two and that the film gets as,buuel never has his work so here and he ca n't be faulted for his work in the slightest of his career
1,but that 's what the story really is,but it 's the latter and i would suggest
1,but the biggest problem with this film is that they,but then again let 's get through it all
1,my sister was also in my teens so my,my favorite episode was when i saw tng
1,at the beginning of a day of the show the only way to see is the first episode,at least we have seen some good shows in this series and this is not one of them
1,this film is a very enjoyable attempt to squeeze a,this time round of course is the first one
1,a movie that is made in the same year with a young woman,a nice movie to watch with your friends who have to find an extra
1,the fact that the entire film takes place with some guys is the key part in the movie,the acting was terrible from a seagal but in the end he was quite good as well
1,i was surprised to find it so annoying and stupid,i have n't seen the original show because the acting here
1,if i 'd seen every chance of making it my way to better the worst i 'd seen for me do n't have to,if my memory of that sport is all that i can offer with my children this film deserves every conceivable praise in that
1,audience beware of the film or the film 's other success at the time of seeing this film,audience a very bad movie with a capital c and i 've only seen a few films like these
1,but after i saw the film i have no idea was that what,but it 's just embarrassing to watch and in a good way
1,out of the blue they 're not really sure that she is the most dangerous member,out of ten and 2 seconds of the film were cut short by the ending
1,some things i did n't find funny at all were the ending where it did n't seem to really,some of the best scenes are at a bar and the ending leaves me laughing my head off
1,but when the plot goes to its,but what a movie it was
1,and this is the most famous movie i 've seen if you 're expecting,and why they should like more than a little less in the movie
1,well she was also a teenager in the beginning of the movie she is the only,well i can identify with the one that i liked more than i would say
1,i have a good sense of fun here but this movie should have been a great deal of fun in this part of an otherwise charming movie,i just want to say that the movie should be shown as a classic that 's a little silly as it is all the more ridiculous because of
1,it 's supposed to be a comedy about the holocaust,it must be said that he has a beard to grind
1,the director and writer are too busy giving us something for everyone,the dialogue is terrible the script is bad the acting is bad the
1,the whole movie does n't work anymore though,the movie has the usual clichs of romance and
1,now i'm giving it 3 out of 10 stars for the score itself,now she is n't just a bad person a guy in a bad suit
1,despite the plot there are a few laughs in this movie,despite some intriguing details he is also rather boring and not even
1,i love watching this movie as a kid in the late 80 's,i think the whole situation of the episode is as bad as we get
1,the fact that he was n't so much more than a human character had a certain meaning,the scene in which the main character attempts suicide by the end has a really funny climax involving
1,the problem with her was that this scene was an,the characters are very different from the first one
1,that 's a minor quibble i have to say i have,that is not all about the lack of a plot
1,but i doubt this one will ever be again forgotten,but not to the top of your lungs unless you do
1,do n't watch this movie you 're bound to get rid of the movie,do n't worry though this film did n't even attempt to make much sense
1,the only reason i did n't give,the movie was filmed in color
1,they are going to be taken by the same man with no knowledge of the world,they try to make every real life the world where they live but it just adds nothing
1,within five minutes of time i was still convinced to have it done,within seconds the movie is a typical slasher flick and is n't about the
1,not only that it does n't work hard to predict what is left,not even with a bad script and good direction this film is one of
1,their scenes are the first and the best is when the killer comes home to the scene we see,their lives at that young time are n't quite so real you may ask yourself how it ends
1,she meets a woman who does n't seem,she does n't come up with it
1,but i would rather go as far as to say that the acting was good,but this certainly must have been an exercise for the rest of a movie
1,offensive and cruel for a movie to enjoy,offensive is the best way to describe this show
1,there is n't much to write about this film and it 's only marginally watchable,there are some moments of genuine interest that make your eyes feel like you 're watching
1,secondly this is a great example of,secondly the film was n't bad
1,the movie is about a bunch of people and how they are in,the acting is terrible but all i found good was the story
1,the music is the worst in the film all sung by both o'toole and rogers,the rest of the story is a joke with the usual plot devices and a few
1,the film is very good for a rainy afternoon,the action sequences really seem to have gone on for
1,what could go on forever and make the movie worse,what 's more painful about them is the way it was
1,admittedly a bunch of people trapped out of the woods for a long time,admittedly another example of a movie that has some funny effects the film moves along
1,paid the bills or to the one or two of my favourite films,paid for a copy of it i saw a clip in which the film
1,a couple of guys in the town are trying to kill those who are n't sure,a couple of years earlier they get into a little village and the boys start their home
1,and it was the only reason he did n't like his wife,and why did they always fall for them in this movie
1,nobody can deny that one man of the cloth is the sole hero,nobody is able to understand that the film was really bad and is n't
1,never say never again has such a small cast and director and this is one of the best satires of,never mind what it seemed like the people making it the reacted to the other side of the board
1,during this film the film never makes clear it is a thriller which is also more important and is about a film that is so incredibly bad,during the course of the film kerr 's character takes a turn of the prince of a young girl who tries to find and appreciate her husband
1,also it seems that the film is trying to appeal to some serious demographic,also for an episode of the show i have to say it 's a great
1,i had noticed that people were actually sitting in a,i loved this film as much as i did
1,apparently i'm going to start wondering what,apparently i would have liked the film more
1,there is a point in which the character 's character is developed well and you can still love,there 's not a false mention of why in the world this movie is not for everyone
1,the only other actor who is better known from him was his father who is a bad guy,the fact that we 're told to know why that is so obvious is what the writer says is
1,the story line was absolutely perfect,the film is an action anthology that
1,only a few of the characters and actresses from here were likable enough to,only two of his fans will find this to be a complete success
1,however these elements are often overlooked and the film does a good job,however the movie was never too short and should have been shot
1,all it needed was to do a couple more things i do wish they would n't come around it,all i can say is the whole time spent trying hard to figure out where the show was coming from
1,it really is about people who know the people like jesus and his wife who is so bad it,it 's a very interesting story with a good sense of character but the actors are also good
1,no one could have picked things up for,no it 's not a bad movie
1,we are supposed to have known as i might frighten the audience because the audience does not think that the movie is intended as a documentary,we can not believe that the girl in law has to work on her own terms as if he just ca n't seem to control any of
1,ms and her brother are also married to their younger sisters,ms and mr toad make it their most fun but with so
1,if you need to see and enjoy something like this you will probably find,if you want to kill kids for the first time look no further
1,the movie just sits down and watched the next scene in which i have nothing against,the two actresses are excellent in their roles and really the supporting cast is wonderful
1,as a parent he does n't seem to be able to relate to the main character 's personality,as far as being that should be true when you 're dealing with the most important scene in the
1,surprisingly a lot of people in the cinema seem to say this is a bad,surprisingly i love the film version for the reasons that it has in it
1,it takes a lot of time to make sense which is,it is a very moving film with a great cast
1,these are my thoughts and i do watch this over all times,these are the words i have seen and it 's so obvious that
1,he says that he 's not,he is also a master of his
1,we 're talking about two girls who are at,we also know what to do next summer
1,on the plus side its worth a watch,on the plus side the cinematography is good and
1,but if you want to be bored and think twice about the meaning this film is a must to watch,but then there are some of the scenes and i 've been impressed the first time i watched this movie at
1,if you are thinking about having some friends getting to know the people of australia,if the film ever really had an interesting plot or was then a plot
1,however i thought i 'd like this movie too,however the film ends with little twist as the movie
1,when this is about to be taken to the big screen we see a lot of people walking around talking and talking about women and,when they go to the store where it appears on some of the actors the camera work as if this had already been made
1,i found many parts of the film pretty funny and i think i 've seen worse in them,i do n't know why in the name of the filmmakers directors that they were making me in the
1,in the story there may have been a part in the film to the point or that the actors were there,in the past of the film we see his mother at the center of his father 's family 's life
1,another thing i did n't mind is that you never have to see an episode of the film that actually has enough plot,another thing i really wanted to like was the film 's depiction of her parents and the relationship between father and sister
1,it was n't an easy way to help it but there 's not too much in the way of consistency,it is one of the best american films i have ever viewed the acting is good and the characters look interesting
1,well the idea of a movie called the dead end is so bad it 's,well to me this was one of the best and best film about him
1,this episode is one of the best of the series,this is a good movie and a very good example of
1,it is a real shame because you know all of the characters,it does n't work for a movie that was just terrible
1,some of the scenes are great the actors portraying their roles,some films have great plots but are better than this
1,this could have been made so early in the episode,this is really really stupid and one of the worst action
1,the character of the movie is very similar to the characters,the script is very funny and the story is pretty interesting
1,however i cannot recall ever seeing a movie like this before,however the whole film is all about the real big jerk trying
1,i really liked this movie and ca n't get into,i also liked what was left of the series
1,the music is a dream to listen to and,the film does not have one funny moment
1,death bed is an example of the kind of film,death sentence 3 extremes 3 of 10 and 4
1,if you have a soft spot for you watch this type of film before you should go back,if you want to watch a great tv experience for your kids i recommend this to all
1,i think it deserves a 910,i saw this gem of a film
1,this episode is not a great movie to watch in,this is the most important film i have seen
1,that in a nutshell was an awful lot of the time was spent,that is why i have watched this movie countless times and i love to
1,clearly this is a lowbudget film not for the faint hearted who would not,clearly his wife has never seen him but the way he treats him
1,some of the film 's main characters have the potential to be funny and some,some scenes are far out the scenes and sometimes are n't up to scratch
1,for the people out there that would be like for someone else who might,for all this a complete waste of time in this post apocalyptic genre
1,i hope the writer will come up with more great,i was watching a movie with friends being killed
1,at the same time we saw a black forest in paris and the other side of the sea had a few other giants,at the end of the film they become suspicious and the eventual showdown is just as the one part of the movie has been
1,actress dunne gives a brilliant performance as the confused and distressed widow of the little girl who she does n't want to be his wife,actress 's performance was so bad she was so badly dubbed that she looked like her brother when it turned out that she would never get
1,you could see it 's not a huge budget but certainly worth the effort,you know the kind of thing they want in our country and we know that
1,i watched the whole movie hoping to get rid of it and it 's done better than what i expected to see,i saw this film at the stockholm film festival and while it was n't all the finest work it was still a very
1,an american dream is sent to a hospital,an interesting film about a young man who has
1,says they should just tell a lesson on the meaning of being what they do,says i would like to see this one the director 's the beautiful movie is a
1,if you 're not looking for this kind of horror film and have one of the many,if you want to watch something out of the blue lagoon check out the other comments
1,my grade d where there 's worse than this crap heap on the imdb,my favorite parts of the movie however are they really need a good portion of
1,of course in all this review i would have voted that way,of all the films of the past 10 years i 've just watched
1,anybody interested in the history of the original novel will love this film,anybody who can tell a drama about a guy who is n't bad enough
1,i do n't think that would have made the whole different part of the script more interesting,i ca n't see anyone getting so bored over an hour into my life that i really hate
1,in a brief moment in the new guinea pig the sheriff shows up,in fact it 's a shame i watched her in that one
1,some of the most memorable sequences were when the old man was telling her father the truth,some movies have had many funny scenes and the actors are all pretty well done even the special
1,a man who is n't and he 's all the right for some unknown kids in the past,a group of young women and her dog decide to run away from a local mafia to find that
1,and there 's still some very good cgi shots,and it is almost impossible to watch an excellent movie
1,the characters do not come from the same universe but are very familiar with their plights,the movie is so long and so boring that i wanted to vomit at the tv
1,this is n't a great action film but,this is one of her finest performances
1,this is one of the finest films i 've seen in a long,this time a good supporting cast includes robert deniro and billy connolly
1,action is a great deal of fun watching a movie but,action scene is n't the highlight of the movie anyway
1,the plot is pretty well done a,the film is a total disgrace
1,parts of the film were shot together in such a long way because he,parts of this work should be shot out to us to be seen
1,what you have is a poor production,what does n't have to be the ultimate
1,but i suppose he was a little more fun,but he 's a bit of a problem
1,snipes 's character is one dimensional and the same guy who i do n't care when people,snipes has been hired by a police officer for two or five times a sadistic man
1,the other actors were not even nominated for a short film,the movie is a great example of what a director can call
1,it is n't even worth the time to go and do yourself a favor and do n't try to watch,it has a very strong story line but really falls off it 's hard to keep track of it
1,if you do n't you would not see this picture,if the viewer is a little uncomfortable to begin with the
1,but that 's about it for the most part the story,but the worst part of this movie was the acting
1,in my opinion the best actor is the one where the hero who is in love with the girl is actually a bit of a jerk,in conclusion i was n't into anime but when i finally found out this was real the story was so stupid it would make any sense
1,are you thinking how could you go about it all,are they just reading the script for more movies like this
1,other reviewers have described it as a very disturbing movie,other than that the film is worth your time
1,i did enjoy the film at its best,i do n't know how i can put into
1,but it 's also a pretty decent flick,but in fact it does n't have all this
1,all in all it 's a good family movie because there is no story to,all in all one of the most disappointing movie that i have ever seen
1,ok it 's a story about a rich woman who is a struggling lady whose life is gone to her mother 's,ok it was fun to have an idea of how bad a film can be but not by many good actors
1,go watch that this is a terrible movie and,go and see a live action movie instead
1,while this was a rather good film it was hard to get on,while the script is quite entertaining it 's still not a thriller
1,jason stewart is a bit naive in his role as the sheriff as he tries to,jason biggs is just fantastic here as the doctor of a high school basketball team
1,the only people to take out this is the old lady,the rest of the cast seems very amateurish the actors
1,i'm still asking for them to live there,i'm pretty sure he will never forget
1,for me the movie has a certain flaw in,for fans of the genre do n't bother
1,the film itself is very beautiful,the film makes you wonder what all
1,i thought of what it was the first two movies of one of my best movies for this,i was so happy that i did i could have taken the title as the movie turned out to
1,i guess that a lot of the dialogue is so bad it makes you wonder if it could be taken from someone 's movie school,i was n't expecting much from this movie anyway but then my classmates told me it was n't a total ripoff of halloween 3 but it
1,the film was quite depressing though i am not sure what it is,the only positive comment on this movie was the ending was horrible
1,that is because of the excellent acting performances the beautiful cinematography and good acting,that means all her friends and the kids are doing a pretty much like a
1,oh yeah you have some lame lines and some lame jokes,oh my god that 's all you can ask for you are
1,i 've rarely seen this show before the mst3k classic but the animation i,i saw this on cable and it has something that you 'd watch
1,there is a very brief scene involving a black guy with a gun grenade,there 's a real story about an elderly man living in a town that 's
1,the action begins slowly with the first,the actors were all very good
1,all of her films are made for all the money spent on their reputations so that they could be made,all in all this is a must see film for people who have never seen one of their films with a
1,there are times where i felt it was rather weak considering the film and i would n't say that the actors do anything and everything else seemed,there 's nothing wrong with the plot for this movie because it 's not enough for me to want to go back and watch it again
1,well there are several great parts of the movie,well done well directed with a wonderful story
1,the whole movie was the most implausible moment of our time and i,the movie was directed as a comedy with a lot of acting
1,yes i have seen many people who did n't like this,yes there is a lot of potential about the action
1,the acting is very bad and the,the acting is mediocre at best
1,however they did a few things with a different slant,however he is not the only person who is very fond
1,the most memorable part of the whole film is that it gives birth to the devil 's world where he,the other cast in this movie include jack palance who plays the role of the son the great catwoman
1,much of the movie has an early part,much like that 's the main theme
1,and even though this is n't necessarily a very bad movie it is good fun and,and as a result the fact that it was a bit too bad is ludicrous
1,kristin 's son comes to a conclusion when there is nothing wrong with reality,kristin does a good job at bringing her character but her character is really sweet
1,head up the movie and it should n't be made,head is a very good movie to see especially those in
1,i 've already finished watching both on the,i think it deserves to be discovered
1,and they were the ones who made this movie even,and that 's just the way it was filmed
1,the other characters that are not funny,the movie has a few laughs
1,but the way the story begins to unfold is just a confusing and boring waste of time,but there really is n't a single scene in this film that has anything to do with the
1,meryl streep plays a young girl who has an emotional power to,meryl streep should play a character that is a bit weak
1,i did laugh aloud for the whole,i saw this movie on tv
1,despite the fact that the director of all of him could n't get it to,despite many many the plot and characters all do a lot really fine acting
1,gregory peck plays his wife as the head and the audience would like if she,gregory lee jr has some good oneliners as the villain who 's too short
1,the acting was all over the top but very good in a way that did not get made,the movie is about a father who does not want to get married but a few people
1,i think this movie did that in an effort where it really got all that money,i do n't mind the movie for the sake of seeing a good film at a time
1,on the way to the west estate to,on both it is also worth mentioning
1,you need to check some scenes in order to make some of the film 's characters and this,you 'll know that you 're supposed to make a movie to take a trip to video
1,so the show begins when the first two brothers get killed one by one by a mysterious psychopath who starts tripping around them from outer space on the ground and suddenly kills the,so what 's worse perkins is the director of this movie that is very close to the book the director and his wife had and had to tell the director 's vision
1,lets hope that this is not a movie for people who like,lets talk about the acting is so bad it 's unbelievable
1,why the hell does this movie go straight to video,why they are not just cuddly or ordinary people makes me
1,i would n't have known that these two kids would never have spent a lot of time together for that movie,i was bored on the first minute and the second time i was hoping to see them in the new orleans locations
1,other people are called on it so why have n't my ears so stupid,other than that what it means is the acting that was just pathetic
1,vivien gaynor is excellent as the main woman,vivien blaine is not just a comic book heroine
1,too much is made of this film,too much time to go through the movie
1,maybe it 's about a woman who loves a husband,maybe one day it may well have been lost
1,i am sure this would be released in a,i am not at all surprised with it
1,those films were shot in a country and used to use the name as their name,those people have been warned about the film which would have been better if they had had
1,laputa is very interesting and one that is definitely recommended to everyone,laputa seems to be a spoof of the original stage play
1,i have a new and enthusiastic dvd of this movie in,i would rather watch 'the paint then just to see this movie
1,the plot is so predictable i could see that the writer or director wanted,the last fifteen minutes is just the best part in the whole movie
1,what 's the worst movie ever,what else had the whole idea of
1,a good example of how the script fails badly in this instance,a young cast and a group of characters who have the most interesting
1,i think this is an excellent film,i 've seen other films that have been
1,such a great actor as the other characters which are supposed to go straight to the surface are amazing,such is the key of watching the movie and it 's a shame the filmmakers did n't try and do
1,unfortunately i could n't get past the fact that there were several other similar movies of this type that were only made for television but most of all do not bother to put on and it 's more,unfortunately all too long until one of those rare films you 're able to see and then get into the mystery of the story and the plot as though it has its potential a very good one
1,my wife and i rented a vhs copy of this dvd because it,my advice is that you 're really in love with this guy
1,eighty minutes of footage of my favorite actor in the game has an architectural ability to get away with to become,eighty minutes of all is not even funny and the main character of the main character is almost completely unbelievable
1,the story is as a whole the characters have been turned into a series of boring,the story line was interesting but the performances do n't help the film at all
1,i think a lot of the things are quite a,i do n't care a fig to avoid that
1,full of the cast members the two brothers in this,full moon fans do n't think of this movie
1,i found the story a little more interesting than the first film,i was able to watch this with my mother and we 'd never
1,this movie had been in my memory,this movie is just not good
1,is an absolute insult to any medium of film student from the period and is not a complete experience,is the movie set in a country that can hold a candle to the rest of the movie in the
1,you can imagine why the filmmakers decided to hire the character in such an understandable and unique view of the story of this film,you ca n't tell her but in some cases are the better men out there so she ca n't decide whether or not the woman
1,perhaps this was the last time she left,perhaps it was the case that they did n't
1,that 's the plot to say that there is so much to it and i have never seen a,that is what happens next to any of the main characters a lot of people in the town
1,in short this is one to do in fact at least one reviewer,in summary the main problem with this film is that they are completely absent
1,the only reason i gave it 9 stars was because we 'd had to have been disappointed by the story,the story of this movie is very confusing and there is a subplot that is absolutely nothing interesting but it is
1,here we get a really awful b movie about three young men that go out,here they play a nice pair of kids but they 're just all right
1,i think it was worth the time and money for,i was also impressed to learn that it might be a
1,a few movies i would love to make a point to watch,a very good cast including the likes of james stewart harry morgan john
1,she 's not about the best actress in her career but it,she has a small crush she believes is the same actress
1,i'm glad they did not put their names on this turkey,i'm afraid that the story line is too short and it 's
1,the story in the third installment was excellent the acting was excellent especially the one which was,the only reason for this movie is for hardcore pornography it is a very good movie
1,taxidermia is not without its charm but the way he treats the life out of all those members that they are a lot better than this does n't really,taxidermia 's direction here is an uneven one the scenes of sex and violence are mostly the same as the movie that has been edited into a pg
1,for me the film does not try to be so funny and the characters are all completely flat,for years of being released only five weeks ago i am aware that this was actually one of the
1,initially the film was pretty good,initially a bit dated as it 's
1,but the movie is a lot like the same thing,but no that 's what they need to be
1,this is the kind of film you would have just watched on dvd,this show has the same appeal as it is in all episodes
1,the film is about a little old man who has the ability to get a job that he has built with that of a woman,the director who does n't know what he has tried to think is that he did n't have enough imagination to do some research here he
1,it should be avoided and that at least a bit resistant,it was very much as if the writers decided to just go
1,nearly every character has a lot of charisma and the rest of the story is n't bad but it is a fun movie to watch with one of,nearly as good as the original the first and only mildly entertaining one is a lot more fun than any other series that has lasted for ages
1,i know that when a movie has been done i would also like to ask,i know what he 's trying but unfortunately he ca n't find the truth
1,rich and interesting is the kind of role to be the most serious role in the film,rich actors in this movie and a bunch of supporting actors including christopher lee thomas morgan and a
1,i ca n't figure out how to get this out of my rental now i should have listened to another website in the box office,i loved her from that point on and her portrayal of an angry woman for me as he became a real person had been in my
1,the film also features a great cast and supporting actors as the stars of this era,the story and story line was a complete mess and never quite developed to show us
1,deft plot twists for the characters which would,deft and intelligent the film drags on
1,this movie does n't have all that much promise,this one is a complete waste of time
1,even the movie 's biggest message at the end is a lot of unanswered questions such as the woman being crushed over the,even worse than the average columbo movie we have two characters of every real person who have nothing to do with themselves
1,spoiler ahead i went ahead and bought,spoiler a few and far between
1,these three guys are both attractive and,these characters are not particularly convincing
1,i was expecting more from it but it,i give it three out of ten
1,lady snowblood is a real winner,lady snowblood as a hero is as
1,in fact that was the point why the first 45 minutes so the movie ended as,in the end a film to be called the classic film that 's in black
1,their mother is one of them,their parents will be so disappointed at
1,these are two of the most memorable characters i 've ever seen i 've seen,these girls have been abused because they need their help for the next year
1,only the final fight scene is so badly done the actors cannot save this picture,only when it was on the air to show us that the public would not see
1,whereas the story does n't leave too many surprises though i do like the twist that the ending has left me in the theatre and in such a way that it might have been more enjoyable if it was,whereas i can relate to the fact that the acting is n't the worst i can ever understand to be young i know i have seen a lot of films and the people who thought this was horrible
1,neither of those films have an undertone to your story nor have any of the twists or,neither the script nor the acting itself were anything special so i did like this movie
1,this is one of the best examples of that many movies have come into this world where,this movie tries not to make you laugh and laugh but also has a fun way
1,i 'll put this on my list on a video box,i saw the unrated version in my last 15 years and i
1,truly this is another example of a tedious film,truly i had to keep watching the entire thing hoping
1,i 've never met a single bloke who is so utterly stupid and annoying just to get a little scary at least that would have said,i am now looking at this movie for years and i cannot say i do n't think it 's the worst film i 've ever seen
1,as soon as they were in the middle of the road the only actor who does n't have a mustache and has n't even,as for the special effects do n't get the budget out of the way the cgi effects were a little weak at times
1,sheeta does n't get to do that much better because of the threat to those who are killed by the killer and the woman 's,sheeta is the kind of person you 'd see in your life in the 1950 's or when you should n't know and love
1,i give it a 3 but once the plot got you,i 'll be looking for something new in this story
1,i 've heard many people who know that this is a bad thing,i am not sure why i did n't give them such high ratings
1,i love horror movies i liked the grudge a lot more,i am not a fan of the story i ca n't recommend
1,but the real draw is it 's just the right amount of suspense,but then that 's all it 's going for this movie to get and
1,her father who is about to have a relationship with a woman,her performance in the original version is as strong as in this one
1,or why do n't you go see a film about the real life,or why it 's called american television channel the american public enemy
1,oh well the best i can tell,oh yeah the plot was good
1,if u do n't do n't like the whole idea of a little old fashioned movie,if they had done it with her so much i would have missed this point
1,while the rest of the cast is quite good and well suited to,while it is interesting it may have been a much better film
1,fassbinder is so close the viewer can almost feel the emotion of the characters,fassbinder 's film and the film itself is in a word of the macabre
1,i ca n't remember the last time i watched this,i have always been a fan of james spader
1,you can tell the writers were going to start a slow buildup,you just get to see all over the eyes of all that is
1,rain is so much better than it seems in the first place,rain was my first introduction to this film as the great muppet flick
1,its not about all the things that,its not like she did it
1,throughout the movie we 're watching two girls and a girl and boy and girl are so bad that i can not understand why they 're actually doing some,throughout the film the viewer sees all the possible suspects that are in this episode so that they can do their best to keep it in the movie
1,dennis rodman is hilarious as ever but,dennis hopper is in top form
1,there are many other funny scenes in the film that do not even have,there 's very little dialogue except the last half hour of the film
1,in my opinion that is not for kids and adults of,in fact this is a good movie to be found
1,as a side note i was not so bored to watch it as i did,as for the plot well worth mentioning but i guess it 's impossible to make a
1,laura linney plays the wife 's daughter,laura linney gives a tremendous performance
1,in fact the best performance is the one character from the original film,in summary there is a lot more to say about life of these characters
1,and it was funny to watch him,and as a result i found the production
1,you have read the screenplay a good movie a good story and some,you think your friends will watch this movie to see what happens
1,it 's no surprise that this movie did n't even feature a story or plot,it takes place at a bar at one of the men 's party party
1,there was also a nice amount of,there is more than meets girl
1,it does n't get any better than this,it is a shame there 's so many other
1,this movie is worth the watching,this is just another one of john
1,the story is the whole enterprise is trying to get home and the ship can only be destroyed,the ending is totally laughable at times and even when the climax disappoints you 'll be disappointed
1,and that 's right the way,and it still feels better than the
1,this is a well written acted and directed movie,this movie should be required viewing for all who are
1,i just read a couple of reviews of this movie and am thinking about it,i know i can give it credit for some of the acting talent and story
1,peter lorre is great and he 's good,peter o'toole seems to be enjoying for the most
1,but of course we have all we got this show was,but i doubt any of the people responsible for it
1,what happens next is that when the hero and his friends are trying to save the family there they find something,what was worse is that this was no doubt this movie just seemed to be a mess of a plot
1,through the whole film there was something very little about that sort of character which is what it is,through the whole movie and then some time later the film is set aside to develop and i feel i
1,apparently an idea and a good premise,apparently they all have different opinions about why
1,a movie about a girl who has escaped some friends the girls are cheating on her mother 's death for their children or,a real shame though because they went to show people who are just stupid things like the real people in the theater
1,the characters are not exactly real and that the real,the acting in this movie was great as well
1,does anyone know what is more than,does i really like this guy
1,this film is very true to its book and also as a,this was the funniest and funniest movie i 've ever seen
1,clearly the movie suffers from an ending only it 's so,clearly this is a film that you never will view
1,the story line was pretty simple,the plot is pretty typical hollywood fodder
1,the plot line is simple and implausible the characters are onedimensional the movie is boring and no surprises,the result is definitely one of the best films of 1997 where the movie starts out with a couple
1,not much happens to my knowledge i felt as though i was,not that the story was stupid and the characters were boring
1,i liked it so much they actually had it together,i 'd not recommend any of the other reviewers but i
1,first of all i must say what i did not think is was very well done,first of all this movie is the only reason why i wanted to see it
1,as a kid i think it was a bad idea to make a movie about a haunted house girl and a,as for the rest of it i ca n't remember it being made by a child but it never happened
1,subsequently in the next scene he shows up to find an american russian family and the girl that the king says,subsequently it turns out that the only thing that actually kills in the original movie was that this was the only other
1,instead we get an endless boring unnecessary chase scene with the girl playing a girl and his,instead it ends up being a waste of time an opportunity to sit through this film
1,this film has a good atmosphere the movie tries to be good as it turns out not being,this movie has got to be one of the worst i 've ever seen in my life
1,i watched it on late night a couple of years ago and i have to say what,i just felt that the film was great and i have to be honest and would recommend
1,i would rate the lower points of the film at least half a hour,i am tempted to leave you for no offense if i ca n't find one
1,a movie about the evils in the past with an almost,a must see for all who have n't seen much
1,it 's been done by the filmmaker who 's the writer with,it 's like this should be shot in an old country
1,the cast is pretty good and most of the time,the first 30 minutes of the film are interesting
1,it was obvious there was a scene where the camera was in a mental hospital where we see a girl dressed up with her head looking,it 's all about a young boy who is a loner who is in love with a woman which allows him to become a vampire
1,everybody else did just like in the film,everybody knows the difference a man has to die
1,personally i do n't know what 's so funny about the film but of course they do,personally i think the actors in this film were the only good characters of this film
1,i just do n't see it in theaters but it has a very,i 'll give him a lot because he 's really so bad
1,his father is a wealthy cop who is constantly accused of murdering himself and is determined to go to a small community for a small country and he will live in,his character does a great job of keeping on going for the role and the acting is so wooden that the overall feeling of the film is just plain terrible
1,busey 's voice really shines in this film,busey is a man he is willing to do
1,the scene with an old man is just hilarious but the plot here is so stupid that it feels like the main event of,the film does have a rather creepy atmosphere and i had to rewind through a bit of a few things to understand it
1,kiss 's daughter does n't want her life but then the movie ends in nothing,kiss me deadly for this little bit of fluff is not a problem because it 's
1,she does not appear the most attractive one with whom she could n't be,she had a little girl on the loose in front of the camera and she
1,sadly he is trying to solve a mystery and some of,sadly the fact that the film is a silent film
1,as i said before you have to see that she 's one of the top ten directors in disney history,as the world goes from being an adventure to its own lack of reality in that film it would seem that
1,he does not even try to pull off this wimpy cop role but he has some real talent for the movie,he is n't really a talented actor but he shows that there are n't many good actors in this movie
1,even though the film is very predictable you,even her performance as sophie was horrible
1,oh yeah the scene where he 's going through a door,oh boy he has the right idea and he 's the right
1,ok i had to pay for the,ok i did n't get it
1,the performances are pretty much just like they were in the series but even from,the story does move to the right way but the ending is too predictable
1,however it is a story and not one movie but i do n't agree,however even the extras like the old west and the other members did not seem
1,most of the film makes absolutely no sense,most of the actors are good actors not that
1,unfortunately the film is just a complete lack of talent,unfortunately he never gets a chance with the guy and who
1,there was a brief bit of suspense in the film that would be used in the movie,there are many very bad movies out there but this one is one that should make you feel
1,yet the film is quite good in every way,yet all i could see was a bunch of women
1,i would advise you not to see this movie,i 'd rather have read the other comments and comments
1,oscar wilde the performance in which he plays a man as he tries,oscar wilde plays the young lady as a sort of an everyman
1,tom has the same name over and over,tom savini has been a good actor
1,phoebe is a girl who loves her father so i can see no point in his story why not,phoebe and the rest of the kids were n't in the movie and were not trying to fit the time
1,none of them have any connection to any of their movies,none of it makes sense is it all of course
1,for example i just do n't get to,for the next thirty minutes we see the final
1,when they do n't know what they do to celebrate their lives they 're left stranded on a desolate planet,when they make it into a movie in a movie they do everything about love story for example and it 's
1,did they care about a bunch of people doing something,did you really need something wrong with this thing
1,francis depardieu plays the same role and does fine work in this role,francis ford coppola 's vision of this film has been filmed many times earlier
1,vidal is n't a talented filmmaker,vidal 's direction is just as good
1,there are the exact anachronisms which are more impressive and more interesting,there are other characters such as a robot and a turtle
1,growing up is a great example of bad acting bad story horrible characters all around,growing to life where i saw the story of this movie on the waterfront i was
1,the script is a very boring joke the directing is poor and the story makes this show,the acting was good enough even the cast of the movie was good considering the budget
1,ghosts of dracula are not only annoying but rather the movie,ghosts who are more sophisticated than those around the time
1,the plot is rather unbelievable and predictable,the movie looks beautiful and it just gets
1,the best part of the movie was the ending that i was willing to pay attention to,the plot revolves around her aunt ruth who is pregnant and the child 's mother marries her but
1,but in the end it 's so great i want to be entertained,but not before i had read that it is n't the same as i
1,mainly his face is the only actor in the film who is the one who gets shot in the back,mainly because of the way the first part of the story unfolds the film loses the point and it actually touches
1,also the ending will likely make a lifetime to me,also the director should have done the original in the book
1,there 's almost no point to it whatsoever,there are other good ones that i have seen
1,also it reminded me of a great deal of the work of mr darcy 's son,also the film was quite funny and i think that people like this to the audience
1,the story is of course a bit similar to the rest of it,the fact is that if you 're into it you 've certainly never seen
1,locations as the plot unfolds and the audience are left wondering when the next carlito will end up having sex,locations include a couple of other great actors of a time and their characterizations that are real and are very credible
1,the film is directed by a director and the director of the film but this film takes a lot more seriously than a film you could n't do for,the action is n't bad though it was still better than the ones with the fight scene and i got the impression that the actors are not amateurs
1,seeing him in other movies does not have the depth to,seeing this movie was like watching a real train wreck
1,this is a movie about an indian trying to find success and being a complete embodiment of people who do not appreciate how everything,this is an insult to any senses and the movie takes over several hours of the whole movie just does n't make sense
1,the music was superb and the songs are beautiful,the other problem i had with this is the way
1,if you ever watched it you can safely appreciate it but it makes you cry,if you love drama i recommend you go to see and watch the show
1,it is a real shame for the writers writers because they are not aware of the story,it 's a very dark and violent atmosphere of dread the whole way through and its great
1,i also thought this was a very good movie in the mold of all the other cast members but not by,i have always been a fan of horror flicks but i do n't know how good it can even get
1,this is a very beautiful film not one of that great martialarts movies,this would also make a good movie if you would n't have paid attention
1,finally after a night of the year with the big chill,finally the movie was a disaster in the long run
1,everything else has been on here in australia and,everything that can be bad without is poor
1,along with his wife david he 's being taken off by his father and a friend trying to,along with the acting the acting the script it 's a bad movie and is really bad
1,it 's easy to predict why this show has been so successful,it 's more fun to see some kind of life in the world
1,in some ways i was so confused by them that i was surprised to find,in a lot of ways it 's a nice idea of an unknown cast
1,the film opens and starts with a woman who has a dream of her own,the only one who has a problem with this show seems to be watching an old
1,i think that you could say it is a good movie,i had never seen this movie before i was amazed at the
1,but there are some things wrong with this movie,but when he finds a job he 's able to
1,moreover he 's a bit annoying now,moreover for those involved only with a few
1,this is what happened with the rest,this is a must see film
1,she makes the mistake of making a,she does n't even have more
1,from that it has an incredibly beautiful voice of,from this time on things start to end
1,let 's face it a sequel,let 's face it there 's not
1,it is a film of the sort of film i 've,it 's not a bad movie it makes a statement
1,first of all this movie features an allstar cast for this film that is a total disgrace,first we 'll feel that all of the stories of the film have been written and performed
1,i would give it a 6 instead of 110,i saw every single line in the movie and they
1,opinion is also a film called nz,opinion is n't a bad bad film
1,the film is set in a city and it is,the plot seems rather too straightforward to be enjoyable
1,this is a good and interesting movie,this guy 's acting is just as great
1,the script is so bad it 's hard to believe exactly the characters which the director is afraid to do to achieve the necessary task of,the movie is also full of action to keep you guessing throughout and never once makes you want to leave without resorting to the story
1,basically it is just about as interesting as a brick 's mouth,basically the movie is n't going to be so bad but not good
1,not the sort of way to spend your time on this drivel,not enough is going on for the characters but the story is too
1,long gone it could 've been a little more interesting but i guess it,long after this scene is revealed why you need to be blown away
1,the plot is a little weak and is really about the characters 's interactions with the,the only thing that kept me watching were those who seemed like a complete jerk
1,it 's been called an old lady for years until the late 70 's and her,it was n't only about 30 minutes but it did n't make up for that
1,they also look in a car crash that can only be filmed as a piece of the camera,they did n't do much to help them to commit suicide to survive but that 's not what we
1,he also uses one single actor to pull,he could n't have made this movie
1,for starters the only reason i gave this movie a 3 it was because the story was very confusing and the story line,for the first 10 minutes it seems that the actors have a script and they try to do not make it work
1,every word of this is good,every scene is a reflection to his
1,change their name for themselves as well with the exception of the movie and the great yokai,change of character from other movies such as the green gun as well as the movie has more
1,maclaine plays a man who tries to bring the woman she needs unsuccessfully,maclaine 's performance of a young female with a broken face was just stunning
1,in the background the film is not even close to good,in fact it was a bad and pointless effort to get the
1,considered a complete piece of crap and it 's definitely worth noting,considered one thing and the other half hour or so i 'd have
1,john frankenheimer was a great actor as well as the film 's director and the music is flawless,john cusak is a man whose career rests in the air of a great cast of him
1,the character development was much more interesting the writing was pretty,the only redeeming quality in the movie is the song
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen,this is a fun one for anyone to take a
1,with a good sense of time you can appreciate the great story lines,with a capital a plot line of such a script that you have to
1,however for a change in any life it feels like its creator was on it 's own,however there were moments when you could not tell why they did n't just go a bit further
1,they are all over this movie,they find that they are trapped in
1,what was to become an intimate film,what we needed to see was the story
1,he has been on a plane with a large group of thugs but he has never been in a film before his untimely death as an,he is a film star of the early 1950 's and was probably the very popular career but he probably rivaled the most of it
1,i have to admit this one was better than i expected,i saw this movie at a gay film festival on dvd
1,the movie is about the way a person living and who comes up with a bad plan to make all the money money they want to be,the special effects were terrible so many of the effects look like they were done in a few high school in the middle of the night
1,he did n't even know about the police at the start,he gives the audience a very sympathetic yet loving look at life
1,this is a perfect movie in terms of its acting and script,this is certainly the most compelling one to come out of disney ever
1,the cast was n't too bad with the main female character at times,the movie opens a couple of events with the group members as the main
1,emily watson 's performance was a total treat choice for a young carradine and the rest,emily smith as emma 's young daughter and sister is not one of her best
1,sure all of us loved you,sure the movie has its own identity
1,this movie will keep you from going,this is a very boring film
1,part of life is filled with the best bits of this show,part of the appeal of the movie is its low budget and the
1,and you just have to be happy,and as you said the plot twist is
1,this is the real story of a true person in the us,this is a classic movie and has one of those rare cameos where
1,a good cast to make this movie,a classic of movie time was the fact
1,must the young woman take a shower in some way or something and her body,must have wandered out of the office and the crew got to have more time to
1,i saw this on tv when i was 9,i would really want to like that little
1,it 's a nice one to sit through but what is this,it 's hard to say how many others actually say this
1,the problem with the show is that the writers have done,the story was quite thin even the plot is ludicrous
1,such a great film is a mustsee,such films do exist of some and i
1,the plot was n't the focus of the book,the film could have been quite easily shot on the
1,the ending seemed to be a tad unsatisfying but i was happy to see that this movie,the best movie from my childhood is its theme and i just have to say the twist is
1,a very interesting premise and a strong portrayal of a troubled young man growing into,a movie dealing with this subject matter in a way that you cannot understand
1,months later i saw this film in the video store,months of history will always be the world that is to
1,as for the fact that they did not go a second film they were not afraid to make an action picture and,as an added bonus a film can be enjoyed for a couple years of seeing a live breathing version of it
1,whoever gave it a ten would have a chance,whoever did it even have the decency of being an
1,on this subject it 's an original premise for the film to,on paper the film is the best of all film history
1,if the story is simple or not you must watch any episode like the big chill i have watched,if it 's out on dvd you will probably get into it but it will be an inspiration for fans
1,every scene in the movie is so bad it 's funny,every movie they made was that they were just a bunch and
1,but the movie is not about the value of the plot either,but in her case the movie was not just about as much as
1,kind of a movie with a message about,kind of like that in my heart
1,when a movie was going and the second half was like that one i realized that the movie had only been about five hundred minutes from long scenes,when they go undercover to locate the president he escapes an ambulance and tries to flee the police in the process of getting rid of the bodies that happen
1,i love the fact that the film was about 3 hours long and there never feels like,i remember having seen the trailer on the dvd box set the other three and one
1,see a film called rififi or the jackal or predator 2 it 's really a good idea,see if he has gotten some big glasses and a few extra bottles from his old pal
1,but for what should be it is a film with a few,but do n't expect anything out or you 'll find it
1,this show is a disgrace and the same applies to a new standard that,this one would be better served as much better as a comedy series
1,do n't try too hard to do something good,do n't bother i have seen the original and it
1,north america is one of the few action films that can easily make an awesome statement on the right path,north pole of the 1920 's with a capital e in the late thirties and the early seventies in which case
1,i ca n't imagine enough i think that,i do n't know if this is a movie
1,the acting was ok the script was solid,the music is excellent in every sense and is
1,fantastic film with excellent direction and good acting,fantastic performances by everyone involved in this bizarrely overlooked
1,will this show be made on the spot of the,will the driver and her wife go after them
1,whatever he does they 've been on the edge with,whatever you call them these guys can be identified
1,if it makes any sense it 's more of a drama and an,if you want to see a very funny drama watch this flick
1,the story of an older boy and boy who move along,the film is more of an experiment than a feature
1,above the average ripoff with english subtitles and,above all the cast was very fine
1,i really liked what they all felt like i had read,i hope that someday a sequel is available on dvd
1,spoofing his best performance is by far the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen some far worse films,spoofing the excellent acting by the stars the film offers a very dark and mysterious portrait of the relationship between the two main
1,the music is so perfect and well composed by the first and the songs,the story line is ridiculous even for a young woman with a soft spot
1,if you want to see a good film where the original cast can come up with some serious plot,if you want to be a fan of the show for you avoid reading the book on dvd
1,it 's one of my favorites of,it 's not a great movie
1,computer generated sex scenes or the gratuitous nudity that was obviously done by the female lead and the lesbian women who were also involved in the sex scene that they were attempting to imitate,computer graphics in one scene are shot to see some kind of dark side of a man 's head for a while it 's about a hundred feet and they can only grunt each shot
1,this is the sort of film where,this is a film for teens
1,but if you know it is not,but i do prefer a few
1,there are lots more plot holes in the plot,there is this very subtle issue about that movie about
1,now that is bad for me i just could n't give this movie a 2 or a zero the overall rating for this film was a total zero,now she has to choose this little girl and it 's obvious she 's going to be a little ahead of the man in the first place
1,a great soundtrack which could only have been written by a man who knows that all the film industry is supposed to be the same movie the same,a very funny movie though it is rather long to say that the acting performances are all bad the directing and cinematography is so over the top
1,i saw the movie in a preview video and thought it was absolutely hilarious though,i like how the director andor producer tried to cram so many lines into a movie
1,it 's like it was done by the same old man who wrote the books for their film in the first five minutes,it 's a shame that this film was released for distribution on dvd for our vhs collection it was pretty much just a bad
1,just as good a movie about a serial killer that is being chased by a werewolf or something like that you should never have a movie that,just as a kid would be a stupid character if he had to pull out the worst of the show or just say this unfunny show
1,it' a movie has its plot it sucks,it' is the most boring plot which i could
1,john agar is a comic villain of a kind,john travolta as sir is good in this film
1,when i watch the film i think it is a real treat to watch,when a film does n't have all the goods you have to watch a lot
1,it would not have worked if the movie kept the film going in places,it is sad that so many of the films work for this movie had been
1,such a story about a beautiful young man who 's dying from an incurable institution from her boyfriend 's life in an abandoned building is a metaphor for a life which should,such a fun concept is the obvious fact that these guys are n't necessarily interested in selling the picture 's title which makes their actions appear more difficult than they are
1,if you are a big fan of the series then you will not be disappointed,if this movie were made to make this movie the best thing it would ever be
1,it 's a film that is so bad in any way,it 's a good example of what is wrong with the film
1,amy adams plays an american teacher who comes off as a poor mother on the verge of learning the truth,amy is a man who just did n't want to work out as it did because she knew she is the
1,as for the performances here there also was a scene about the woman in her underwear that had very little to do with helen,as for the acting i believe this film belongs only in a really special way if i could give up the opportunity for a movie
1,an early episode of the show is the most bizarre things,an awful movie that everyone involved should be ashamed of
1,while the real story is that of the book it also appears as a flashback,while i am a fan of peter o'toole and have seen many of his movies many
1,the rest of the movie is as a story about a group,the only one who had a decent name was michael jackson
1,filthy ugly and cheap for those of a bad taste,filthy is a good thing but this is hardly noticeable if
1,some of its flaws were some better ones the acting and the direction of this episode,some of the other films that make them so good are not at all bad
1,there is a strong plot twist of the movie,there are two scenes for example where the boys are
1,the special effects are pretty bad as are the location and sets,the result is n't bad but rather it 's just bad
1,anyway we get that one who has no clue either way,anyway this can only be considered as a comedy to entertain people
1,why is everyone giving this to the kids for this,why did the police not have to pay attention
1,the actors can be in such poor situations as to a few of those who have experienced their careers at first,the plot is pretty good but the movie lacks a punch as a whole venture is n't a satisfying film
1,my favourite scene in the movie was filmed at the beginning of the movie when the dam,my wife and i both enjoyed the movie i enjoyed the first one i watched it
1,this is a very bad and extremely stupid film,this is a pretty bad movie and the acting
1,she must be given the permission she needs and what they see at a train station is a nice way of saying about,she is an attractive female who lives as a woman in an american prison who is trying to protect the poor guy
1,1st watched series 3 out of 10 horrible and downright,1st watched this 7 out of 10 valuable film
1,the acting was atrocious and the whole cast seemed forced it is n't,the acting and directing is very good and the actors all excellent
1,so how about the first 10 minutes of this film are just not worth sitting through,so do n't worry about the fact that i was a teenager when the credits rolled into
1,i saw this movie after a year ago and i was impressed and i had,i will give it 10 out of 10 because of all but the movie
1,this movie is so bad that he has made one big deal,this is the worst movie i 've seen this year i have n't
1,though the story is about a hitman who is dying by her,though we do n't even have to wait for a bit
1,some interesting scenes where i was surprised by the ending of this film but i,some moments were so bad i could understand a lot from the movie itself
1,badge has always been a huge success of the first kind of tv movie,badge out to the public i 'd like to warn everyone you need to skip
1,gene tierney as usual in supporting roles,gene 's the real estate mate
1,yet it becomes a joke at the end,yet this is all done by a man who
1,we do n't know what to expect of this one,we were not impressed by the acting by the entire cast
1,this story of the love between the old man and an adult of the dead,this is about as subtle a character as you may think of the film
1,a guy who goes with a little help and a young boy is supposed to do the right thing,a group of other passengers find themselves in paris for some time before the allies are caught out
1,relay a man to the west and this is the movie for my list of directors and directors,relay him in a fight against his own boss at the local hospital and he will find his mother
1,dennis wilson was superb he was so cool,dennis quaid is pretty good as an indian and
1,specifically the movie has no relation to robert deniro 's acting or character motivation,specifically in the scene where the hero explains the woman of the baby and then
1,i 've seen a lot of movies,i love her performance in it
1,they were the two main characters in the movie so far,they 're so funny and fun in their portrayals so well and
1,however this movie is a waste of a hour to do so,however if you like a good romance with the right cast do not
1,haunted house was one of the worst films ever made,haunted by a terrible movie this film is about the life
1,but to me these actors are always a great opportunity for each other for it,but you do n't realize that that 's why there is no plot at all
1,not to expect a lot of things and all the characters who are so stereotypical to each other,not much more to this film is a great way to make a movie about what people do with
1,as far as tv goes i'm concerned this movie is not as good or better than most films i 've ever seen in my life but i doubt this movie was intended,as far as i can tell the truth is more like a film that it 's just a vehicle for the director and his acting ability and it makes people laugh
1,they do n't have many movies,they also have an unforced relationship
1,similarly there 's nothing wrong with the film,similarly it 's supposed to be a prequel to
1,the film also gives a different perspective,the movie is not about time
1,from the very beginning i was surprised that it,from the beginning he returns to the past
1,she was not happy with him,she did n't get the recognition she
1,and that 's a good job by director michael haneke,and there 's some good comedy and a fun involving family
1,he is not a master he 's not a hardened man in a country,he tries to make another statement but i ca n't make a comment on it
1,instead we get the idea to be more clever a la a little,instead if you find love bug this film is one of you
1,the film 's humor was quite funny and i would have liked to see just how well it was handled,the film could probably seem too harsh and violent but that 's not enough to give you a headache
1,some of that might have made it slightly easier to handle,some are so good at this movie that i found myself laughing
1,neither can be regarded as a good thing the acting is horrendous throughout with all the extras you have come to expect and you 'll be pleasantly surprised,neither of those films have ever captured a classic for me but this one is so bad that i ca n't even get to the first theater
1,they are actually quite normal people having sex with a little,they take a beating off the wall of the road
1,now let me preface my review about this movie just,now this movie was one of the alltime worst
1,this is the kind of movie that leaves a great taste and not in a good way,this guy is a genius of the type of film that he often has known since that 's
1,i watched this movie with high expectations not because of my good ratings,i saw the first movie on the other hand and it was the funniest
1,describing a character on film that is too old for a change is a difficult work to follow,describing it as being the worst movie i have seen in several years is pretty generous in its approach
1,it may be a bit alarming but i do n't think it 's funny and definitely,it 's a movie based on a play by henry harvey and you know it
1,the movie is also a very well made show,the acting was very good especially the music which reminded
1,the characters get drawn into the characters of the story of a pair of college killers who try too hard,the performances are generally wooden the movie is n't good and the plot is predictable yet at times it does n't
1,there are few scenes which are really quite chilling and while the gore was lacking overall i felt to see this film and,there is one of john 's movies this good guy i will always have the audacity to get a hold of it
1,although the film lacks any sort of suspense and the scares are still,although that film has a bit of sex the film lacks tension
1,after all what they get out of the trouble of meeting,after that the audience did not sit still so easily
1,it 's also one of the many movies that will make you laugh,it 's a bad idea but it is ruined by the acting
1,there 's also the obligatory scene where the hero and a priest who are in the middle of the night in a remote gated container,there is also an excellent performance from peter coyote who plays a mentally unstable yet troubled figure as a family and what a young lad
1,us all those who are not at the same,us and your fans should see this movie
1,the scene in which our hero wanders into the house is quite good,the movie was directed by a woman who got all the major eggs and
1,i do n't buy the show the first time and,i 've always thought the two movies were brilliant
1,casey 's love for the girl who never was able to communicate her mind at his house,casey borgnine is perfect as the evil psychiatrist in this one but the action is too overthetop
1,as for me who wrote and directed this movie i do n't know whether maybe it,as a viewer it 's only in the last 15 minutes that is completely unbelievable
1,although a bit silly and very very dark and the movie is n't overly dull or original it is not a complete waste of time and money but not too bad,although at first the movie seems so much fun to watch and a complete mess of its kind of entertainment that has no real impact in it it just seems forced and
1,rumor has been done so many times that it 's difficult to feel any empathy for them,rumor is a very disturbing movie but the fact that it is so bad that it is a
1,where the bad guys come back in the movie they had to fight each other until the last battle on,where have you got the idea that it was n't going to be a funny spoof or a spoof
1,i am going to make it onto the screen for the first 45 minutes or so about the end of the movie,i do believe that people who can relate to the history of filmmaking should n't be as excited as to make a film
1,believe me this film is a waste of time,believe they should have to kill the president and all
1,no one has to stop talking about why he was so so he is still dead and the rest of them did n't have a lot of,no worries at all from the fact that it 's hard to tell if it was intended to be a thriller or a drama or movie
1,i have recently visited the entire film for so long and have seen it all over again,i have a question of the meaning of how the producers manage to screw up the main characters
1,in fact we see her constantly at the end in the opening scene of this film and we do not have a very challenging love,in the film he goes into a little of a seedy past where he is not afraid of a character and he ends up being the
1,at the end i had a great job and it 's been a matter of the time,at first im not sure if anyone is supposed to think of it if the acting was bad
1,the plot is simple for a short while the director of the story the,the film is shot with the wind that is at home at most
1,the story lines were good and really good,the only character who could save the movie with
1,you want to get to a time where people talk about sex drugs alcohol alcohol sex,you wo n't regret seeing a scene or two when all this takes place inside
1,kudos to everyone involved in this production,kudos to every single person who will like
1,i did n't know what was going on with the movie but it seems to be the focus of,i loved his performance even though his performance was great because that movie just never looked so bad
1,it was a horrible production of the,it 's just a bad movie
1,aside from this the film is very boring in terms of acting and its reliance on the characters of the story,aside from my wife 's wedding i never got out of my chair to make this stand up because it seemed to
1,ultimately these characters never seem to gel as each other has their,ultimately one of the characters in the novel is his friend
1,in the end i was happy when i thought it,in this movie we see what she would like
1,like i said earlier it really showed a total lack of talent for it,like the other posters i 've seen people who hated this movie i felt i
1,the two central characters are not bad though they are all over the next,the acting was horrible the directing was worse than a bad student film
1,the main reason i wanted to watch it was because of the acting,the fact that every time this is in german movies makes it difficult to
1,if you liked a film like the one i can,if you are looking for a fun watch movie
1,the special effects were laughable the acting was awful and even the special,the plot of the movie is interesting if not all that different
1,when things start to get going it gets the point across as he gets arrested for the,when it takes a bizarre little mystery to the film it is a mess of interest
1,to make this film a success for instance the actors would,to make a great idea the film fails to deliver
1,a lot of other films like this were popular and very controversial,a little bit of the film is a movie about a girl who
1,if you want to watch a great martial arts movie about revenge by bad horror you should get a copy,if you like this show i highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to be the first person who ever watched
1,warren oates plays his role wonderfully and,warren beatty is a standout actor
1,the movie is n't a good start for him at all,the story is that it seems like something a movie would have
1,because he is in charge of a mental patient on that of an older man he is forced to deal and,because it had the potential to be a movie that had a limited ending the ending was just plain boring
1,some people might even claim that it is a bit of a bore and if you,some of the jokes are funny but still funny and funny at the same time
1,i could n't help but feel to myself that he does that too far,i know someone who has not watched the movie probably knows that it is an
1,i would rather like the movie that i,i think it did n't really matter
1,i could n't help but laugh and sing with her,i thought the actors playing the parts of the were well
1,this is a movie that you should really watch,this is one of their last films to date the
1,i'm in the minority or the people that love this series and,i'm afraid to think this could of been an ok movie
1,it 's pretty hard to explain the plot about the film or the acting,it reminded me of the first one so much i thought it to be funny
1,who cares if they can even be,who are the two ladies are
1,but the movie was a complete dud,but here it 's a lot of fun
1,this is a terrible excuse for action and violence,this is a film that deserves to be seen
1,why would the moviemakers and the screenwriter go to town in the,why is n't this movie on the top of my list
1,this film is a perfect mix of what was a good and not funny movie and that was why i did care about the character development,this is an excellent movie i would recommend for anyone with a sense of humour for their work and a good solid story which is worth seeing
1,kids may not have that sense of humor the story is just,kids would love this and everyone should be ashamed of themselves
1,i think the film is an embarrassment to anyone who likes musicals with a strong ending and great acting,i 've been one of my friends of friends and loved them for years and we 're still getting into
1,when a lot of characters start hurting the story for a good example as is the case of this woman 's face you think you know it may,when an actor who is being interviewed he seems to have had a very high standard in all the others he gives you in this sorry man
1,pity it was the worst picture in my life,pity the acting was very good except for meryl streep
1,is there no time period on the production,is that what the film is being
1,i like that the movie has n't so much depth and,i mean why is i so good at the movie
1,i 've seen them in a few tv episodes but in some ways it is n't all there,i was hoping a more serious interpretation of the whole picture could be considered a major improvement on how
1,fittingly the script by christopher nolan has not come down in a long time,fittingly it 's not as bad as it was expecting a movie made in the
1,the first half of the movie is really bad,the only thing that really bothered me was the fact
1,they 've just eaten a deer on the head but that 's just me,they say it 's a little different and better it is more of a story
1,modern day england is the most controversial film about the holocaust,modern europe is about the american government and the government that are
1,i guess it 's not a perfect movie if you find true art and expect,i was at least an 8 yr old but the movie is just boring
1,we learn about his heritage with a young boy named cedric who makes,we get a lot of action scenes in the movie as well
1,it was the same with every lash,it really is a fun movie
1,personally i love the scene the film begins when the guy playing the,personally i believe that this is a major improvement on the movie
1,if you 're going to try to enjoy this kind of thing it should be more enjoyable then some of the best,if you ca n't make a statement about what happens to you like i am a masochist you have to be a fan
1,it makes for a sad experience as a young boy searching for him by his friends and for a,it 's a story about people who love to surf and are happy at them just like themselves
1,i guess i could make a comment on this film and,i have read people 's comments before seeing this movie
1,the story revolves around the family on the search for a man named angus,the film is a perfect example of how to deal with a film
1,how did anyone find a copy version of this,how about that character development was the main theme in
1,another reviewer said it 's a good movie,another notable scene that i would rather have left
1,apart from a somewhat clever and implausible plot line i would n't expect any less in other films of this kind,apart from his brief appearance there is a few laughs about the man being tortured by the evil and that is a
1,the plot is full of holes and inconsistencies,the only real problem i have with this movie
1,much of the problem with this film is the plot,much to the disgust of the director and everyone in the
1,recommended for the big diehard of any oscars,recommended to anyone who loves a little film about
1,he has a small role in this film,he does n't get so close and why not
1,not since the beginning of season 1 where the original,not only is this film a lot of fun
1,i also ca n't wait to get,i really wanted to see more
1,being gay was the only way he had been,being a fan of the big game the plot of
1,and so if the movie is true it must be a big disappointment,and the film takes a very long time to change the story because they
1,we have a few good moments here and a few,we were watching a movie on an oil rig
1,it 's one of the best and most powerful films of this year and i hope the director is not encouraged to,it 's pretty boring but the ending is great and it 's so funny to see and again at the climax
1,he is a little over his head with their little teeth,he has an interesting future in it a man being treated with
1,at any rate i was shocked to discover that this is n't a movie but,at the same time it 's not exactly perfect but its a little fun
1,the story is a typical one but it 's still fun in the most unexpected way,the plot does n't seem to go anywhere even one does n't even care about the characters
1,i would like to thank ya for that,i really enjoyed this film from the very beginning
1,mai is the one who takes him in,mai field was perfect for this part of the
1,you can make a movie with all these bad acting and,you can hear the radio station for the first time
1,nor do i even know how to fight,nor were you people having been living in a
1,i had not seen the movie yet it was more of,i would be lying to your grave or go home
1,with a supposed budget of about 1000000 i thought there was something,with much like this film the acting was n't horrible either
1,the performances of the women and the woman who are not in the cast are beautiful,the most important thing about this mess is that the actors are very good not for actors
1,even the soundtrack is a bit over the top that there 's actually quite a bit of,even a little kid gets eaten by a bat of the cloth and turns on it
1,followed by the other reviewer 's comments here,followed by the end of the episode
1,first off i found it predictable and really,first of all the acting is superb
1,but at the same time is very little,but a man and a woman make a mistake
1,in the process of course is the fact that he 's been in the prison for the past 20 years since then,in this respect i was so annoyed by the whole enterprise that i would have to admit it 's quite interesting
1,or in case you think it 's safe to the movie 's credit to the actors i 'd,or when i was looking through my tv guide i was intrigued by how good it was
1,it makes no sense whatsoever a few interesting points of note for my son 's life and i have no idea what the film was supposed to be about but i 've just enjoyed these two,it 's almost a shame that the director was only able to have his first one and instead he had taken himself far more seriously and i wonder if his films had been taken from the original
1,however the one and only time the first film shows how to act and say good looks at a good script,however the most important thing in this movie was that the movie was not just as good as the first
1,now she 's got to know a bit about her sexuality but the film is really nothing more than a bunch of girls that go off into a house and it 's not even worth,now this is what we saw when people talked about this and it turned out that it had already been so terrible and boring it was like trying to find something interesting in it and that
1,the story is based in a book that made absolutely no sense,the problem with that is its ability to communicate as the story develops
1,it was a shame that all my friends watched this movie and they wanted to see it,it is all done in a way that makes us question what we are seeing ourselves as the
1,first of all it 's not a comedy or even the,first of all the plot was so stupid and boring
1,this movie reminded me of the classic american film casablanca as a movie,this might have been his best movie on the world that it had
1,two of my friends who had watched this episode in 2005 and enjoyed it,two guys who had n't made a movie would have given it a chance because
1,i had always heard about watching it and it is probably the funniest element of any movie that,i hope to see more in the future on screen now with someone on a tight basis
1,i would love to see more of the work with such wonderful material in the movie but not here,i watched this movie at the edinburgh film festival but it is not the worst movie on imdb ever
1,she goes to bed in a bar,she meets her and finds him
1,this is a very powerful film of the year,this movie is one of the most interesting i have
1,drama and tragedy ensue the movie drags slowly but this time in a row of flashbacks and turns into a joke and more effective than the first the third is,drama is not the only element with the right elements that have come out of hollywood the whole world involving the american dream as is in english 's past
1,cusack 's script is as good as it could have been,cusack 's character seemed that he could do more then he was
1,i think the movie is great and it shows very true messages and has a great feeling that you may never get out of your life,i 'll admit the movie would have been better had it not been that much of the film 's impact were in the film 's original denouement
1,i do n't know what to make of this,i saw this because it is a movie
1,luc besson and john woo have a knack for spotting in this film,luc besson is superb as the conflicted genius who 's been reduced to being
1,it all boils down and i got in trouble,it is a pity that the film had ended too
1,as the film opens her career is in a relationship with,as i said above the plot is a bit confusing
1,by contrast i do not have that kind of attention but it is still,by the end this seems to just be a vehicle for a movie
1,all i can say is that i am so glad i did,all in all it 's a real shame that a good friend would
1,a couple of years later she has to deal with her own and that is her mother,a movie not only is n't there really is a good story and the actors are actually quite
1,this is not the case with the movie,this is one of the best comedies i have
1,i had to take the movie and get the girl,i found the film entertaining and hilarious at the same time
1,james caan stars as a reporter who works in a supermarket to collect a beer,james earl jones 's script here is a bit underdeveloped but you wo n't really notice
1,the first story is a great one yet not the same,the movie does not go for the actors involved although their performances
1,they never could have made a movie like this,they are a bunch of characters and make an appearance
1,i have been waiting for an audition for the film to come out of canada sometime to become fashionable with its detractors who had made their first appearance for a week,i can say it 's pretty good but there are many ways to put it all together and the storyline could n't have been done without the depth but not so well
1,without the redeeming quality of this film and that is to say a,without spoiling their plot we would get an action comedy drama drama
1,the first time i saw this movie there was actually the opening credits and the ending that,the film takes place in the united states of paris at the time and the cinematography
1,just a few things you can do with the first movie this is one one,just a couple of seconds in and the acting is generally very bad even after it
1,with a cast of unknowns in the film it is apparent that the director wanted to get some work on the set and that this would be,with no chance at the end you are sure he has some moments which is n't bad as long as you are n't expecting anything better
1,this show has nothing to do with reality tv series,this is a really terrible movie made about as close as
1,the characters are believable but that does not matter that,the rest of the story is a tad confusing
1,this film is a must see for any prospective family especially if you 've seen her in this one,this movie is one of the most hilarious tv shows i have ever had the pleasure of watching
1,today this is a great piece of entertainment a great example of the best film,today 's big city folk in the united states are still the stars of the new
1,of course its a comedy it 's not,of course if you have a problem with a
1,that 's why the movie has a huge following,that is what this production might have done
1,poor and boring acting is all there for me as well,poor plot good acting bad directing poor dialog it 's so bad
1,i do n't know why this is the best,i would never watch the whole movie again
1,sinatra is a good actress but the script is too weak for words,sinatra is pretty much perfect in his role as david callaway which has proved
1,i have seen this film for five years it is hard to believe that the actors and actresses were going to like her,i think the fact that i am convinced in many of the positive comments that this is from the people who made the book
1,but the film is n't a thriller,but there is just something about mary a
1,probably this is the type of crap that is,probably the worst movie i have ever seen
1,the film opens with a bit of a flashback at the end of the,the script was a great book to play in the middle of nowhere
1,of course the movie is not at all bad but we have to go to the store,of course he was on this case but i guess he was the one who he did not
1,a group of people want to live together on a mountain island,a true joy of what the story of one of his most unique
1,very bad horror movie that i 've seen dozens,very funny stuff for fans of old movies
1,the acting is very good the actors are really good but the dialogue and writing are all over the map as well as the acting,the rest of the film involves a bit of a big boy getting eaten by a gang of thugs in an old apartment building
1,my wife rented this dvd for me a,my girlfriend and i enjoyed the movie
1,thus i found it in a movie festival of sorts where i am not alone i will do it again that,thus i did a good job of finding the real movie but i could n't have been a horror star
1,final thoughts i 've been watching,final note is this a great movie
1,lara hawn is one of the best actors i 've ever seen in this movie,lara 's character gets a few laughs from the audience at the end is one of
1,i'm afraid that i 'll have to say more about the plot,i'm sorry to you so unless you were watching this film i'm in
1,the actors in the series are excellent not just for kids,the plot is a bit out of focus but the performances of
1,and the final showdown between the police in this movie and the police,and if you are looking for the right story to be in on watching
1,even though the film is based on a true story i think,even the ending is not only unexpected but is the ending
1,if you ca n't see the movie that is good enough you will love this as they will watch the first movie,if the director did n't have her the way the woman was able to get rid of her body was so stupid i
1,for those interested in making this kind of movie i think you 'll come,for example there was no shortage of emotion to that of a sequel
1,although that movie is a little bit of a shock one may think that this series is about the same,although his role is far too long this is not what he does for the supporting characters and the film itself
1,far from the truth here as there were a few,far worse than a lot of other action films
1,my favorite scenes involving tony are in the first scene where the kid tries something the man asks for him and,my first complaint is that it seems like you have come here in a very similar state for good acting
1,what a great vehicle and i am,what else would you expect to know why
1,in the end they are more believable and better,in summary of this the movie is not as powerful
1,there is no real reason to watch this movie because we know nothing about it and are spared from the experience of a few friends,there are several moments where the characters interact with each other very slow but without much of the action and suspense of the film
1,as an aside it is a good horror movie,as he turns out the movie has a strong moral
1,i 've watched it numerous times the other day but ca n't even begin to laugh,i would highly advise anyone who reads this to get to watch or will be disappointed
1,well as the film opens its narrative becomes blurred and pointless,well it 's still a good movie if you have a friend
1,but he is always the most normal person,but that of the great and funny script and
1,be prepared this movie could have been a,be prepared to watch a new one
1,having said that the director did n't care that they should just be a bunch of people having an eye,having read the book the first time in the film anne archer is a complete wimp in the world
1,it 's just a simple movie because it does offer a lot of a message that makes one wish not,it looks like a cheap madefortv film that looks so bad i think the sets were a very low budget production
1,wow i must say that this movie is,wow it 's a lot of fun
1,gorgeous the characters as a family are n't afraid to go around their homes as they,gorgeous images of music a very nice change is not as bad as the title
1,when the film is over the top makes you laugh at the screen,when he hears the words of the dead lady i could tell you if
1,not a bad plot if you 're expecting the story to unfold and some sort of character development would have,not that there 's anything more scary than a cheap monster flick so it is not a monster film
1,while the show is not about the people who are looking for anything it makes no sense and the plot is a joke,while her is not the best actress to look the show still proves that her character is a very good actress and actress is
1,they seem to be trying too hard to say things where they are all connected in a sense but do n't,they 're always there for them but their parents do n't get to and the rest of the audience laughed
1,we see her get naked before the,we have seen it countless times
1,yet the show has not been made for its subject matter,yet the idea of a killer whale who was actually trying to
1,i will never even remember a movie where you would watch it,i had some problems of the show but i think its a bit
1,an interesting premise the performances from everyone involved,an interesting premise by a director for this movie
1,clark gable gives a wonderful performance in this film,clark gable plays a man who gets caught up in
1,after having seen it many times i could n't watch it until i got to it,after a series of flashbacks he tries to get involved with a serial killer who is the
1,it would be hard for me to rate it a 10 but as i saw it again i,it is very sad to see a character named ben gazzara played by a young hugh corbett
1,an interesting and funny film about an extremely,an interesting film with a great cast
1,in fact it is a little more funny and it works like a sore thumb,in the end for that matter and a good score the camera pans and pans
1,he has a new way of getting a woman in the way of this movie and he 's given a free time,he goes into a mental institute to be his own and he gets into trouble with another actor who he does
1,that is where the real problem between the book and the story comes,that said i thought it had the potential of an adventure with such a
1,which is to say this is a low budget low budget low budget film,which was quite a feat considering that the director was making movies this film and
1,there 's a lot of people who have to read,there 's no shortage of clichs or action sequences
1,but it 's a comedy and never mind the goose and,but what in the world do they have to offer
1,it 's all so bad i almost wet myself when i,it does n't have a sense to me that way
1,my recommendation is to find it to be a gem on your shelf,my only complaint in this movie is the title song itself not on his
1,there should be a lot of things happening to all involved,there 's a brief appearance of a man with a huge brain
1,anyone who saw this film knew that this film was funny and thought provoking so why was it a lot,anyone who has a problem with the work of their work may be surprised but this film is a very good
1,daniel craig was excellent in this film,daniel daylewis was a man who did n't
1,the acting are poor the characters are cardboard the characters are ridiculous and never,the movie is a great documentary but does not contain very explicit hints
1,as mentioned much earlier in the movie you 'll find something new and it 's a little bit of an anthology of sorts,as far as sequels go i would highly recommend this to anyone who is a huge fan of al pacino and in his own
1,when you first meet someone who loves a movie of hers,when i first saw this movie the first time it seemed to
1,but she 's the real hero of,but the story makes little sense
1,in fact she takes the cake of the,in all honesty it is quite simple
1,the film goes in a very cheap fashion the movie is about the same people,the movie ends with a bit of a twist that you 'll likely remember
1,she was a really nice guy and i loved her in this movie,she gets a few points before she goes and takes a shower in the
1,pamela graham is a nice change of pace,pamela brooks 's acting is pretty bad
1,as for everyone involved they made something like that,as long as you enjoy a good thriller you 'll
1,jane wyman plays her character very likable and is one of the few things that makes for her,jane wyman does a fairly good job as her mother whose best friend 's name is sammy
1,with my mother on the other end of the phone i could n't figure out what it seems,with many others this will be a must see but a lot of the film is about a fictional
1,my favorite part is when she is talking to her friend in a room she writes an old letter to the police,my suggestion is if you want a good movie with something like action to make you stop a thrill watch you
1,both men and women have come in very quickly and we were n't talking about the movie,both of these years later with his mother and mother they have been married in the accident and
1,has anyone not already know the difference between this and on,has the story not so much greater that there was one element
1,despite some of the comments i have read here about how i felt about it i would n't want to watch this movie,despite the shortcomings of this film i enjoyed seeing it in a theater for a long time to come through as the other user
1,unless you have a fondness for the game and you can accept an excellent,unless you are a horror fan you will be pleasantly surprised as well
1,dwight ackland portrays a great part of the character who has a role,dwight ackland as a reporter who is always trying to murder her brother is
1,i think this is the worst movie i have ever seen and should n't have been made,i watched it in full time for my daughter and i have seen it over the years
1,this is a must see for any fan of old man 's book,this film is a very different outlook about one of the most important characters
1,but all the other is a wonderful portrayal of the struggle and sacrifice that,but it was not much as a movie in its own good way
1,however i have the impression that it 's not an insult to this very good horror films,however it 's so damn hard to find a movie that is so incredibly boring and so utterly
1,with all the other problems i have with the story the film is quite funny,with the help of a few recognizable scientists it 's apparent that the actors actually needed
1,the film opens with its predecessor and his son jerry and a young,the film is n't very exciting nor is it any more funny
1,this one is so bad that it is,this movie does not deserve the recognition
1,ca n't you really see how badly bad the acting in this film,ca n't wait to see what 's coming out of its mouths
1,in fact you should see the film yourself will find it quite enjoyable,in fact the story would have been far better with a few twists
1,i just read the other reviews on the poster and the fact that,i ca n't believe that someone would make such a crappy film
1,if you must have this a better film it 's probably not the best at all,if you 're interested in your movie then go ahead with this little gem of a film
1,while the acting sucks there is nothing terribly special here,while a group of men are traveling to mexico who is
1,but it 's a bad thing,but to me this movie is a
1,however i think it was an impressive movie and it worked best to keep the viewer interested so the film should be appreciated,however this episode does have its strengths which is why they did not show it the truth it is the story of the war
1,the action and plot is quite good,the plot is n't original because of the
1,it is very easy to see how the movie has to be described to be a bad movie in the beginning of the war,it is also one of the few films that could have been so much better i would have to rate higher but if you are
1,the only way i would not have seen such a thing was the acting,the movie ends and they end abruptly and gradually after leaving a few questions unanswered
1,some of this is filmed with little style or flair by director vittorio storaro,some people have been warned because they 're always living in their town
1,another great example of why people might think when they have to,another thing to make is what a terrible and unoriginal movie
1,of course he is the one who does in a film of this kind of film,of course there is another scene in the book that makes you jump with laughter
1,there 's a lot of sex scenes the requisite topless scenes of course and the,there are some very funny moments from the start and a very funny laugh
1,this film just does not make it out to be a bad movie,this film has one very very long scene with the two lovers being chased
1,he was in fact a movie,he was in his job with the
1,it 's a bit more serious than that of its predecessor and as the result of the rape of the,it is a pretty well made movie especially the final fight sequence which gives way to a decent climax
1,there is no story line in the,there is nothing funny about it
1,would have helped if there have been a better director,would you have any good story with a decent plot and
1,either way he did a nice job of showing the very real thing he had,either way i was still surprised to see how the first three films came out
1,the actors try not to take time too long for each of these actors,the story of the boy trying to avenge his wife friend who is n't given
1,wonderland is more of a film that showcases a strong message of faith and faith,wonderland is still more like a bad sitcom but it 's actually good entertainment
1,and i thought that a lot of her character was going to be a,and what if any other reviewer will get this information on the film
1,it is a pretty good movie and is highly original,it is clear that they could actually create a new wave
1,what more could you ask for when a child in the woods is stabbed with a flashlight through a river and the,what i liked most about this movie was the fact that the characters were so onedimensional they were n't good actors
1,about 15 minutes into the movie i found myself wondering who was who was who was on but who could n't see a,about a third of the way through i had to leave the theater with an empty feeling about the end of it
1,and if so with all its faults you would be able to feel the uneasy pain that the survivors have on the lives of two,and it 's just a bunch of kids talking about how people react to what the movie is like to have to say it
1,midway through the movie i realized i could not wait for the next scene to show you,midway till the end we have more money to spend our time with our troops than we do
1,john wayne is a great actor but even he has an actor who is n't really his,john carpenter did a spectacular job with this film so it definitely makes an appealing film
1,all of the characters in this movie did not know what to do but they could n't make this movie funny,all in all i would like to say that this was a wonderful movie i will give it a 7 for all
1,they just go the whole hog together,they tried to make a statement to the
1,i was just hoping that maybe a more realistic version but unfortunately it still works it needs to be,i could n't stand my eyes in disgust at my reaction until then there was no other explanation
1,all this is happening in a series,all i can say was that it never
1,also i am a vegetarian living in france for most of the time,also a couple of really funny moments were cut and executed so badly that
1,the rest of the cast of characters play one and only slightly,the whole point of this movie is that you want to know about
1,some people like this one too,some of it was just plain boring
1,the dialogue is so terrible i would have made,the acting is good though not everyone else
1,yes the movie 's plot summary is somewhat predictable but the film goes downhill because the movie has so many ideas,yes its not one of my favorites and i definitely did n't watch it when i was 9 or 13
1,i was in my seat when the movie was supposed just going to go on,i am surprised that you can have one or a bad movie in a film
1,ultimately enough this is the best movie to be made and you ca n't even,ultimately there are plenty of other movies out there that have this little theme
1,neither of her lines at all so much as a villain,neither do films have to work or are that bad a few
1,it is clear that this had been,it 's the same old crap
1,certainly there are a few of those movies that you get to learn to understand what makes you want to,certainly we could have had some great scenes with a bit more character development and more tension or drama
1,and what can he say about the president,and he 's so out of character that matter
1,the best thing in the movie is the acting,the story is quite a departure from the original it
1,chances are you 'll be in your own right,chances all the way to the next episode of the
1,it 's interesting that she is a little different in,it was pretty funny and the action is great
1,i have seen this movie in a couple of places which will keep me watching once so,i found this movie to be a waste of time with all of its redeeming qualities
1,i was in for a treat i think,i did n't feel the effects and this is
1,better yet the director is so desperate for making this so hard to follow,better luck next time phoebe 's son and sister have to go into the room
1,and when i first viewed it again i was,and it 's not that it 's bad
1,the fact that this movie made me want to eat my eyes was enough,the plot was interesting enough but that is the point of the film
1,i could relate to the plot in a different,i would n't bother getting to see it
1,demme had a few moments that could,demme 's direction is the same
1,the story and idea were the right,the character does not have the skills of
1,whatever the case what if it were just that funny,whatever the reason this film has made it to the video
1,this movie is one of the worst i ever seen,this is a fun film and i am glad i was
1,friend played by joe brown is seen by a group of terrorists who can barely escape the plane,friend and son should have listened to his wife 's love and the life of his father
1,in case you like the character of kurtz who is played by a,in the end it 's as if that movie was written down
1,farrah fawcett is a great actress who was also playing an old age on a,farrah fawcett is a fine actress but her role here was n't that great
1,in a movie like this i found myself cheering for a lot of the action,in other words this film is a perfect example of an experimental film that is a
1,worst of any time he is given no real screen time,worst of all a waste of millions of time spent on these
1,it was just that the director and the cast did not deliver that much,it was so refreshing as one of the greatest movies i 've seen
1,unlike many of the recent american movies i 've seen this one a good movie that is,unlike the other films of the 80 's i thought this movie is fantastic to watch
1,you 're going to love a movie like this i would recommend this to any fan of indie film especially the likes of,you know that this movie does n't live where the characters are drawn and the writers try to explain what really happened
1,the plot was n't that great a movie as it could have been,the movie shows a lot of people including the other persons who know the
1,told me a little more about her is how she is drawn out,told me to write a script and write it and then to write my
1,thisi got a good deal of enjoyment in this,thisi have some great fun with the script
1,also the acting is very wooden,also the music in this movie is
1,all i have done is make sense,all i know is that it has a
1,symbolism is n't too good and the movie is not even worth mentioning,symbolism is nonexistent and the characters lack personality depth that just makes it not
1,nothing in this entire movie seemed to fit with the actual concept of what this movie was all about,nothing happens the story is really a mess and it 's a shame to see a decent sequel
1,if you were a fan of the genre then you might be wrong,if you find one of the actors who play his most likable character you
1,anger was a pretty good thing but that the rest,anger is not what people are supposed to be
1,but you ca n't have this a true story,but after the first hour of the film there 's
1,this was one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen i 've seen this film several times,this is the worst movie ever made which could have been saved by the whole production because that alone
1,i ca n't believe how much thought was due for this movie,i have heard several positive reviews on this one about the making of
1,the story about the war is that the precogs involved in the civil,the story is interesting but it 's not that easy to follow
1,it would have helped it if he had been involved with the,it is as though you had had something a bit different
1,i was quite a fan of james cagney 's later life and i enjoyed the,i 've seen a great silent film and this is one of the best
1,it took me about 45 minutes to complete the movie without needing so many tears at the end,it 's not that the film is n't a film in its genre or its subject matter
1,however this is one of those films that really,however i can be forgiven for that much
1,told from the start of the movie that all of the audience laughed so hard and went to the wind i thought no that,told my own opinion about this one and i think that is what the first season of the series would get so far
1,they find out what it is that she 's going through with their relationship,they do n't even manage to walk away from the end where they try to
1,in this movie though it 's a fairly slow and dull piece of work,in this film the protagonist who goes from the one in the world in a
1,i'm amazed that the entire cast members seem at all,i'm guessing you did n't even notice the dialog
1,and the real problem with this movie is its,and how do you manage to survive yourself
1,spoilers ahead i think the movie is a masterpiece,spoilers ahead this movie is about the end of the
1,this movie is more about a group of young girls making friends in the dark woods where they see him and his friends to,this was n't even my first experience but i think some of the jokes do n't have any substance and are really lame
1,but it 's that one in the style of cinema that is the last one of all these films and the most memorable film of all time,but that is what gives it a positive rating this movie is still so good if for no other reason than to the acting in the film and
1,he was still in australia and has a lot of fun in him,he has one scene to look a scene which he uses to see him
1,with such excellent potential for the big screen in that he never really gets to a halt or a,with his work and a big ego he makes them so memorable with their usual personalities so far
1,one thing that annoyed me was that every scene were done with little enthusiasm on the sets,one of the biggest disappointments to cinema 's success is the way the director tries to emulate the
1,in fact the film begins a bit slowly but as if it 's a masterpiece it is n't,in fact all in their very special effects the music score and the music is very good so i
1,but all of this is about to go down against his own and i hope it gets distributed by all the people he considers as one of the few people in this world,but i also ca n't help but think that he was supposed to be a little too possessive but in reality he should have never done anything else instead of that of a couple
1,sometimes what 's the story in this film,sometimes the two characters are believable enough to be
1,the plot of this movie is a disaster and a couple of times of what makes a great movie,the problem is they only want to do something with their own people they try to get back a life
1,at first i was looking on the clock the plot to get to the end but once you get back to it i wo n't even make,at the end of the movie it 's obvious that when watching something weird and having nothing better to do then it 's all pretty obvious
1,just because of the ending of his career the film is very different,just do n't let anything this made you feel uncomfortable to watch
1,this is not a typical movie it 's,this is a classic of british pie
1,indeed the fact that the women are attractive so are the ones who are more interesting,indeed the movie is n't too bad but it 's still a fun horror movie
1,in the course of one of the last few scenes you have a movie with a strong sense of suspense and,in the end the main plot seems like all the others are either joking or misled from some serious scenes
1,they will stop in a big house with no luck,they had a lot of fun at every turn to show
1,yet the film is a great vehicle for a tv series and i,yet in a somewhat short way the camera zooms to the ground
1,anyway we 'd rather see the film on,anyway one of the best movies ever
1,and the acting all round of the best is great and as i was older than myself you could easily see something,and as the man that has to deal with his own needs as they learn that his son will not be
1,one of the funniest scenes of a movie at the,one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,sonam hayek is amazing as she is the sexiest man in this movie,sonam kikuchi 's role was wonderful in the role that gave her a few
1,in fact he does not do the first thing he has done the time that he goes to the police and his girlfriend is n't going to be the killer and why is the killer so good,in short as i write a better review for the review that i like the movie in its initial form or a little bit of the movie i got the dvd and figured hey i 'll give it
1,he really seemed to think he was that great,he is n't always the one in the film the
1,i hope they make more a film,i would n't recommend this film
1,i think this is a great example of what a british film can do,i have seen a fair amount of it in my time that was so good
1,overall i give this movie a 1 out of 10,overall this is one very boring and only 84 minutes of
1,sophia loren as the director does what she does best is the,sophia qi and robert taylor are in a fine supporting role
1,anyone who has ever experienced this type of film will appreciate to see,anyone that is aware of this movie has not yet seen it
1,hayao miyazaki uses a lot of the actors,hayao miyazaki is one of his movies
1,her husband has a brother who is the father of the mother whom she believes is a former,her father is a great actress who deserves the movie that is a movie of this film
1,with a cast full of payoffs and lots of dialogue i thought he should have been sent to,with some of the most impressive scenes you have ever seen in a movie you know why
1,burns has no personality and is not afraid of anything but himself by playing the role of a rich doctor,burns is in top form in his role as the villain who gets into fights with his neighbors and gets drunk
1,william wyler is a perfect actor,william wyler wrote this movie on his
1,as i said this is a pretty decent film,as the young lovers have done their research we see
1,i was impressed with his performance in his second half role which was,i love those two films i have seen them as the funniest
1,this is an excellent movie for adults,this was the best movie of the 80s
1,why the hell was they have such a low budget,why do n't the couple know anything about the film or
1,so i think this is just one of my favorite actors especially,so what do you want about a film with special fx
1,it 's a fun film to watch,it 's the only real explanation to the
1,i was quite impressed by one of the funniest stories ever made and i loved how much a great actor was involved,i thought that all i could think of was the same guy that played buffy and is one of the most overrated characters
1,he 's a good action hero,he also directs his new adventures of
1,on the other hand if you are thinking about renting this movie and read the book,on the other hand there are many other scenes so bad that i am ashamed or upset
1,jake murphy is a former writer with a penchant for ultra good,jake mencia has a very good cast as an american actor
1,she is a wonderful actress but when playing some role i just saw her,she was n't even in the movie but the story line is bad the acting
1,i saw a movie about a pimp who is accused of a murder and how he can get involved with a cop but his boss,i know the whole idea of this film is what made me dislike but it just ca n't get me to worry about it
1,not one from my collection except that it was nominated for the best,not the worst movie ever but it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
1,the director seems to have no idea of how he can think of the film or plot as,the plot is simple enough at times and i could tell one of a better off watching
1,comments for being shown by those with a few mates interested in such things,comments that this film is very good if you do get the dvd
1,morally inaccurate is the idea that a more powerful human being,morally inaccurate it is n't even a waste of time
1,hard to get an audience to invest in a movie,hard boiled 's the next gig and as the two have
1,it 's just as far from his great job as it takes me to a theater,it 's just a bit more than a bad movie the acting is atrocious and the acting
1,it is one of the funniest and most interesting films i have ever seen,it 's like a documentary of a whole bunch of people talking about how the
1,all the main players are all there in,all i have to say is wow
1,by the time she got a big screen,by this time i was more impressed
1,perhaps the first time i saw a movie i could 've enjoyed a few minutes or so,perhaps if you 're looking for something funny this one is n't even worth your time
1,pilot is a beautiful movie that is set in new,pilot is a brilliant character study from this film
1,the script is so thin that it 's beyond me the film is poorly directed,the most important thing is that the film never stops the slightest bit longer
1,this is a film to watch with your buddies who,this film is a great vehicle for the story
1,this was the first of the three,this was the worst piece of crap i
1,this is a pretty film with plenty of gore mixed with gore and gore effects,this is not a classic but just about fun and not scary or suspenseful
1,why did it matter just so much,why not have a cast of characters whose
1,it also appears to be one of those movies that i would enjoy for everyone who enjoys it and enjoy it,it had to be one of the last scenes that made me want to know what happened next in the end
1,sure the movie did move on too long,sure this does n't really qualify to be anything
1,the first thing she wanted was the story of a reporter who just happened to be married enough to have a relationship with one of,the plot is also quite interesting and a movie that just does n't look realistic for people who are not afraid to watch them
1,but of course you still want it to be your pet,but the two of them are married of both the main and
1,this movie had the potential to be a bad movie,this film is not for anyone interested in comedy you ca
1,there is the same type of stuff you would think that it made it to a theater,there 's still a lot to the show for me especially the fact that it 's just plain
1,i was really thinking what was wrong with all these guys but how can he pull the punches and just say that,i found an uncut version of the film on ebay and decided to sit in the back seat of the theater when it
1,but if you have been reading the novel i am a believer,but hey i have ever told my own opinion of this film
1,i thought this was a wonderful film with a few great actors a few excellent scenes good animation and a cool atmosphere,i am looking for an accurate portrayal of the life of the filmmaker on the daily spectrum that this film portrays
1,you 're supposed to have seen people who live in a,you know it was a movie in the first place
1,there 's also some other reason that this film is not on the list of movies,there is a very good reason for this thing and a lot of great films
1,it 's a complete waste of time,it 's one of those films that leaves
1,i know i laughed out loud at a good number of the jokes,i will never get more into the historical aspect of this film
1,they say it is in the book that,they 've been sent to the island
1,3 if you 're in a military mood and you ca n't beat people into a bunch of,3 out of 10 stars and there is n't a lot of money spent on the script
1,fearing is a lot of money to spend,fearing that to help a family there 's a
1,the characters and story line could have been improved as some,the acting writing and storyline are also the worst part
1,the film could have been much better,the dialogue in the movie 's original and
1,young people seem to fall short of each other,young adults do n't speak like this or anything will
1,what was the point of this,what they did n't know was they
1,this was a very sad film from start to finish,this is a great vehicle for a director who has never
1,i am sure that the filmmakers could not have made the movie more dramatic,i really like the scenes where the parents find their respective animal mates and the
1,i have n't read yet and is a good little movie the story,i would suggest that you want to see a movie like this
1,the movie was a complete failure,the actors do n't seem to be
1,if you 're looking for something like a cross between an octopus and a zombie film then you need to watch the sequel,if you want to see a really good actor on display on the soundtrack of an evil villain then this is your movie
1,when you think of this kind of movies,when i first saw it my interest in hollywood
1,could it have been done without a single shred of the character motivations that,could n't there spoil the surprise in the first part of the film
1,however we know it and i did n't care and i do,however it 's not too much of a surprise for me
1,pretty good cast good story and great soundtrack,pretty much we have to see the film but
1,definitely there is a reason why the movie is n't the,definitely one of the funniest movies i have ever seen
1,it 's a fun film for people who want to laugh at their audience,it also is an old show a young man from the future like futurama
1,so it is like a bunch of other characters in their family who,so on the other hand the film is n't particularly bad either
1,proceeds to keep up the good work if you want to see two of,proceeds to save yourselves what i saw a bit of the first chapter
1,a man named melvin has had to live by someone but he,a big screen experience has a real effect on the audience
1,maybe the director just forgot that it,maybe because it is too stupid
1,i 've already got the impression that this show was not a great,i do n't think there was supposed to be something about it
1,it is truly an enjoyable film,it 's as though that he 's
1,sommer had great hair and makeup and a great deal,sommer has never appeared before but that 's fine
1,both his love interest and his own,both do very little with little
1,i'm a big fan of independent cinema and action flicks alike but this one is one of my favorites,i'm guessing that this was made in 1981 some of the scenes do n't even work and those scenes are
1,eugene levy looks fantastic but in this film he turns the tables on his characters as he tries to make,eugene levy is so good that his role is a bit too bad for his time in a role
1,this is not a movie about an africanamerican and a very racist social activist,this movie also contains the usual suspects that this film makes you think you have
1,the plot is good with many twists and,the script really had me laughing aloud
1,obviously they had a very nice time with him because,obviously it has a high moral in the world
1,asserts what is so obvious about an actress who 's played straight by the,asserts that there was no such thing as the worst movie ever made
1,this one is a remake of the one that takes place,this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen
1,did n't i mention it in the end the film goes on with the same effect as a,did they just say that a bad movie can be good because of the lack of direction
1,the movie was so bad that i felt embarrassed for such,the music is very good and the costumes are great
1,hbo was n't the great fan of the show anyway but not even the best episode of the,hbo is a wonderful film and they all share the same amount of imagination in the movie
1,the performances were excellent with each choice,the main character a group of teens of
1,it just felt like it was a,it 's not even the movie
1,however as a matter of fact you have,however the actors were in the movie
1,so many characters appear to be more realistic than the others that have ever achieved the depth to express the meaning of the viewer,so how does this show remind you the real little details of the tv series that you find yourself enthralled after i first saw it
1,john agar was a talented director and i can not believe he,john carpenter 's film is the ultimate opposite of the genre
1,that 's what makes it so enjoyable,that is all right there with nothing like
1,in my opinion it 's a good movie the actors are great and the,in the end that is enough to make you want your life back
1,unless the cast is anything else it is a little,unless only that he was involved with his father
1,this was the first of which i saw,this movie is n't in many bad movie school
1,i would like to see one of those,i found it to be the most boring and
1,as for the plot it 's not a movie for it and there are a few flaws that make,as we get into the story in the middle it shows how much of a waste of talent
1,it was a waste of time and,it was a very good movie
1,all the characters seem to get to know their characters and when they play out like the movie they are able to do not tell,all the time it seems to revolve around the same kind of situation that it 's based on is really like a soap opera
1,after the first time we were n't all that we were n't laughing we knew of this movie as well as having heard that the producers had gone,after they tried to stop the ship of loot from the nazis and the nazis are fighting their mission and the general they return to the planet
1,you really hate this type of genre,you also hear that there is a scene
1,writerdirector sam raimi directs the screenplay and the director is on a trail and is the film 's strongest strength,writerdirector john waters does an excellent job as a director to keep the audience interested at the level of the movie
1,next time director dick martin creates a film that shows his family with,next thing i say is that he 's got a good story
1,the film would go on for a long time without a fight sequence between the old and that would make some sense if the viewer is left with an obvious feeling of satisfaction,the film is just so much from what the budget was done in that movie as an extended documentary to ensure that this is a pretty poor effort by not making any sense in
1,i do n't think so many people involved and even have it be,i think he 's a real jerk and is a great artist
1,after seeing it i have to say that there are elements of this movie that are n't worth mentioning,after the screening at the end of wwii and the city that was the only reason i decided to rent
1,the acting is horrible the dialogue is bad and the acting is awful,the movie begins with a long and long battle battle on one of australia
1,i think someone could have done something better with a more budget but that 's not just me,i saw the unrated version of it on the big screen it was the worst thing i could ever
1,one of the problems with hollywood movies is that the women are not treated like the characters,one would think that in a society where women and women have their jobs and love they get
1,they have to be more than a comedy,they just want to put their kids around to
1,i like to say this if you do not find the humor and interesting characters like,i loved her as much as she did with this role and was pretty likable
1,obviously they are getting a job at the local morgue where they get up and walk around on an island,obviously it 's a story of a young boy who ca n't get away from a mental institution from an unknown
1,at the end the doctor realizes the truth and gives him his son by a mysterious stranger,at first glance they have only got the names but the film has a little lacking
1,frank is a very likable character,frank drebin is a superb actor and
1,recommended watching it for the good hearted scenery some nice scenery and some memorable moments,recommended for fans of the british films like airplane for that it certainly not
1,it made the audience feel sad for them,it starts out with a young man entering the
1,he has a little more to work with but still he is the most likable and powerful character in the film,he does n't know what he is doing but still does he think they should n't be and that 's what the
1,obviously someone who is a child and has his wife,obviously the movie did n't know how to move
1,the film is a good one for young kids who actually see a beautiful film and the cast were,the cast did n't seem to think too much about the actors other than the script and all
1,a bunch of girls find the killer 's daughter and daughter after they killed a woman,a very difficult movie with a few faults the end will end the film abruptly
1,the film has been released as a,the plot is a complete mess
1,watch it as you will see something a little more,watch the film without a laugh and enjoy them
1,but this is the kind of movie you 'll likely watch over time and get a whole,but i just ca n't get into the mystery with a lot of people like wow
1,and yet that only served for his second act,and with the exception of this movie i believe that
1,i could n't watch this for over two hours and i found myself smiling at the screen when this film was over my eyes so how could any sane actor,i did n't get out after the movie to get this out of my mind but it 's not just so many things i can say about the movie
1,aside from that he just wants to make people do this stuff,aside from that this film is an example of what you could call
1,it 's so good to know i have been the same,it just does n't work so well in the way it does
1,just because she has no character was a joke,just remember it was my first thought back in the
1,i am not a great fan of the new type of movie but,i can assure you this is just another example of why not
1,but it would have had that,but then the story takes a downward
1,i was really really surprised that a sequel was,i do n't understand how this thing is
1,you know that if you take the movie for it the director and some other directors will learn something,you get a very interesting look at the life and times of the time and place of how many characters
1,a few of the scenes the music of the show has all of the scenes,a great movie a film that would be better suited to a wider audience
1,sure i do n't need to know why a film was released but there are so many things wrong with the way these actors,sure as you may have guessed there were no real surprises here but i guess that is what you see in my life
1,what is wrong with the film,what was with the old timer with
1,everyone seemed more like two old people and the fact that we were not so stupid as,everyone involved in this film should try to make sure that this one should be avoided
1,at least one movie had one good action scenes,at first we all know who killed the boy and
1,i had no idea of the story but in its entirety it was the most beautiful and compelling portrayal of the real life and,i think the fact that in the movie he is playing a gay woman is all i have ever seen in a movie
1,the story is very thin and i was actually able to find something interesting about the main characters,the story is very different from the others and it does n't seem like one of the most intelligent
1,this series is one of the best of the three movies,this is one of the best films i have ever seen
1,john cusak is the villain that has been a long way through hollywood,john wayne is a brilliant actor the only thing that really can be said
1,not surprisingly that i have to admit it this was the worst of the worst,not just bad directing poor effects and silly photography the rest is pretty much one of
1,no wonder he should work for someone,no more than two years ago
1,a must see for film makers,a young woman kills her and she
1,amidst the entire movie we witness a wide array of emotions and the ending of an extremely ambiguous and very disturbing death,amidst the coarse the first scene of the film is the opening scene of the crime as a boy of his age on
1,one thing that 's more disappointing is that every time a huge movie does come out,one thing i thought was wrong was the lack of acting writing directing direction writing directing etc
1,also starring david lynch stephen furst william forsythe and donald sutherland is a great example of how to,also what 's up with all the other actors in the movie with a lot of fun
1,series 4 is not perfect but it is,series is full of holes and jokes
1,boone gives all that money in all and does all that,boone is a former member of the crew who are looking for
1,but at least i know that there must be much longer to be made than that,but it is not an attempt to create a sequel by adding a little humor to it
1,sweeping with the most absurd scene ever filmed in the head of a nightclub,sweeping it with its own unique characters and its excellent use of colour and costume
1,make sure to buy it on dvd,make sure that many of us have heard
1,i love a good story and i really enjoyed both the characters the music the characters the actors all,i do not really think about the story but what the director does to the movie is just padding and
1,only the most ardent fans of him,only a few weeks later i found it
1,the acting is also great as is the cinematography and cinematography very well done,the most notable thing about this movie is that it is n't a perfect movie
1,how did i find a copy of the whole book,how is a story about sex and crime and love
1,when asked for it the movie could have been a little more interesting in some ways and at that level it should stick to the real,when someone 's told about him you 've probably a bad thing he needs to do it a thousand times and that is just stupid
1,whatever they have n't got into a story it 's about the consequences of war,whatever a good cast for this story it is a fun film to watch
1,as the movie went on on her career and the director,as a young man this movie made me physically remember
1,if you are in the mood for a really good horror flick you 're going to,if you are willing to watch it on its entirety you will be very disappointed
1,some of the scenes from the original were so badly done that i thought that the characters would,some pretty good acting and some nicely choreographed action sequences combined to make the film quite enjoyable
1,i really want to feel so different from a,i am still thinking about watching this film
1,we are treated to more than a bunch of other actors who have proved themselves as an accomplished force to pull off a,we do n't see it coming as it 's in the movies of the film to which the people who were involved
1,now this is in the middle but this is,now what was the purpose with these movies
1,but that 's it 's most horrifying moments involve all of the main actors,but here 's a movie with a plot like this would just make an interesting
1,in fact a great deal of acting in all aspects of the film is the pity between this two,in my opinion of this film is the fact that the director could not tell it at all
1,in spite of the fact that the plot is n't always as simple as,in other words she 's just not a bad bad guy like him
1,the ending is also not the best ending but you,the main problem with this movie is the pacing
1,at least the soundtrack was quite good,at times it seemed like it was made
1,i 'd really like to see a pretty bad film with the,i could go on and on but it 's pretty bad
1,all the other women are not good,all the ingredients were done in one location
1,from then on all he 's been like is the villain,from the outset to the acting to the performances he just looks
1,i was expecting a real horror movie but was not too bad on this,i mean the story of her parents is told from her husband she 's told
1,okay okay so let 's get this straight,okay this is one of the reasons why the
1,maybe some people have been born and have problems finding themselves,maybe one day he will do a great job for a better
1,as well the music is a real classic,as it stands it 's no surprise that the
1,paxton plays a bad man in the film with the worst dialogue i have ever heard,paxton 's part is about a year later a kid 's mother is a woman from the
1,so far i do n't seem to,so we could see him again
1,likewise if you are looking for a good film experience this is n't a good choice,likewise the movie is not funny unless you are into watching these movies for an entertaining time
1,do n't read this review go to the movie,do yourself a favor and get this movie
1,also the script was too predictable to be believable,also why should you not be bored by this film
1,unless we are going to have the usual hollywood action you can take them,unless you do love it it 's the first time i see it
1,the first half of the film takes place in time to kill the first,the movie opens without any sort of meaningful discussion of the main characters
1,playing a tough teenager in the beginning is so believable you wonder if it has,playing a role in this film you cannot deny it 's really in trouble
1,he did all of us for free attention to,he gets this part and gets his comeuppance
1,years later the young man and the two are still at the center of attention to their own relationship,years later while he returns home from town in the country they find a dilapidated river located in new york
1,girlfriend who is married but who does n't know in this,girlfriend who was supposed to go missing in this movie
1,maybe he just missed the point for me,maybe it will do in a positive way and
1,instead just like this i would rather spend a sunday in this small town because i do n't want to,instead we 're treated to a bland and dull ending that makes no sense the film becomes even worse
1,bruno mattei 's adaptation of the lord of the rings is a masterpiece as,bruno 's father and he tries to kill an elephant who kills him
1,dolph lundgren plays the young and very cool man,dolph lundgren 's character development is great too
1,let 's just make an argument that,let 's make a better movie
1,when all his films together and that 's funny they are just lame and boring,when your daughter and boyfriend get up from their seats you lose their interest
1,the film would also have been a hit a hard hitting,the whole cast should n't be called even a script
1,but there is something good in the movie the plot is so convoluted that we 're left to ponder where the rest of their lives are,but the worst thing i can say about this other film is that it really had a story to follow with a plot and acting not to
1,it takes a good idea for you to tell you it 's supposed to be a mystery but it is n't,it seems like he is just taking the people 's bodies from his life and the movie makes the movie look artsy
1,even the music score is an interesting mess,even though it is made in the seventies so
1,without spoiling the entire story the music never changes,without revealing the story for a long time i still
1,the fact that the movie is a movie of sorts the director seems,the main character is about as annoying as a sack of milk
1,but she has that of ms o'hara and her daughter,but this should be given away on the plot
1,i was pleasantly surprised to see that this movie was made in new zealand city during the 1980s and early 1950 's,i saw it in the theater in the movie theatre where it was banned and then said it is a great movie
1,in fact all i saw was one character development at once leaving me in tears and had to,in the next of the first two movies i had a feeling this is an excellent adaptation
1,sadly the film is a tad more serious and as the movie progresses from the first half of the plot,sadly his best role is to sing in a different direction and has a lot of potential in hollywood
1,why did n't tarzan know that if the nazis were innocent and,why did n't they call the murderer or not the daughter
1,yes all in all the plot is quite good considering this movie was produced before completion or in 1939 there were,yes this movie has an unusual look and a bit of a sex scene but it is not that bad
1,but they all know nothing about the world from reality,but this time you gotta stop and do the trick
1,now i have to say it was a fun time,now the movie seems very serious and makes me feel sick
1,the whole affair seems so disjointed and so uninteresting that i,the most important thing this movie has is its message
1,judy hayward had a very good voice and some very good acting skills but she was a little too innocent,judy 's mother is also a friend of herself and i could go on for a bit too long
1,renewed the final scene at the end we see our heroes arriving and later on with the,renewed the film and the end as a child of mine have a feeling of sadness
1,this is a film about family with the usual and timeless social commentary and what 's the,this was a great film and i think you 'd find something better of the plot
1,after about a minute of my life i got it,after this movie i did n't have to wait until someone
1,i am glad that i had to take this movie to the extreme,i ca n't believe i missed anything in the first hour of this movie
1,the director of course did a poor job in choosing to create what i thought might be,the performances are well cast the characters are wonderful as are most people in this movie
1,unfortunately i did n't remember that the film did n't give me the chills and,unfortunately the film falls flat with the whole subplot and it is poorly executed
1,this movie was a great and funny experience and one of the best comedies from the year till it was on tv,this show has a more successful view of the family and its subject not just a family with a strong child but their
1,i was n't going to buy it but i have n't seen an episode of this since it is,i did n't care whether it was her or his character when she was the child 's boyfriend
1,seita 's son was a teenager who had the potential to come and then make her own choices,seita 's relationship with her daughter was never addressed as well as the characters so she made it look
1,the rest of the movie seemed to be completely lost,the acting is superb and the direction is excellent
1,the characters do n't make any sense and are just plain stupid,the film has been made by a group of friends known as well
1,could have used more development and more twists and turns to,could have been great for a movie on the oscars
1,the script was absolutely hilarious and i thought that the idea of the movie,the main character is played by richard crenna who was a real genius
1,but the problem is the script has a terrible storyline and the movie suffers from poor direction,but they have to change to get back to some of the characters or get their names on
1,the only difference between the two is that he 's really a,the whole film does a poor job at explaining everything else
1,one wonders why the director who would be responsible for such a brilliant script or what this,one character seems like a very nice character and is probably the funniest of the bunch
1,a good thriller for a horror movie lover to,a lot of people are talking to it
1,and if you were in the room to watch this movie and if you want a good thriller then it 's ok,and the actors do n't seem to care much for his actions but the whole experience is the best thing that could happen
1,the scene is obviously inspired by an,the other actors are great too
1,the acting is wooden but that does n't mean this is bad,the first movie had to be one of my favorites from the tv
1,but the movie still moves on,but this movie is a real stinker
1,he had no idea for a very good reason,he and two friends do very different jobs on the
1,to sum it up this film is a mustsee for anyone,to say this on the imdb is a bad thing
1,most of the time it takes more than just some stock footage where a lot of music videos have done better than most,most of the movies featured the hero of nottingham a little old and old to be a bunch of kids as well
1,they are the best characters on stage,they should of had their brains at this
1,shuttle and a bunch of american kids try to stop them,shuttle is the best show in the past four seasons
1,the problem is with the fact that we are taken into the movie it does not,the movie 's plot has some good songs but i found it tedious to behold
1,the only part of this mess that feels like is when they find themselves in some sort of relationship together,the last segment in the series that came to me as was a bit of a problem that i did n't
1,there is nothing original about the plot in this film,there have n't been a lot of other similar films since
1,no one else has the guts to carry out some scenes,no i would n't waste my time to get this movie on
1,i just ca n't imagine what this movie is,i do n't remember the film being too melodramatic at
1,on that level there are no attempts at humor,on the way all the characters played by the characters
1,the director and the writer just make this comment as far as the movie goes but the movie is the opposite of the book,the main reason i did n't really bother watching this is because the plot was great because it had some great action sequences
1,make me wonder if my friend slept up after a series of,make me think i 'll never be around again and again
1,watching the three o'clock to a different woman being able to see the struggle between the two of them,watching it for the love it would have been a shame if not one and the same scenes
1,everyone else had a problem in this film that was no surprise,everyone is a stereotype of each other and the story is so good
1,the first three films have all gone into the wind and this is one,the only thing that i will say is that i actually laughed once
1,this is one of the alltime great film to explore of a film noir star,this is not one of these films that is neither easy nor realistic or a very
1,or are people saying there was the chance to see a movie,or did they have to take the next flight on and it could
1,the cast also fits nicely to create a,the actors seem to be watching it
1,it might take a while to be able to watch this movie without the slightest,it is a story of the hardships that occur in a very long period
1,but do n't underestimate it for my money,but in the end they leave so much to
1,in a strange way i mean if we have all in the us we will be seeing this movie,in my own personal opinion as they would have made the movie if the director had a script
1,an interesting and entertaining story of the struggles between,an actor of note is a young girl
1,the film does have an interesting plot to,the actors did a fine job too
1,some episodes are so good that they just have to make it the first of three,some people claim he might be better off a bit more and he gets better and better
1,makes it a more enjoyable thriller for those who,makes him look like his real life friend
1,and it is the scene where the mother and the son had,and so i thought the character was going down a bit
1,for a movie of four years it is a very poor film a,for my consideration it 's not worth the time to view it
1,postscript in this case the good guys are not evil,postscript it was a bit more successful and could have been
1,i could go on forever about this the film but instead i got lost,i have never forgotten it a little more so than i can tell my mom
1,i just wish they could get in the car with a group of kids as they,i ca n't think of one thing that was better even worse with this one
1,she does n't want to give this one her first blood she 's just a poor girl,she was so beautiful and she had it in a tv movie so she looked real sexy
1,it 's a long way to stop the action,it may make you laugh at some parts of it
1,after this film they went after a couple of hours of their own just because the,after this incident they 're dead but there 's no real connection to the original
1,though the film was directed by joseph van dien it is also the,though the story is much better it is still a solid film
1,not being able to give credit to,not that he 's an actor
1,a very enjoyable film a true classic,a truly awful film with some decent and
1,this is my favorite movie and i definitely,this was a very low budget movie
1,right i say what a treat to see him act as a guy,right after the death of a girl in a car car accident she tries
1,evening after watching this film i'm 17 or 2 people who live in poverty on their own i 'll be watching it over 20 years until seeing this,evening the night after that is what you do n't see in the first movie if you ask me the killer is n't going for a reason
1,overall this movie was the most enjoyable and,overall this film is a must see
1,on the upside to the main character in,on top of that everything is illuminated
1,this film should be a warning to many people to the people who wrote the score and it,this film reminds me of a good movie a director who loves to be a good director
1,broadcast and i 've come to the conclusion that everyone has been so irritated,broadcast was more of a drama in parts and a bit more thrilling
1,the characters are so well developed you will have a certain feeling it will end and make you feel like something like,the only things that really make this movie enjoyable is that it deals with racial issues like violence corruption and violence
1,therefore the actors get very bad and the actors all seem,therefore he could only use good old school 's computer
1,it 's an obvious combination of the classic and the typical suspects but it works,it should be released on dvd for free but soon afterwards the quality and professionalism of
1,children may get this but the film is not for its very good and very poor but at least there were enough potential to make the film work,children who were forced to choose it would be in their own country and they would n't be able to understand the sexual aspects of the first film as
1,if you are looking for some interesting fun movie you do,if you have never seen the original show or read this i
1,the movie also does n't quite work because the movie 's just plain stupid because it 's no where near up to the,the plot was interesting as it was written about two characters who were sent to play in a very very boring movie
1,4 a man named kenny is a woman who was a little too confused and not in reality,4 the film just got into a weird mess of what you 'd expect a lot of fun
1,there 's nothing interesting or interesting about this film,there are so many twists in this film that no
1,the actors involved in this movie are just as bad people,the cast was well put together especially in their characters
1,the acting performances in this movie are pretty bland,the ending is an insult to our intelligence
1,as it turns out this man has been trying to get his old friends to work so,as the movie continues a young couple of kids are abducted and murdered from her parents
1,it 's all in line with the story to the point that you get a few questions out of it all and in so doing,it could have had a little more atmosphere and the music was a decent fit of the sort that was n't used in the original movie
1,to quote those from these things like it 's a perfect combination and i would recommend seeing it in color and you 'll feel great,to keep the rest of this film on all low budget it certainly is the best of the bunch but then the film is over for
1,granted it 's still a bad movie but it really lacks the cohesion and is,granted it 's not the scariest episode but it 's so stupid and boring
1,hbo has no air force one,hbo and the critics in the world
1,the most memorable scene comes when the couple are playing themselves in the background while a couple of men,the movie has got a lot of nudity and nudity and nudity in it but it 's not
1,and as for my favorite actors for all you 're the ones who have,and the film is a great movie but even the title was n't
1,and that it will make us question it and get the money of the people who are responsible for their work,and he 's the best director ever to have in a movie with a script that can take over it 's potential
1,had the film stayed true to the book and the novel itself was n't faithful to the novel of the original series it was a bit of a disappointment,had the entire idea of the script was a bit less interesting for the most part the character would have given the audience what it needed to be
1,the acting is very very bad and the director 's attempt,the movie is not nearly as good as the first
1,our heroes are introduced as the old white boys in the movie,our heroes are being chased by a sadistic and inhuman madman
1,this was a really bad film,this was one of the best films
1,another great film from the bbc television series has the cameo of the year 2000,another aspect that you have to assume was not going to lose the battle for any
1,approach the story is a perfect blend of action and thriller,approach to a man who did n't really try to adapt it
1,particularly if you 're going to have a good time do n't get any of the reviews,particularly the performances that are at the first rate as he has the thankless roles on the beach
1,they have all to think to help it get to show how they go to,they tried and failed miserably to put all their parts together and failed miserably
1,england has been described as a modern world to have been the greatest movie for years,england was on one night of a tv show and is one of the best of the
1,yes she 's been married to a girl and a few,yes there 's a lot of violence and sexual mutilation
1,alonzo was also one of the best character,alonzo himself is one of the best
1,this film is a complete waste of time,this movie seems to have been made into a
1,demi moore 's performance is excellent and it gives,demi moore is a revelation in this film
1,i give it a 0 on 10 a 10 because i enjoyed them as my friends,i ca n't quite believe that anyone watching this should be able to buy the dvd and
1,it would be as entertaining today if any of,it 's very bad and it is not
1,i ca n't begin to tell you how about this i could have had more than just a few lines,i have no idea why so many of them will not compare this but because it 's not as bad as
1,life lesson is the story of love and honor,life was supposed to be a lot of fun but
1,as for the main storyline of this movie it 's a bit of an annoyance and an odd one indeed,as someone who worked in his life and was able to obtain a few laughs for the duration of his audience
1,she 's a cute little guy but is n't much of an actress,she is an actress who is supposed to be good at that
1,i had always wondered if this was a joke from a high,i do n't really know what to do with this movie
1,people who have seen the films of takashi miike have done this and are not fond of the,people who have seen a terrible terrible film that must admit the acting is terrible beyond belief
1,the whole thing is all there and all of the sudden,the only redeeming feature of this movie are the music of miklos
1,the director must have been a huge fan of this man to the,the story was predictable but the acting and dialogue are great plus
1,i think that the show needed some more work but it never,i also like how they tried to cram it together well
1,the only one can watch the show,the acting is awful but there are a
1,my roommate had a copy of this video and i must admit i loved it for all the reasons it has been put together,my roommate took this movie and it was very good as he made it to the end credits as an exercise a few hours
1,a bunch of friends meet a young woman in the town on their way to their destination and then find her in the river 's,a man who goes into a small mountain in a small town looking for a little girl but does n't want to have children
1,compared with all of hitchcock 's movies i highly,compared to those films it 's not funny
1,to be honest i'm no prude fan or any of us to watch this kind of movie,to be honest i do n't think i 've ever seen another actor in one film together
1,we are never given much value and neither is anyone else really involved,we know this was probably a comedy when a movie made a bad thing
1,the cast does an excellent job,the story starts in the first 10
1,you 'll be glad that you did not have the money,you do n't get to see a horror type of film in
1,on that note i 'd like to quote the plot in the movie with the comment regarding the plot and the story itself,on the other hand robert deniro was not funny as the other villain who was the best actor he could possibly have written he
1,for me this scene shows more interaction between the two leads than we might,for fans of the classic work of the likes of ichi and miss
1,hurling aside the action there was that and i ca n't really understand why it could have been set,hurling the kids with the devil and his family who are both the youngest man and the girl
1,they 're a bunch of people who have become trapped on the highway while the other soldiers are killed while their victims turn up to get their hopes,they 're the perfect target for a man who is in a hospital full of his girlfriend and they ca n't seem to find it in other words
1,from the viewpoint of a chinese to a man of the cloth you ca n't help but like them just look at the camera for the first time,from the beginning she gets to sing sing and she 's a big rock and it 's not clear when a young woman is trying to be funny
1,what does it have to do with it,what do i know about this movie
1,he 's really not on the phone and he,he 's like he was in the book
1,is there any real message to any of the actors or how well written their lines are,is the director really trying to make an art movie feel more real than i expected
1,four of the most famous stories are the very early,four thumbs up for the rest of the cast
1,it makes it impossible for you to find the way to see if it belonged or not like in the middle that you will have seen before the big screen and you know,it 's difficult to get sympathy from any of this characters but if you just care about the characters they are in the story that really care and even think you are missing something
1,firstly the film has to be seen to be believed in the end and it 's only a couple of scenes in this one which are n't very gory yet a satisfying and gory ending on that film,firstly it would n't have worked so well without the action and violence and you 'd never figure out what the story is about as you know the story has nothing to do with the real reason why
1,phenomenal performance from the entire cast are also all great here,phenomenal performance from director richard benjamin and an excellent cast
1,well first of all the film is a waste of time and money is so much fun,well the best in any movie about the movie is that the story is n't really a drama
1,the movie revolves around a group of people who do not have to go on a mission to save,the two main leads were great and that in itself was a bit weak considering the low budget
1,george lopez had a good sense of humor but he seemed to be on autopilot,george 's son is no different to what you want to know to be
1,this movie was released in the late '80s,this movie will probably be an indication of why
1,it was not the movie not to,it 's a very good movie
1,stallone was just about to use a camera,stallone plays a scientist who is trying to bring
1,the first one was definitely a lot better with a bunch of friends getting their teeth out and going to go out to a,the most ridiculous aspect of this film was that the cast made a good amount of laughs during the making of this movie
1,characters are supposed to be funny at best,characters are n't very different in the movie
1,there have been many movies that seem to suck to so many people they have to have seen more than this one,there is a lot of violence in it so it wo n't be funny if that is n't enough to redeem things rather
1,i 've seen the other two parts and this is the only one i ever saw on the cinema,i do n't mind you but a lot of people complain because they are too much of a joke
1,no wonder this movie has this one in common with the others of the genre or if it 's a parody,no matter how hard you try to explain or forgive in order to appreciate his work he 's a little confused
1,the only thing i could find is that a,the dialogue is full to arouse the attention
1,anyone could possibly be entertained during the day with a film of the week,anyone who could have an interest in her film is not so much
1,and the best part of it all is,and that was a few weeks ago
1,real actors would n't be able to act a little over,real human beings in the world should do a more
1,with the other comments i read here in imdbcom this film is no exception,with her eyes and a hand to her face she has the ability to create
1,a lot of the plot holes do not explain it but that 's another,a woman 's performance in the film is actually quite a bit rough
1,and this movie is a complete stinker,and the film moves well with no tension
1,the only reason people have to think is if you 're going to sit through the whole,the fact that all women do very little with the same is not a good idea
1,we learn to read the original book,we are told that this guy has become
1,but the film is not in the way,but that 's where it falls apart
1,and of course she does n't have a scratch that 's only,and i agree with anyone who commented that i love it
1,i think it would n't make any difference if there was no shortage of the character 's and he would have to do,i found the whole plot to have been extremely interesting but this film turned out to be boring and pointless and boring
1,the film has a few funny moments but does not,the rest of the cast plays their roles competently
1,and yet the film has never been made before,and the last five minutes of the movie are so
1,that 's the only reason that i,that 's all i can say
1,yup i know i 've already seen the movie but it is not,yup the story revolves around a group of men who are dying
1,lori allen appears in this film as a director for her to make a breakthrough film on her own,lori and her aunt 's sister who are being pursued by this serial murderer decide to take revenge her father
1,he 's always funny because he always does,he meets all three men and it works
1,this one 's been trying to be a failed attempt to put down on,this film has the same appeal as other works except the beginning credits
1,overall i'm not trying to watch this film,overall a movie with some flaws to it
1,but if you 're looking for a comedy that 's all just a little more interesting,but we never find out why that 's why this is not even remotely funny
1,my favourite movie has in my opinion,my only regret that i will never get
1,how do you even think when i'm a big fan of the movies,how was that a favour in that a good place on camera
1,he can even keep her from getting a divorce at the expense,he meets his wife who is pregnant and decides to marry him and
1,the script is n't good it 's not funny either,the whole story of the film revolves around two characters that
1,max nolte plays an important character who is a loner,max and his team decide that they ca n't save the
1,razzle pani is better in this case,razzle dazzle and its humor are a bit
1,the story is a basic story and the cast is very poor,the film is a bit of an exercise in any of the other
1,the film is shot without a clear message to speak in a manner like that,the acting is very good too as she is the only one who manages to pull
1,it is an important and moving movie in my opinion but the most disturbing to me was the soundtrack,it 's not just that the budget was too cheap to be able to make even less convincing in its
1,and the film has a really strong cast which adds to the overall excellence of this,and the director has done a good job giving a good view of the movie
1,perhaps the director was going to have a few lines which were all quite,perhaps this was more of a parody of a spoof than a feature
1,it has a very good premise that i can see in several parts,it is a complete waste of money on the list of them
1,the ending is really quite boring,the plot is not particularly original or
1,there is a reason why the series 's creators just make sure the writers are making the same thing,there were also two major differences to make us believe that the us government was able to do that in
1,full of holes i found myself wanting to turn out very pretty,full marks should be made to put this movie in the trash bin
1,as far as i can tell the rest of the cast including a young david carradine and james earl,as a consequence of the story the director uses for his character to have him into a caricature
1,the movie ends abruptly in an extended flashback sequence where in the middle of the night when that means this is,the most notable thing about this is the fact that the production values were not at best the same age
1,his brother is a doctor and they are not only happy because of course,his character is a likable stereotype who seems to be a bit naive at first
1,a good movie it is based on true events,a story of two sisters an impoverished man a woman
1,i do n't have any idea what this film is supposed to be,i would n't even say that the film was a great movie
1,now they 're trying to get to its destination,now that if they are talking about why they are
1,having already fallen in love with the younger brother is n't quite as exciting as the original,having seen this film in the last few weeks of the night it seemed to be going over
1,you get even a little bit of action a bad director a killer and a weird character,you have all of your usual ingredients and the fact that your time spent watching it was even
1,even though the film was a good one i really thought it might be,even the action sequences alone seem to have been filmed with a cut
1,this film is an absolutely terrible and dull movie,this was a very enjoyable film which was great
1,lil abner is an intelligent movie,lil deol is not as good as
1,much of the time however is not as bad as they just seem and,much of the humor is in every single episode and is really boring
1,okay i know i missed what i saw,okay now that 's a big flaw
1,the plot does n't sound stupid and the dialogue is n't as bad as many others from the book,the action sequences are all good but not for the faint it is just a bunch of boring boring action
1,i hope i saw his own interpretation of,i would recommend this movie to viewers
1,also i ca n't seem to think of anyone else that could compare it to this movie,also the movie did n't have enough time to develop the storyline it had to be taken simply
1,but at least it 's like the script,but then the action kicks up on some more
1,i 've got to admit that i did have a lot of expectations for this show and this was a real surprise,i was n't surprised to learn that the film was supposed to be a comedy but it was quite enjoyable enough
1,the script is weak with this flimsy idea that we 're never really about and you can only dream,the movie is an attempt at some sort of parody but it 's not enough to be remotely suspenseful and
1,am i a fan of the art form,am i glad you 're in a bad mood
1,and how a young kid could play in the first place is,and that 's about the only redeeming quality in the film
1,hence there is no reason why a lot of people feel so ashamed to understand that,hence she is at the top of my list of top stars in the world
1,so do yourself a favor and get the other two of them out there,so for all those who have seen better movies in its prime this is still
1,one could also see the director and actors and crew on a train and have them on a road trip to the beach where all of them were filmed,one of the great films of all time universal producer sam mendes 's the league of the greatest film in my time a far cry from being a masterpiece and
1,they have an unnatural conversation with a doctor and tries to steal his family,they do n't care about anyone who has to go to the other side of
1,while the film 's score is rather odd it does leave viewers feeling that the director has taken to the production that it is a film and that it is a lot more than it is,while they are out to find the way they are detained in the middle of the river 's life is an absolute struggle between and the man who is n't afraid to take care of them either
1,but if i have n't enjoyed the film since i had a child,but the story was not so stupid and the acting was horrible
1,come in that movie as well,come on a dvd of a sequel
1,when this is not going to be the second and least of the three stories of the first,when the show is canceled i feel obligated to be left in a state of sheer pain
1,i'm just not sure what to think,i'm not saying that anyone in the past
1,this movie should have been in theaters in the 80 's,this movie is an insult to all fans of the genre
1,i 'd like to watch a whole lot of people 's minds,i thought this was going to be a pretty good movie that i
1,everyone involved just phoned fun at each other,everyone seems to know what in the hell of
1,another very good example of the most popular of the 70 's,another thing that makes this show is its humor and very funny special
1,sandy bakula gives a good performance as a woman who befriends,sandy silverman is a brilliant actress and that 's about the only
1,the movie also does a fine job of showing the true,the only good thing about the film is the music
1,the story of a man called goliath and his wife who must have an accident,the movie really was n't as bad as his other films of which it has been
1,tcm was probably the worst movie i have ever seen,tcm shows her range which would become very popular in the
1,funny to think about the fact that it is n't bad,funny to think that it was made by the creator of the
1,chaplin had a knack for finding and the new york city,chaplin 's best performance as the villain is very reminiscent of jack
1,luckily the rest was just bad,luckily when in the midst of the
1,there is no question why the other character 's are not so much as to leave the rest of the story,there was so much information that i could have liked the first three i was in for a little more and more
1,the director has an idea of how he has handled the,the film has the power of a very good movie
1,the fact that it is not the end of a trilogy,the only thing in the story that really bothered me i found
1,until the war itself becomes more convincing more intriguing and more complicated than we are watching on one of the tv series,until this guy has had the gift not the right amount of a great actor his ability to act in the last frame
1,i would have rated it a zero instead of a,i would rather watch a film of my time
1,it 's more important than in most cases you have seen here on a large,it 's not enough of a budget b movie and deserves a better rating
1,i can only wish the next movie was n't to be watched i can not watch it,i was looking forward to seeing the original movie but this is only one of the reasons i
1,the first time i seen an episode from the original series with the little mermaid i realized that it was n't even the best,the first thing i noticed is that some of the dialog is so awful in it 's own words that it 's unbelievable
1,kris kristofferson is great as the sheriff,kris kristofferson was the only highlight of the
1,hell what a shame that the story is not,hell we 're all you want to know
1,at first they are all about their girlfriends and their family,at first im thinking of doing this movie a little
1,i ca n't believe this was one of the first films released in theaters,i will say that while i have no problem with the characters i can still
1,and if that 's about it it 's also a good,and when people go to hell it is a mistake
1,there 's really nothing here to make this film better but it 's still pretty funny,there is some good points i hope in an example for some kind of explanation and a
1,director james b demille directed this movie about a young,director tom berenger makes one look like oscar material
1,joyce is a real good actor and the young,joyce tells her if you love the movie
1,not as a bad horror movie but,not for all the wrong reasons
1,shows the true talent of an american and her own feelings behind the camera,shows a lot of emotion and the ability to be more than just like the
1,with a low budget and poor performances i did n't even care about anyone 's motivation for watching this tripe,with the help of john 's mother the man also has to work in the home of the children
1,imdb user comments praising the movie as to why to,imdb i have a good idea of the plot
1,caan was one of the few times you 'd think that he was not in for a very long,caan is one of the best actors in the film that is the best part of the movie
1,i had just watched the trailer for the other thing,i just wanted to get up to it after
1,although the subject matter certainly did n't really come across as a good idea this is a great film not a movie at all,although the character of alicia 's father is a bit of a wimp it never does have the heart to embrace the viewer 's attention
1,this is a film that does n't,this is a film for adults
1,it 's like a bunch of kids trying to make an episode,it 's also a great film and it definitely is not
1,there is no question why some people will know what this film was like,there are some nice touches in the movie it was done on a loop with
1,the film is not even an action picture,the acting ranges from bad to flat
1,while the characters are portrayed in the film the audience is given a view of the subject matter,while it is not hard to figure out one 's identity is the story is that of john merrick
1,in reality however the film is still a fun show with,in the end this movie is not without good thrills
1,the film is a bit over the top but it has its flaws,the film takes over the last 40 minutes as though the director had no
1,also the scene where the guy is,also the ending was pretty awful
1,overall i must say that this movie,overall it 's well worth seeing
1,that 's all the movie is about,that 's not to say it was just
1,turner was just a typical villain that made the story such a bad one,turner 's film is a little less subtle than his most recent film which is
1,i 've got to admit that this is a very low budget piece of garbage,i think this could easily have been a great movie a director with only a few
1,ive seen this movie when i need a movie i can,ive always been fascinated by what i 've always seen
1,and if you know anything you see the characters are a complete wimp,and i do n't think anything that will be forgotten from your viewing viewing
1,i am going to give this dvd release in a video transfer,i also liked the movie and the actors are pretty good
1,sumi is a bit confused that her acting is not believable but a very good actress,sumi 's sister just did n't have a very bright point and she was a jerk
1,the plot was simple but the direction of this is great,the characters are good and it 's all the way a big
1,life that i did not like but i loved both this and the ending which,life will probably not disappoint and the fans will embrace what their will think
1,back then it was never explained before the show began to lose its,back in 1986 he was the only actor who had a chance
1,hearing this to yourself that i was watching the film i had been,hearing how i came to grips with the movie in the end
1,it is not a bad movie but it is very hard to sit through,it makes the movie all the more thrilling and so in my mind the better
1,sub par is it me as one can say this has the best lines the movie has ever,sub par is the worst movie of the year and this guy has really no talent whatsoever
1,too bad it is just a waste of time,too bad that i was n't too busy laughing
1,there are a lot of other flaws in this movie that are too old,there 's some nice fun here but the rest of the movie is just another
1,you know anything about what they have in mind for you to believe them,you could have done a better job of watching a young woman than she would
1,though he played with the best of his colleagues he still remains a real human being and gives this film a truly remarkable score,though the premise of the original version and the dialogue between the title song is pretty good this movie falls into the latter category and
1,so what can and other than do we 're not to accept,so i think that the movie might have been in my opinion much
1,role acting and direction were all too obvious,role of this serial killer is n't nearly worth
1,although the production values are low budget and the editing is just plain awful,although the story line takes a little bit in it 's resolution with the addition
1,you get to learn more from her character after leaving her,you 'll see what happened after the first 3 minutes
1,he makes it interesting to see his girlfriend and her body and his family life,he is given a short look but he does n't have one funny thing
1,our hero plays a dumb character,our heroes and their friends are on
1,hank was so much better then the usual cgi and he used the same old same old same voice tricks and,hank who is on the run from the law finds an egg which appears to play their part very well
1,i saw this movie yesterday when it was,i guess that it is the truth
1,just as bad was the poor quality,just sit back relax with your buddies
1,if they do n't want it and the only other movie that has come out of the usa,if i were to have a few more bucks about some time i still think about it
1,personally i 'd be missing out on one thing if it,personally i loved the movie it was just plain bad
1,this is what you find in an independent movie,this leads to a series of pointless happenings
1,now that does n't matter because they are all on the same,now imagine i was n't watching this show after ten minutes
1,the music does not fit and jolson 's character does a fine job but the script itself is too much to bear,the movie also suffers from being a very cheesy thriller with a bunch of characters that are constantly thrown in on a lot
1,in summary i saw this on tv a few years back at,in this movie they meet as a youngster and the cops
1,the story is interesting and it is a film about a real friendship and a happy ending but it 's a total,the film was an excellent adaptation of the book which i know is a remake at the boxoffice in my opinion
1,i really ca n't see why,i saw it at the san francisco
1,while it is n't all very good it is probably one of the best of the columbo series that was also on the list and it really was fun to,while most are the same in real life in a way that makes the film better than the first film it was just dull and boring and not worth
1,they also do an interview with the movie,they did n't know who they were and the
1,maybe the best scene is the ending where it 's not that there are so many things i do n't like about this film,maybe even worse to the point that a film is not made as an exercise in an old movie it is just a little too
1,so it 's not that bad,so i think that this will be
1,and i thought i 'd give it an eight stars,and the film is a perfect example of how awful the
1,you 'll wish you had to have a,you 're a teenager or a parent
1,some people will have the most important problems about this film which means it was n't,some of the worst scenes are not supposed to make me laugh at the end
1,movie is just a lot less interesting to the more sensitive the characters are,movie like this was funny and i was still a fan of it
1,the acting is so natural that it is hard to get away with it,the movie started out fairly well as we did know in the first part but
1,the film starts out with a couple of minutes of promise the director 's daughter looks like an,the best part could have been better was the director was going to get to the scene
1,the movie is as a journey through a new world of old men as the world 's,the other people are a mixture of bad acting poor acting and generally some terrible acting
1,he also did n't get to run away from his friend or even the police he was n't really interested in the,he does n't realize that the only person he 's forced to go to die comes close to the same cloth
1,each has their own personality and it also is n't the first time,each of the characters is very well done a good one who is n't
1,ayres 's character is so incredibly bad that it,ayres does a superb job in his role
1,seeing this film will not change the appeal if you have any consideration for yourself,seeing this film i would have liked to know where they were with the people in
1,factory masterson is an old guy who becomes one of the last of the,factory whitaker is on the screen as a young woman with a conscience
1,george 's role is in my opinion the perfect film of that period,george orwell 's 'the phantom of the opera a unique and inventive film that
1,in fact the movie did n't quite work out at all,in his own good luck he is unable to cope with and
1,the only thing i have to do is the story line to the end of a movie,the film 's main character is an ardent businessman of the age of innocence yet his love for
1,this film is one of our favorites,this is a movie not to be taken
1,it is the most unique of the three installments of the history that it 's not a total washout,it does n't seem like that was what made the movie so bad and i do n't care if they
1,this film was awful and there were,this one also was a disappointment
1,you could easily see the similarities between this film and their two men 's struggle to take place,you ca n't really tell who and not to take the scene from and do something useful
1,also it was very predictable at times,also the story of the book is so
1,if you must have some fun on the big screen,if you want to see an independent film you can see
1,the rest of the film is not an easy one,the best and most stupid lines are when the police force
1,especially the ending where she does n't,especially the girl in white dress
1,this show is the biggest winner in tv for sure,this movie was filmed by one who has just moved to
1,john mctiernan 's classic novel about the consequences of life,john cassavetes 's career is so good as always
1,the problem is that he does n't care about it for that,the plot was not a big part and it was a very straightforward
1,regrettably when it comes up again we find a,regrettably the show does not get off screen
1,he finds them dead because of his father 's,he 's not even a very good character
1,i ca n't understand why a lot of other people here died over the film and made fun of their relationship,i watched the first movie of the original and was shocked that the rest in the cast did n't help
1,sure enough the movie does have little of the charm and atmosphere of the original the story of,sure it 's as simple predictable and boring as the original but it certainly does not work
1,as long as there 's a good story with a twist,as they meet in the film 's protagonists they decide to play
1,the scene where a woman walks through a window has a,the movie itself is quite predictable for the young viewer
1,i was so impressed by the film that i thought the acting was,i mean it could go wrong in the second and last seconds
1,i love this movie and think that the story will hold up for,i am so confused that i have wasted time on this film
1,the ending was way to long for,the story is n't funny anymore
1,there was a very interesting plot involving the doctor whose name was built up in the beginning to the end where the killer has no motive,there was a few scenes in the movie which i liked the way it did make me feel sick when he got his shirt out
1,next up he is to the devil the vampire slayer,next i can understand that this whole film was written for
1,my favorite character is that of the girl from the house,my wife would love it but i ca n't wait for it
1,will smith do well on a screen with a character,will you just find an actress on him playing a role
1,and it 's even better the acting is great,and i know it is n't a complete loss
1,the whole cast is perfect and it fits in the plot in,the acting is atrocious and the story was n't really funny
1,louise beavers plays a beautiful woman who takes her husband from a car and turns her into a man of her own,louise is a nice actress but she makes it believable and is a natural character who is always an extremely likable character
1,this has got to be the worst movie that,this movie seems to drag from other shows
1,yeah that 's exactly how it ended,yeah it just did n't feel like what
1,so many people in this movie can watch it,so i think it would have been nice to see
1,despite the poor acting of the characters who were n't supposed to be sympathetic i still wanted to care,despite the bad script and directing the actors are a little dull and in the sense that there is no
1,after a while that is not a big problem of the genre,after a while i thought i was going to watch an ad
1,ultimately the idea that the characters are just an unsympathetic bunch would not have been developed,ultimately the story is so stupid that you 'll not have to take it anymore
1,it was good seeing a fine cast member like me to like it,it 's also difficult to believe how easy the actors were involved in this
1,the story is a little slow and uninteresting with a plot that is basically not funny,the film is about two people from different backgrounds who have sex with each other
1,songwriter is so obsessed with the character he seeks to emulate and eventually to,songwriter has an extraordinary talent that allows the audience to give it up
1,i 'll also add a few more examples here but it 's too hard not to miss out of my stomach,i will not say if i was looking for a copy of this film on a double or dvd player of a
1,also starring robert duvall and christopher reeve,also the only decent acting in the movie
1,stick on this movie is a movie that i was delighted to think about and did n't really matter as i,stick to the same as you get a better idea about making an entertaining show and just watch the show
1,many people have commented on the lack of understanding of why it 's such a film,many things i do n't understand here is that this film is the worst i 've ever
1,in a time when the director has done a thing to solve the problem he does,in my opinion it is just another film that is so bad it is good
1,i mean the acting was horrible the story was weak and it is even worse,i liked her performance in the two films but this is the most horrible
1,chuck norris is the best and most of his acting ability,chuck connors as good as ever was he is excellent in his
1,it is one of the most beautiful and most haunting moments of a film i have seen recently,it 's a simple story with a couple of clever characters and a decent finale as well
1,do n't waste your money with your,do n't expect to come away
1,he is such a good guy,he is in love with a woman
1,he also gets away with a good and bad job,he was so good on a very long career
1,i love all the seasons and it shows,i will be honest if i had a friend
1,i 've seen it several times so i do n't have to rewind it with your next friend,i do n't care more on how the film should be made and the film is full of ideas
1,i saw this film a few times and found it to be a pretty hilarious movie,i 'll never try to get into what it was the film actually had the entire story
1,the acting is good with all the stars and actresses in the supporting roles,the film is a mishmash of clichs that are really rare to produce and should
1,wow this is what i think about this movie,wow i think he would probably make her a bit
1,everything i love of horror movies are done so this film is a little out there it 's certainly a lot more interesting,everything that was wrong about it is that in the same manner that the book was done by which he used all the scenes
1,steven seagal 's direction is terrible i doubt even,steven soderbergh has a nice touch at work
1,this film is probably the funniest of its run,this film is a bit slow in the fact that
1,well you must tell your girlfriend you are in the mood for a good film to watch,well done and directed on screen i ca n't blame the actors from a few years of praise
1,as the series progressed he was more interested in making the work of the first one than the simpsons that was it 's sequel,as he is revealed and in the process of getting into bed she does n't get to the top of the sea or his life
1,john woo is in it for a long long time and as for all the other cast members he,john sayles had a great story to work with here that is both the movie and its message
1,the acting is superb and the direction is excellent,the first season was good the first episode was great
1,sadly the director has a great job of directing a script,sadly this was a much better film as a whole
1,not all is good here but there is absolutely no suspense,not to mention how many times of this show were so ridiculous
1,i would n't say that this is my favorite movie in the world but it 's one of the best and it 's all just a fun one,i was hoping to be on the edge of my seat in front of the camera as i watched this move through but it was a little slow to
1,the only reason i like the series so much is because i was not afraid of something,the story is a lot to make and that was a little more than a little
1,dick haymes did a great job,dick tracy was pretty good as the
1,it was very very good but at it 's time it was a poor production,it 's hard to imagine how to do the research in this movie but i can
1,it is n't even so much a film that you can barely see what it is trying to portray,it is a very good performance from the two leads to each others that play in the film
1,in many ways they did n't have that same concept and did the same thing,in fact it 's obvious that this is the only film ever made in the united
1,i watched it for 3 minutes and it was so damn painful i 'd watch it again,i saw this film and i must admit that i do think it is a great film
1,it 's one of the best movies i 've ever seen,it is the story of how many people can enjoy every episode
1,their relationship is one of only the most cynical and evil in all these women,their son is played by george sanders as the title character and was not only a
1,his only minor contribution was his relationship with,his character is too flat and annoying
1,this is the biggest waste of time i have ever seen,this is about a guy who lives in an isolated hotel with
1,as far as the acting performances the script was awful,as much as the movie has many different scenes one can
1,let 's put it this way,let me begin without spoiling the story
1,well it 's the typical tv show that makes the plot not a very good one,well it is n't as good as the other reviewers and it 's hard to believe how
1,because it has a great storyline,because i saw the first one and
1,it 's like it was done for tv or tv show and they,it did not seem in depth as they were supposed to be
1,adopting the cast with this script of an episode of a film they 're not a complete disgrace,adopting this a woman who had sex with two men and girls who killed the girls and then became
1,this is a must see film,this is the third of its many
1,how could he just give a damn about her,how many times have they done a better job
1,what i found a film that kept me,what a waste that should be ashamed
1,one could argue that the story would never quite live up to the original but that would have been,one of them tells the story of how not to do a movie without a full of holes
1,so i decided to watch it thinking it was a comedy,so you have to see this film to believe it
1,the plot is thin yet i liked it,the action takes off from two genres but the
1,that in itself is a wonderful way to waste a lifetime,that is why it shows how it was not done in the
1,1 out of 10 i highly recommend,1 out of 10 best performance
1,but the film opens into a ridiculous disaster film with,but they all seem to have a bad relationship
1,of course the man does n't have much of a role to play the,of course that would have been the movie to make a good movie
1,or maybe they could have done more,or if you have the deepest respect for
1,it also features an extremely long flashback sequence where a group of men are trying to get some,it does n't work to engage into a movie that you ca n't escape from its predecessor
1,this film was no exception in the film because it,this film is absolutely no exception in both areas
1,i also wanted to give a different perspective on this character as it did,i just saw this movie on tv on a special night and the second one
1,this could have been a decent film if the action scenes were n't for the violence but the film makes no sense,this was one of the best films of the year with the new actors in both the big stars and the best actors
1,the acting is awful and the directing makes the most of the scenes unconvincing,the first half hour of the film makes me wonder what the film maker must
1,i did n't know the killer was a good boy and i was bored so i just,i was so annoyed so much to watch as it was actually a little bit dated
1,i hope he will even keep an open mind and it is very difficult to find something new about it,i 'd just like to know how much can be changed from the film by director vincente minnelli 's portrayal of
1,spoiler of course i was n't that stupid,spoiler so i ca n't imagine that he might
1,house of frankenstein is pretty much a film of cat in monster lake placid and its,house of god is one of those movies that can hold together for a while
1,the film was filmed as a dream show in all the fun to,the best and the best and the film is a mustsee movie
1,she 's married to an immature woman who has lost her job,she plays the role of a very strong character not the least of
1,with his friends as a woman his parents and parents are n't quite as funny,with a few exceptions with his earlier films she does n't seem to know what she
1,bad things wrong and bad news on,bad acting bad bad bad bad
1,probably the worst movie ever made and it would be at it 's core,probably the worst show on television television and it 's not that bad and not
1,harry callahan who plays the lead role as an excellent woman and a sexy little girl but she,harry gets his own life and offers her a chance in the world to be his family
1,mutual born is a fine thriller that should of been the same as the other two,mutual attraction is that of a man whom the world had not done in other movies
1,all is just well to show the real world of the human beings,all of the jokes are funny sometimes the humor was quite funny and the
1,however the story is not that bad,however despite the terrible script to get through
1,the story of a woman who 's been rejected by,the story begins by and a very strange ending
1,oh dear oh yes maybe maybe i wanted the same for,oh well it 's a good movie at some points
1,one is a woman struggling with a child 's love affair the other,one star with a lot of fun and it 's really good
1,i saw this when it was originally released on video and it came out in my own,i am amazed and i have seen the first one now and it does not matter
1,this is a very good movie,this may as well have won a
1,leland is a big fat liar from the first family is the,leland 's character is the worst link in the whole world
1,if you like to watch a movie about the holocaust you have to go,if people do n't understand this movie or why there were so many americans and
1,shot over in the summer of the summer is by no means an exception but a very,shot for the new millennium in mexico the story of the american family moves to england
1,a great premise this movie should be remembered in a film theater and in its,a very funny and exciting movie that will stay in your memory right away
1,will a couple of people run from this to their next,will this movie made even the worst of the horror genre
1,too i should never say for sure there are people who love good movies or you will have much to see,too much has been made of it for an adult audience the fact that they have no plot lines no plot no
1,it 's a shame that we did n't even get the movie,it 's easy for people who love to look at this kind of
1,they 're so great so badly filmed and so poorly choreographed,they were so bad that it was hard to believe this could
1,lloyd 's life is the most accurate aspect of this film so it seems as if this film,lloyd crowe is the leader of his own son who has been in trouble for the past
1,the problem was that the movie had been produced and played a few parts with more interesting music to make it a better experience to sit through,the whole thing seems to have been written in the background on the characters and they just randomly decided to put in a bit of effort
1,this movie had such a good script and was,this is the one that made me laugh
1,at this point this movie 's main weakness to the film is his work but the way he develops the truth,at the beginning of the movie we see a woman falling in love with an angel and she takes her
1,susan sarandon was great in her role and i,susan hayward is also excellent in her role
1,this is just a bad movie,this movie is about a bunch of
1,the only reason i'm giving this movie a 2 is because it 's not too bad that is pretty bad,the other actors also contribute some more extra class material to the proceedings but overall one of her best performances
1,it was a pleasure to watch the two separate lovers of the first season,it 's just a shame for me and i 've never seen a worse film
1,this film has been so much more,this guy and the duke of the world
1,diana rigg plays the reporter an innocent husband and a young daughter for a magazine,diana dors is a wonderful woman with the right luck as a young woman 's love
1,isabel chopra is superb as the conflicted and somewhat astute aunt,isabel and his gang boss a mysterious man who befriends michael his
1,bad acting bad casting horrible dialogue and,bad script bad acting no effort
1,leaves the rest of the film to a young man,leaves this film alone will be more a film
1,upon a number of episodes i felt no sympathy for these two characters,upon visiting a mysterious man who lives with his mother in a wheelchair and
1,enter victor vargas 's character of frankenstein,enter the theater where it was supposed to
1,yet the story remains relatively engrossing,yet in the end you see a
1,look it might appear to have some of the same type of humor,look at one of the other reviews the comments from other posters
1,this is a good movie for kids,this one is n't a particularly good one
1,i am not going to spoil things that i am sure,i do n't think people will remember the word firth so highly
1,the plot is just terrible and you ca n't really blame the director,the movie moves along like a fairy tale to come with a plot that
1,i was not disappointed by the ending,i am surprised that it lasted
1,some may dislike this movie and i'm not,some of the shots are nice though
1,hogan is just right in the middle and,hogan 's character is in his prime
1,if you do n't like the character of luke,if nothing else the film is a bore
1,but i guess this really could be a fun movie,but all of you really are not sure whether or not
1,it 's not an easy way out for an independent film though,it was very similar to the original tarzan and mouse series and was
1,what a waste of talent it made me want to yell,what follows is the real story that keeps you laughing throughout and
1,this was the main theme in life by the people,this is what the film was trying to convey
1,the only thing that 's funny about this movie is if you,the acting was decent and the special effects were good too
1,he 's always in the dark of his face and the fact that,he has a very good movie style for which it was filmed
1,these films were released mostly on the market as a series because the studio was released,these two actors appear more in their performances than some actual actors in the movie
1,the plot is n't just that the main focus,the character is believable and believable to watch
1,also one ca n't help but feel his,also the ending is a bit unsatisfying
1,and the two young lovers in the film do n't give a strong view of the movie,and the most obvious problem is the fact that it was a terrible attempt at something that really
1,despite all this it is a true story of some of the more flamboyant characters in contemporary history and that they have the advantage of an older child,despite having a good movie and this does not try too hard to do anything about it the audience should not get away from it because it shows how
1,his only true life is his character,his character is all rather bland and does
1,it 's supposed to be a satire because of the quality of the plot and the acting,it 's a shame that the only way you got to see this movie was to learn how
1,they try to make a decent movie with a great premise and,they 're on a ship where he 's talking to himself
1,so i do n't think i 'll ever be able to sit through it again because it lasts about 15 minutes,so as much as a curiosity can be done for it i think it would have been something in this one
1,while you have a great idea for the plot i,while watching the film i did n't like it
1,i was just laughing on and watching it but it was not that bad,i think that the two guys have done some work in the movies and this
1,the story is simple and has some very good characters,the acting was excellent the script was very solid and the
1,secondly the first was bad to say the least,secondly what was a great show and that they should
1,in most way the characters are not developed as we feel for them for example,in fact the actors look like they were reading the script from any other movie
1,in the end he was given some great opportunities to make good movies but not everything in this movie is really bad,in real life a person is the best of the two people who are being stalked by the evil man that they are
1,richard chamberlain is excellent and does a very good job to,richard lester has a very limited role as the sheriff
1,now it 's a fun film for your parents who are the type of movie,now to the director 's credit this movie would have gone away from beginning to end
1,with such a great production it would become a different picture than the,with all it 's worth seeing and you wo n't be disappointed
1,it was good idea to make good use of a certain plot to keep the action going,it might not be a movie noir but to say this is one of the most horrible and
1,also there are some funny moments,also the film is n't a true
1,the director gives up a little of his own life and,the cast and crew did n't even bother getting that
1,2 the plot devices are ridiculous,2 i am in the military and
1,elwood just wants to keep a straight face,elwood 's brother of the family he played with
1,the movie 's score is very catchy especially the music video,the dialogue is a little stilted too i was very surprised to
1,harry is a great actor but it 's hard for him to show it,harry met this family of mine not unlike the father and his mother
1,but i will give it a try by the end to the next generation who just was n't the same for me,but the problem is that the plot is too obvious just like a fairy tale which it would have been a better movie
1,you can see the first part of,you will know who killed them
1,stalling is one of the best films about a man who will make a fool of himself as a,stalling is the epitome of bad horror film the lowest and lower than others could chew this movie
1,only when you look at the film 's reflection the movie itself is not the typical hollywood blockbuster like most other countries which have not been seen anywhere near,only for you to love as your own child you should not watch this movie over and over again as you know how you get the same message
1,i 've seen this film and it has all the suspense of a snuff film,i loved the book and the two of them i saw in the previews
1,for the first time mr rochester was so much more,for no apparent reason why is this so bad
1,i was expecting a lot more from this movie,i thought this was going to be a serious joke
1,i'm pretty sure one is tempted to accept the fact that a person who has n't seen,i'm a fan of movies so i do n't think this one had good looking stars
1,it was great as to why and how good this sequel is,it was fun seeing that at a cinema screening as the producer of
1,aside from the obvious lack of suspense this is an enjoyable movie,aside with a few gags it 's a shame that no one has
1,sometime in the movie it was in fact an intimate film that dealt with the themes,sometime in the first one we then get a monster and mouse from the ground
1,if you are in the mood for a classic movie i,if you love the original do n't bother with it
1,the story has a lot of plot holes and i 'll not go into that movie solely because of the ending but there,the first hour is pretty funny the only saving grace are the performances that are so incredibly dull they 're almost painful
1,the most amazing aspect of the movie is the fact that the acting is not all bad,the film also does a great job at recreating the life of three women who were married to
1,viewing this film and i did n't really think much of it,viewing for the very first time in a while the film is so
1,at other times i was a friend of the film theater,at the last times a film starts with a group of friends
1,the movie is supposed to be about a woman who is cheating on her daughter not knowing her name but she is a beautiful woman,the script by jerry j davis jr is a very clever one and the main villain is n't even a funny guy but he 's the
1,ponyo seems to be the reason the movie was made because they were just making the movie a lot less successful,ponyo becomes the subject matter for this series while avoiding a bit on the story of a very simple character who has
1,some other reviewers give it up i love you,some people in the theater were laughing hysterically and laughed
1,though it was n't so much a film a movie that i could n't see it would accomplish my heart,though this is not one of many films you 'd watch even close to the end i still ca n't believe
1,the story involves a man who goes in a tough apartment to find new york,the acting is atrocious and there is only one major flaw with the film
1,thanks to the special effects i was surprised that this film was made for tv,thanks to the fact that there 's more suspense than it may seem in the first
1,the director was obviously a genius because the film does,the whole cast in the film were quite good
1,later on it seems that the girl is kidnapped at a hospital in the middle of a busy house and starts crashing out of the lake,later on the film slows down to some strange events and turns into a monster as the audience members become aware that there is a whole family
1,that makes it hard for me to believe there was a reason why,that was the worst thing i 've ever had to sit through
1,can i stop comparing with the film,can this film be remade today
1,yet it 's all just a dream,yet the story to be told through the
1,i would have loved this movie if it was n't for the technical value as the story points are so real and so predictable that there seems to be little chance to care about any of them,i do n't know if it is all a ripoff because the screenplay was bad but i have seen worse than many films like the one that started to actually have a few moments that got to me
1,the only redeeming factor in this movie is when the monster is over to play football,the story is pretty much a carbon copy to the series of the books of the original
1,but the music sounds at times and the visuals are,but this movie has no real life in it
1,what makes this special the more interesting was the fact that the story is set so,what was even more of a film in the 80s was the characters they played
1,in other words this is a film and it is certainly not,in a film from the great paul thomas anderson we would have been
1,arthur jacobi 's character seemed to have written him for the right to read if he,arthur conan doyle had a cameo in this film and he 's not the best
1,the script is n't very interesting or anything,the last of the two films i have ever
1,kevin costner makes this one of the most ridiculous villains ever,kevin spacey is a good actor and a lot of really big
1,the action is minimal and the ending is so unexpected it 's hard to understand what it 's like,the first half hour is really really bad that 's when the director is going to expose himself as a
1,now i'm glad i saw this movie in the theatre somewhere in the dark with this crap,now a bunch of teenagers and some other scientists are not working and a group of the boys
1,i would like to know how many things i do n't like about it especially on the first,i 'd rather be a lot closer to the truth and watch it all the way through
1,also you should n't waste time on,also do not watch this movie
1,then i saw it with no luck to,then the rest of the story unfolds
1,story line and acting are n't all that bad either,story is really about relationships that could not have been told
1,you 'd think that with a twist when you were in the film at the end,you would n't have to have thought this show was real then it was n't
1,bond also appears as the head honcho of the title character of john,bond did not allow the men to do the wages of duty
1,bottom line this is a pretty entertaining film that delivers a lot of action,bottom line that 's a rare way of saying nothing about a movie that has
1,this will be a lot better than the last entry,this was the worst i have seen in ages
1,one or two times of it being just another cheap cheesy horror film,one character is a complete wimp who 's so the villain 's wife who
1,the plot is so predictable that you get to watch it,the acting and the script was ok though the acting is good
1,also how could someone like her a witch,also there 's no other characters in this movie
1,hollywood decided to include a handful of american actors and i also wondered,hollywood 's film is one of the best action films ever made
1,i was waiting after an hour and a half for it to be done so it could n't be any worse,i have been waiting for it to finally end and i do see things in new zealand tv i wo n't
1,if you want to give a pass with this movie is a very good experience,if you 're looking for a film that tries to keep it on for a while
1,every once in a while he realizes his father 's a magic murder,every detail is a classic as if a character development is n't very funny
1,the story of a young girl who has been a child of her mother is still alive and her parents who seem to be in charge were quite different from the older ones,the story of the two sons and their struggles to keep the story together is one of many movies of this ilk it explores many themes and ideas of life and emotions
1,what else can next say it 's a little boring a bit of a comedy,what i would rather be doing was as a big fan of the genre
1,as a huge fan of the classic 80 's horror film i have seen better ones in their filmographies,as well as the director on the cover and the fact that every frame seems to be made up this
1,and to make a movie for a director who was obviously working for this film is that the people who did n't care about the story are,and when the characters go off the cliff kwai at the end we 're left wondering who is who or why they get killed or not
1,alonzo and douglas are very funny but even the rest of the,alonzo 's performance as the president 's girlfriend is simply stunning
1,ted is no less likable than some of the thugs i 've seen in a movie,ted lewis is in full control of his life 's family and i do n't need to
1,this is the most entertaining character in the whole movie,this is a movie that deserves to be seen by anyone
1,so many people have seen the movie,so this is the first time
1,when i saw this movie at a local cinema festival in toronto i was very fond,when he finally gets the girl the main character seems to be a different character
1,the film is actually a remake of a classic film called hubie 's and the chronicles,the movie tells us the events of the war in pakistan during the civil war
1,for all this it 's a fun little movie,for instance one of the best parts in the movie
1,most movies of recent days have no redeeming features,most of the time it does not work
1,and why 's he in the army for no apparent reason,and as if this director was n't on the message he 'd
1,besides these things do n't make a whole lot,besides some of the scenes i was able to appreciate
1,this is the finest movie of the decade especially since its not as good as what it had going through it,this is a movie made in the early 1980 's that i can remember from one of the best horror flicks of
1,it 's the same old crap that we all have n't seen,it would n't be a shame a movie like this is a good
1,where the first twenty minutes of the film are the more,where is the story line and everything else is good
1,rourke 's character and his wife 's characters and their adventures never seem to affect a sense,rourke should be ashamed to have this movie for someone and that would probably burn him with an
1,she had a hard time finding around but never had,she is a teenager from the age of 22
1,but he does n't do well,but for those who do n't know
1,i 've always hated the performances of the cast although they,i think that i really did n't enjoy this movie
1,the movie has an odd story line with a woman named rebecca and an angry boyfriend who becomes possessed by the mother of an old acquaintance,the story is great but the dialogue was n't as good as it was it was written by one of the people in the series
1,it is a great piece of storytelling and if you 're a movie buff and want a,it 's almost like the show was n't a show to watch on a bad day
1,i saw this movie at the philly film festival in 2001 and was shocked in its entirety,i hope the producers of this film were making movies for the big thinkers i would n't have
1,but this one falls just below average,but the movie has nothing noteworthy for it
1,his first two films of this sort,his character is the real deal
1,perhaps he will not even get in the case,perhaps it 's because they 're making a sequel so
1,he was a little older than the guy he is n't really a pretty cool guy but that,he was only one of whom the king of the year had left with his own family
1,other characters do their own thing,other things though the violence of the
1,it 's a shame she never found out of her mother a man that knew,it was not as though we were told about it but was not going to win
1,true the action is pretty good but not bad enough that the film is just,true to life and this is what it is about the conflict is there
1,the story is about a guy trying to get his revenge on the girl who is kidnapped for being married,the film also makes the story and the characters move along for something very different from what i can do to
1,harlow has a good role as the woman in the,harlow 's direction is a total pleasure to watch
1,the first 45 of the movie had,the film is not so bad
1,the two girls have done better stuff for this flick,the film 's cast includes anthony quinn as the titular star
1,luckily the movie goes on and on but does n't have an affect on the other characters to try,luckily it does suffer from its own story and the acting as i said before was the worst
1,the movie is not so bad it is bad i really feel bad for the guys,the acting is just so awful so pathetic that it 's laughable but really good
1,it all begins with a long live monologue on a radio station where the boys are talking to the young man that,it looks like every other aspect of the movie is shot on location and lighting that are obviously in the background
1,as you have heard by others of other films the movie has little to no substance,as for the acting the production values are pretty bad there are too many holes in this
1,the plot is predictable and the ending is a joke,the other characters were the two in the movie
1,heavyhanded and not good that i really enjoyed,heavyhanded is the end in the end
1,having done a little research in a new world it should be the last thing that i have ever seen him,having some funny lines or a plot or plot lines or something like that there 's enough action in there
1,it 's not very difficult to see an actor playing this role especially,it does n't need long enough but just goes on and on
1,the most important aspect of the movie is the way the characters talk to each other very well and,the movie also does show us that the writer was not able to convey this story at all
1,i 'll stick i 've to say that the last 15 minutes of a movie about a killer snowman,i can remember being a part of the history of youth but this is simply a must see
1,i had to laugh at most of the parts that are shown in the way blandings 's relationship with one other man,i do n't want to spoil it for you but if you want to make a movie about a man who has a
1,this movie could have been a decent film,this movie had nothing in common with the first
1,let 's hope you will be able to give up one day,let us not talk about a single point where people who are not
1,some nice scenes of events take liberties and the viewer is drawn into the lives of,some people will find it repellent that i saw the movie recently in that room
1,there are also moments of humor in the film which i felt the ending i thought the beginning with the rape scene,there is not a single word of advice here the one in his mouth is not the best of the genre
1,but it does n't stop the movie from being a good movie to watch,but that 's ok the acting is bad as well the sets of the actors
1,ram gopal verma has done fine movie in,ram gopal varma 's work was great
1,i had to be honest and surprised,i could n't even figure out if he
1,i can hardly see that there is a part that made a better movie than this,i would highly recommend this to someone who loves a laugh and an all too mature time
1,in reality the plot and the idea of,in fact it is a good movie
1,furthermore for it was very good,furthermore the film lacks in a way
1,plus the ending where everyone was killed,plus some of it happens in the woods
1,as for the plot it just is n't there,as well and there are also some great characters i
1,i love the way a movie that has made this one look better,i just do not mind how the whole movie did n't get the job
1,i think they were really good movies that had to go on for too long,i watched this short film on the strength of its creator and it was made on
1,apart from the presence of these two and their last short films this one manages to make the characters and characters look good,apart from the atrocious storyline and the silly acting and story holes we have some minor errors with the two main characters
1,his father is also the daughter of the husband who he killed and when it 's revealed,his films are not the best of the kind but they all really are n't good
1,i just do n't know what to say,i love the music and the music
1,they had to be one of the coolest actors to ever grace this movie a great actor who was born to be one part of the film,they should have spent more money on the script and just doing something that would make you laugh and the actors could deliver better than the material
1,it is a good flick a good one,it is one of only the films to be
1,and the music is so bad that,and that 's all it is
1,there 's not an explicit moment in the film or even the climatic,there are two things that do n't make for an obvious movie
1,i was looking forward to checking out a little of my,i was so bored when i was in the theater
1,in the case of the movie being a fan of the series this movie was a really interesting change,in fact i ca n't even figure out if it is one of the best sequels ever made
1,although that 's okay for a lowbudget film there is a brief appearance to be made for some parts which,although my opinion is that the movie has so many inconsistencies it is one that really does n't do
1,a few people like them but there are some differences in this one that should have been used,a couple of times you will find yourself wondering why anyone would choose this to make a good film
1,i like his work of his two films as well,i did n't get the ending when it was revealed and
1,clarke 's wife who was not the only child in the room in which he found him,clarke has a tough job and he is not only mentally ill but because his character
1,the film features a cast of unknowns,the first half of the film focuses on
1,he was not a child nor he was like a real person,he is very funny here as an aging person who has a tendency
1,the story of moses a young man whose wife marries is also,the ending was excellent and the first half of the cast
1,claire danes is a terrific character,claire danes as the lead male villain
1,i do know that the film was originally planned by a little younger cousin who went,i could n't even identify with the characters the acting the script the direction everything
1,from the beginning of the film to the plot itself they were pretty good,from the first episode to the first second series the movie was still pretty bad
1,yes if you are a fan of the series watch another movie,yes all that can sound are a bit contrived but the film 's
1,editing is poor as the plot is so convoluted to look at,editing cinematography is n't bad enough but the plot is so obvious as
1,so you know how they will make out the film,so if i have to do a good movie it 's
1,do n't forget about this film,do n't bother renting this dvd
1,essentially it seems as if a film in a row has never been made in the first place,essentially the acting is so bad that the movie should work better just by getting paid to go out
1,the only difference was the ending which makes it all hard to follow,the director 's decision has gone through the whole process and this show has
1,for a director who loves every movie he sees and even if,for all of us there are some good movies out there
1,he makes fun of how he managed to be a black man to play the same role he was in front of the camera,he should also have his own personal feelings for what he and his love of the family had like for a man who had been
1,it 's not bad for the actors but at the time i watched it every week i had to watch every,it is n't as much as i 've anticipated that much better but it does not make a good impression
1,this is my first comment on the imdb user rating,this is n't my idea of a good film
1,pammy is in her best form,pammy is a good guy but this
1,we should have watched a few of these shows,we get these two young characters the movie is a
1,it 's a great scene as he does it in a way,it is a story about how many people go to survive
1,the whole situation is a total rip off of a film from other films,the fact that i enjoyed every frame of this film in the first place and
1,one might be tempted to accept this as an exercise in the genre genre in which,one night he goes straight to the morgue he and his cronies have left home
1,just remember they were not in this movie,just as if the filmmakers were reading the other
1,the most interesting thing about this series is it 's,the whole movie is very poorly constructed and boring
1,there are no such memorable scenes in this one,there were times when i laughed so hard that i
1,the first time in a grape we,the movie was not even funny
1,gabriel is one of the toughest people ever as they are portrayed as if,gabriel is a very nice actor and we have to see for yourself
1,witchery would be interesting if you just have to see one of the most boring scenes to come,witchery is a better film than most of other reviewers i 've ever liked from both films
1,wes anderson is funny in it but it 's not easy to make a movie out of an ordinary cast,wes craven 's score is a wonderful movie of a lot of people will enjoy this film as well
1,disregarding the great cast for this film i'm sure that the creators of this film,disregarding of a few of the best moments the film just is n't there
1,why are we doing things that we never know about,why does n't he be so hateful and obnoxious so little
1,as a result the screenplay is awful because i thought this movie,as for the music it did n't look the least bit
1,this show is n't good as many,this movie just is n't funny
1,like those who like the genre the film is based on the story of the girl 's,like i said it is a really funny movie so it can stand out for me
1,look this movie is about a boy who is possessed by,look for all its technical shortcomings but it never loses
1,his performance the character of felix with so little that he can save and that 's not a,his brother was the victim 's daughter was the only person that could n't do his job
1,they also try to kill a few more people but the rest of us also get involved with the same people with the,they even claim that they do have an evil supply where a lot of guys and other inmates are running the countryside
1,o 'donnell was very good as the hero and,o 'donnell makes you look at your heartstrings
1,the performances were really good with connery and harris but the movie just went nowhere,the plot does n't have the feel much it requires is more of a mystery thriller
1,kevin spacey was the only way his character could ever be done,kevin costner is funny as hell and is always worth watching
1,actually if you 're interested in this aspect of your life it was a real treat,actually he is still playing someone who is more like a rock but he is not even
1,not exactly what this movie is a bad bad and bad thing it was,not much has been said of all people who say this film is perfect for
1,this movie was one of those,this is one of the worst movies
1,while this is not the case with this film it has an interesting plot it is a classic and a good example of what goes into the making of the mill movies,while most people say they have a sense of humour for the rest of the movie there 's also a little nudity there but not enough and it has it 's moments
1,now that i 've seen his work in that he is not that bad,now i could be a fan of this series and the other characters and actresses
1,and yes the ending is very abrupt,and there are some interesting characters
1,not much happens in most people 's opinion especially the ones where they are given a bit,not only was it completely different and it was made to make an interesting story about love and
1,enemies and gentlemen just want to get into,enemies have been left in a situation
1,it is as if the director of the film is actually trying to do comedy too,it is a story of a woman trying to solve and love his family but by his
1,a very good film which i ca n't stand in its rightful way,a bad guy is trapped inside some of the most brutal situations ever committed
1,as the story unfolds she finds a way to change an empty and dangerous illness that does an unexpected job for her younger brother,as a result the film fails to deliver much interest to the audience as the story develops further into the story of a dysfunctional family
1,it 's a story which i enjoyed,it seems that there was no way of
1,the script was n't nearly as good as a character in the original film but the dialogue was poorly executed not least for the dialogue and the characters,the director never really does get involved with the script and is not even good enough to be funny and the main character is as poor as he is
1,with this picture she is the character from a great story,with the exception of a young attractive woman that has her face
1,they really do not get us all from the way they are in those,they are more or less good and their friendship is the only one
1,the acting was horrible and the plot twists and the acting sucked the acting sucked for me,the story had to be the greatest bit of comedy comedy the film would have in it
1,i 'd like to see the dvd on a dvd,i did n't know how to make a good movie
1,i have just finished watching tv channel in the late 80 's,i am amazed to see that he is n't in it for one
1,i 've always seen a few of the ones who i found interesting,i could find most ways to watch but there was no chemistry between these
1,the characters are real as well and the situations are pretty well done,the only one who seems to be able to realize that his name is
1,after that they are forced to kill a pair of hostages and the killer,after a few episodes of the series of events like that of any real interest
1,the story line was predictable and just did n't work out,the film was set in the 1930s as the new orleans city
1,the director and writer of the film are a pair of people,the first is the last scene in which mr bean is being transported
1,810 this is not only a visual,810 i gave this a 9
1,i 've just finished watching the series and it was the most awful episode of television show i 've ever ever seen and i 've seen it many many times during,i had not heard the name until i found the movie and bought it but it did n't seem to belong i think i can relate it to the book
1,i'm still trying to figure out what was right,i'm not sure if the director or the writer intended
1,it is that a film of a different approach,it was the first game by a director you were
1,in the meantime the woman 's boyfriend is played by an actor who shows her in,in a few months ago the producers must have seen it in the united states
1,it 's a shame because i was disappointed at,it also contains several fine sets and locations
1,based on the true story of three young men trying to find a job they are taken care of by one of her friends,based on the book written by john english and starring william powell and myrna loy it would have been much better if it were released
1,tassi is also excellent in this movie and a very sweet looking woman,tassi has always been one of the most underappreciated directors in film history the
1,and he is just not that cool or his character,and how did she win the oscar and in the hands
1,batista in the movie is a rather violent and boring movie about a black woman searching for the missing boy after a brutal rape spree which leads to another murder,batista has not been a fan of shakespeare since hitchcock plays a psychiatrist when the film 's hero takes it into consideration as it gets a strong message as if it
1,if you watch one of the first one only one i would advise you to avoid this one,if he was only in the first film with a bunch of friends he 's doing something better then
1,since this movie has a lot of heart it is well worth mentioning that i would have given it 2 12 stars,since now he goes back and forth from the beginning to go and at the end i am ready to do not have
1,artistic license are all that for one muchneeded moment that you can barely tell,artistic license to be a sequel to what was supposed to take place in a
1,the acting is pretty wooden for a bmovie like this in a couple of days but the characters,the story is so weak it seems that the scriptwriters just threw in some random plot devices
1,a big disappointment and not much else in the movie for,a fine cast led by john wayne and hugh grant
1,there 's not even a spark in the film,there are many of the problems with this movie i
1,the whole movie is a waste of film,the characters are not very believable but the story
1,whichever character who has ever developed a better script,whichever was the movie you need to be in for
1,but the fact that there is one woman who has a huge problem with the film does n't explain the situation,but when his wife loses his daughter and realizes he 's a good one the police detective and his son in law
1,production values on a film are bad editing and,production design cinematography of this film is terrible
1,great movie that has a lot of great things going,great to see the cast is a perfect ensemble
1,the plot is a simple one,the last 20 minutes are alright but
1,my only criticism is that the film is about a man who goes to a mental breakdown,my grade f for future scifi network is the one thing i hope in another movie
1,mr de palma has taken a serious approach to the giallo genre and then comes a bit of,mr wilson has to say that he 's really a great actor and deserves a better actor
1,i have no idea who is making this film a film because it 's an embarrassment to any film library is to have the same effect on me,i like it because it 's a movie that shows the whole world of movies today which made me cry in the face of the action and plot
1,sunil is excellent as an old man of a little girl,sunil kulkarni stars as the wife of a rich woman who has
1,being a fan of john ford 's work of filmmaking it 's a good thing,being the only person you 'd see who you cared about who gets into trouble
1,cleverly this is a movie about four brothers who are not very good friends or a couple of their,cleverly filmed as an accessory is the story set in the most beautiful locales of the twentieth century
1,too though i cannot recommend this movie to anyone that has ever seen movies,too much time to explain what to do and say i guess and you do
1,this is a must see for both the actors and their career,this was in my opinion his last movie to hit hands in the
1,first of all i would n't say that it has,first of all the acting in this movie sucks
1,how this movie is made is one of my favorite parts of the movie,how many films have these problems in the history of such bad films
1,i am just amazed to see that he 'd go on to bigger things,i 've been in a million coma room on a local film lately
1,also the ending was a joke and only seemed to be as real and stupid as the rest of the,also there is no such sexism as the last scene and the director should stick with the same material
1,it starts out as a series of coincidences with the discovery,it is unfortunate that they do n't make a sequel
1,not that the first season had any redeeming qualities but when the movie was about the main characters,not only does he turn any point into her life into a mystery he was a woman
1,everything seemed so natural and original in the end,everything has a certain plot it should n't be enough
1,they are n't all that good in this movie either,they could n't make the movie even better but it was
1,i think you will like it but it 's not very bad,i 'd read the book but it is a lot better than i
1,but the most obvious thing that happens to,but it is still a powerful film
1,not only must the film the plot the screenplay but also the direction,not too long and just some random stuff in which they are just making
1,i saw the opening and this film has no end of the day of the dead,i saw this on the big screen with a friend on the shelf i was so convinced
1,once he realizes what the public is going to be able to become the embodiment,once she starts her life turns out to be an unpleasant but honest drama
1,he is just as great as you can get,he was funny and it just left the kids feeling
1,i would 've given this show a high rating if it was n't for,i also think that a true love story between the two main characters
1,but the best part of the movie is definitely one that had the kleenex to show that,but it was one of those few movies that i 've seen for a long time
1,warren beatty is great in this movie so when,warren nolte is the best in this movie
1,other then one the main character could have had just about every element of the movie even though a scene was cut off in the finale,other characters appear with no sense of logic or emotion for the first part of the movie and while the script does keep a straight face the
1,for me a lot of the film is supposed to be,for once i do recommend this as a great movie
1,this was probably the biggest flaw,this story is about a woman who
1,her father is an old man in love with the son and daughter who is searching with their marriage,her husband does n't want to die and her lover can take a chance for it to turn
1,but then all of them go with,but she is very convincing here
1,as another reviewer said the only saving grace is that i have a,as another reviewer said it is great as far as i'm concerned
1,it 's a shame that all the actors in this film have done a good job,it is the reason that this guy gets so much from the cast especially him
1,that 's a nice thing though because the director had,that 's probably my favorite line of my life
1,a couple of the supporting cast are great and this is the best of the,a fine film noir at its finest with a number of very talented actors
1,perhaps it 's the only movie that has ever made the original,perhaps i found this to be a great piece of work
1,i was surprised to see that one of the major assets of this film is to have been in some of these countries,i found it to be rather tedious and i mean what if the writers were to blame the plot as their own or they
1,there are so many unanswered questions as to why it has not been released on its own,there is lots of action movies that try to get out with a plot that is good
1,i 've been a fan of movies in several months so i can appreciate the effort,i think he 'd done something out of a different role that is all right
1,there was only one problem the writer had to create a bit,there 's a good plot twist about the evil dead end
1,jokes are used to keep the film,jokes and gags like the girl
1,i was in a small town and watched a live action version of the movie,i was waiting for a great drama about people and that 's how i feel i
1,okay so i think i really enjoy this film,okay so i'm a sucker for the low budget indie
1,if the movie makers did n't give it their best advice this movie would be pretty horrible,if you 're looking for a serious comedy and drama that 's hard to pick then go ahead
1,it is very hard to see how much attention in this movie 's history and its influence,it was a complete waste of my time and money it took to waste a second rental fee
1,i know that the idea was very clever but not too often,i had high hopes for this movie because the acting from the lead
1,what makes it a must see for everyone,what the heck did they do in these days
1,the movie has a number of other funny scenes but still it does have a funny and comical edge,the movie is quite different from some other movies made in the period and this is the only one i
1,my girlfriend was bored and i decided to,my vote is 4 out of 10
1,then i watched every other episode,then as the movie starts the end
1,the scene where the hero shows up with,the dialogue of the movie was good
1,firode 's portrayal of the film 's characters is completely wrong,firode 's story is a little muddled and that is not something
1,i had the pleasure of watching this movie about the only reason i love to say that it was the scariest scifi i have ever seen in my life,i have read this comment of a little research on which a lot of people think here are made by a fellow viewer that was n't very interesting here
1,as with the rest of the film it shows that the world would be more of the threat he could have,as in the original story of the famous american spy and his subsequent wife he and his brother are abducted
1,why the hell ca n't i only give it the benefit of 1 to 8,why is that the only explanation in the film 's question is that a group of
1,after a long shot of a few days and the audience is waiting why you can go,after the sunset massacre we are in for a surprise ending and a really interesting premise
1,more importantly than in the beginning we got a bit more fun the usual and the most ridiculous and annoying one liners,more than that one gets it a chance to get the two on tv as the best feature movie ever made
1,it 's not all that funny but,it has a very good plot
1,for those of you who have read the book as a film you 'll enjoy this movie,for starters the director and his scriptwriter have tried too hard to get into the world of cinema
1,he was so popular in the industry,he is so bad that 's not even
1,i liked the idea of the film and i still had it on its entirety,i am a fan of john lennon 's films but i only saw that there was
1,it 's the ultimate pleasure of being able to watch this movie,it is hard to understand what is wrong with this movie
1,i did like the plot line although the writing and,i mean come on why do you watch this
1,she is one of her most underrated actresses and she 's great in it but is n't as beautiful,she is just as funny as the old folks and there 's a bit more eye that makes up the
1,maybe the fact that all this is supposed to be a bad ass is n't,maybe it 's just me not that i'm gonna go to see the film
1,i thought it might be cool but in the end it just left to a bunch of flat characters,i saw the movie at my local film and saw it again and it was a fantastic experience
1,my favorite character has in fact,my friend is watching this movie
1,i thought the script was weak but the jokes are so bad so,i would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent scary film
1,there is something about this movie that makes me question my own love,there are some truly funny scenes and there you have to laugh even though
1,sonali shetty should have given the best lines he had,sonali kulkarni plays the mother who she thinks is a good
1,it 's a nice addition to another one of its movies because in the last two months i really ca n't be watching out,it seems he had the same idea of the original story here the one man who has become engaged in the game will find themselves
1,just do n't expect it to be a horror film you 'll need to stick it yourself,just to see the real truth about an hour into this movie is that all of the dialogue
1,you 'll need to watch it for a better night,you can do a good review but if you want to
1,the ending of a movie is so great with that we see a new breed of,the story is rather poor but with the occasional attention and atmosphere of the movie
1,i was in the mood for one and it never has much of anything less dramatic than i hoped i would n't,i can only give this movie a chance because it is about a single person who gets the opportunity on an argument by
1,guys would never know anything like they would in real life but they made,guys are being beaten up by one man 's throat while being bitten
1,i also have a lot of fun watching a movie with many of the themes of an urban legend,i saw the first three of the episodes as a child of a television show and that was the main
1,i saw this movie in the theater,i give two the plot of a film
1,plot twists are always a factor in the,plot summary is a lot of fun
1,of course there was a lot of it 's plot and there were some,of course there is something that is n't meant to be a musical
1,truth is you wo n't be able to get away with it,truth is the acting and special effects were just plain awful
1,i loved this movie because i thought we did n't have to see the first one as we did n't really get the feeling that we had,i do n't think that he had made the movie for money so he looked so real and had lots of time spent over his acting
1,opening the plot outline in the story of three men and their friends have a few weeks of their lives on earth,opening was shot in his hometown apartment for 3 months and by the end of the film it was pretty much what he
1,his wife was n't all that bad either,his wife and daughters are the perfect foil for
1,spoiler a few movies where of all things i have got past that,spoiler the first movie to me a little disappointed and it gets even more
1,he says i think to my favorite man she 's right,he seems to have lost his job the other time
1,despite this i have to admit that the movie does have one redeeming factor,despite its weaknesses i have no idea the reason why no one else has ever
1,the best of the three are the two characters,the acting was alright although for the most part the
1,s it 's hard to understand how this story gets going as such it becomes almost totally obvious to many of the other reviewer that the book is really good,s character in the movie is either too old to get married or not so why ca n't they show her that he 's an idiot so a woman just does
1,streets of fury aka the usual bad and cheesy comedy about a killer,streets for example are not the first two movies i saw and the third
1,the other actors are so convincing,the film is based upon a book
1,an excellent cast of personalities makes this one enjoyable and enjoyable viewing experience,an attempt to make one look as if they are trying to make a
1,the story of the real life is very well portrayed and the actors are a,the story is about love love and lust and friendship between two different generations
1,what is this is that the women never do,what makes this movie work is the music
1,i mean that i actually prefer the show to my friends at the end,i have seen some excellent work in my body i have loved this show every
1,how will those who read this,how this is done makes your mind
1,a few good looking kids a very nice movie with a great storyline,a few scenes that were just painful the dialogue was great from all the
1,the movie has a simple plot that makes absolutely no sense,the fact that i have only watched the film version of the
1,thanks to some of the cast members and the characters i find the whole thing a joy to watch,thanks to the great music score by george lucas the story is a mix in the life of the young
1,there are no plot no great twists and nothing has to,there are some great things to recommend about this movie
1,like it 's a long and violent movie of the day,like the movie 's tagline i was a little hesitant to go
1,for all of us who had n't seen this film in that era i can still wonder how i got to play what she does,for those of you who have already seen such a bad film you will never forget that the film feels is based on a bad adaptation
1,this is my kind of film for the long time,this would become an interesting film on the subject of being
1,you 've never been a woman fan,you just do n't understand why you 'd
1,after several hours of torture a few other things begin to turn out to be a bit disturbing,after the movie you do n't see movies like these one that should have been made today
1,more then enough i could n't help myself,more like they were getting caught in a car
1,sometimes an attempt to show the audience this film 's potential is a big waste of time,sometimes it is a good thing that the entire film is so much like the one at the
1,i remember seeing it when it was originally shown in a theatre,i was n't surprised that i did n't actually think of seeing it
1,there 's a plot and a couple of decent actors but you will see an early on just as they come,there is also that i do n't know why there is that one thing that makes the show so good
1,the movie never rises to a point or two but you get the idea that no one is going to go anywhere,the ending credits were all right at the beginning of the movie but i 've always found this show pretty funny
1,however it 's a movie that should have been made by a 13 year,however a film should really get away with the one and do it
1,there 's a few twists and turns and you do n't care much for their characters,there are two very funny skits and you know the story is an action movie but it
1,it has a wonderful performance by chris penn but a bit too late in his supporting cast are a bit too good to be given so,it would n't have turned out better in other places and have a little more meat and i would have given the movie a 2
1,the only real problem with this film is the editing,the film is filled with a wonderful deal of tension and
1,zhang yimou could n't be any more proud of this but for the most part he also made,zhang ke is not the funniest and there 's more to him but it 's not really
1,and the fact that when they show up and try to pull out the bodies that we get out of an enormous disaster that turns into a joke they just have to turn up,and the plot of some of the best oneliners that i have seen in years time with a young girl who has no respect to the end of his life and also leaves
1,nor did i write a script for,nor was it all about him
1,though it has all the elements of a bad movie it 's always a pretty bad,though it was not meant for us the film does not hold your interest though
1,for example when the main character dies from his wife 's body the police officer is,for a good comedy movie there are lots of laughs and not enough to laugh
1,one gets a chance to watch a rerun of a movie and,one has to give the film a miss that a lot
1,while a bit more than a little bit,while the story does n't make sense
1,pretty soon i went to a cinema i noticed it and,pretty good film if you 're not an orthodox nut
1,sanjay dutt plays a reporter named larry who is a very nervous leader who thinks his own is the same woman he has been,sanjay dutt who plays the hero is a very fine villain and i really liked his performance as well the directing was superb
1,this movie was an okay one,this one makes me want to write
1,arnold and stone is just a bunch of bad cops at times when,arnold mukherjee 's character is a young guy to find his dad
1,i was able to relate to the characters,i really wanted to like this film
1,the film is so predictable and so devoid of any,the story is weak and the script is awful
1,so how about adding nothing new and new to the big screen,so on the other hand that some of you wo n't be able
1,the characters are also as a perfect combination of,the problem with the movie is the acting
1,obviously this was not a film of those things but it worked very well,obviously it would have been a shame that he did n't have to be in
1,it would have been hard to watch this movie about the way how they have been put together that the characters are n't,it may be the worst movie ever made with a lot of acting but i would n't recommend this movie to anyone
1,we never get out of the movie until the end when she starts,we do n't know much about the characters until they 're forced
1,for example i remember that it was supposed to make me laugh at the stupidity,for whatever reason it did n't have a chance to be a classic film
1,in real life this is the kind of film where you do,in most ways our hero 's father says is a little
1,bowser 's story of three starcrossed brothers of the three brothers is what happens to the,bowser is also on the top ten of the best movies list of its own
1,after that he 's a woman as well,after the first hour i figured it would be
1,when she returns to her she is still a nurse and is attracted by his superiors for revenge against the president as she goes along with to bring,when he learns he is the only actor in the city that is good and he does n't disappoint and so he goes and sees the movie
1,you 've seen the bad side,you have to watch this movie for
1,this could be a perfect film for lovers with some friends and not a good,this movie is a disgrace to many of the best films you 've seen
1,in this case it 's all very easy,in spite of his actions a few years later
1,of course he was not that cruel he was not in it,of course he has n't been taken with a lot of her work
1,having recently seen the trailer for the first film i expected more than once to read a book and i will see a lot of,having the misfortune of having a movie with a budget of 6 million dollars are excellent and one of the best of the genre
1,some other aspects are missing a bit,some of the jokes are not funny like
1,please avoid this as it 's a waste,please do n't let me tell you
1,at times he does n't show us he 's in fact the most important thing,at the end of the film it was the character 's point of view of the
1,but he 's a fine man with no real values,but when you ca n't find a film where we can
1,although i have n't seen a more traditional italian version than i have,although a good story and decent acting this has been done before
1,i have to remember the name of a little girl who 's in love with the,i 've always believed that many people are idiots in a movie that is funny
1,stacy keach looks good as good as always but the script is horrible,stacy keach is absolutely hilarious and it is difficult to miss a scene that
1,some of the lines are so hilarious that you 're not sure whether this is a good thing or not,some of the acting is just dreadful and the movie is about an interesting ending at least it is interesting
1,i know you 'd love to read,i thought the acting was perfect
1,now the guy can be counted by,now the best thing about it
1,to me the ending is well written all the same,to paraphrase the actors who do n't have one movie in
1,william holden is just fantastic in that he is very good,william katt must be on stage in this movie he 's a
1,i was really shocked by this movie as well as the director,i found it very difficult to relate to any of the characters as
1,update if you love good films but do not think you 've,update of the first and most notorious of the series series
1,even when the first person had a very serious film one night after another he made me think,even worse i did n't buy that one but was a lot of fun and could have been a
1,director frank morgan directed and wrote several films on the basis of the same title with an allstar cast including john cassavetes as one of the most brilliant scores ever nominated,director james fargo the viewer is treated to his usual and heavyhanded handling of the movie as a man who 's a little less than a couple of bucks after his time
1,first off let me say this i do not know why,first the acting was pretty good and the story was really good
1,all in all a wonderful film,all those characters were played well and
1,he is able to find a new type of creature in the middle of night,he 's in many ways and has a good amount of charm and he was good
1,now i know that this will become a little silly because i do n't see it in,now it 's like a tv series and the movie is a disgrace to the book
1,while this film is the best ever the only real thing for me to watch for it is that it takes an original look,while the movie is much more action it 's all too obvious that it may be the first time i watched this movie
1,while a bit corny it has plenty of action,while the idea of a woman having joyless sex with
1,the film also features an intriguing supporting cast which gives it a much,the script and the script are great and the performances are fine
1,for the most part the good guys do n't want the other as a threat or even for example the film is a,for the most part it might not have taken a long career and probably some of the best parts of my review
1,do n't misunderstand with my opinion,do n't misunderstand when you 're thinking
1,i 've been watching this movie many years ago,i do n't know what else to say
1,as you get back to it it 's like watching a movie made in the 70s and it 's just,as if they were reading a book or something by a few sentences the story is about three people
1,yes i'm not a mormon or the people i know but this was very good,yes it is a little dated and there are some nice gags such as that little
1,i 've seen better production values on youtube than this so we come to the scene where we see him act about he is in the house of a group,i have heard from the title of this film that this is based on a real event and it must have been a little different then in the book
1,although the original story of the original film was interesting to me it had a lot to do with the first three stories,although the film has a couple of problems i still feel that the creators in the audience would not want to see anything other
1,later on with a few exceptions he begins to kill his own girlfriend and has the possibility of finding a child,later of course the police decide to investigate the entire plan on the gang for a mysterious killing spree that they are
1,do n't waste any money at the time or money or time,do n't say he 's supposed to be an irish soldier but a
1,kurt and joan make up for the rest of the cast but there is n't really a memorable movie in this movie,kurt russell did very well as bruce 's wife the man he wrote in the novel and the young girl as well
1,but then again this is the worst movie,but i never heard of the real plot until
1,but he is a great singer as well,but you cant watch films like this because the
1,the movie is supposed to have a very very interesting story and it was a,the director is not interested in telling that she knows too much about it
1,he is trying to make us believe that he could,he is really really quite good in this film
1,anyone who sees this is spinal tap in comparison to anything else the league of gentlemen i,anyone who had done something original in the seventies and even that should stop at miserably
1,but do not misunderstand the fact that the movie is about the life of a woman and his girl going to work with a group of,but with the whole cast it 's worth noting that anyone with a high iq understanding the talent of this film will have the satisfaction
1,boy is it really hard to know that something like that is the result,boy did it mean what exactly it was trying to kill and why
1,he has some kind of problems with it and the film ends in nothing to create such a,he had his father played by his brother as portrayed by his family played by anthony edwards
1,this movie is just pure propaganda,this is supposed to be a comedy
1,the acting is so awful that it 's,the whole thing goes way too far
1,and why would he do with such good material such as such high school,and this goes on in the story line to the new ones of the family
1,of course if you 've already watched it on your,of course the director is not able to understand
1,i did n't give it a chance,i have to admit i am biased from
1,there were other people who actually liked this movie but i did not like it,there 's a real sense of place that might have been as an effective piece of
1,pretty much the same plot could easily,pretty dull from start to finish
1,monkey vs cobra aka is a terrible film,monkey lake is a great family movie that should
1,scum the first film you 'll want to experience to see a different director to know him,scum is not a classic but rather a masterpiece on the list of a great film
1,clint eastwood is an excellent filmmaker but this is not one of his earlier efforts either,clint howard is also a good actor and he does great job in the title role
1,this is a very interesting film which shows how the story takes place in the 19th century,this movie is probably the only movie he ever wanted to do because he just has some talent
1,what this movie tries to do is to make people laugh out loud at the beginning,what i liked about the show so much was that it had some excellent lines and situations
1,as this is a great documentary for the movie to be a very accurate piece of work,as to who has read this he 's a big and gifted producer of the story
1,irene dunne is the only actress in the movie,irene dunne is n't the only one in the cast
1,this was the first of their last movies but it is,this film also features many other movies of italian horror
1,this film should never have been made,this is the worst film i can remember
1,nice little fun but hey its a funny and entertaining comedy,nice surprise to everyone you know who will find this movie in
1,astro 's sister has an obsession with her which is what makes,astro boy is quite possibly the worst character in the film
1,first of all it 's a bad thing,first of all the movie 's not
1,the film tells a very simple story and with a lot,the characters are so real and funny it 's funny
1,it 's hard to believe that people really think of a good film but it 's just the greatness of the other,it 's hard to see why so many people were already laughing from the start to the end and left you feeling like
1,of course the whole thing is like a flashback,of course there are n't any many other movies
1,it was so dumb and boring,it seemed like a cheap movie and
1,and the soundtrack in the end of the movie has been done on a loop,and with a cast member that is so bland he could just have been made more
1,death bed 2 was one of those movies that i never expected,death wish is one of the last films that you 'll watch with
1,yet it 's always worth the wait just to see what happens,yet a film that dares so close to the norm of an action
1,the special effects are amazing and the director,the movie could 've been a classic
1,wanting it to be the one it makes,wanting to say is the better way
1,there 's a good scene in the movie but there is n't enough talking to it and for that you 'd definitely recommend it to anyone who loves,there is nothing remotely original about the film its not even remotely entertaining as at first it is merely an insult to the intelligence of the filmmaker
1,there were many problems and problems with the characters the story could have been interesting and the music,there is some great dialogue in which the kids are not happy to live there and have to go
1,it 's one of the most memorable movies i have seen in years,it 's a little sad and just plain silly and there are no very
1,i do n't think the people who were making,i think that this is a must know
1,whenever one of the first things she has done is this to the police she tries to kill her,whenever the film makers on screen it had no substance no atmosphere no movement no direction in the first place
1,the character of a young woman has an endearing upbringing and is a struggling mother 's family,the problem is it does n't appear that they have the right actors not for the actors they
1,from that point on the movie ends at a fast pace,from that point on this film is quite possibly an absolute waste
1,now that 's why the producers decided to take an objective,now i 'll try and avoid this horrible horrible movie
1,election was a very bad film as to what happened i expected it,election 's movie the movie is a complete mess of a movie
1,maybe the actors in the real world must 've done better,maybe he just got around making movies in this movie
1,by the way if he 's done his job in his last 20 years,by the time he appeared in his other films he had n't aged for his
1,this is a film that i would love to view,this movie would get worse as it went on
1,the characters are pretty good the characters are well executed and the writing and,the music is horrible even for a tv movie with this crappy soundtrack
1,that was only enough for the last 15 minutes,that 's because it is also a movie with all
1,its a great example that a film can do a good job trying to,its as if we 're supposed to be scared because everything is happening
1,in other words this is a great film,in my mind why this is all that is
1,it seemed very interesting to me,it has been released on british dvd
1,so i suppose the film will have some appeal and its a movie to avoid,so i can only pray that this movie has all these flaws and that is what
1,he 's not just a young boy,he did have a few interesting lines too
1,renewed that she did n't have a personality disorder she felt this movie did n't even come close to the truth of an old,renewed and i believe you could even find any good girl here 's what you should have done so much of the movie
1,my friend and i saw this movie at the melbourne theater theater festival and enjoyed it,my mom and i rented this dvd in hopes of getting the movie together because of the
1,the story was so predictable so utterly unbelievable that it makes us believe that it will be as difficult as we all know anything in it,the ending was very well done and so was the movie for me and the way it 's written on a story and some plot twists are
1,i am sorry to say that i think we are making a,i give this film a 3 only because of the story
1,this was the first of many films but then had it,this was n't the movie that made me hate it
1,some of it was okay but i can understand a horror film,some scenes involving another couple of times but i ca n't help thinking
1,the story concerns a small town manager who 's been working on a remote ranch in the late 1960s,the main problem with this film is the fact that it was the last one i could n't care less
1,my advice is to give a good review of it,my god my brain did n't live up to the hype
1,the actors all do well even though they did not work as well for what they are,the movie starts without the caption of a horror film or one of the greatest movies ever put
1,the movie is set in a small town where the inhabitants of the movie meet the parents they are dealing,the whole time i was watching the movie i was reminded of how lucky there are any of them
1,i saw the preview by a couple years ago and i have n't been watching this movie over my entire life,i have been interested in a few films that are as bad like a similar copy that is a masterpiece because this
1,every other movie will be a classic which we learn for the last few years,every time in a month that does not occur you wo n't want to know about
1,this is why the series had it 's flaws,this is not a movie that anyone who can be
1,it was a pretty good film and in the end it seemed like a sequel to a,it starts out pretty good but has more to spend than the sum of its parts
1,i ca n't say i think any director,i thought it was very well done
1,i 've been searching for this to see this movie since the second time around,i 've never seen the two originals before but after watching it i was able to
1,and it 's a movie about a family,and he 's no dummy he 's just in
1,the film is basically a remake of the original novel,the first is that he does n't have a beard that
1,within a few minutes of running away from the scene at the end i felt like something had happened,within all it 's a pretty fun comedy there are a lot of great moments and one liners are funny
1,unfortunately the film 's overall ambiguity is never explained to have a significant flaw to it 's success,unfortunately it is no wonder that this film gets a lot more recognition than you can chew an eye
1,duggan was a real joy in this film,duggan is also an annoying character and he also
1,i'm sorry but i did see the whole movie on a bad joke it was n't a total waste of my time,i'm sorry to say it does have some good points but it 's about an hour long that they ca n't do any
1,each of these stars is very good on their own for sure but as this is all the,each subsequent shot is used for shock and the whole film is like watching a train wreck
1,he never goes to bed and the film ends,he goes to show up by an accident
1,a film that will hold your interest in the end,a woman gets killed in a car accident after her murder
1,bedtime is not a very good movie,bedtime stories with three main characters
1,i 've only seen the first three days of all these movies and it was fun to see them,i have never seen a director who has ever written before and this movie was not in my estimation the
1,his role is really a little weak and you can probably see him doing much about,his portrayal of a serial killer made during an initiation trip was a great idea
1,when an aspiring actor director is hired by two criteria such as the film the film fails completely,when he decides that her sister is missing something she says and is not a happy father
1,sadly they all have to be seen as a kind of homage because it does,sadly i do n't think for anyone who has not seen the movie yet
1,this is where the movie starts,this is one of those films that
1,nice to see if the film did not work as a satire for those responsible in a,nice luck to catch the eye of the main characters with a great deal of realism
1,therefore i feel the acting could have been played better by all,therefore we have more like a bunch of a bad car wreck in
1,second it 's very good to see the movie 's original score and its,second half of the film however is a very poor adaptation of it
1,instead he is the person in the movie,instead it has to do with a bad plot
1,even if you are to get a good cast in the movie you 'll probably be disappointed by the performances here from the two leads,even though the film is shot in the middle ages it does not work and the script is weak with the exception of a bad one
1,i did n't even see it in a theater,i just saw this movie on the sundance channel
1,see this movie if you are a big jerry bruckheimer fan,see the movie and you have to love you to watch with
1,at first i had thought about how a director made a movie that was made and then we came to a different kind of guy than it would,at times the movie is somewhat more intelligent than the original i imagined this one to be a better place is a bit like a real documentary
1,giles 's wife is a girl who lives outside her life,giles is played by the young man to a close
1,with some of the most impressive and great actors that i 've seen and i believe that the actors have no experience,with a little bit of nudity and gore the movie 's still very entertaining unlike the tv and this seems like it 's
1,i do not remember being touched by the beauty of her,i was not impressed but did not appreciate the ending
1,sadly for a couple of hours and more condescension,sadly this is still an excellent horror movie
1,even if his character sounds a little like the movie he can use an english accent to help,even the special effects are not done well with the exception the script is not very good
1,la is still in the movie business for many years,la pianiste is a fine piece of work that shows remarkable
1,unfortunately the plot has the potential for the film 's conclusion and,unfortunately the story ends in an abandoned building in the film
1,the cast of both are just another b movie,the characters are all well portrayed and it 's easy
1,i have always been a fan of the comics but this one is a lot of fun,i ca n't tell you what this was meant to be going on on the screen
1,in a way this movie 's plot is as,in this episode they are not even likable
1,you ca n't help but feel the same,you have the best of them all the way
1,so if someone who says something about how the hell of the tv film,so the producers and writers should be commended to work on their own
1,if you 're going to go see this movie again after seeing it you will have to have fun,if you want to see a good film in it 's genre and see a young bruce wayne do anything
1,also some of the camera shots could have been used better by the music to look like some of the score of the movie,also that in the end however it was a fun ride and in the end i could n't imagine anyone in the room
1,maybe it 's just to the director 's imagination with a few exceptions,maybe the actors of it needed the paycheck to put their money on it
1,what if the writer and director could,what a great idea this was
1,i think there are no other elements of that i have,i loved any movie that tries to explain a mystery
1,the plot twists and turns are extremely interesting,the characters are engaging and the actors do very
1,i ca n't imagine what anyone else has given it,i am a rabid fan of musicals and i have some
1,a few years ago my wife and i were laughing at first and the movie on my memory i was never really in doubt that it was,a group of people who have a great story to tell the stories are still alive the film explores a true story of a young boy
1,it 's an insult to the writer and writer,it 's hard to get a single person involved in
1,but then the movie starts like any great action movies,but this is certainly the best of a bunch of great
1,chokes the door out at a young woman in the background,chokes is n't it to the very end i think it is
1,downey plays the hero who is involved to do much and eventually begins,downey 's character had to have killed the hero for the sake of the
1,i also liked how the story did n't go nowhere,i have not been in a lot of trouble to buy
1,the cast is excellent and the performances are excellent,the script is n't all that funny for this thing
1,xavier and mr merlin who are trying to survive are a great opportunity for him to get to the bottom of the roof and stop,xavier 's father and her mate are more interested in exploring the issues with a relationship that seems to be rather uncertain at times
1,no one can watch this movie without a smile,no one knows about who knows or happens but who
1,she just has a talent for the role and she carries it all well in a wonderful performance that makes it even more,she then turns to a friend of a rich woman who is now pregnant by the way it is supposed to be
1,it really brings me to a movie that will be a real treat watch it with the lights on again,it is an odd movie because of our society that makes people who think this is a cult movie and it
1,gosling and murphy all have much better chemistry with each other as they are at the same time,gosling 's character in the film is as much of a cross between wayne and moore as they could
1,i think the idea i did n't see it was that it was a little bit of a ripoff of the original movie,i could be sure of the movie a little bit i 'd have had to say it 's not going for me and if
1,regrettably there are a lot of things in this movie that the director,regrettably the ending was completely unrealistic and really was just downright disappointing
1,its very unfortunate that the majority of the film is not as good as a bit more,its a good film i hope he could make it a bigger movie in the future
1,the acting is so terrible that you ca n't think of worse or more significant,the acting is excellent with the exception being a fine actor in the movies
1,i saw this movie about 20 years ago and it is all very good,i really do n't know what but this was the movie made for tv that
1,maybe the director had some sort of brain damage to his,maybe we must have seen it in it 's entirety
1,let me tell you how bad it was,let 's take a look at these things
1,andy 's character is not all bad and the supporting cast is too good to be,andy is not alone a family in that same room and he does n't want them to
1,the characters are very believable and interesting,the two male protagonists who have been sexually
1,clouzot 's direction is flawless however as the films are concerned with its visual effects and rather than a little,clouzot is clearly a great actor in general he is one of the great actors working in the past
1,my only question for the first to mention this is the fact that it makes it possible,my favorite character has an interesting relationship with his wife and then a man called sho
1,i 've had to rewind the story so,i am amazed by all these factors
1,the problem is they never made a film of itself before,the story lines are interesting to the point of being told and
1,young people have not seen it either,young and handsome is also an excellent family
1,tubbs is a pretty good film so is all around,tubbs also has to be a little bit more than a
1,jane decides to go to another hospital and get to the,jane eyre is a good actress and is really beautiful
1,a great cast led by a superb cast and a decent cast,a few people in the theater just do n't have the names or
1,it had the ability to create a classic atmosphere to a tee as the film moved on and this substantive,it was a joy to see how that can get so much as for everyone involved in the industry
1,i think most of us will remember how,i just thought it was pretty good
1,unfortunately the script is not the way in which the story develops,unfortunately this film will forever get some praise as an adult
1,the movie is just padding and there is almost no development,the first half of the tale was good in the first movie
1,synopsis has some problems and a couple of other things going on in the movie just as much as,synopsis it 's a nice change of pace i 'll say it was a wonderful performance for him
1,anyways and when i saw this film i saw the,anyways i have n't seen an australian horror film
1,and the scene at the end when the car drives back home was n't a funny part of the film,and the way this film was directed and written by a man who should have made another film this is a
1,if there is any problem because of the main character 's mother and the,if you have n't enjoyed this episode i 'd recommend you watch it
1,like a day when the boys are having an accident,like all those who have never seen this film
1,the first two seasons were promising and were still in the dark,the first part of one of the great classic movies is when a
1,in all the story of the crime lord of the united states is not a typical bollywood movie,in a time when the film makers are being shown at this stage it 's clear that the writer
1,but the movie is not a total rehash,but the film also feels very interesting
1,you can tell just from another point of view the acting is,you will feel good for the film as an action adventure
1,the acting is so poor you 'll almost,the acting was excellent in this movie
1,physical thriller is supposed to do justice to his character in one word a film but he does well,physical moments are mostly the way he 's depicted and does n't make sense even though he 's in some
1,or the guy who is the hero,or do you have any luck with it
1,altman did a good job of mixing suspense with the,altman 's movies are n't really scary at all
1,i really ca n't stress enough enough with how the majority of the actors are all,i mean if your looking for something you 'd do n't do anything like it
1,here they are obviously going to do something that i can see coming off the fact that i was,here 's how the two men become the opposite to each other in their native countries for instance
1,do n't worry you 'll never end bored,do not say it 's a good movie
1,to add insult to injury the audience is likely to assume that a woman from the future of evil could be found with a body double and a little lamb,to be honest i never thought that it was as bad as the first movie and i thought it 'd be very easy to find something funny about this film
1,i have enjoyed this movie more than ever,i could n't wait for this to come back
1,any movie that touches and turns it into something really wrong you might find it more interesting,any major mistake to this film are to the viewer 's attention as we can see one of
1,coming from the one who claims to be in this movie we know why,coming up with a few movies from the same type of genre like this it
1,everyone was talking about it they had a lot of fun with it,everyone who wrote my comments said this is the best film ever made
1,after being dumped by a doctor and an accident of his family 's wife the two of them find the body of the living dead,after her life in the hospital she discovers that she really loves her he takes her from a different culture where a girl named rachel is
1,may he want to be the world,may is very difficult to do
1,i think it 's an independent film to,i thought that it was pretty good
1,what is this guy doing in the world,what can i say i can understand why he
1,at one point the movie switches in to the very tense climax that is quite funny,at the beginning of the movie there is so much talking of course it makes you want
1,the story was full of holes in,the acting is a bit stilted
1,because of all that i 'll be a fool to say that the ending,because of the lack of action the film lacks of depth and tension
1,all the good stuff about this movie the characters are a bit too unbelievable and i was expecting a better story,all you must think about is why people are doing it in fact it is like a movie you do n't even
1,sometimes i have been impressed with the film a long time,sometimes the movie is too slow boring for all its faults
1,it is very difficult for anyone to think about how these guys get themselves to the next level they need to be,it is a lot of fun and fun watching this short time especially since it was very long but i found myself liking
1,irons 's wife is a good actress but she still managed to play an adult role for the younger generation,irons is in many ways a favorite film a comedy and a tragedy with a very clever view on film
1,savage does n't know what to do,savage or not is another movie for me
1,it was really entertaining to watch on,it is that kind of movie
1,the actors who played winston were just horrible,the story is weak to begin with but the
1,unfortunately the fact that the rest of the,unfortunately this has n't really been done
1,there were some good jokes some of the best actors of the past twenty,there was only one thing that made such an interesting statement on me
1,i am a fan of the original story and the original version,i was so confused that i even liked them all that even when
1,everytime i got the dvd i realized i was really paying for some of the things,everytime these two finally come out of the picture they try to find it 's
1,i hope many people involved me in making this flick,i saw this again on tv in the 80 's
1,so the script is quite boring,so what we have here is a
1,and we can see why the hell they called people with the zoom on the back of her forehead,and yes if you 're looking for a thriller that takes out its message and can actually deal with the
1,this has been my favorite character to ever come across as a very sympathetic,this is not a film to give up with a bunch of kids
1,there is nothing that stands out in terms of being a documentary,there was very little violence and all of the acting and poor actors
1,spoilers ahead i really do n't know why this series is so good it has some nice actors but the story,spoilers from the opening scene he finds someone who killed himself in the head after the death of her husband
1,unless we are talking about that we do n't do as well with ourselves as we are,unless you have seen the movie yet you would want to stay in your local room
1,what i saw is a kind of a very good movie that really needs some action,what would happen next if it had been that a remake that had the decency to be
1,this movie was a huge disappointment in this one,this movie is n't for everyone at all but it
1,the only problem with the film is the script,the story line was bad a little farfetched and some
1,kyra carrol was a good choice and i liked it as an actress,kyra atkins is fine as michael douglas but when she has n't played the
1,regarding the scene as the last couple of the kids and the guy,regarding the title character alex is not in any case a major flaw with
1,enter the world of the first one with a vengeance of the living dead girl is quite a little frightening it 's as,enter a big ship is taken in by a local sheriff who wants to shoot a bunch of them in a cave
1,i'm surprised that most people have n't read the book for the movie to enjoy some kind of meaning of the,i'm not sure if or not it will seem like a movie or a comedy but that 's my opinion
1,i mean i thought this movie was a lot like another low budget movie but,i liked the way it was filmed and very realistic and also very detailed
1,it 's a shame that this version of hamlet was shown in color,it 's no wonder that the film 's biggest flaw is the script
1,he plays very well in this movie,he 's a great comedic actor
1,the ending the ending in the end just is n't up there there are the usual annoying endings in a,the acting is not as good either as the main roles were the only good parts about this one
1,i have n't seen this series yet but it makes you laugh,i think i was looking for the lost empire of this movie but
1,antonio banderas was at his best in this film,antonio fargas portrays a small and lovable man
1,but what the heck is that about with all the other actors,but there 's also a few minor changes to the film
1,it was as i said before in this film it was the most famous film in hollywood and,it seems to be the last film of such a short subject that is quite frankly bad
1,but they 're not all a bunch of nerds in,but that is no excuse of the movie itself
1,the only redeeming value was the acting,the music was a bit schmaltzy and the
1,the characters are a stereotype of two people,the story has been told and that 's a
1,chief woman and his wife arrive at which she works up to the mother,chief of the gods of the first world jim carrey played by vincent cassel in
1,my favorite scene involves the couple,my only complaint was the acting so
1,if this movie is just so bad with the acting or the plot it makes sense that it is a comedy,if all that sounds like it was filmed in the late 18th century it has an excellent feel of the era of
1,from the opening moments of the film i found that the film has a very haunting feel to it which makes for an interesting experience,from a very ordinary concept of this type of story to a very young woman in a society of her own it is a film with
1,it is n't that difficult to get that to do the best they can but i really liked,it 's not just that he has n't had enough opportunities to work on the movie business
1,enjoy it and you 'll love the ride,enjoy the movie because it will always be enjoyable
1,rumor for yourself a movie in the end but with what i already know what it is a story about two people,rumor is the story of the adventures of a man by young men who have lived there before in the past
1,the plot is basically a series of murders and clichs about the human race,the fact that the movie was made as a true story was a very real
1,i do n't understand what 's the matter,i mean you get the dvd cover
1,even worse the acting is terrible,even in that he 's the worst
1,unfortunately it is still not for everyone but if you want to see an actor with whom he can act like this,unfortunately for the love of god there is a difference between the and on screen and it 's all very contrived
1,ms malone plays her part as a woman in a hospital that goes on for a long time,ms 's mom who had a severe fascination with a married woman who could n't help her parents as
1,and what 's the point of his character,and it has a bit of some old action
1,there does n't seem to be nothing else,there are no real characters in the cast it
1,the plot is a joke with the characters who seem to,the movie is a tribute to the old bw movies
1,the movie has a lot of bad acting and there,the movie had the exact same impact on me
1,she 's always been one of many good movies but she does n't,she tries to escape his mind and she starts throwing his hands
1,there is also a lot of nudity that should have lasted over the first 15 minutes or so and instead of showing us the final shootout there was no attempt to build tension,there are plenty of reasons for not putting up the story as is the case with the characters at least it would have been interesting to see them in an entertaining fashion
1,there 's a lot more than just the usual array,there is more talk at the door than this
1,watch the first episode and then the rest of the crap out there,watch it alone if you can and get a sense of nostalgia that you
1,we are not going to be shocked,we 're at a loss where the hero
1,and the soundtrack of this particular song is truly haunting,and even the film looks like something hollywood would like to
1,full moon does n't even know what,full of bad things like an airplane scene
1,and yes as the film was set a little more the rest of,and how was it not to be made in the first place
1,yellow eyed young girl returns home to stay alive all that year before she 's killed by a cop at the,yellow rock a very funny and interesting story and a great action movie and if you have not seen it
1,i am very impressed by the casting decisions that made this film so terrible with the exception of,i really enjoyed the fact that the film 's title song in this movie is so bad
1,some of us might be able to handle,some of the jokes are really funny
1,say there is a great deal of talent in this film and you 'll know it it is n't even worth,say it is another movie without a soul of what it is meant to be but nothing is interesting or interesting or
1,jim belushi plays the role of john anderton,jim carrey is the most believable and engaging character
1,in the case of it elvira the only one left are in the case on the dvd cover,in addition to the film 's overall mastery of the picture is that a good deal of money was
1,i hope they are at the top of their game because this is one of the best parts of the movie,i love the fact that we 're not only slightly more forgiving and that the story would n't have been so stupid
1,please i heartily recommend this movie,please if you get the feeling it
1,there is never a drop of evil at the back of the van van dyke or a few,there 's a good cast of characters who never appear to be able to make a film
1,okay so the story of the girl who tries to kill her and tries to steal the mystery from a,okay i can see the appeal in my eyes that would be a great idea to start seeing it
1,it is a film that will make you cry,it is the most interesting thing about the documentary and
1,the main problem here is the script,the only real problem i have was with
1,no this was not the end of the movie,no real life has been done here for a few
1,ps the movie is like a bad remake of a play from an author of the 80 's from his childhood,ps they were all so good at producing that they were n't even remotely good enough to make it a big hit
1,it was a movie with good intentions,it is not the most horrible movie i
1,if the acting had been given more of a chance for the plot and the cast,if you want a scary horror film this is not the movie to watch either
1,donald pleasance 's career of playing his father who was just playing on himself was n't funny and neither was anything in the movie i do,donald sutherland is an actor in a film like this this is the last american film of its time by using a myriad of genres
1,i have seen her when she has sex and,i would definitely recommend this flick for all
1,and that 's too much to ask for,and if the story is about a very interesting
1,there have been two of two movies by the writer from texas chainsaw massacre and nightmare on elm street,there is more action scenes the usual cgi battle sequences like the city of hong kong police in the same
1,you 'd think this with a couple of actors in this movie,you will see the director and you will like this if you do
1,johnson 's portrayal of the film is that it takes quite a while to do so with a twist when the real,johnson is a young man who lives with many other people who want to be more and more than one character
1,he 's the director and has to deliver the whole show,he is in love and the man that has not seen this
1,what a shame that she never happened to be able to see it,what i got instead of being able to have a plot the movie is
1,this time she was one of many movies that made me miss,this is n't a comedy or a movie of a kind
1,the movie was made in the us by a lot of it,the story is basically the same except the main character is n't really
1,this film is only about a woman 's daughter the way to get her mother in the end,this is one of those movies that are n't great and it would have been quite nice
1,a man who has had a great job with his,a man meets his old girlfriend in the end
1,and for all the other good points i can make for the ending,and the way it was made it does n't mean that it was n't
1,the rest of the cast is good although,the only other problem is the dialogue
1,the ending was the last nail in the coffin and at the end of the movie after the battle and resolution i was surprised that this,the plot is full of clichs in this and the movie is a little bit more enjoyable in it 's approach to the genre itself
1,the cast of characters with guns and guns were absolutely,the story is interesting and the acting is good
1,there 's nothing wrong with it,there was one song scene that stood
1,but the worst one was the way that a movie made me think that there was,but the most striking character is one of the most underappreciated characters in the film
1,and it is a long distance,and it must have been done before
1,it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen,it was a bad movie in my opinion
1,in one point the director of her novel,in that way i was n't disappointed
1,nice fun and i recommend this film,nice thing he got a job in a
1,the film is a visual feast,the film shows the life it takes
1,snape the merciless boy from the first film is not going after any of the film 's,snape 's father comes across for this family 's family and seeks out a new life
1,while not really in high school i was really intrigued by the acting and,while not necessarily there seems to be some elements within the first act
1,i did get a kick out of many of the performances and,i was quite disappointed in watching all of our lives unfold
1,revenge of the mutant is n't a typical western movie it is a total ripoff,revenge and murder will have all but vanished under the radar of his mother
1,then i got this one on video tape,then they all went up they had to put
1,the movie is a waste of time,the acting is great however the characters are
1,also when you have a group of men getting together with women and you have to suffer it,also the whole thing could have been the worst movie i 've seen in a long time
1,if there 's a threat and some of the actors do their own thing it 's pretty easy to tell that their film is,if it was n't for the music of any song it 's the equivalent of a really good rendition of the title song
1,so in the later years of the year the,so i do n't have any clue why
1,it 's a movie about what you need not only be but just as you,it 's more like a bunch of a little fun in it 's time
1,some things are wrong there 's always one good thing you get out of the story that will,some of the scenes seem to be trying to be funny too but it does n't work
1,they can also get the soundtrack together,they could have even cut a shot of
1,you 'll thank me just think about it,you 're not even looking at how ridiculous it
1,it was an odd film for everyone who wants to see a nice movie to get excited for,it makes me question why the producers decided to take such serious characters and do something to fill up
1,with the exception of that movie and the fact that i loved this movie so much i did n't find anything quite interesting,with this film the actors in this film did n't seem realistic except that it 's just a bunch of pointless things just for
1,the film has no plot the only time this movie is ever released is to,the movie is about people 's relationships and the interactions between themselves and people
1,no wonder they all do n't work hard to obtain the laughs,no one i 've ever seen as many have mentioned this
1,and the two of them do n't know how to work,and it is quite the idea of the movie itself
1,well this show was great a good one at that,well that 's how i got the dvd of it
1,it 's not one of those,it 's a nice work but it
1,for me that was the biggest draw in the way i imagined them,for that matter it was so ridiculous its funny and quite funny
1,this is a film to enjoy as a,this film is as bad as that
1,morris as the hero is the most realistic character,morris and the director could n't find his
1,he is just a complete jerk,he was also the best actor in
1,beast vs kramer is one of a low budget movie about life and a story that does n't work because,beast of bagdad is a wonderful and very well acted story of a man trying to save his country
1,these are the two people who just keep their clothes,these guys have more screen time than the original the whole
1,carey is such a great actor and yet he manages to pull off a very different role,carey 's character is a real drag man and he has a girlfriend in his bed
1,first was the music which was played by a man who used to be a punk,first there 's more to this and more like the other movie about the subject matter
1,meanwhile his wife leaves him and tells him about his life,meanwhile a group of american soldiers find in a japanese base and
1,he does n't take a kindly character as,he finds a new meaning and does
1,this is a comedy i recommend you to do n't mind but please make sure to keep it at any cost,this is so bad its that i am glad they went to the bottom that would come off like that
1,more entertaining than the movie it 's about the relationship between both and in a very rich family,more like a comedy with some sort of character development and some clever acting and a nice score by
1,the main characters are just plain funny,the story is a bit corny but as
1,perhaps they really should have just stayed a little in the,perhaps this was the worst movie i have ever seen
1,i hope this is an underrated movie in the history of the world the film industry had,i am a fan of the original manga and i can see it being a masterpiece of classic
1,jennifer garner as the daughter is so bad her role as good ol' and innocent is,jennifer tilly was excellent as the wife who was given the chance to leave her
1,i was n't sure what to expect,i 've only read the original
1,wes anderson was obviously the only character in the original,wes craven has been done so many times before
1,the main cast includes edward woodward tom hanks james mason and john goodman,the main character who has to kill herself is a total cipher with a
1,anyway i 'd read the book for the story,anyway i was quite disappointed that the story is pretty
1,she gets the first look and the acting in this,she would have been the star as a girl
1,every episode is so real and the story moves along for no discernible reason,every aspect of this film is as funny as the movie 's title
1,here is a story that is both intelligent and a very realistic and moving,here i am not a critic but a critic and i could overlook her reputation
1,no it was only a kid 's show,no one expects a decent idea and instead i
1,at this cost of film awards for the big screen,at first 37 minutes in overzealous mr klein is n't able
1,they could n't go to a lot,they would have made it good
1,despite the acting performances the film is n't bad,despite the fact that he has a lot of action
1,perabo were the first major thing that could have been covered,perabo the guy playing his girlfriend and then the story of this
1,none of that is that interesting it is about,none of the original episodes were any better
1,it is so bad it 's almost ridiculous,it 's a shame that many actors are so
1,stockwell 's direction is excellent and there is a nice cameo by james hurt,stockwell plays the cop with another unusual film and a few good ideas
1,strong dialogue or funny lines in the original movie,strong yet funny dialogue from all the actors in a
1,you get a sense of an individual 's personality in,you could do a better job with this film
1,it was an enjoyable scene of this one,it was a very well done film
1,before seeing the opening scenes of the film the girls playing on the train and the two of them,before the film 's release of the film was shown recently to a group of people for free
1,visually this was made for television it,visually a must see for you
1,its that you do n't want to know it is,its very easy to suspend the disbelief of a film but
1,she then finds something weird and gets his friend to be the,she is just as hot and funny as i 'd anticipated
1,the first time i saw it i felt like i knew it would be like a movie of its kind it,the other characters had an excellent amount of chemistry and chemistry between them and it was a pleasure to watch
1,a perfect piece of work not to,a must see for all those
1,as for her performance in here and,as mentioned all over the place
1,for some reason the music used for the keyboard and the dancing in that scene in the film is,for example when the family is on one side of the screen they start apologizing for the murder
1,all in all this is one of the,all of the performances are very good
1,apart from the aforementioned theme of events and its shortcomings being somewhat preachy,apart from that it 's the one i have ever heard about
1,ben has the most memorable moments in,ben murphy stars in this one
1,gary sinise as a woman in the lead,gary oldman and john malkovich are amazing
1,he plays out to make sure he has never known such a man,he is also able to walk through the ranks of his career
1,so the film does have its moments though the director is trying to get,so what does this have to do with a guy on a bike
1,both men were well known for their work and the production values are very good,both characters have not done a lot in the plot and are obviously very very close
1,just do n't expect a big explosion,just to make a movie for people i
1,maybe this was the most interesting thing to get out of the muck,maybe the real thing you will probably have in the game is why we
1,if they had n't been allowed to make it a bit better i would n't know what the appeal they made to it but it is really an indie and movie,if you were planning to watch a movie with a good cast with the lead character and his friends in the case should have it coming to a end where i was
1,although this film has a bad acting to the plot i could not help but feel,although i do appreciate the fact that one movie was shot in england with the director one
1,the film opens with a couple of scenes that take,the characters in this movie actually did n't die
1,my wife and i were bored on the couch crying,my dad said it 's a really bad movie it is
1,it was n't long on i remembered that it was a good tv movie and the best,it is one of those movies that you can understand and so much fun to watch
1,everyone else has their own way,everyone from the cast including the young
1,yet it 's also a shame it has no more funding than it must be at least,yet i never saw the original but it turned it off as a pretty good movie
1,ridiculed in this era however is his second time and he can still maintain one 's sympathy,ridiculed during the war years between the two in terms of the american and the people who saw
1,its very hard to understand the film 's lack of atmosphere because there is no,its not the greatest scifi film but a good watch but not very original
1,bad script bad script bad dialogue bad,bad acting awful plot horrible music
1,this film is very well done and it 's a fun flick that,this is n't it it 's not your usual hollywood type movie
1,he is a hero and his wife is so old,he is n't as scary as an actor and is not
1,a couple scenes were not only blurry and shot but,a good show to watch for a rainy day
1,this film would be worth seeing for her performance,this would make me curious to watch something in the
1,a good cast great characters with a strong plot,a film by the director 's best acting the directing
1,there 's no need to explore a lot of,there was really no sense about this film
1,these were the moments where the movie was written by neil simon,these stories take an turn of the 1930s that combines them with them
1,i did n't think the film was very much on a plot,i 'll tell you my opinion this is the most interesting film i
1,who in that movie was the victim of the movie,who would love both if they had a different movie
1,wesley snipes plays a guy who has a tough way of life and is a tough cop with a secret agent but then they do n't,wesley snipes plays the typical detective who gets a girl to work at the morgue in which he 's mistaken that his mother is dead and is
1,plus the actors were so incredibly bad,plus the performances are top notch
1,tom cruise is a joy to watch as the father of a rich boy on the verge from,tom hanks is funny as the lead character and makes you root for him in the end
1,in the beginning i loved the film,in fact i loved this movie and had
1,if you have n't read the book you will want to watch,if you love fantasy films then this may be your film
1,why did they want to make a film about a kid,why is this one in the first place or what
1,there are too many scenes that are n't funny when we come to a scene,there 's a bit of a twist that 's actually quite exciting and not enough that
1,the story has an interesting premise,the fact that the whole film is
1,there are many good jokes to go on,there were some moments when the show did come
1,at this point it is a rather long paced film for both of the people involved,at least she had no talent and did not know that he was going to have her
1,at least we could see the film more often than is possible,at least i do n't remember that that was the case with it
1,a complete waste of money money and effort,a very funny thing to look at there was
1,we got in the way of our nation and then we did what we were doing with,we 're supposed to feel that you watch the movie with all the lights in there
1,i know they 're going to be there too many characters but it 's hard to get on the story of a,i 've never seen such a stupid thing if there have ever been one or a good movie on this level
1,first a bunch of men wearing yellow suits to death and kill her own husbands,first let me tell you the plot i just really liked how the movie could possibly
1,their actions are in fact the ones who,their acting skills also seemed very fake
1,the other reviews i 've read from it are not to be missed,the plot line is about the same age as the original movie and i
1,i had to buy a ticket when i came,i 've heard more detail of this documentary
1,also if you like to watch and enjoy this movie it 's,also why not like a sequel to a new groove episode
1,while the film is quite a bit boring its definitely not a good film that really does n't,while this is a bad film the acting is absolutely horrible which really made me wonder why
1,have not we been waiting for the sequel to the original classic classic,have i known more of the people who had this type of movie
1,he is a great storyteller but they,he was killed with a chainsaw
1,i do n't care how you keep the tape on this dvd which means it wo n't make you feel bad,i remember the old black guy who was in the first one and he had the first look of the movie
1,i'm amazed that the producers had a negative budget and decided not to mention the obvious attempt at,i'm sure this movie was filmed in new zealand as to why we were n't the president
1,the scene that we see is a very graphic scene involving a woman looking on a lawn tree wearing a jacket coat,the film never drags out from the novel and the dialogue is flat dull and completely contrived to say the least
1,but when some of the dialog and the film 's characters evoke,but all i wanted was just a bunch of random stereotypes
1,i do think that the character of christy was too shy in,i have to say that i'm not to be taken seriously
1,you would think that the movie was actually more of a comedy in the hands of,you have no idea who made this to go back in time but who cares
1,i thought that this movie should just have been a great idea for a lowbudget film to,i really ca n't really figure out why this movie got picked up in that case
1,most of the time a film about a boy being shot in the street was,most of them are n't funny or were there really bad in this movie
1,it may seem a bit dated,it 's like he was trying his
1,from this point on it is clear to be a complete unmitigated embarrassment,from the fact that this film has not got much of a budget it
1,clearly the movie is a very good show it 's fun to watch and some interesting elements,clearly it looks like someone with a camera that has never been made with a camera
1,the problem is that it is n't even that good,the acting as for the sets were very good
1,check out the old fashioned house and do yourself a favor and go buy a vhs of this film,check out the dvd set is very misleading but you 'll better help the actress who you cannot care less
1,both these movies have a theme about,both leads were just as bad
1,interesting how many people in the world say things,interesting is the plot that shows a potential between two
1,the film was a complete disappointment,the plot is a bit predictable and
1,he is a true warrior and he is willing to sacrifice themselves,he gets an actor who is quite annoying as well as his usual
1,therefore the film does not offer a definite,therefore the movie is not for everyone
1,nobody seems to think in life at all that this,nobody else believes that this is one of them
1,just look at the movie and the subject of,just do n't be fooled by the comments
1,about all the films i have to say about this movie i have to admit that i have n't missed it in,about to go through the motions as a director with many scenes of sexual abuse the film relies on its humor
1,it does not even try and be a comedy and is not a comedy,it was also a great idea for what the tagline was saying about the time
1,ming was good but his character was the only one and he was supposed to,ming ming 's character is a bit of a brat named theodore de sica
1,that is because it feels too sad,that 's the way it is
1,it 's really about the war against all the characters and the stories,it 's as though the writers tried to be different from the blair witch
1,both films have very low budget and a plot that,both sides and are pretty much in desperate need
1,the end is as ridiculous as watching,the fact that the story is supposed to
1,i hope that i will even purchase the dvd for,i 'd rate this movie as a total 8
1,he was really really a lot of screen time,he 's a lot more annoying than ever
1,at first i liked that the film was filmed independently in the 70 's,at last it has a real appeal i feel compelled to write to the director
1,chops to the plot to be a pretty good cast,chops is a bad movie and a disgrace to those who
1,the ending is the most predictable climax ever committed,the rest of the cast is quite good
1,this was one of the few movies i ever had walked out over the years and the acting is terrible,this is certainly the best of the series because it features a lot more than one person from the first movie
1,while he was an international leader and therefore was the son of the group that became his best friend and who died,while i think that it is a great film i think it 's a really bad movie that i would watch and it
1,between these two girls he 's not a great singer,between all his scenes are very similar to anything in recent
1,the movie is a total disappointment,the movie really does suffer from the
1,but they just seem to run over the head trying to be funny,but the movie is so bad that you actually feel embarrassed by seeing this
1,but then the movie abruptly ends up as another slasher movie,but the end of the film was not quite in the movie
1,however i must concede that there were some scenes that make the whole thing worthwhile,however these are not enough to save the film and that one was the complete lack
1,in fact the entire movie feels like a soap,in short a great work of a film
1,teenager is played by the one and,teenager on paper was so great
1,making sure i could not see this film again,making a good action movie with a nice cast headed
1,bacon was so good to watch the show that he made it a delight to watch and the way he talked to the people,bacon does a fine job of playing a man who has a great time in his life and is very difficult to make
1,when i first heard it was available i watched the movie,when one of the other reviewers said the plot had absolutely no
1,and in the end she is an incredibly talented actress which makes it,and so after sitting through this one that is a true classic
1,a simple little movie about the life of an artist on a daily basis in,a must see for anyone who wants to know about their life and beliefs
1,so now he decides to make a better film,so the movie has a long story arc but not
1,while he gives a bit of humour in its viewers they feel as though he 's going on,while it does n't have the right ingredients to show as a big budget hollywood show this is a
1,one of the best was the scene between the two brothers,one of the most beautiful moments and a very funny surprise
1,the story is not that bad,the scene involving a man in a
1,if you 're looking for something a little better please do n't bother with the,if you 're a big fan of his work then this is a classic
1,the first film in the series where she got a great scene and was actually good,the end of the game is a complete mess of a film about an unknown character
1,even the music of the film seems unnecessary,even the score by philip glass has n't been
1,richard pryor as a cowboy on top of the line is simply as great as he is in the,richard chamberlain was good as the leader of the group 's gang in the new york city town
1,if you 're looking for a funny film with a bunch of familiar names to do with,if i wanted to see that 's the type of film i would n't think about
1,karen blair and john doe were great but the rest of the,karen silkwood does n't come close to being a good actress
1,the plot line was a bit overdone at,the two leads have their best moments
1,the film starts out with a bang of a man laying in at his arms,the fact that everything in this movie stunk but it was a good job
1,but the worst movies i have ever seen,but she makes all the difference and leaves the
1,some of the lines are a bit overdone but in the end this is a movie with a different message,some critics say that i prefer some of the great classics of all time including a lot of people who are
1,i was a huge fan of this movie,i was so surprised by the end of the
1,the story line of both of them being,the music and sound quality are awesome
1,with the release of the film a film about the search of a story about,with a great cast this is not a film you will want to watch
1,ted plays the son of an eminent doctor in an auto accident in an area that,ted martin has a special appearance in the first place and is n't too bad
1,all these actors give the lead performance all in all i give,all of this are the worst movies i have ever seen
1,i saw this film after a group of young actors,i have n't enjoyed the original pumpkinhead but this is one
1,i can imagine all the people liking the movie especially considering that it is a film with,i really could care less about what 's going on about this horrible attempt at humor
1,it 's the most disturbing moment in the whole movie it 's very funny to,it 's a pretty good film that deserves all due to the brilliant cast
1,there is also some great comedy moments in one episode the opening shot of events by the mother and how the family is reunited,there was a lot of action in the film for the audience a sense of dread that did not quite capture the atmosphere
1,harry then proceeds to show her his true sense of humor,harry also was n't a child molester the whole movie could have
1,the acting is excellent the storyline is sharp and full of action and the whole idea of how,the best i can think of is it had good acting and just about everybody in it
1,all of them are the nicest part of the moviethe characters of the movie,all in all i think all involved the cast of the film are the worst
1,the film was shot in color,the only reason they made this movie
1,the story line is so poor to,the special effects are really good
1,after watching his first film he made several other films out of his way with the same type of old man and black mask and,after he was released he meets some strange characters in the series and his friend is very clearly put into a pit of water
1,unfortunately none of us have seen a character like the comic,unfortunately some of the shots are just some of the worst i
1,why is it so important to do to a child,why he has his best roles is beyond me
1,five men in a mansion with a mysterious black man,five out of 10 is a perfect one of their own
1,and the music by michael rock is very appropriate as i recall the name of the film was a classic,and if you enjoy the tv series and you know what the show is and what happens in the movie you
1,oh and i mean it 's supposed to be scary,oh so you cannot tell anything that is right about this
1,i 've never heard of a movie where they have done something like the movie i know it 's not the main reason,i saw this film as my friends and i did n't even watch the movie until i got to see the film
1,i can understand the real problem with this film,i will never again go see a movie
1,i am a diehard fan of the book,i could n't imagine how the film makers have
1,i did n't think a guy was really trying to get his son on the set,i have to admit that it is true that i do n't get this at all the
1,if you love movies you would like the one in which they are released and how are there,if only you are watching a movie you 'll laugh at how funny this movie is for people who
1,he does the best with his portrayal of a young girl,he was born in hollywood for an interview with a few people
1,in my opinion it 's a pretty accurate movie as a whole,in the book he 's a very good actress but it really does
1,good idea not to mention the first,good luck from a good director
1,camerawork is beautiful and the actors do what appears to be very,camerawork a great deal and this was one of my favorites
1,the movie is like a very funny drama,the acting is awful the directing is weak the
1,the acting is very good and the performances were good,the characters are the best in any movie but the one
1,he could write so many words and write scripts that he would make,he was in the picture he got the best of these girls
1,as you know it 's not much easier than what you,as it is i feel sorry for the bad guys
1,excellent cinematography nice camera angles good music and all together,excellent film about a girl who is a virgin but also
1,grant is a fine actor as the young detective and the supporting cast is great but it gets a bit boring at times,grant and kelly are two stars on a movie in their lives but on a mission to bring back the memories of their relationship
1,one of the biggest problems with 87 yearold women in other countries is to see her at first as a teenager trying,one has to wonder how she could act as a woman but i do n't get a moment to her boyfriend
1,contains some great actors like anthony sheen and steve buscemi,contains spoilers from the imdb reviewer is not a comedy
1,sure the film has a good atmosphere but it does n't,sure it could be a comedy and it was made at all
1,he plays the leader of the mormons on the loose,he has the capacity to be the world of most hardened
1,then the whole film consists of the characters talking and talking about each other,then you know what i wanted to talk about but these things happened
1,those who feel offended are the guys with no sense of humor or intelligence or interest of our,those who enjoy it go nuts or buying the dvd because the cast is the real standout
1,it 's a lot of fun for the kids and women to enjoy,it reminds me so much of its own reality it 's so bad it
1,i could never forgive the old man 's wife in his own life or what,i ca n't think of a better movie so badly done in this film
1,but in the end this will always have a chance or a cult following of the classic in the way of comedy,but if someone had a little research for the project to go through his life there 's a good way to give it
1,it is definitely not a sequel that i have ever seen,it was a waste of time and i would n't have made
1,i like movies that do n't shy me at all,i do n't feel like my children are having a child
1,there were some very good shots in the film,there are some memorable things in all of the gags
1,borrowed from my own memories i have no idea why this should be released in the same way as the first one,borrowed from a story of a wealthy man 's family life of her own father 's journey to find her own and find
1,the film was a waste of time and money,the movie is just about the same sort of thing
1,first off i would like to point out the plot line,first this film had no good intentions in its predecessor
1,the only thing that was n't bad was the lack of a message for the,the story is very thin and you can understand the actors with the script
1,chris rock is a good show because i'm convinced that the whole,chris sarandon has a few moments as the young seth brundle
1,she even makes one of her all time,she gets caught up in the murder of the
1,the result is just plain awful and is definitely worth checking out,the last few scenes that would have looked to have been in the
1,season 2 was one of my favorites after i watched it,season 12 is an absolute abc classic with a lot of great
1,experience and i do n't know where to start it is just as,experience is a story of love love friendship greed despair and sacrifice
1,why should they be able to pull it off with the same old person as they,why did anyone tell the police officer that the entire police officer was killed during the robbery
1,as the title suggests i'm anxiously anticipating i read that i actually had a problem with it,as a matter of fact the movie was n't very good either but really that one could have
1,how could he keep thinking it was a bad film,how could be made to play a different game
1,hanki was a little nervous though,hanki is a beautiful woman and they
1,she plays a great role model who gets involved in a lot of trouble,she has two sons whose husband left a house for new york and marries a
1,for a horror flick this was a very nice surprise,for the movie it would get a bit repetitive and for
1,the only difference between one of the worlds in the movie is the way the police officials are trying to get,the characters were believable and there were interesting moments of poignancy but nothing from the real or even memorable scenes
1,the movie is a great example of how not to make a good movie especially when you 're reading it,the actors seem to have been dubbed by the director but they did n't make for a bad director
1,to add depth to the story the film gets some interesting points in the dialogue and the dialogue is one of the better performances of the,to the filmmakers and directors who have done what they are doing it they will say that the majority of the movie is pretty bad
1,the movie tries to be something like an adventure thriller but is n't,the story is simple and predictable but the action sequences are very well filmed
1,there are so many problems with that film are that the script is n't too hard to follow,there 's nothing funny here at all but as they go along the way you get the impression you
1,it 's a lot more serious as a tv film for the boys that were made by,it makes a point about how crappy it is and how the characters are completely different
1,this movie will make me laugh,this film has the ability to put
1,they would not have to be better than most of them,they do n't know what 's going on and we have to
1,but the movie is about a group of students who travel into a car through,but the worst part of this movie is the casting of the main actors
1,i saw the movie on a free afternoon on a sunday afternoon and,i do have a soft spot of quality with the acting talent
1,on a note of how the film 's production value was used by,on top of that she 's just too bad for her part
1,the film never fails to deliver any suspense with it 's characters and the final twist is pretty lame,the music is very good and does make me feel like i 'll see every single scene and that 's
1,altogether it makes no sense to the actors either it 's a little bland and it is so annoying its,altogether this movie is very slow with the fact that there was more action to be told in it
1,the dialogue is witty the music is well worth mentioning,the script which can be summarized by is a good premise
1,santa claus is as good if not,santa claus was a good actor
1,even today i just ca n't say which,even if you have the choice to have one
1,jesse bruce is a good one as was the rest of the cast though,jesse does n't seem to get that right either but even the actors look and
1,after a while i thought they were all going to be in the movie but they were n't quite as so the plot twist was,after viewing the trailer and then read about it i know that most of the reviews are on the same level as the original
1,this was one of those bad movies that i rented only,this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the book
1,somehow i did n't know this until i read the book,somehow i have a strong sense of humor about how to play
1,sure there 's a lot to say about this guy who is so funny and i feel very proud of his character,sure you know i'm a die hard snipes fan but you know his character was killed but all i had no reason to
1,their acting is top notch with great timing and this is one of them,their actions make more sense and there are other plans for this sort of situation
1,does n't it seem like any person from south park and,does they look at it in a more conventional way
1,i hope they can be released soon,i can safely say this is not a
1,i saw it for the first time it was released on dvd at the same,i was thinking he was an underrated filmmaker but this film was no exception
1,it had to be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen and i,it 's a shame that a film does n't get better in many ways
1,oh no this film is in my opinion the greatest of all,oh wait they do n't get to be in the middle of the
1,different people know their lines and they go through the paces of trying to push it off,different people are not quite as important as this one but it was fun to see a lot
1,sunshine is the last of the four films i,sunshine 2 and 2 have been the scariest
1,a few films of note to have it that all work and some of them are not,a woman that has gone on a killing spree by a killer named hector and a man of
1,the story is really very straightforward and the acting is good for the time,the first segment was a very good one to watch in a great way but
1,slowly as usual and is often pretty funny,slowly the girl gets a chance to visit the
1,in that movie the audience is not aware of what to,in reality if they do they can only say this
1,vaughn 's performance is the same as that of robert deniro 's character,vaughn 's performance was well put this film was n't good but it was
1,agostino 's friend died when he was,agostino is one of my favorites
1,if you want a fun ride then look elsewhere,if so i would give this movie an 810 a
1,obviously for one film the audience is supposed to sympathize with the fact,obviously the movie is also so much more than an exercise piece
1,great job by an excellent cast,great music and cinematography make this a
1,again there is a story within a short,again his father is a good guy
1,lynn 's direction was all at once and the acting was awful,lynn and karen had also given her mother 's fortune and she was
1,was there any more time to watch the tv,was a lot of fun if you were
1,i loved this movie a lot,i had heard of the last mimzy
1,counting the acting of the main lead actor,counting is something that is the funniest thing about
1,leslie colbert stars in the film as she 's a great actress,leslie nielsen makes a good appearance as alex the man that loves him
1,debra winger is also excellent as the mother who is just as interesting as she is,debra winger gives a brilliant performance as the villain and the one that will keep you interested
1,it has a big problem to the plot it is as simple,it 's supposed to be a comedy but it 's funny
1,when a character calls him unconscious the victim does n't get shot up and he escapes to the other side of the road,when the movie came out it did n't come down to that and never seemed to get any of the major details
1,there were some good examples of the film as a result a scene,there 's not one ounce of good character development to speak of
1,heck it 's one of my favorite films ever,heck if you want to see another great horror movie
1,the main difference between the two is that they have a way of doing so,the movie tries to take a bit while trying to take serious themes from one 's
1,in the original version it has been told by another reviewer but,in this episode the characters are very likable and very interesting
1,the movie has no redeeming and grace in it as the two female leads are a bunch of people with no respect whatsoever and no one else,the acting is quite good and i do n't think that many people who do a decent job do n't try to steer into the movie
1,this film is in my opinion the best and not so bad it is very hard to believe,this is not bad but for those of you who like this film in general to understand from the
1,there 's nothing funny that we can only remember as a,there is a great performance by anthony hopkins as ben
1,i was not impressed by the production of this film because when it,i did n't think he was an actress from the first movie
1,depp is ok but you can barely understand how he could be like these movies,depp and hawn are very good in their characters but you really should n't notice them
1,the movie 's title is that it 's also an indepth depiction of the characters,the film 's message is the same one but rather its true meaning for me that
1,i do n't want to do anything positive about this film at least,i 'd prefer to hear more but i wont be a problem
1,brilliant and exciting film that could have,brilliant script good performances all round
1,while the main character on the other hand is a character the acting is generally a bit stiff at,while not a typical hollywood film it 's a real treasure it was more like in the 1930s
1,through that this is the way most of the actors go and the,through some of the same scenes you are taken to the movie
1,i'm thinking the producers of this film wanted to get the,i'm sure the whole group was n't a fair grader
1,it was filmed in a class in time where a bunch of,it has a lot of good performances but i liked it
1,i just thought it would come off as a bad film as i really liked all three,i 've seen some of the episodes and i can honestly say that it was just so sweet
1,but a perfect director for film lovers,but it is a good film
1,robert redford and james stewart did much better as a team together,robert englund as a slimy and sadistic man who seems like a cross
1,the problem with the movie is how does these,the film is a good piece of cinema
1,in a way he makes the best of every accolade in which he is in full bloom,in this one you can get a sense of a plot the story to make for a good
1,it is the same guy who gave the film all the money,it was almost impossible to see where this film went wrong
1,he also wrote the book it could have been some of the,he is one of the most talented actors of our generation
1,in fact the first scene was quite good and the story,in many ways the movie is just a bad movie
1,generally a lot of this film is n't the most visually interesting film i have ever seen but the acting,generally for me the film 's greatest sin is the fact that the plot is rather confusing and the characters do
1,maris himself is perfect in a role that looks like the role of andy banks an accountant who in a wheelchair,maris is one of the best films ever made but it 's all too damn to be really quite silly in a
1,this film will remain a little more long and will probably be remembered as having enjoyed it for that time,this is an action movie in fact it was shot on a budget in the same place as did you 'd
1,clive owen 's performance is brilliant as well,clive owen plays an excellent and very believable character
1,a little slow moving and with a few exceptions,a fine ensemble cast that brings across the picture and
1,it has a great cast excellent sets good fx plenty of fun and lots of action as the tension mounts and the action is very much the movie 's pace,it is n't a film of any kind but the fact that the camera is in a way different than the story itself in terms of style and style
1,remember a movie with a bad name,remember the scene where our hero walking inside
1,there 's lots of other characters for the last minute but the story of a girl that has the mental illness of young people trying to kill them all the,there are some things like the ending where i was going to get the dvd and i realized it was just so much better with the original cast members
1,this is definitely a good movie,this would be a perfect story to
1,she 's also a good actor,she has a daughter whom she does
1,sprung by several different characters in the film to give us in a certain moment to connect that of mr 's mind on a very difficult level to,sprung from a movie that 's not particularly memorable the film is not a bad film but it is also good clean fun from all the characters
1,if your looking for the fact that there 's nothing left out the film should be as,if anything it would have been better to show it on a saturday night tv show
1,after seeing this film it was an attempt to capitalize the movie on a book that is not funny,after seeing the movie we are not able to understand any aspect of the characters that we are watching and
1,grand prix is not a great movie either,grand hotel for me is one of the worst
1,he is also the perfect leader who is in love with a woman which she does,he has been put to the test of the earth to make a living organism
1,yet as a result of all the things you 're missing from these films they are not all bad,yet in a movie that takes the time to turn it into a big bore a film that has its
1,all in all this is more of an action picture,all we get is some kind of monster attack
1,uneven in all the wrong way there is a lot of good points which can,uneven dialogue and directing of course that was the worst thing in this flick
1,not only because the director was a master of the material but also his own ability to use,not that it matters really mean that the film was really filmed like a bunch of films
1,both men are at first hotter than the actual movie but in this,both the story lines are completely ludicrous and the acting is wooden
1,remarkably recommended as a film by director costagavras and a few more others for,remarkably enough she finds her niche and her husband played by jack palance
1,if you want a good lowbudget b movie go ahead and check this one out for yourself,if it 's supposed to be a horror film it 's not a bad script or action
1,these are not always actors here we see they do,these people just do n't know what to like
1,madhuri rai is one of my favorite actresses in all its glory and the movie makes her look like a big doll in the dark,madhuri dixit does an excellent job as usual so as a person she looks as though she is in it for a brief cameo
1,so if you have n't figured this out you 've seen the film,so he and her fellow wife rebecca go on some kind of vacation trip
1,it 's one of the more fun comedies of the 90 's of the 90s,it 's not that hard on her part she is very believable as she should have
1,not to mention the terrible editing and editing which was n't even hinted at any of the other members of the audience,not for everyone in this movie though some people have already made it a point to view it in its entirety
1,i saw the premier of this movie,i 've read another user comments here that
1,taken into consideration she takes the child out of the asylum as a waitress,taken to a very very different level is the story of two individuals who go
1,italy was a huge hit in australia was,italy 's original release was never made
1,an excellent movie in the series i saw,an interesting cast and a good movie
1,claimed to be a bad and pointless and boring movie it had no plot no,claimed to be this movie has the most memorable scenes i have ever seen
1,the story is very real with the exception of the other members of the family,the special effects of these two and the costumes and makeup effects are excellent
1,michael ironside gives some impressive performances,michael ironside should have been given an
1,consider my personal opinion of this film and the fact that there 's something very wrong with it,consider this a bad show but it 's very lame and it ends without a clear aftertaste
1,the acting ranges from pretty mediocre to oscarworthy,the main idea is so that you can see
1,diahann carroll was superb as miss marple and she also starred in this movie,diahann carroll had a great career career and she was always a joy to watch
1,that means they are on this and that is why people seem to dislike this,that 's because they are not used in the first hour of the film
1,music was a bit cheesy but after having a couple of hours to live the entire family,music is just beautiful the costumes are breathtaking and the songs have the lyrics to them
1,mike and her new boyfriend john are friends and they just do,mike myers gives a good performance as well as his character
1,secret sunshine is not as good if not worse than the first,secret agent frank marshall has created the most memorable character in the history
1,judy garland and the rest of the supporting cast are great,judy garland stars as her boyfriend and her character is quite engaging
1,her best friend 's daughter is murdered by the local government,her sister and the daughter are also quite beautiful people
1,the first time i saw a film titled i had already discovered it had to be released from the local,the acting was ok the story was good but the directing was horrible by the end and really sucked
1,bravo for all who will pay for this movie,bravo and a lot of good entertainment work
1,before the film is over the opening credits are set to ponder which is why the,before you know it is n't a complete ripoff in your face it is all
1,i could feel for this person who could n't help any more than a few people,i have seen the film on the big screen and i think the director had only a
1,so we follow a group of members and three sisters,so to my surprise it 's a good movie but i
1,i guess all the actors were miscast in a role of a lifetime actor who was unable to convey what he could,i could not believe that i am in the minority 's position to put in my collection when i think a film like
1,and the scene is at least twice a little jarring,and then there is the sound of scenes that take place
1,there 's never any redeeming factor,there is some real reason they have
1,the movie is a masterpiece of how the studio can be treated as a series of scenes as many people have a real connection to the entire history of society and,the movie is a complete failure it makes you angry and i recommend the movie to the last 10 minutes or so i spent in vain for something that happened
1,and i wo n't spoil it,and this time it 's just an
1,more often than a few moments of the film the film does linger a little,more or less the characters are completely underdeveloped and their personalities are the same
1,what makes this most memorable is its visual depth the film 's ability to use the,what would come from this movie is if you are a fan of the movies
1,all the girls in the cast did a pretty good job of delivering convincing dialog,all this was made to me so be it is the film and the director is
1,anyway if you 're going to rip off the dvd you probably,anyway the film moves in time and has to be seen
1,jack palance has been cast and is probably best suited for her role,jack palance and john garfield are two the greatest actors and it is his
1,of course the only reason anyone should like this movie is because i'm not an idiot fan i thought i 'd give my a chance to see but i do hope they,of all the cheech chong movies it is an amazingly creepy film and i am glad that it was released nationwide on dvd since i was lucky enough to see it
1,this would have been far more accurate and had more of the focus,this is probably the most impressive film made during the last decade
1,finding his wife in the family farm and the child is the son who died shortly later on to their grandfather but was able to get out of the depression after his own death,finding the truth is that the world could bring back this series and the result was the same one did you need to get all the plot threads the characters show in what they were
1,his father is a boy he 's a man,his name is so awful you really need to wonder
1,director jacques audiard is always a director of his time but even this particular film can be so bad that,director david cronenberg has created a dark and gritty atmosphere of the events that are revealed in the movie
1,this was my introduction to the story,this is n't a well produced film it
1,jerk the other half way is pretty sad for a couple minutes,jerk are the real deal when the movie is really bad
1,h20 is a classic in every category,h20 was probably the last best animated series
1,the film is also full of the worst films out there,the movie begins with the opening sequence but as i said it
1,up to the standards of acting and screenplay it is one of those films you 've never heard of,up until this point this film was released as it was made for a small budget that does n't seem
1,death bed is a great film of,death race was a great movie
1,the characters were developed for the entire movie so much so that it felt rushed and disjointed,the other is that in a very dark and stormy night there is a story line which is
1,this one is as awful as i 've ever seen and for many years as,this movie does n't have a big budget it is cheap entertainment at best
1,and they were never told the truth at all,and yes you get to see a very pretty hot
1,it 's a movie as good as the first the better,it 's a shame because i do think i 'd put the
1,instead of a film where the story is about time travel from two different sources it,instead it 's just like all his other films so what are you waiting for
1,my rating a highly 7 out of 10,my favorite one star was the girl
1,compared up in this regard this one falls short in the second half,compared to a movie that has never been made before and yet does the
1,i do n't have a big grin i will not spend most of the film objectively trying to pass myself into this film but it,i like all the other comments posted about this movie and i have to mention that one of the best movies out there is
1,at an avid high school student who would seem to enjoy everything the show portrays and the show would have been better,at the onset of this film the only thing he would do the film is the head of a girl on the edge
1,cactus flower is one of the most beloved and memorable movies i 've seen and it truly,cactus ho da is my favorite horror film of all time that was until the 1980s
1,as in american films the characters are cardboard cutouts,as for me i'm not all that impressed with that
1,and what does he do to go with them,and then he becomes trapped in a dangerous relationship involving
1,at one point i thought that they had to see this,at this point in time he meets a girl named patty who
1,if it was possible to be a little less than just a bunch,if you 're not a fan of anime check out this movie
1,as it is it 's the story of the family and the people,as the movie goes on there are several laughs here and there
1,as he stands alone and tells his boss their father has been cheating,as the whole movie goes off i was looking forward to watching
1,as someone who is the only person in prison they will probably learn more about him who is,as we begin to watch you begin to see what happened to the rest of the film
1,after all the plot the characters and situations all are interesting and it 's not quite the story itself,after watching this show i was hooked as i felt like i was in for more or less as the
1,he was at the forefront of making the show,he does n't know he 's a virgin and now
1,maybe there are too many people in the cast list,maybe i was looking at my friends all i got my
1,one can only hope that a film comes as a big disappointment,one more thing the movie would have been great but the plot is
1,the story of jane 's sister who moves to paris and finding it is all that a new comer and that it 's a very beautiful movie if it ever ever appeared with the eyes in its heart,the acting is a bit stiff the acting is not good but its overall alright not everything i will say about this movie is a total waste of time it has nothing to do with the big budget movies
1,i hope people will be able to get away,i do n't want to repeat the details
1,and this is not a very typical film,and the ending is the most bizarre part of
1,he makes more believable choices from his role with,he is also his son in the movie
1,so i went with the whole movie hoping not to give this film more or less of a possible review,so much of the footage is lifted from the original which is where the first halve of the movie kicks into
1,plato is the best character in this movie and is a refreshing change from the viewer but,plato has a wonderful cast but i did n't remember anything about him in this movie
1,later after they leave the house and begins to attack them,later i could n't see it for so many reasons
1,perhaps not a film i have seen about a dozen times over a hundred days but it still is a very good,perhaps this film might be a little too slow for anyone else but the most extreme film buffs will likely recognize
1,however the movie takes place in the basement,however there also are other interesting characters
1,people do not do stupid things at the end,people who know they need to watch this movie are
1,save yourself the trouble and do n't watch this movie,save yourself a time and money and your time
1,a few hundred years later the mother who plays the same part of the,a friend is the one who has always the coolest of all men
1,the first episode was a great movie,the actors were terrible at best
1,they 've just been in hollywood the whole thing,they have been a long time since shakespeare as harry
1,as a consequence there is not a single positive thing in it besides that the story is rather simple a woman,as for the main actress and the rest of her character his character is a bit too naive and there are moments
1,indeed you just did n't care less about the characters and the action scenes,indeed with each successive time and it still helps that the rest of the cast
1,then she turns around a very rich woman,then it goes all over the place
1,for the record of the director and her son,for fans of the series its worth seeing
1,this is so bad it actually comes across as a poor,this film is so good and the acting is superb
1,the movie itself is so utterly ridiculous it has nothing to do,the rest of the action takes place in the same town
1,he even had a chance in the story to do some serious stunts about what really happened if the hero was,he does n't really look like he 's trying to get the right to be killed in the first place
1,ok so this film was a success for me,ok so it 's a classic a film which tries
1,i like the story the story and the humor,i remember it vividly but had little idea
1,the script by john payne is as bad as his next film is,the movie could have had a bit more romance with all the other characters
1,kubrick is also a director with that much credit to the subject and,kubrick is a master in disguise and his acting technique is flawless
1,the movie starts with a group of students heading through their homes the film focuses on a group of young women in search of a couple of rich students living in,the main reason why the movie was so good was the acting from the young justin and a beautiful deborah patty that i did n't expect much from the film
1,essentially a movie with a weak title like it that makes no sense or not as much as a comedy,essentially it is a film that never went beyond me because it was all so good and this was so beautiful
1,they have more than three films a few of them,they do n't make up one of the best films i
1,the story centers around the boy 's struggle,the whole thing is filmed inside the camera which
1,it does n't look a lot like the normal people in it 's ilk except a cheap cheap looking cheap monster,it 's pretty cool and it has absolutely no action scenes but its good points and i do n't want to give
1,in addition the story has potential but not good enough to save this turgid and boring movie,in my opinion the greatest is the use of the scene while the camera pans out and all
1,this could have been better made for some money,this could have only been about a couple hours but
1,pacino is an amazing choice for garbo,pacino 's the master was n't his best
1,pacino as the young inspector of an expedition on the waterfront is pretty funny,pacino is just as bad and as the title character there 's a bit of
1,bloody troopers and then a few minutes into the end,bloody violence is one great movie if you want to make
1,after a lifetime that has begun an obsession with a man a person 's struggle and the spirit of his own life this,after a few other reviews i do n't recognize his name but the real truth he 's getting is for the character
1,it 's a shame he gets involved in this project for directing,it is difficult in this case to give an oscar to the director
1,an excellent cast helps that the director is not going,an insult to the genius from beginning to end
1,if you are looking for a fun comedy this one 's not for,if you are trying to rationalize this movie you must do so
1,the movie is not all good,the ending also was as contrived as
1,i am surprised how someone who is not in the movie business could act and say something much more dangerous,i have to say that it 's a film about a man who lives life without getting a conscience because he
1,the acting was so bad that it ended me,the fact that the actors could n't act better in
1,maybe i was just a few hundred year olds who went to see this,maybe that 's why it was so boring or the other way around
1,like so many bad films i would n't recommend it to anyone who has nothing better to do,like an avalanche in this movie you do n't have to say anything like you 're right
1,what follows is the story of the woman who played sara 's mother so well as to keep her,what are the odds or that they should n't have to be a very young couple who live together and
1,all in all it 's not a great film unless,all the same actors in a very good job
1,during the movie you are reminded of how people are the first,during those years of the year 1999 we did it the other year
1,these guys should never have allowed them to be given a,these are the words for the film of the book
1,even his father who 's only an asshole with one of the few and more of the,even at the end we feel like a character should have been a much better person
1,great for a few laughs as well as anyone that likes it,great action action but also the movie had a bad ending and a
1,nevertheless the film is so incredibly bad that this film makes you lose your patience and feeling you 'll cry as if someone just lost it from your heart by making fun of the movie,nevertheless as many great gags as the characters are here it is still the best of several episodes but for a long long time time it 's just a bit more of a thriller at all
1,the only reason i kept seeing was that it took me 15 minutes so i was n't sure,the first half is full of bad acting poor acting horrible music and it 's completely laughable
1,or is it just as bad as the other two,or did the filmmakers have the same name as he did
1,every character from it in the book is very good and is also likable,every once in a while it becomes apparent that the director was trying to make
1,i had never been a part of the tribe nor was he in the family,i had to endure this film as a drama and the plot does conjure up well
1,saw it on a tv channel,saw this when it was released in
1,nobody seems to be interested in the character motivations nor the character 's,nobody is entitled and it 's a shame that they did n't get a
1,this is one of the few comedies that has been,this movie is nothing but a piece of art
1,the story could have been interesting even if it,the story is based on a true story
1,although it 's still a good film as to why it has been made even in many,although the story is not original the plot goes nowhere and i do n't know why
1,the acting is good enough that i have a feeling that someone made the mistake of taking his role,the film takes you back in time to get acquainted with the main character while it is in keeping us
1,of course the real mccoy is the head with his father,of course the only thing that really bothered me from this movie
1,this is a classic movie about how,this is n't all it matters
1,dark city is so bad that it looks like a good movie a nice place is not it and that 's,dark on the other hand is a story about a group of women at their very end of the world
1,his face as an extra is so convincing that they make a profit and,his life with all the crew is not the best he can give
1,they find they do not realize that these events are merely,they find a gold apartment filled with a vast treasure
1,a great little film that deserves to be seen or,a great show but the show is much better
1,there was a lot about the original film being able to be entertaining,there 's a good ending in it although a little contrived a bit abrupt
1,when a person gets raped by the local bully the owner comes in a bar and says what,when you put in your head where you could almost no longer know how to use it
1,it is hard to explain why the title refers to the film,it 's a story to tell all the details and characters that are
1,i had been a huge fan of all of the columbo books i,i saw this movie when i was a 12 year old child
1,so in summary this one has to be,so this is not a bad sign
1,this was probably the second attempt at realism i have ever seen,this is one that is not so bad it 's good but nothing
1,they try to create the monster 's world where,they go on but they all fall flat
1,not a film as a result but a solid and interesting film about a very dangerous subject in,not so the movie has a lot of action and it 's really a very good film
1,which means it 's something for everyone but those of,which are all we can watch in the future
1,the music and lyrics could be an improvement to this film rather than a true story,the story is set up in the first one so we can understand at least one character
1,funniest line in the movie is the death of her daughter,funniest performance by a large ensemble of actors in a very small
1,and so if you are a fan of hers and all the,and what 's so bad about the film is the script
1,but after reading the description of the film i was a little confused and disappointed,but the film goes downhill and you start with the message of the story
1,douglas fairbanks jr is always a joy to watch as he is as the title role,douglas fairbanks jr and james earl jones were so funny and i wanted to see what happened
1,and why do the makers have chosen this so called a,and then at the end she is still a prostitute
1,if you want to see what happens when you do n't care at all,if you are not a fan of the original series then stay away from this
1,but the film 's only real flaw is the way the plot develops out and then,but the plot is so boring it makes it difficult to root for a second
1,dialogue is very subtle and is quite funny in,dialogue aside it 's certainly an action picture
1,the problem child is not that much of a fan of it but it will keep you hooked thinking that in fact you cannot find a good movie like this you get it,the story is told through a couple of moments from the movie in which these characters are in danger as they are and finally there is a clear message to the viewers
1,filmmakers have created a movie that is both good and wrong,filmmakers are just ruining themselves in the film which is all that
1,the actors were very good particularly christopher lee and william,the plot is thin dull and full of holes
1,one thing that makes it fun to watch is some of the most enjoyable lines in,one is that the characters are so bad so much pain is given by them
1,so it is just a cheap looking piece of,so now this movie was not for everyone
1,the movie begins in the middle of a conversation in central park with a,the whole affair with the family is the best way to describe that
1,the only redeeming feature of this film is the cinematography of this piece of,the story line is ok but in any case it makes any sense
1,streep played her role brilliantly and was n't given much to do in her play either,streep 's acting ability is one to avoid with her eyes and not as good as the
1,the acting was bad and i could n't get more then a headache,the whole story revolves around a man who is going to assassinate the son
1,one of the best episodes ever put,one of my all time favorites
1,all the other actors should have been chosen for more of each scene in such a lame production,all the action scenes are very good you have a bunch of explosions from a train chase on the
1,i just finished reading my comment on this forum in high school and i cannot help anyone else in the movie theater,i 've never seen so many bad movies that i have seen that far away but this one is just another great
1,looking after you 've got to be the one,looking for it in the first place i did but
1,as is the case with the series i had to admit that i,as if it had been a long lost it would have done
1,it was very predictable as the whole movie ends up just getting boring and boring by the end,it reminded me of those of us i have done so yearn for its own family viewing that for
1,i have to admit the worst and the film seems,i mean i loved it better than the first
1,her performance in the film is wonderful and i recommend it,her boyfriend has one and one more thing in it
1,ok there 's the main character who is killed by a woman,ok i saw this movie and was not looking for it
1,there are lots of funny ones on the show,there are so many more stories about the story of
1,even if all the movie was set during the time the us government and the germans were not allowed to watch,even though they are all good the rest of the movie is pretty boring and has some sort of interesting flow to
1,restrictions were the director 's intent to provide us to see as one reviewer noted but you can tell that the producers,restrictions include dr van devere the only real human being i can recall and she said i like her every year
1,with a low budget the same could be said for the director,with all of his fans and his work that is the movie he
1,i think you can see this movie without spoiling all their problems,i am currently waiting for another sequel to that the series but it
1,the story is very slow and uninteresting and the ending is boring,the characters are n't interesting either as he is in the book too
1,mrs and his friends make fun of men,mrs jones plays her friend who tries to do
1,the problem is the screenplay is pretty terrible in itself and i,the first two thirds of the movie are not even good
1,fairly few of us have met the plot line but if you watch the film closely in the first,fairly the scene where the young man is supposed to kill the girl of the car is laughable
1,this episode is a big let down and i wish i could say that if i was watching the series i was n't paying attention to,this was a very disappointing attempt to pad out the entire film the sort of person that makes absolutely no redeeming qualities in the genre
1,in fact that i would have given him a little more screen time and the fact that he is only his own and the rest is just an,in spite of the fact that the movie was on tv it looked as though it was shot in a local warehouse in front of a camera
1,celebrities and villains are all too busy and are too few,celebrities are supposed to be a little unfair as are all of
1,most of the time it takes place in a small house with the young people who had a very successful budget in the middle of the picture,most of us feel this way while he has a great voice as he goes crazy and it can turn out who the hell is going to be
1,it 's no doubt that any of these guys can survive a couple of times,it 's not even that hard when you get a bunch of actors to make a
1,meanwhile one of the two main characters played by eric stoltz is called to make up her,meanwhile a killer whale in the building and runs through the woods to collect the virus
1,how can people make a difference with this movie,how the hell are our heroes and the men who
1,was he trying to make it to,was her real love to her
1,if you 're a big fan of the franchise and enjoy the film and find the,if you 're looking for a good movie about life 's implausibilities watch this movie
1,poolhall and bess is not all that bad,poolhall junkies is the worst movie ever
1,although i was on the edge of my seat and my girlfriend said i was in,although the characters are n't too onedimensional or even interesting their personalities are well developed
1,the performances are generally excellent particularly the one you find yourself comparing it to the film which was a great deal of,the cast is fantastic especially stuart the boy with a heart of gold who brings out the best of her mother
1,the last hour of this picture is a joy to watch and it just keeps the atmosphere moving,the movie is an action movie in which a hero a guy gets killed and killed by a man
1,the script was weak it 's just plain silly and the writing is horrible,the film is quite a surprise but there 's plenty of nudity and nudity
1,in the end the ending comes as a surprise,in the end it 's hard to say
1,the ending is just another bad thing a bit of a spoiler you have to be very wrong now,the film is filled with action and the end of some suspense film is very powerful as well
1,she gets married and goes on a killing spree but it 's a bit more of a shame,she has the most unconvincing role ever but i thought the movie did n't need to be made
1,while the film does n't have the feel of the first two parts of the series the storyline seems,while she 's not one of them she 's the one with the most memorable of the movie
1,because it does n't have a plot or,because it works well with the story
1,the result is an insult to humanity,the characters are also played by a group
1,there 's really not much to recommend this except for just to watch it again,there is a scene in the middle when harry goes down the road and goes down
1,i guess when i said i ca n't possibly make up a film this really is,i guess i'm not a big fan of bmovies or movies at least it is
1,this is the way to live in that context,this movie is a mustsee for fans of horror movies
1,and there is so much truth about the subject at times that it is like listening to an,and what i did even like was the part of the woman who was on the show
1,in the case i think the film will just,in any case the acting is very amateurish
1,it has been said by maltin 's point that we all have a,it was a real shame that all the characters were n't developed
1,from the cover of this film at the bottom of your lungs it will take a pretty good one to take your patience,from the first scene i was bored to tears by an extremely tedious experience the movie does n't even manage to hold any suspense
1,suffice to say i could go on for,suffice to say that it was great
1,very good action thriller from the late seventies and this ranks up there,very similar to how the plot itself can have a certain charm
1,i'm very sure that even though i will still love the,i'm amazed that i could n't sleep in that department
1,i have to admit i did not think much of the movie,i could see the director and producers to be able to get more
1,elvira as the main villain does get old and pretty damn young,elvira is so cute it becomes the equivalent of these characters
1,im a lifelong fan of any of,im giving my most honest view
1,i guess i wanted to like it,i remember that he has been in other
1,of course the ending is somewhat unsatisfying and not even the end of an ending leaves you with a feeling you could n't tell,of course i do n't think the appeal of this movie is how not to make a perfect hollywood film but the script must be
1,the special effects were bad looking,the acting ranges from good to excellent
1,in short i think the movie 's producers must have made them less,in other words some of the movies have been very well done
1,the only scene in which she looks like a woman with a crush on the guy who is n't so much,the rest of the performances are all a bunch of characters that do n't seem to care about the characters
1,the performances by john ritter and stephen rea were,the actors were n't bad either as well
1,bottom line is that for more than 8 years it would deserve 9,bottom line on this site is that this is an excellent movie
1,you can see it in an hour and 20 months of screen time,you 'd swear that with the script they 're in trouble with each and
1,it 's a shame that these are n't at the helm 's best to make any attempt for a,it is so much fun if you 're the kind of person who ca n't appreciate any movie
1,the result is a movie which should probably have been made,the first was that the camera made some mistakes with the movie
1,disgusting and depressing is something i wo n't forget i am not sure when i need to go out and see it again,disgusting i mean i just love the soundtrack is awful enough to give a score of 10 i give this movie a 2 out
1,robin williams is the highlight of this film,robin williams plays an equally unlikeable character who ca
1,the whole film is in a way boring boring predictable but i suppose it makes them just like,the ending i do n't remember anything from the movie i was excited to see what happened
1,he and his friends play this kind of,he really does n't care about it
1,the story follows around three weeks from the prison but the one with the most important event 's life is one of the most beautiful people around and not too long a very,the movie is worth watching as a bonus of that film and a wonderful film i think many people are talking about how it 's supposed to be on the scifi channel
1,well i had to take it as i was,well i loved every minute of this film
1,this film did n't have a budget,this movie is so bad it 's funny
1,from those who think a lot of the people do,from the very beginning it 's a bad movie
1,but no we are left with the distinct ending as the film progresses,but i did n't expect it to be so bad so it was really
1,only problem with harry is that he makes her famous character and then makes him a,only for anyone who 's a fan of a good action movie for this movie
1,i 'll tell you how i think it must happen within the first 15 minutes,i just love it and i love that it keeps the momentum and style of it
1,virginia mayo is the best actor of the bunch,virginia devgan has been a very minor actress but is
1,vera was on her way home from the law and now i'm sorry but i never get,vera is a very good choice for her role although i ca n't remember her performance
1,the story is great and the characters are all well developed,the other cast members will give such a perfect performance you 'll
1,one of the funniest moments of dialogue,one of the best movies to come out
1,beverly hills cop does n't have good acting like the first part,beverly d'angelo plays a beautiful sexy woman to whom the title does n't
1,please do not waste your time or,please do n't watch the movie
1,but as it turns out she 's a jerk,but the first thing you will say about this and
1,wtf on an attempt at making a sequel and being released from the united states is simply a waste place a bad title,wtf is what happened to me and i found the characters very believable and very real i kept thinking why they had left that
1,is n't that a bad thing if the people who,is a very interesting film for its own sake
1,his mother and father also get married by,his wife is dead but never happens
1,a movie that leaves you feeling sad and angry sad sad sad and sad yet still very sad and uplifting,a good mix of what we 've seen in a film adaptation of trainspotting and which is n't a sequel
1,dear i love you that 's for one minute or so,dear lord of the rings tells the story of a man from
1,you might have your taste for this movie,you may expect a strong drama but is not
1,chief jack frost is a bad bad thing,chief and wife find themselves unable to communicate through
1,cray is a good actor but it makes this to a movie that seems to be on autopilot,cray was an incredibly good character who played the bad guy with his snide wit and the acting was
1,rarely ever has a loved film elvis' life even in the,rarely has to deal with the characters in this story
1,wow the fact that the action is almost,wow that said in terms of cinematography
1,so now we are n't going to lose everything but you can get a little bored,so i ca n't understand how it 's the way i have it is so far from
1,hogan as the cop who is being bitten,hogan is the worst in the business
1,he does what he could with the film 's story but never has any interest,he was also the star of the film and in the first sequel the second part
1,and you can watch the movie again but even if you 're just bored you 'll find the meaning,and the ending is so bad you may wonder what the director was thinking when he wrote these scenes
1,this is one of the best horror films of the past decade,this movie is a must see for anyone interested in the work of
1,but here the characters are so flat they seem to have a problem they are just waiting for something,but the fact that it 's very funny to watch in a few weeks is definitely not good
1,the last 20 minutes of the movie are actually just too,the acting is terrible but the performances are all excellent
1,everyone involved and in a movie about a bunch of guys just stand and talk,everyone in the movie is the definition of the main character that is trying to get
1,the film has a very very deep message about it,the acting and directing in this movie is really bad as
1,for the most part i did enjoy that one so much,for some reason a film made at the end was a failure
1,and it is n't as good as the book,and what really makes the other is that they keep
1,the film is so bad it 's good,the rest of the film has many faults
1,i was hoping he 'd get out of hand of his car,i 've heard many many people i 've mentioned so many people have
1,the plot is a bit corny with only a handful of characters who has never done or even come,the end of suburbia is one of the most intriguing movies i 've seen in a long time
1,i watched this movie when it was released and i was not so impressed,i have seen a lot of great films that have always been filmed in england
1,from the point of view of a child who is in love with the person who is not as beautiful as he is,from the screen there is a strong performance by richard gere as mr collins a disillusioned middleaged man who finds a more sinister ways
1,embarrassingly scripted and directed by mark lester the film is uneven and,embarrassingly boring uninvolving predictable and boring with dull writing and acting
1,paul is one of the worst and most talented actors in film history,paul rudd should have asked more of his career for the future
1,the film is a mixture of many of the very personal films of the past decade,the plot has its ups and downs with a number of characters of the show with the
1,we must assume that a group of girls who just want to be good actors were n't in it one,we should take more notice in the movie as a movie that gives us multiple flashbacks on a train
1,it 's the kind of movie that has something for people with the audacity to give it to the masses and make it out to be at the top of our list,it looks like it 's made of a low budget film with a cast of amateurs who have never done the job and the cinematographer of one of the most original directors of
1,i remember laughing in this movie,i had to watch this over and
1,he 's supposed to be the killer,he plays the title role of a wealthy
1,horrible awful and not much on the film it does n't help matters i do,horrible acting bad dialog the ending is predictable and there 's a bad ending
1,it 's the same guy that you think your friends are but it 's also,it 's not a good idea as that has been made from this movie
1,it 's not about the evils of life 's loss of,it 's not funny not even in a bad way
1,do yourself a favor do n't buy this movie,do you think this film is going to be so
1,everyone in town is just as confused and tired as when they,everyone should see it and find it on a rainy night
1,in this role the young lady is a real actress,in an interview of a man he is shown in a
1,what a great film if it does n't make sense to those of us who have n't seen the new versions of the story the series is so much better if you liked the first film and this,what i remember about this film was that the film is based on the life of a friend who has made him a compulsive murder which involves the son who is killed by his mother and son
1,other than that there 's very little dialogue and this is one of his best performances in his career,other than that i would n't say it 's good entertainment but it certainly has one of the most original
1,howard 's character is so bland that even she can only draw herself,howard yam 's acting is a bit too stiff and the acting
1,it really takes us away from the movie and it still,it 's a wonderful film and is worth the wait
1,but it was still good the acting and,but i digress so it is n't
1,nowadays it 's one of the best animated films,nowadays the plot would seem that was it
1,the film 's message is revealed in the first act at that point which is,the movie is a comedy and it 's not that easy to be bored
1,robin is a real person because we can identify with the two old men in this movie,robin williams is a wonderful actor and i could tell he 's right the same actors
1,when he confronts a new orleans reporter she realizes that he 's a werewolf and a womanizer is going to get a little deeper as she has been sleeping with her husband,when the first one has a bit more action and a more serious feeling of realism it 's not that this was a little more action drama and that one really did n't
1,audio has its charm but it does n't,audio is as good as the actors
1,the whole film is predictable and not much fun at all,the movie is really bad but they are all a couple of
1,films like this are also the ones that should give a 10 to me,films like this are not the best films in my list but this one is
1,it is an interesting film that would be a,it 's not as compelling as the first
1,one thing that should definitely please people in the making home to watch this,one of the finest films i have seen in history in recent years
1,no more no character development at all no more of a,no it is about an airplane that comes to earth
1,the only flaw for me is the soundtrack,the acting as well as the film 's quality
1,it 's not funny it 's really bad and the whole plot just sucks,it 's obvious that this film would be a much better experience by the screenwriter
1,from there the action takes place inside the house of a local farmer,from the point of view of the killer was one of the most powerful
1,you 're watching a movie with a good deal of good acting,you might also notice that the story was a bit convoluted
1,another film that i loved it a little while my wife had only the slightest attention to a fan,another film i had seen where this movie was released theatrically on broadway for a very long time
1,even if you 're not familiar with it i doubt you 'll probably end up renting this,even the special effects are done very amateurish and not convincing as the camera was made
1,chris gardner would have been proud of that,chris a widower in hollywood is a former lawyer
1,actually there was a scene in particular that would have been left in one of the most important pieces of information to see a scene in,actually you think it is a great film to watch only if you 're a mormon or have an opinion of the history of war
1,the only reason to watch this movie is that the first time you get into the,the movie just lacks the punch and depth the filmmakers feel in the first place
1,typically it is just that the movie is made up of the actors in an attempt to be serious,typically the only good thing about it is that it has a decent script and does n't follow either because
1,first off i hate movies to give credit to all involved as much as they are,first of all the movie itself is more than a little shallow and i ca n't help
1,it seems to me all the writers wanted to make an ending it has been made and replaced by the story holes,it 's not the usual hollywood that was in this movie and the way it was shot in the most beautiful locations
1,our hero the main character and his son 's are a rather shallow and irresponsible woman who thinks she is a black woman,our main protagonist and his friends both have no charisma in the relationship the director 's film takes over and over it all is
1,i'm a fan of the comic book and,i'm in your dvd collection of 37
1,hard working in the usa of the 1930s,hard boiled is not the best movie ever made
1,the ending is so stupid when you get to know the,the main character is not the best actress she could
1,it is a movie that i think it 's one of the best movies ever made,it will not only remind you how to make a movie not so stupid i feel obliged
1,it 's like i said the acting was ok in this movie but it 's a bad movie,it is a true story of a young boy who goes into an old family from france to a
1,it 's really good to see a movie and there,it has the feel of a high school play
1,it 's as good as the truth,it 's the real deal of the story
1,if there is a possibility for you to come through this movie it 's for your self,if you 're not a fan of the first one you 'll need to skip this one
1,i know all he writes is the worst,i have no idea the real killer
1,this story of the kelly gang' was not a,this is a movie made by bollywood studio
1,maybe it 's not the fault of this film but i have to say i have seen other people 's movies,maybe it 's meant as a serious drama but it does n't come close to the quality of the original
1,whether the script is not so good its not it seems more real than the film itself and i think it is n't as good on dvd as it is,whether or not the two were really a good idea to make you feel sorry for the main characters when it came to them and the ending did n't work together
1,i'm gonna say that the best movie to date for me,i'm not the least bit surprised that there 's a reason for
1,after spending all the rest of the movie trying to figure out why the father of the slain kid was attracted to her,after seeing it i would highly urge and not a movie which would have made sense the time spent with this film
1,it does make it a real treat to watch,it is a fine family film for children
1,i am afraid that it 's probably something akin to the movie the most extreme and,i think it was intended to be a spoof to the genre and it shows
1,how did we get a movie,how the hell does anyone know whether
1,it 's not even a b remake of the twilight zone 's,it 's a movie about love in the world of adversity
1,by now i 've already seen all of the movies,by comparison me with this film is a little more about
1,i could tell when watching this film was very boring,i can safely say that it ranks among the best documentaries
1,final rating saturday night fever friday night friday night friday morning,final verdict do n't waste your money on this movie
1,those familiar with their days may have been very upset with this,those two people who just do n't have any redeeming quality
1,you see a movie depicting the human consciousness,you really do n't find anything but a simple
1,i would strongly recommend anyone to watch this film unless you love the same sort of thing,i have not seen anything that is better than what i usually found that it was n't going
1,it is a nice flick but one that does not require the power to get a bit of the,it is interesting to say that i love to say one of the best movies of them all
1,life is on the verge about the time you,life is full of problems in the past
1,noroi does not deliver in his face but it 's a shame that his role is not only a comedy but,noroi has the feel of a bad movie but not for the right way in terms of action and suspense
1,mr wilson also appears in an interview that is probably the highlight of,mr beetle was born to play the lead to this great role
1,often even if it seemed a little long in the extreme it was probably the best film ever filmed in the big screen,often it seems that the producers have done something in this movie to get us to empathise with the situation rather than the typical
1,it 's definitely a film that is worth seeking out,it 's pretty nice to see one of the most impressive
1,this was a waste of time and money,this is a good idea that should be avoided
1,sad that we have a few scenes that is n't good enough for a movie to,sad but in the end both the story and the acting performances are really good
1,this is one of the best of all time,this movie is absolutely hilarious and i'm a huge fan
1,it 's also a wonderful idea for a documentary but in reality it is the opposite that makes it all that,it would be much better if the actors of the script were involved in this story and that 's what they should
1,after years of making the show i saw the,after her mother dies he is left alone
1,she also had a very small role as a woman,she is so bad you could n't even go
1,powell gives such an energetic performance that he,powell 's character was so poorly developed
1,normally the director is the most interesting film in history,normally i think of the acting style and the directing it
1,asoka is one of the most underappreciated actors in the movie but the actor 's name is just above average,asoka and his men are the only two reasons for making each thing worth seeing and so i gave them a
1,the last half hour of this movie just does n't do that,the acting is wooden to say the least with the exception of a
1,for example that they made a big joke about it and i thought the show was in the,for all the hype i have seen this movie 's first half hour is an excellent hour
1,in addition the film is full of suspense and,in my mind this show is just fantastic
1,mancuso 's performance is a fine piece of the story,mancuso 's character should be the only one of the two
1,what i like so much about the film is its message is that it is a,what a complete insult to any audience i 'd choose to give me a chance
1,of course this is a must watch,of course the fact that she is a
1,why is it called that they had to,why was a bit of a stretch
1,i give this episode 2 star rating,i saw this movie on the sundance film
1,unfortunately the movie 's only redeeming feature was that it was,unfortunately these are just films too bad to be funny
1,i was a small fan of the tv,i was very disappointed at this ending
1,the two male leads were well in it,the scene of the child in the hall of
1,just because you do n't have to be a big fan of hers because you have a,just the story about a mysterious man who tries to convince us that nothing will surprise
1,it is not a film to have the chance to entertain people in,it 's really not to be taken seriously by an underwritten cast
1,the scene with the kids was a good thing,the script and acting were terrible and the characters were
1,the actors are excellent but not the real thing,the movie revolves around a very young woman who had
1,even though the acting was worse than the main,even though of course that 's pretty accurate
1,give away the plot the book becomes too convoluted and you 're not aware of that,give a good deal of bad taste in the end and you can do that
1,for a first timer i am so shocked i could find anything to write to watch,for a good performance by anthony hopkins and a good looking performance by david gale
1,not to mention that the movie is a comedy,not many of his movies ever go and find some
1,with an interesting idea they could have had better written better plots,with the help of an astronaut who 's been sent to some prison
1,i was quite angry at a movie like,i will buy a copy of it
1,there is so much violence in it to sustain the audience 's emotions even in a sense where it makes sense of the fact,there are some memorable scenes which i did like and all i think a bit too sweet and the climax of the film where the
1,they have a new and fresh family and the same characters as always,they both deserve a different breed but they do n't make sense
1,edwards does not go with the other films it presents here though,edwards is a pretty poor guy on the phone and is a really
1,so we start the picture as a group of friends and girls have decided to rob a bank robbery,so it 's hard to imagine that some people will say that this is n't a good movie but i
1,a must see for any serious comedy fan a bit of fun and a chuckle at the,a really good movie is just about the type of character who makes a great movie
1,of course the filmmakers have decided to move it off but the story makes it more,of course its a great movie with its message it 's a really funny movie
1,war films are not always for sale,war movies will not disappoint you
1,ostensibly this movie does not look much like any other work,ostensibly the man with his eye on a piece of paper
1,when it comes to being filmed in the context of the most bizarre films of all time the movie relies heavily on cheap slapstick and crude jokes,when i saw this film on the shelves and then all my eyes were fixed it is about two separate reasons it 's not that i have ever
1,if that 's your idea of the word that your hero 's dad has not in this,if you are an orthodox viewer of japanese comedy you need a good deal of attention
1,fontaine should try to avoid this one because she is the one,fontaine was great in this kind of film in several ways
1,the film goes on for one reason and one has to be very well judged as a movie in a very bad,the film 's cast also has a strong storyline although it is a little bit on the back side of that
1,why has any one redeeming and if even a female who is n't on the show is the most,why do we watch all three movies because this one is one of the worst and most predictable
1,between two extremes the scene with the old man is a joke to all that,between the two detectives and it 's hard to find a way to get this thing
1,the other side of the pond is that the movie,the acting is superb and the direction is excellent
1,it was an obvious choice for this movie to be made in a relatively simple hollywood,it 's a shame because it 's not worth the 3 i paid for it
1,the whole movie ends up in no way that the characters really are likable or funny or anything,the scene where the two roommates sit in their seats and have sex with each other a guy being
1,i'm really upset because of this film,i'm glad that i had been able to
1,it 's the best movie i 've seen,it 's a complete waste of time
1,it was a complete lack of talent,it is a lot less than the sum
1,most of the other actors have nothing to distinguish anyone they 're all very good at their roles,most of the songs are either sung nor performed by the sounds of the song of a symphony or
1,i will give anyone the reason that the movie was,i love to say a lot about the story
1,the actors are all great and the script is very good too,the director has some funny sequences a cute touch by the great wallach
1,furthermore this is not the movie to come from a very very bad movie this is a complete mess and then again maybe it was just a movie and a bunch of amateurs,furthermore these young boys of the town seem to have a secret affair with all those involved in the accident but the way they 're executed are priceless and there 's more to choose
1,she 's a little too old her age is just an annoying,she then decides to get him into the big residence and soon falls
1,i give this movie a three out of ten,i will watch you say oh my god it just
1,the characters are good as in most of the other,the acting is n't bad it makes no sense
1,chase has done so well in its own,chase was a very low budget bmovie
1,i know it is probably in that statement it should n't,i do n't think i 've ever seen a sequel
1,instead we get the typical dumb looking guy who has to,instead they are either very poorly constructed or poorly done
1,orville 's friends with the most disgusting of all,orville 's eyes will be an uphill test for improvement
1,his character is really quite creepy,his voice looks very natural and is
1,his family shows up in the middle of nowhere in prison and he decides that things do not work well or get arrested,his first movie in this film was his first but when the movie started i could n't stop thinking about the film because you
1,you will have to see this,you are the only one who could
1,there are a lot more problems to explore for the next generation and their lives are,there have been many movies that have been so successful and so easy to enjoy
1,this movie is a real waste of time,this movie however has something to say
1,bad movie and a waste of time and money,bad film like i was in the theater where the
1,young and simple i love most comedies,young actors who make very few movies seem
1,it 's a movie that has many faults and a great soundtrack in the,it was not scary in that sense and it certainly was n't there
1,in the original version of this movie the movie had me wondering what the actors would really like about it,in the end though i can find more about that than about a little bit of the events that occur in
1,my grade f where i come from and you can see the,my friends and i decided to buy it but was n't
1,when he 's a kid we see and then he dies at the end,when i saw the pilot tonight on film television for a few minutes that was
1,i loved all the characters so much,i would n't buy my ticket when i
1,it 's the kind of movie where the majority of the scenes are,it would n't hold that honor a single note in the series
1,i saw the first episode and this one did not,i do n't care how this character is not a fat
1,lambert was in no more of a good role in this movie but it certainly made him a great actor,lambert as it is was more annoying in his life but this one is for the most part quite entertaining
1,plus there 's plenty of funny scenes going on and like when a movie is shot a little better the actors and,plus you feel like you 've done yourselves research for the last 90 minutes or so and so is n't sure
1,i 've seen a lot of bad movies,i 'd recommend this film to anyone
1,part of it is that the characters just feel like a normal man with a heart attack,part of a larger question is that these kids are more often than not and to put him
1,if you do n't appreciate the music it will be worth watching,if the actors were involved with a story as good as the original
1,so i had a chance to see this film when i was,so if youre not acquainted with it you should do this
1,oh and if i could get a hold of what i had heard a lot of that happened i could have had a good time,oh well the film is a little bit short of course but the whole thing is in good form to make it all worth
1,so when you do n't have to be in the mood to play it right,so that said it was quite a surprise to watch a movie about it for a
1,however there is an impressive performance by james stewart as the villain who has no qualms that this is his first day after the big hit,however as i said before this film has some parts that may have been used and for a major amount but not many films make me wonder
1,when this film was made a year later i had to watch it to see,when i was young i was very surprised when i looked at this film
1,for the most part the cast is fantastic,for one that shows what the movie was about
1,however the film is still too dull to be,however the two stars are pretty good too
1,i ca n't believe how the producer got to the point where he,i saw this movie at the boston international film festival in nyc
1,in the end the series focuses on the character of the son who 's been conned as,in this case you get more of this from the two towers in the same room
1,recommended to you to see how a man could get a good,recommended a movie without resorting to many things on the subject
1,and there is no real reason for that to go through the use of a scene and scenes of her past with the same scene where the girl and his mistress are going through the same woman,and then the film goes along and the two become the very first few and then decide the whole things and the end result is that all three characters seem to be very different personalities and this is
1,and then back to the show the great guys,and the main storyline is a little contrived
1,incidentally the only problem is that the first and only is a bit boring,incidentally on the other hand the film has some kind of good acting and there
1,i know the original has been said,i ca n't even remember that much of
1,years of my childhood memories i watched this movie and have been surprised it has,years later it is only on the run for people to think about it
1,the only real downer they could 've made about this movie was the score but all,the first one was about a mysterious woman who just happens to be a witch
1,at least they did not have a script with such a bad name it 's a shame,at first visconti is particularly memorable from his perspective and i hope they do n't come out in
1,side the way he plays by the end of the movie it feels very true and we root for him,side as much as that 's the point i got and all the acting was perfect for many reasons
1,i 'd advise anyone to watch this movie and just enjoy it,i found a movie that was funny i cried when the end credits
1,let me preface for the positive reviews but the fact that this is a true story of some,let me break down the rest of the cast what was the point of filming this film
1,how does this fit into a film in a way that,how on earth can this movie say anything about it
1,the most disappointing scene is when they find the body parts of the water 's the giant birds with little eyes,the only thing i can say that if you 're looking for a good western i suppose i would have a soft
1,valerie linney is excellent as the young woman at some points the script is great and the director is,valerie perrine plays a wealthy and overbearing young man who befriends with her boyfriend and has become friends
1,phantom of the opera is a movie worth seeing,phantom of the opera was a bad movie
1,anyway there 's a reason the film,anyway what about the special effects
1,to make matters worse you get a glimpse of,to my surprise this movie was a joke
1,for a film with similar actors to be a movie with all the great actors but it will help the story of the man and the dog to end some very bad things,for a second thought about it at least i 'll put the two together to get a little compensation of the story and get the original story so i guess that 's why i
1,the acting is excellent but the story is a joke,the film starts by using a young teenager to solve the
1,a film to be a good example of how the movie industry could go without the great depression and the result,a lot is my suggestion to see how people would like the movie and you know it will not be a good
1,however you are likely to agree on the obvious amount of this is a real stinker,however his love life the real world of our dreams is a common sense of betrayal
1,this movie should have been as a perfect one,this was a very good movie to watch
1,while he was being chased out of jail by an army of thugs in a building against the mob government officials are being chased in one way by his enemies,while i think the premise in a movie is not very interesting and some aspects of this show are totally unbelievable you would think that it was more difficult to make
1,sex and violence are not necessarily the,sex and violence in the plot
1,but that was not to say that the story was n't as good as that of the one i was used by,but they are so funny to laugh at it 's that you do n't get to see them fall completely flat
1,she has nothing else to do but this film is more than just a vehicle for her talents she 's still,she 's so much as a girl that the girl ca n't help but love her but who she was
1,while the show seemed more than a little too tame it was still,while the film is a bad film it is very well done
1,they go to their apartment and they ca n't be bothered to pay a debt and they get involved in a heist,they should also say that in the case of the devil that was killed the movie could be considered a classic
1,how does they do such a thing,how could you possibly go through the events
1,after all these years we learn to understand this fact that it is n't going to be,after the first 15 minutes of the movie all the characters are supposed to be funny
1,the ending is too predictable and for,the actors seem completely stupid too
1,some say what the movie is about the subject matter is there no plot and the cast,some of the scenes were so poorly done they almost did n't even make me chuckle
1,and of course you 'd want to see,and that 's all it really does
1,well i guess i do n't give it a good amount of,well it was a really poor attempt at something really funny
1,the story line is weak and just barely manages to keep the flow of the action at first gear,the director does not tell us where it 's really bad but i could not make his films out of
1,they have a good chemistry between her,they do a lot of drugs
1,it 's one thing to say how this film 's story is presented,it is about a young woman and her being able to fend to save
1,this was the first movie that i saw this year 's,this movie made me a little disappointed in the film
1,just a movie that would get people talking at the end of his,just so i ca n't really be a fan of this movie
1,nothing more to the effect than to the plot itself,nothing could spoil the plot if it was written in the
1,if you do n't care about this movie you should probably have a very,if there was some action going on in there are all of them
1,some of them may not get that far,some moments of comedy and drama make the series
1,what was really interesting was that he did n't play a woman,what if you 're looking for a better movie than this
1,this is just a silly mess,this kind of movie is a lot
1,i liked the soundtrack as well,i was in a state of shock
1,asoka a man who was in fact a friend was,asoka is the best a martyr to the history
1,the acting is a bit amateurish compared to the excellent one liners or the story,the only thing worth mentioning of this movie was the score by the entire crew
1,most of all the film does not flow well at,most of the time i was watching a documentary
1,there 's not so much wrong with that one,there are only three and a half dozen and many
1,it was interesting i think the movie is a good thing,it 's a very enjoyable film that keeps its welcome
1,i liked this movie a lot so that i can read what,i could n't tell what exactly it was going to say
1,wellreceived and produced by the same film is the,wellreceived by the critics who made it big
1,the film was actually just too long too short,the film goes on and on and on until the
1,i did find it extremely funny and it would n't have it in the end and would recommend a,i thought it would have gotten better the characters were better and the script was the real culprit
1,do yourself a favour and avoid it,do n't waste 90 minutes or a paragraph
1,did n't she leave that to the old school,did i mention the movie 's plot summary of a
1,although there was no shortage of sex in the film there 's a real connection,although i think the film is primarily aimed at children i would love it
1,the two women are really good,the movie is a little confusing but
1,at least a good one had to stay the course after hitting a few off violently from them into a film,at my knowledge this movie has a somewhat more interesting and dramatic feel to it than that would have been but somehow
1,or are it all necessary to keep the kids on the,or not even in an age where nothing is happening
1,because after some months we get to see a bunch of characters wander,because one cannot wait for the return of to see another movie
1,the story is not that big either in terms of style and the,the film has its moments however this is not a horror movie
1,it has a certain point where it is often,it was a waste of time and money
1,for the first 40 minutes i was n't going to go,for the first time is that the show was a bit longer
1,played with the most energetic character by the first film you 'll love her work,played by richard benjamin it combines a great story with a lot of humor and a
1,oh and a real shame to see all other shows,oh the other people who did n't like it
1,i watched the film primarily because i'm bored to the point of seeing a tv movie,i did enjoy several parts especially when the two divers got knocked off for food
1,sometimes i get the impression that this movie is made for a low budget but for those who can make up the difference in the first half of it,sometimes this happens to our two friends the first time a lot of the movie shows the difference between the two and how they will end the movie that really
1,both the stories themselves and the plot,both of these stories are so much more
1,in many ways this show is the perfect capper,in my opinion the funniest part is how they are
1,he would like to play an american,he is a master of his own life
1,easy boiled was a complete waste of time,easy is to assume there should be no story
1,there is some very beautiful scenery,there is no way that she can
1,funny stuff on a saturday night,funny characters good acting and some good
1,that 's a shame because it did n't have any of the elements of a story and a weak,that 's just a tip off for the film because the plot is so predictable it 's painful
1,i have n't given that rating 10,i thought the storyline was interesting
1,much so that was n't funny it was a fun flick and it would n't be made as many a movie about people as,much like it takes the first 30 minutes to solve it 's an exciting plot twist that gets a few minutes of enjoyment
1,i think even one character in the film had no redeeming feelings whatsoever or was there,i think i should even get to see that he looks menacing and his character is very
1,sinatra 's role as the president 's wife and son and ryan 's partner are certainly not at all believable,sinatra as a police inspector and a police officer in his first novel who played a great role in the american
1,these actors did the same thing but not me,these guys did have the right idea on the back
1,i can see this film as the only person who will see it that i liked this one,i will be waiting someday for a good film to read the book for the first time or to
1,i thought it was the funniest movie i have ever heard i 've seen but also what i 've probably seen in the film is pretty damn close,i would agree with the other posters it 's a true story that holds no interest or cleverness but is so entertaining and its message at least to the
1,the film is a bit too depressing for words and the characters,the film is full of clichs and the acting is bad
1,the ending is so bad that it becomes funny or is happening in an hour,the other members of the family have a strange conversation with a guy when they were
1,other than that the film is pretty good and i enjoyed the performances by the,other than that there is a little of a story to be entertained for
1,funny and disturbing as is the plot a group of high school kids decide to,funny thing about a movie that is n't good because it is too funny
1,the film also has a lot of,the film is also pretty gory
1,i was n't looking for a movie with good actors in it but,i just ca n't believe they would make such a boring movie
1,the special effects come off as a bad ripoff,the actors in this movie were very funny
1,there 's nothing new in the plot it just makes you wanna care,there 's a great sense of fun which can have some entertainment value and
1,i 've seen better acting in supporting roles and i suspect that with less than a few laughs i really do n't care how this comedy got the 94 million rating,i would not take it as a real horror film as i 've never seen a movie that has a dull plot line but in some ways it is not one of
1,even though he was n't a good actor he was the greatest,even though it is a bad film it 's pretty good
1,saw this movie and it was still pretty good,saw this at the 2005 film festival in london on
1,if you have read the book the story has been told about the events in the book and it,if you have a masochistic interest in seeing these two movies you 'll most likely enjoy it immensely
1,unlike the other movies it was almost impossible to distinguish the experience,unlike the original i had a lot of other things about it apart
1,ruth and emma fall in love with,ruth is not a great actress
1,his parents are not really his parents,his only real problem with this film is
1,the only thing this film has going for it is the cinematography and the characters,the movie is so boring you can feel the pain as if nothing happens
1,neither of these characters are anything but funny,neither can you be really happy to watch so
1,no matter the story of the film it follows the characters at,no wonder she agreed to go after herself to marry her
1,i 've always thought that he is very talented and is just not funny,i do n't think i will ever know anything about anything yet and there are
1,overall the film does have a few,overall i really enjoy the movie
1,that alone is n't one of their problems,that is the question why the movie is so
1,also it seems a little too easy to make a movie about people,also when she is n't a very talented actress or a woman it 's
1,all the actors and actresses are ok the actors are real bad in their,all in all but the ending is one of the worst things ever
1,the film also includes the beautiful loretta young as a female cop who is,the other main problem with this movie is its lack of acting ability
1,but the story of the son and his family seems to be in the end of the film and ends up the ending,but as the film continues to focus on the story the characters are constantly drawn from the perspective and their motivation for themselves is
1,and yes she 's just plain awful with her acting and she looks good at some points,and the idea and the way we deal with them so different than in one of their most
1,begin an excellent career for the big screen at the last minute,begin it all together but then a man and his friends have to
1,also the scenes in the first movie were really quite shocking and that 's what all the kids are about,also as a person i was not interested in hearing me about it as a kid i found it very entertaining
1,there 's an extended version of the real estate building of which the movie is trying to make fun of but it was not,there are moments and situations of the world that should be lost in the plot but it seems to me that they do n't want
1,as an american i am a huge fan of italian cinema,as usual as a film is meant to be a cult classic
1,there is no attempt to find a,there are also some hilarious scenes
1,seasonal fright 2 is one of many movies that you would like to see in an eternity or even better of today,seasonal 's in a very strange tone of the day the film 's production is in contrast from the first one
1,it 's a film where the viewer is introduced to the characters and the characters are not that likable,it has a number of creepy images so the fact that it was made as a thriller set on the
1,this was really one of his most enjoyable and,this guy does n't have a funny bone
1,unlike other reviewers the movie was shot in a very small town where the people were shot or killed and,unlike in the previous movie they 're a very good man who had a real life with his family
1,however after watching this i am amazed,however i will go to this film to
1,i ca n't imagine anyone involved in this movie,i 've only seen the film briefly on dvd
1,even then you could tell the difference between a tv and a movie was never better than this movie and even,even though the movie is a bit preachy it has some moments going on with just how boring it was
1,casting is outstanding the only saving grace to the movie is the cinematography,casting and i liked this film more than any other film i have ever
1,the performances are brilliant though the movie does n't really convey the impact of a character in the character 's motivation,the best parts of this film include a sequence where a woman is lying in a bed and her face is washing
1,sure even it 's a bit schmaltzy but not bad,sure the action sequences are good but the direction was awful
1,it 's really a really good film,it is a very sad film about a
1,i'm sure he 'd rather go with the two,i'm surprised that she is n't as good
1,and with the first movie to be the whole movie that was,and yet we had this movie and it never came good
1,i saw this movie at its local premiere,i just saw this film and i could n't
1,the whole premise was about the mother of a man who lives happily and has been forced to leave her,the acting is all bad the dialog is stupid the acting is worse than expected for a lowbudget movie
1,though it is n't a great film the movie is a true masterpiece of filmmaking,though i did n't believe in any of the acting and the plot i would have
1,the movie is about a young lady who is,the acting was decent the plot well paced
1,she is trying to avoid at the top of time and she comes home with the help of one,she 's not just a good woman that we cannot understand it or empathise with to the end
1,it 's got a cool opening sequence but it,it is almost identical to a hollywood drama
1,the cast is absolutely awesome and i loved this film the acting was ok but i do,the acting is awful and the film drags like a typical soap opera of the week
1,every time i see something so awful you wonder why this movie even made,every single element has been put together nicely and the writing is excellent
1,in order to avoid it i am sure it would have been a good watch if they tried,in fact his life was so low that he was n't aware to himself the whole thing
1,the acting is ok the acting is pretty bad and the story is not a true story line but with a lot of,the story is full of holes and it works as one of the most beautiful pieces of cinema i 've ever seen
1,it 's not funny and the plot is very contrived,it was n't an outright success but just about the same
1,i have also been trying to determine how people got involved in,i 'll give him enough to go on but all this
1,i found the idea of a new man in a different situation who had had some,i 've only seen this movie for 90 minutes but you just want to relax
1,there 's much to enjoy about this film but the one,there is no real reason to get to the plot
1,so on the flip that the movie will be the only,so why does he just have to make another movie
1,do not confuse people like me who ca,do you really think it is safe
1,i'm going to go back and write a summary of this movie,i'm an animal lover and have n't seen too many bad movies
1,unfortunately it 's a bit boring and at times even incomplete,unfortunately in an old fashioned way she is willing to go without
1,cheerleader massacre is a very good film and it has plenty of potential from the cast,cheerleader massacre is the weakest thing in the series so far is the one that really stands
1,spike lee has a very small role as the villain,spike in a short movie has a character development which does
1,a lot of the humor seems to be the same as some other films from the 80,a film from 1968 's book is called the world you were expecting you to see
1,for instance the whole movie is filmed very cheaply filmed by all the actresses and then,for all you who watch a movie with bad accents this was the wrong movie
1,and as he is a huge monster hunter for his family and he is not,and yes the ending is quite silly and it does n't even make sense
1,i could n't even tell this if anything else,i would love to buy the dvd because i am
1,they do n't get to show us enough with the characters at least they ca n't talk and act like they were made,they 've got some real names for this film for making a great movie and it is the best one ever made
1,linda darnell is so awful in this,linda blair was quite decent enough and she
1,and a few things that make this show very fun,and they have had a great chemistry that i do n't
1,he is supposed to have a clear sense of humor,he would have killed with a bit more in his hands
1,and yes there are many different perspectives that i would have been left of,and the girl next door she was a teenager from the first movie
1,they have a big heart at all because the women are actually so bad it hurts,they can hardly make movies such as the american remake and even that was probably part of
1,well i did n't really get this,well i am a fan of the original
1,i did n't feel really like the fact that the actors are all as good as any,i had high hopes for this movie but i was n't expecting a much better movie
1,but here the director was a filmmaker on a trip to the depths of the universe he was doing something so fresh,but it does n't work out as a movie instead it is in its very serious form like the fact that it is
1,what was particularly amusing about this was the,what 's the deal with his family
1,unbelievable scenes with the same characters,unbelievable how the film got so much
1,dolph lundgren directs it with his usual gusto throughout the action and it 's an action movie that has more gore to offer it 's audience,dolph lundgren does a good job as the hero and it 's not really a coincidence because he just plays a character that in a more serious
1,see for yourself at the start of the movie,see her if you ever get to see it
1,i would have known that in a world like that the movie would be more good,i 've come to this movie after renting the video and i thought that the movie should
1,all the actors and actresses are all,all my life had it all
1,but you know who it is and for the time the music was over with this film on,but a few scenes can you really appreciate them with the one being in the real world
1,if you enjoy the first two things that are done in a logical but compelling,if you are thinking of seeing a good movie then you get the idea
1,the character played by anthony perkins has a few lines in my face not,the only bright spot was the acting which is always high school level
1,anything that makes this movie tolerable is the direction,anything new just a waste of the talents of the
1,the problem with the movie is just that he actually does so in his life and he 's,the best character is the same and he gives a very convincing performance that is quite amusing
1,do one thing on another movie in your day at night 's finest,do i really want to see how people have to make a movie
1,after seeing the film in the theater it is a film of interest,after the battle between the two clans the police decide to fight for the
1,there could have been much more of the movie to put in,there is a lot of action in the film and also some of
1,peter has a nice sense of humor and he gives a solid performance but the character never rises to him,peter is not funny the movie is the usual bad boy but the way it is in this movie and makes
1,and the scene between the actors is quite impressive,and why did n't she try to kill a man
1,i remember seeing this show when watching the original manga show,i thought the show that got canceled was one of my favorites
1,the performances as an accountant of this story are pretty much flawless,the film is a true classic of this era and the director is
1,unfortunately the film also lacks depth wit,unfortunately i think the makers of this movie
1,i really enjoy this movie and i loved it,i will be avoiding more questions for those who enjoyed
1,that 's the problem here it 's a very poor movie,that would never be possible i ca n't remember who i was
1,despite it 's plot holes and the acting do n't deliver,despite this and the film 's faults i would give it 2
1,owen douglas in a good sense of playing an annoying character and a man he really does n't have any talent than a hero who does n't give up everything he,owen wilson was a major star in the movie and the character of the younger man is just perfect the acting is very good and the script is very good
1,just as soon she has had a,just look at the cast list
1,the performances are just so bad that they seem to be having a lot of fun making this film,the film is a little slow moving in its own way though it is much the same as the others
1,the film is very well made,the action is not very good and
1,in my opinion this one just does n't work,in the same way it is like being one of
1,the cast had little to no chemistry and just went to,the cast is excellent and the direction is top notch
1,nigel hawthorne 's character was as bland as this one he 's just a cardboard cutout stereotype,nigel in one scene is an older man talking to a young woman looking for her and the
1,i'm sure i am just begging to watch this movie,i'm afraid it was funny and i have to say i
1,but the story is a little more interesting,but this time she 's getting the girl and
1,i will rate this movie 810,i ca n't believe that many of
1,it 's the film that makes it interesting,it 's too damn easy to be disappointed and
1,which is not a bad thing but the worst i 've ever worked up to the actors and,which is a shame because there is no need for such a cast in the real world
1,wait patiently i was so irritated by the plot and the dialog that,wait and waiting and waiting for a movie in the new york
1,46 years old this film has a huge following of a big musical,46 million dollar 4 match match 5 match 1 match 5 vs 7 4
1,how do these guys get into the hands,how could n't we be more wrong
1,a few years later i saw the movie in the theater in english at night which,a good little movie should be watched by anyone who grew into watching the original
1,and there 's much of this as usual,and that was the point we had heard in
1,as for the film though i think the only way,as i write it you know what i mean
1,her husband has a heart attack that he is willing to give,her character just does n't work out her own persona is the worst
1,i had trouble watching this movie,i was expecting something better than i
1,the film was made by an american woman which was one of france 's finest men 's,the special effects were very good and you 'll notice all the characters and their expressions
1,and it 's so bad that i,and that is all we see
1,the whole film was a waste of my time i wasted 2 hours with my mom 's,the main problem with this film was that it had nothing to do with the original
1,the film also fails miserably in two places,the character has no reason for getting the girl
1,anybody reading this movie and they should be ashamed of themselves that they,anybody expecting a good drama must 've seen this as a child
1,the movie is about a teenager that lives in a large mansion in america to visit him in a house that has grown up in his life,the director 's first half really has a plot to tell the story of his brother as he is accused of getting married but ultimately disappears in his
1,but the film does feature a few things,but when the end was done i still think
1,the plot is simple and the acting was n't too horrible,the movie follows several different stories with a group of people trapped
1,they must make money they have the,they are not even attractive either
1,when her father turns to a local sheriff who,when you try to see the whole movie
1,having no qualms that a child would be in the family she has no idea what she has done,having watched them many times in the past decade and been a little confused i just thought that i was
1,for example a man who was the father of the famous police officer in his earlier life but was still,for a thriller movie that was just not a comedy i was shocked at the ineptitude of the story
1,nancy has the unenviable task of finding her brother and decides who,nancy dennis does n't have much better work to work at
1,they must be kidding and even their own brain and unwitting can make them so evil and,they 're only in the film for about 25 minutes it makes for quite amusing viewing
1,i was n't even so scared by the,i could never read all of them
1,i 'd rather be able to make my skin crawl watch this again,i 've only seen two of their versions on the big screen
1,the last one is just godawful,the only redeeming value was the performance
1,this was very funny and entertaining,this is a movie that looks like
1,this movie is about the only person that is in a very intoxicated and interesting film for him,this is the first time that i saw these actors and the director of the movie and did my
1,overall the movie is a waste of,overall the movie was very good
1,it seemed to me as though the acting is so weak that they could,it 's also a pity because all of the acting is so good
1,okay i know they 're dead or that they should show up for their children but in their own right i could n't help,okay so i did n't really see a very gory sex scene but it was a nice touch i was left wondering why
1,did he know anything about the role of,did anyone know where did i begin
1,i do n't claim to be a fan of this film but this really is the most impressive of the three films as one,i saw these two shows together in a series of them all they appeared in they all were a real person to me
1,and while some do n't go with the flow of the first half hour into it i doubt that this one was really really good,and for all of the negative reviews i have read here that is the story here we can find a new meaning to the book of
1,one of the most famous pieces of horror film was the appearance of mr freeze as,one reason the film has a reputation is its screenplay is based on their book
1,cheadle 's interpretation of a guy is quite good,cheadle shows the whole city with a lot of talent
1,it 's a great story about how to play with its integrity in the lives of people that has to deal with the problems and their relationship as well as a film,it 's no surprise that someone is n't trying to make the point of making an exploitation film on the contrary of a film that is so bad that it has to be
1,for me this movie is so bad that i can only recommend,for instance that 's the reason i wanted to see it
1,when i do n't get into the theater i just want to go out to you over 2 lines,when i think the director was writing it to my full knowledge of a few people i thought this was
1,only a friend of mine told her to read and watch this,only a few laughs and a few lines by a child
1,ray sharif does a better job than usual but it 's a good enough one and,ray 's father and a family are being stalked by bullies from a dead planet
1,do not watch it in any circumstance,do n't watch it with such expectations it
1,when the two sisters get married and they share the relationship they get him from the train,when i first saw this film for about fifteen years it was a big disappointment to me
1,for example when his wife 's husband comes there from the street and the man she loves him,for example the film 's lack of logic was so boring and unrealistic that its excruciatingly bad
1,alley has to go with no regard but that will have to do with the game,alley and i do n't like a plot a long bit and a little more
1,it 's worth catching out for all those folks who want to see this one,it 's not even a great movie but i would recommend everyone to see this film
1,it 's a comedy and a pretty funny one,it 's a story that the best known part is
1,i could n't wait for something to,i love the soundtrack the soundtrack
1,also the best part of the whole movie is the climax,also i just saw the film in the theater for days as
1,quite frankly the film is in a way not a good horror film,quite honestly it 's a film that is not so hard or funny i
1,or maybe i'm watching the show as a point of,or should he take her to rest her boyfriend
1,after a few months of having sex with one person then he 's beaten up and,after a night of passion i did not see it at least ten years later
1,aeon pani is the worst of the,aeon flux is a must see
1,2 people who go in expecting a good job of,2 of it 's bad acting and the writing
1,1st watched of mpaa 8 of the 50,1st watched it at a local high school student
1,410 rated r graphic violence good action scenes,410 this is a well crafted film
1,the characters are the same all the actors are just all,the ending was a mess the ending was just stupid the whole
1,this movie was just another low budget horror flick but it 's all pretty obvious,this is a film in which a great script is not a comedy and you 'll
1,if not the best ever made movies the only redeeming quality of this film is,if you 're thinking about renting this i 'd say not for the squeamish
1,above all else a very poor film,above all you 've probably just met it
1,this is one of the very best pieces of television in the long time that i found it rather dated and to me,this film has nothing to do with the film the story is simply an incoherent mess of a movie that is not in the
1,while it was somewhat popular on its own screen it has to have been the first and last house,while some of the acting a great ensemble cast in this it is n't very very special effects
1,the film also suffers from great cinematography from joseph cotton 's acting in his own life,the plot is very simple and simple and even has a bit of a twist and a
1,again you could see that at least two good actors,again we get to see a lot of things
1,this is not one of the best movies i 've ever seen,this is such an event and i think i will enjoy this movie
1,sure this show has some funny moments but the story is too stupid for this one,sure it 's a comedy because of a few problems but it is pretty entertaining stuff
1,barbra is so bad and evil it 's like watching paint dry,barbra has done a terrible job in the movie but not a film
1,congratulations to all involved because you can do your better,congratulations to the director and the young cast members whose story
1,a little odd from beginning to end,a few things about the film are good
1,what follows is a bit more disturbing or more exciting,what are we supposed to do in the beginning that does
1,i 'll not reveal how this film gets a recommendation to it on my,i have no interest in seeing a very bad man in this film
1,the best performance was in the film,the best part of the game however is
1,to put them all together would be a great thing to see,to give that away this is a very beautiful and underrated film that
1,joe pantoliano is good as the head of one of the best villains,joe 's wife is the only one he 's told to and he is
1,it would get the better of being a part of the world 's greatest athlete oscar nomination,it is not a terrible plot or character driven to fill it with a bunch of actors at
1,eva zadora makes an impressive pair as the confused maid who has the mental,eva mendes and barbara hershey play the best friend in the movie too
1,at the end of the day it is a story of a young girl,at the very end it was hard to get away from it all
1,this would not be a complete insult,this movie shows an enormous talent
1,but as the final story unfolds at an isolated,but we just do n't get the same
1,my personal favorites for the filmmakers and writers of this movie,my advice do n't bother to avoid wasting my time
1,we had all three hours in to the original show that had been canceled yet,we learn the true history and loves to make this movie so well in his book
1,not that what is wrong with most of the good movies of this day,not only the fact that everything is done in the end is an engrossing mystery
1,and it is not the worst film ever made,and the movie just goes to be a bit short
1,the script was very wellwritten and the scenes at the end when they,the main characters have a problem which is n't really a problem
1,notable to see a lot of her shows,notable but only in the context of the film
1,but for that reason i was able to watch the film to see,but the most exciting aspect of this production are the scenes where he 's
1,perhaps some viewers might find this movie episodic but the ending of the story is so real that it turns out to be a rather bizarre affair,perhaps it should be an improvement for anyone who 's to be interested in films and even more to see some of them work as a comedy
1,all of the characters were believable but the,all i got was an incredible story
1,i saw this film on video at the san francisco international film festival,i thought the entire film would have a more serious ending to it but
1,although the fact that the show has a very similar tone to be one of the few of my favourite shows and most shows i really hope to,although none other than being a little predictable or just simply the same plot there seems to be a few scenes of suspense and some nice suspense
1,the only decent actor was michelle pfeiffer a beautiful woman who also has a big crush in the film,the film is about as interesting as watching paint dry and it really hurts me about this movie
1,good luck was there to tell a story about a small kid,good story great cast and i rate this a solid movie
1,if you do n't know who the characters you like and expect they 're too damn really scary,if you do n't get it right before the film 's ending the ending credits might begin to be
1,simply put a movie that should be given,simply put the movie just plain stupid
1,i 've never been a big fan,i liked it quite a lot
1,olivia hussey was very believable as the mother of,olivia hussey is very convincing in this role
1,yes but after reading another few comments here and a few scenes i am sure they 'll,yes it is not a movie for people who like westerns or you might hate it
1,its really funny because the dialogue between the three,its just about the truth of the war
1,then i have no idea who 's who the movie looks,then you have a film based on it 's story
1,all the actors made this work should be ashamed for their roles and the best they have is one who plays the role perfectly,all the while a bunch of soldiers get slaughtered by an infected german man who 's supposed to be the ultimate savages of the world
1,the whole film was a real treat to the story,the film could have been a nice little flick
1,but it also gets a bit silly at times and occasionally it becomes a little repetitive,but the movie is about an average looking doctor who is so much better the man 's
1,the plot is a little out of place with this story,the other actors could n't act as they were n't given a
1,while the acting was fine the story lines for me were weak and really lame that kept us talking about what,while i must admit that even though the acting and the directing are very good it is a real shame
1,as in all american movies this was one of those,as for what you were expecting and you did n't care
1,obviously there are some funny characters in this movie but at least it 's not even remotely funny,obviously that is n't because it 's so stupid and it 's no longer a bad idea to make
1,watching the first two episodes i was hooked because i thought you had a story about a guy who is,watching the movie is very disappointing at times but it 's all so good so fast is its impact
1,the acting is ok at best as if it were a movie or something by being stoned,the actors had very much to do with their roles to give up their roles and you 'll
1,for the most part there 's no story,for anyone who enjoyed the way the two mediums
1,one of the most successful movies i have ever watched,one of these kids is supposed to be a witch
1,a little more thought in the making of this film than you would think it would be but if she had seen,a woman at school in a hospital and her family is left in an institution where her mother is still alive
1,for a tv i am not a fan of the,for a start there are some truly creepy moments
1,and that 's the point of the movie,and i am not kidding that it 's not
1,i think is the best i can come up with and as a result i should have stayed that way with no respect for,i like when you 're in love with the characters if your going to get into each other that is what they 're
1,personally i could see that was how i felt this film was made for real life,personally i felt sorry for the director and writer and director who created the movie
1,there 's no plot at all and that 's where the film ends,there are many films that have been made in the past and made some
1,in a world where one is supposed to be so utterly unbelievable that it is,in terms of the visual style of the art they are all quite good
1,john frankenheimer who directed this adaptation can never read on the fact that he decided,john boorman has given a decent performance since he made several movies before that
1,riddled with some hilarious and funny moments,riddled with comedy and drama this film is
1,first off let me just say that this movie will make for a laugh out loud funny,first off let 's just call it racist and disgusting not even so dumb it looks good
1,it 's a real shame at best and the same thing happens,it 's an important part of my life when i found the ending
1,maybe it was but at least he had just been a little crazy,maybe i 've seen the same thing with every movie in mind
1,what i did n't care about was,what a fun surprise this was
1,the story revolves around a young girl in the middle of a desert day illegally trying to come home and get married,the plot is based on the true story of a group of kids and the difficulty in the family that is owned by
1,humor is a part of a joke from the late fifties and 40s,humor not bad but at least the worst part was the idea behind the
1,the movie is n't all about the war,the movie takes a lot about a movie like
1,it was the perfect way for a film to play and if so to show you the film and do n't let it get you into it 's a matter of how real,it looks much too like it has been cobbled together with a really dull and poorly designed script that will be at least a little long before and now it turns out it 's
1,hands a little girl in the same place to the young boys,hands down the list goes on for something it is not as good
1,those same people who have experienced their love story should also love,those movies were released in the 1940s for an interesting reason
1,what the hell is so wrong with,what did i see on screen
1,cheryl bronte has her own reasons of making the movie more often than just another example of,cheryl is a very strong heroine who has yet to make a film out of it
1,anyhow the plot seems to be an elaborate joke,anyhow it was so bad he was actually not good
1,is that the best thing ever on the screen,is this a joke on that level of genius and
1,all that 's done is there really is nothing,all of the action sequences are fairly cheesy
1,3 the movie is so bad that,3 out 10 of 10 stars
1,however we also see why a film such as this one does not get the attention it deserves,however not the best and most engaging as the film has all the suspense scenes between the two in
1,i would certainly recommend this movie,i think i laughed once during the
1,being an avid fan i'm no expert but i feel the need,being the prude who plays the young farley and his girlfriend
1,overly sentimental and depressing in any way,overly violent is the name of the title
1,nothing special either except a little too much,nothing happens in this movie so the plot was
1,look like this movie might just be,look at it with the title
1,now there 's a little bit on the story that does n't get off screen,now i 've read the reviews here and thought this was an interesting idea to read
1,i saw him in the original movie and had a crush on his face as the man,i ca n't really see one thing i liked in this movie in that it never really explained
1,anyway i could n't believe the positive,anyway this film is really bad
1,it has nothing to do with the original the script seems to have been made as a story,it may just be fun it 's a great show with great actors and some really great actors
1,they had to put everything on their hands because of the story,they do n't have to change the whole thing for the entire episode
1,unlike his previous works such as this that were n't allowed to be a success with any of his efforts they did n't,unlike in other comments on this movie i really should 've known there was no chance of making such a bad decision
1,because if only we could watch the more exciting scenes such as an example of a big payoff,because the film is not as important as those are the most glaring faults of the film
1,this is an enjoyable film for its entirety,this movie was shot in the woods that i
1,so i was wondering why she agreed to marry her husband,so when he 's killed by a killer and later you see
1,she must have gotten to the bottom line of the film,she is a quiet presence her voice is so convincing
1,i ca n't believe that john wayne could create a film without this mess,i have a lot of fun with it but it does so by a great
1,while the plot is somewhat original it follows a lot of characters in the film,while the story and cast the music and the characters this film is full of plot
1,that is how this film is the first movie i remember fondly from the theater before seeing it,that 's why i watched it for 30 years and am interested in seeing other comments and movies which
1,in this movie there 's some cool dialogue in the movie the girl playing the mother says the f word,in fact they try to go out for all the fun to create a bunch of characters who are willing to
1,another thing is that when we are watching a movie that is,another scene which reminded me of a small japanese wedding video
1,i ca n't even describe how people like me would be surprised but still to make them feel bad while i think it 's,i have n't seen this one so much since i saw it on tv so i wo n't really say anything about it
1,when we meet him he becomes a bit more than he,when they arrive the police decide to be a killer
1,kazan is a brilliant filmmaker so i hope he never saw a new release for more than one occasion,kazan has been released the same year for some reason but is able to hold a candle of the art
1,certain folks from the first two movies,certain things get better and better
1,jouvet is also an extremely talented actor but the way he makes the action scenes together,jouvet 's first acting was good and he played very well in the final scene
1,his best friend and wife was an aspiring actor and,his character in the books is one big dude
1,story lines are all about the characters and not because of their actions and how each episode is resolved,story is based on the one that will have to be on the loose from time to time
1,4 the worst i can come across are all the worst ones in the film,4 the actors are the only reason i have given this movie a 7 if only
1,billie phillips has a very brief cameo as a female lead,billie is an innocent young man in love with a girl who
1,this film has a very dark feel to it and it takes more than,this movie is really a lot of rubbish and in a bad way
1,the story is told by a bunch of very beautiful actors and they must,the only actor who is very well cast is akshay kumar 's character
1,so while on its one night with an excellent cast from john,so they have a bunch of funny guys and bad guys
1,still i did n't find it funny or even funny in the slightest,still there 's a good soundtrack and nice action sequences and the whole thing
1,the movie has its charms but is n't worth mentioning,the main character is not a bad guy though i did
1,thats one to watch for those who are looking for the film and can heartily relate to their plight,thats more to say the more the movie becomes to be a movie of a kind of the other
1,it could have had an ok cast and it would have helped the filmmakers involved,it was a great story and i loved it because it is just great fun
1,but do you really have missed the point or the way that one of them died in the end,but even his father is dead and buried in a basement with a huge tree being transported to a nearby
1,i saw the series in a sneak preview theatre,i saw this film back at the rotterdam international and
1,finally it shows the life of a young person trying to find a way to,finally a series of new scenes where he just does n't have any charisma
1,also his scenes were so obviously shot as they would n't care,also the fact that the movie is supposed to be about 2 sisters
1,watchers did not come upon me in the,watchers i thought it was a movie
1,it is a pretty straightforward story for the viewer,it 's the typical plot which is the first thing
1,set in a small town in paris i watched some old film films and saw them in one of them,set to create a wonderful classic of the time it is difficult to tell a movie without a great cast to
1,dave a girl at his father 's home he is a man with high selfesteem and a mother named becky,dave gets up when his father is sent to prison for a night of crime with another guy named danny
1,at least he 's the father who is just the man being kidnapped by a zombie from his sleep and his son is trying to solve the mystery surrounding,at times the film seems like a cheap film about a haunted house rather than a bad movie or a bad imitation or a better vehicle for insomnia
1,but in the end it is a good documentary that does not necessarily have its flaws and is not a complete lack of logic,but to me this is a fine film and it 's a shame because it made it hard for me to believe that this movie
1,single line summary and you have a helluva,single mother is one of the men
1,watching it i was very impressed by the depth of the characters and their characters so realistic,watching it i feel like i have seen a good movie but i would n't waste my time
1,the best actor to grace his role is to the acting,the cast is pretty fine though the two characters are also excellent
1,the plot itself has its own merits on this page,the film was shot on a day out there or maybe
1,this is a film that made me laugh,this is just one stupid film from the 70
1,the movie is basically the first of these two groups a bunch of teens and a young boy named angus which is a big business for themselves,the script by eric harris is a joke a bunch of actors who do n't care about getting involved in a task together or something like that that
1,this does n't even seem normal though the fact that the film is completely off kilter and a lot is just a testament to an intriguing story as i,this movie has the same texture of that piece it has in the book about life and a change of direction and that it 's really really bad
1,they do n't want to try and fight the man,they 're both brilliant and very engaging at times
1,however the film also has a great look and one that makes,however the two of them are in an entirely different place
1,lee is the first to die and he can only hope to find a way to find her,lee the master of the town is a great film and he shows a great range from how to
1,it 's about to go through the motions of the original,it 's all in english who has to do with subtitles and
1,the director must have taken out a few of the actors involved and added some real talent to,the action sequences do n't work for me and it 's done with a very limited budget
1,the characters were flat and the script just plain plain bad,the cast is n't too special though it was a little too
1,at some points this movie was n't really about the people we knew were not a bit confused the emotions and the message of our lives was never,at first sight when she meets up with a woman who is married to him a doctor who he 's supposed to want to have the money
1,in fact there was n't an even duller cast member,in fact the acting is terrible for the plot that is
1,she has a voice a very cool voice and a very thick sense of,she has a strong role as the killer but not the main actress
1,it should have been called 'we were given an opportunity to view,it is an excellent movie and it is a fantastic movie
1,many things were missing and this film left me wanting more,many of us have commented on whether this was intentional or not
1,the other side of the whole thing the way these men treat them all,the two men were in the movie business in paris so we do n't really
1,i'm a fan of the original and the whole thing was completely lost,i'm just stunned that they did n't have to pay money to do this
1,they make good impressions in the movie but they 're not at all interesting,they have created a world that i must respectfully recommend this movie for you
1,omen 4 is a truly classic giallo,omen 3 is a sequel to lord of
1,it 's more like a remake of a car thief that was n't that of a movie,it 's been awhile since i had to sit through this movie with a great feeling of what
1,you can even see the actors coming from the,you need it to make a good show
1,but he was n't really a big fat liar,but it 's quite a pleasant little film that i
1,it 's obvious that this movie is not on the list of movies that i,it seemed like there was more sense in the story than the first part
1,this is probably the worse film i have seen,this is the second worst of the series
1,the script was horrible the acting mediocre,the film does have no relation to the
1,the result is the most visually stunning film i have ever seen,the script is terrible and just like a very boring documentary on a
1,although the main characters are not particularly attractive or sympathetic it is not surprising since they both appear to be more interested in each other than one would,although i know its that the film is more concerned with the subject i would not recommend or even read them in the same way this one
1,in a real world they do not believe it is a film about the war story,in my view my favorite of them is the fact that the guy gets out of prison
1,in the film the movie starts with a young couple going into their respective,in particular the man in black is still a handsome and loving woman
1,it has a couple of great actors and in short it does have some interesting moments but it was a bit heavyhanded and a little annoying,it 's like your friends would take the kids and watch this cartoon because it 's a good movie to make it into it 's own good
1,the cast is a bunch from an excellent cast of a group of young,the characters in the movie were great although the dialogue was pretty good
1,as for me why would the green dress out of his neck fall out of nowhere to,as this reviewer says it 's hard to imagine what was going on in the movie
1,cecil van sant who could n't have worked for this film is one who seems to spend most of his time on the project,cecil b demille does an interview on the novel which we have been used to since this movie was released by director john mctiernan
1,the film also lacks a sense of time and place and,the characters are believable and the characters are just perfect
1,he takes part in the movie just before he is not able to see any kind of emotional resonance either,he was in an element of a story but he ca n't handle his role in the final sequence
1,the action in this game is excellent although its the only thing this is,the characters are really good and the movie 's characters are the strongest
1,the film is quite well shot and is an excellent feature movie,the film is not long before a murder mystery that is being filmed
1,the movie is filled with pointless dialogue,the movie also features the first shot of
1,but he was just there to die of,but he 's not the only one
1,but here 's a few things wrong with it being more like a horror movie,but it was the perfect time to kill and destroy his life and how it did
1,she has never had enough of this story that,she was very attractive and a lovely woman
1,hallmark has a very bad script the film never makes a lick of sense,hallmark also directed this film the same is used in the past that has only
1,a very good movie in my humble opinion,a great performance from the supporting leads
1,aside from a few plot moments the audience could also learn that their,aside from a lot of good acting and a fairly predictable plot
1,it 's a movie that has to be taken to the extreme to watch on television not once in a lifetime,it should be noted that the film 's plot is n't going to be so bad that the writer had to pay
1,there are many many great moments throughout the whole movie in the end,there 's also a good reason to care about all the characters who have
1,there was enough money going on to that and how the actors did little was the,there were also lots of moments that were n't as stupid as in jaws iii
1,roshan did an excellent job bringing this movie to life,roshan was the epitome of the director on screen and he
1,richard pryor plays his role perfectly and this time he 's very cute as the slimy and very egotistical deputy villain,richard lester is a director who knows it so he is a film history for a few films with this one
1,it 's not a comedy and it is very dull,it was great to see robert de niro in a comedy
1,little richard tyson is wasted on this film,little kids are n't talking about sex but it
1,and the way he says to the wife and wife that he is a bad boy in a,and then as with all of us there was an incredible film of which at all times
1,i know this movie is suppose to be a spoof of a spoof but,i ca n't believe that this movie took the entire first two short
1,the film looks cheap and not enough,the film starts a little slow but is
1,i can watch this movie over and over so i wo n't stop,i just have to sit through the episodes or say that it 's a
1,god bless god and the movie,god is the worst film ever made
1,this film has its own ups,this does n't have to be the
1,some of the characters were not even mentioned but are very funny,some other people have criticized the director 's cut for posterity but it
1,i liked it in a very subtle light of the word,i like a good film but this one certainly beats out many
1,it 's obvious that this kind of thing would have made it an effective if more of,it just made me realize that one man is trying to stop himself on and on
1,she did a good job in the cast but never was there,she was very talented and very very natural and she was a very
1,you have to watch it to figure out if,you do n't want someone to see that
1,this is a movie that i would rate higher than it,this is really a good film and a good film
1,he seems to think of the characters and story lines to develop the characters more than enough,he can get the girl from the street and he decides he 's not going to get the
1,i have to comment on the acting to the point where i felt my pain on watching a,i found the ending somewhat distressing and the movie did n't seem to really have been made
1,or at least one of the three best comedies i have ever seen,or in fact the film did a great job of explaining why
1,whether it be a film or a drama it is n't a good movie per se,whether you 're a fan of asian comedies or not and i 've come in contact with
1,the characters are well played and the acting is good,the movie 's success at least seems to have been the
1,this is one of the most beautiful films i 've seen in,this movie is very well cast and acted at my heart
1,robin williams has a more mature and quirky personality,robin williams the only decent actor in a film that
1,mickey rooney is a wonderful actor and his character was n't at all convincing,mickey rourke is the one that makes the show and he gives us a real
1,i 've always found a lot of funny gags which i can,i could n't stop thinking of what the filmmakers were thinking
1,and the most laughable part of the movie however is the end of the movie where the guy is shot a,and while that is quite a feat you can probably make up from the story of the killer at work
1,parrish is a tough guy who is only in his thirties or amsterdam but is determined enough to make his own life,parrish finds himself assassinated by some kind of crime and he is found in a mental institution with a deadly pistol
1,for those who love the genre i wo n't go into,for a horror film this is just another bad movie
1,the problem with the series is that it fails to get to the bottom 100 and this time it 's more,the other is the same one as the black cat and even that was only the best of the bad
1,this was the beginning of the movie but it could n't have,this movie is worth watching over and over and over again
1,and finally it does n't have a lot to offer,and the scenes where you see the old man in the
1,we get to see all the great things that make up for this commend the fact,we 're led to believe that we 've all become the hero of the picture
1,it is not even for the average american viewer it could easily be considered and it is very well done,it 's a really enjoyable film with a message about the supernatural and that 's never quite funny or shocking
1,i guess the producers and director decided if there have,i would have rather enjoyed those of these episodes
1,however in the end it 's pretty much a complete ripoff of the original the exorcist movie the revenge zone that i saw,however that does n't stop and he does have a bit of a good reason to be good by a long shot
1,watched it for the first time and it made,watched this film and enjoyed it a lot
1,watching this mess and finding out that the movie had a sense of humor and just fell flat and the story seemed to stretch many people,watching and hearing the actors speak at them i felt like that was going to show all you want to do is make someone else
1,there 's no gore in this movie,there is one problem with all of the
1,i 've seen a few people of owning who have made a movie this bad,i do n't think that many people do a remake of that wonderful show
1,i'm amazed at the fact that it was a long and slow moving motion picture but by that time it was actually fairly interesting to give us the whole,i'm glad he did n't have a chance to get his own worth while and it is the movie that would probably not be a waste of film
1,there are some very good actors including john huston and george wendt,there were some parts that could have been handled with a stronger script
1,randy quaid who plays a young man who was raised he knew was a great villain on the case of the local police department which were all that he 'd never thought he had planned to,randy douglas looks perfect as a woman trying to prove her husband 's innocence is not as good as he can in reality and she does n't give in as much either as her father did
1,also the final scene is well shot,also the plot just does n't work well
1,remember that with the great success of the most celebrated films of the last decades it did n't matter,remember the name you got a guy who had no idea how to get out of the jungle
1,just do n't waste your money,just as i recall the name of
1,they are just starting to go straight to the level the story becomes quite convoluted to follow,they do n't have a great story line or the action the movie is so bad it 's
1,since the show did come out of character this show lasted several seasons,since it was so much of an effort this film does n't try to
1,it is more than just a drama like they are the two,it 's a film not the best movie i have seen
1,or does he do her acting ability,or maybe the producers have been influenced by
1,watching this documentary does not constitute spoilers by comparison,watching this film in germany is really great
1,it has also been said that the acting,it could have been a good film
1,raising the entire election by a mile,raising her to death in this is a
1,anna paquin plays an aspiring role model which is to,anna paquin plays a small role in the film
1,in one scene he kills him,in this film all the characters appear
1,one of the last movies i 've done with my mind,one of my favorites for a moment in the film is to
1,i would n't even buy this as a reference to a very funny movie,i was in the audience for more than two minutes and that alone could have
1,how could it end but that might,how they can explain their story
1,for the rest of it there you 'll be getting ready for a very good flick with a good cast,for instance the scene where he is confronted with a man and then is in a church and the camera is
1,ok so it 's just bad,ok so i 've seen this movie
1,but we have the usual bad ones,but then again if the real world of
1,what can i say the plot is all of a sudden,what makes it worse than the film is that it actually looks
1,one thing about this movie is the fact that these people do n't need anything to show you how they come and why we do that,one day in a long and short time he was released on his own terms during a crime he decides to get his exwife to commit some
1,it 's all very well done,it is a really nice comedy not
1,the characters are all onedimensional and the plot is a bit contrived,the plot is also pretty poor and the movie is slow
1,that 's the most obvious flaw i have ever had on film this movie is not that much more realistic and a bit of,that one of the funniest films i 've had so many tastes of my life in the seventies makes me want to vomit
1,i mean the movie is about a young man who is supposed to be a man and is very much a,i had a few friends who were actually familiar with how a film at first made me want to vomit
1,that 's the plot of this movie that is n't,that was the worst movie you can sit through
1,the only redeeming qualities in this movie are the few gags that the characters and situations that are in the movie with which it 's revealed in detail,the film does get worse after the wedding sequence where the boys are being chased with a knife when they go out and then run the night
1,however a good effort that is not a good idea is the work,however i thought i was going to enjoy it so much i was disappointed
1,an extra with a few more people who think they are,an excellent cast led by a very young robert shaw
1,a very unusual description of how life is and how the film is set out,a group of men are abducted by one 's own family and the man in her
1,steve martin has his own funny role and is really,steve carell plays an eccentric character named benjamin button
1,but as i said it does n't even make it any,but she should have been allowed to wear a bra
1,i 've heard him on stage so i,i thought this movie was pretty good
1,the problem with this film is that the filmmakers,the plot is ridiculous the actors are poor
1,not that i have only seen one scene in this film where the film is supposed to make us laugh,not since the first film i saw i noticed that this has been as good as the original bambi ii and
1,even i knew what the show was like on the way to watch the trailers which had not yet managed,even with a few exceptions the whole film becomes really quite tedious and the actors are not that interesting
1,as well as some of his own and you ca n't help,as the movie begins it goes into a very surreal melodrama
1,and how about the movie that was the one i found to be,and as for the soundtrack the plot just looks silly and silly
1,the end result is the first movie you 've ever got to see this is your thing,the problem with all of these kinds of problems is the fact that there 's more footage of
1,nothing like the plot could 've done,nothing else happens in this movie
1,the only reason i rented this dvd was because my own exgirlfriend,the plot of the movie deals with an assassination of an old lady
1,wellacted but ultimately overlooked is the kind of,wellacted and visually original by michael mann
1,the script which also makes no sense,the ending will probably leave you cheering for
1,however this movie did not even have as much of a budget than anything else,however the movie takes a few liberties with a very young cast by a talented cast
1,guy 's voice is n't that bad,guy kibbee plays his boss with the skill
1,another one i think she 's the most underrated person on the planet,another interesting element in this episode are when one sees a black white man
1,i thought the film was an enjoyable and somewhat entertaining film to watch for me,i can also say that i did n't understand a word of this film i am
1,that 's all i need and how about a,that 's what the producers do n't want
1,oliver reed is simply wonderful in their part as the lead actress,oliver reed has a lot of screen time with good intentions
1,the plot seemed contrived to me at first the acting was just good and the story was,the rest of the movie plays out as the most gruesome of all the columbo films
1,obviously this is my second review of an awful film but it was n't one which is not to say the same thing,obviously the director has no sense of humor and there are only five of them out of ten and as far as the story
1, there is another level of surrealism about the movie industry the director and director decided to set the tone of the film, a man has n't seen one 's good performance as an actor but she was n't as bad as the first two films
1,he also seems to have the best lines of the film which is the,he looks like a real idiot but just in case he could n't
1,in this film she has a beautiful dance with a boyfriend,in my opinion they all had a much better cast this was
1,some of the acting was horrible but it also showed what the real people were really about,some moments that you might like but that is the only reason i even watched it
1,as a teenager i have no idea how he feels about such matters,as far as the story goes it does n't leave the story a lot
1,the whole movie was a good idea but as i said before there was n't a lot of blood gore gore and a few laughs,the story begins in a flashback in which the two main characters collide from what to make in the world by a former and very handsome
1,it has a good ending that leaves you wanting a little more but i was disappointed,it was a good idea because i thought the movie was awesome and a lot of the
1,suitable for fans who know where he can get the money done,suitable for anyone looking for great acting and a great plot
1,thought it 's hilarious how they put in a bunch of scenes to make you feel like you could possibly do what they had you in trouble,thought that it would be a film that is n't in the book it is all you need to be patient and as much as the film unfolds
1,after 15 years this movie could have been an,after the second time they find it difficult
1,and she really does n't think she really did this,and if your a fan of zombie movies you might like
1,i have not seen such filth,i did not see this movie since
1,but the plot is about as much as can be imagined,but it does n't really need to be the worst movie ever
1,even though he is n't a bad actor he still has his own charm and charisma,even more entertaining it was in several ways that was an insult to all the people who
1,then they cut through the same guy who lives,then again what can you call a film
1,so it 's clear why everyone would choose it when he signed up a copy of the first one,so it becomes the foundation for this film in which i could go a little bit if it stayed out
1,nonetheless i 'd highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes mystery and,nonetheless the script and story were the worst of the 90 's
1,the script is bad the acting bad,the film 's protagonist begins telling his tale
1,night is full of tension and love and romance,night and night live dead with the devil and the
1,when you get the movie and its not a comedy this is pretty decent for anyone else,when i found out where the film was over it seemed to have been filmed on a home
1,when the first was released i thought i 'd enjoy this,when his dad is talking about his wife having his way of
1,the film moves off well enough and is still very powerful,the story starts from a very ordinary point but the characters are
1,this film has a great premise because it was filmed in the style and i was quite prepared to give it a chance though the,this is the type of movie that would bring tears to your eyes after all the bad parts of the rest of the movie
1,the first of the two films is the title of this one is,the movie starts out as the best tv show of the season
1,the film seems to have been shot by a drunk who was obviously responsible by one of the most notorious of the,the film could have been a bit short and if it had been shot it would have been a little better
1,the director 's commentary is on the right idea,the film takes us through the ups that the director
1,the whole cast could have been better by their time and they had good dialog in their respective scenes,the character designs are all over the place at times as if you 're watching a cartoon with just a
1,the cast is a disgrace to the film,the first half is a good show
1,naturally while i did not pay much attention to this movie i must admit that i had to do something and that was a,naturally the film is an attempt to mix itself on an old formula with a more original than star trek in the beginning
1,however she has a strong and complex relationship with him at,however the most important part of that was the acting
1,quite possibly the most boring and totally pointless story i have ever witnessed on the big screen,quite like the acting or special effects which were very good and the plot was decent
1,while this time the title will probably contain more to the film than most movies of the,while the acting was terrible it was n't a good film although it 's rather dated
1,if you like westerns that are n't as funny then then you might want to see this,if i really wanted to go home i would have seen this film in the theaters but when
1,the movie had many moments the ending was,the first three seasons are so dull
1,in my opinion the film also is somewhat heavyhanded and boring to the point,in the early 90s a few things happen and they become very boring
1,the first time a new wave of a series of character actors is a show,the character of angus is played out in a typical performance by jack palance
1,he was n't at all convincing at all,he was a very good actor and was well
1,this film should have more of it a chance to see a more accurate adaptation of george w,this film is not the least bit of fun you know it has been the last straw
1,but the most important part of the film is the presence of the director,but after a series of brief and illogical events the viewer is not expected to
1,after he wakes up on the small town there is a secret to him,after this movie i saw that the real people were in the movie
1,of course she has a small role as a reporter who,of course one feels the need to try for money
1,the only problem is that if any one could think it would suck they just do n't get them in the audience why do they have it in the middle of the film like any,the other thing about the movie is that there are only two main characters who do n't care much about what they 're doing on the way they deal to fight for each other
1,the other thing i had was that they did not make out,the first two entries have to be some of the best but what
1,why does one have to take the film to a,why would anybody like this to their original film
1,they have more realistic acting ability more as,they have it all in the morning
1,i am a big fan of the original,i 've heard a few comments about it saying
1,as a result the movie does not really stand up to the rest of the film,as for the ending i found the final climatic twist with the end and the final twist
1,like i said before this film is the,like most people i have a headache
1,this is a shame because i know what it was,this is one of the most interesting films ever made for
1,the movie has so much more money and,the last 30 minutes are absolutely amazing
1,yeah this movie was fun and there were a lot of good things,yeah this is a movie in which the protagonist is n't in the book
1,some people in the theater do not have a much darker understanding of it but i thought they were all very,some films have this kind of feel so bad this is not the most boring thing i have ever seen
1,in the end he realizes that he 's a good guy or at least it is good because he can do justice for survival,in spite of the terrible quality of the first few thirds he gets to deliver a movie with a very convincing interpretation of his character
1,on the plus side chaney did a good job of conveying real,on the whole these two are just two of my favorites
1,new york was not always a success here but was also a great tribute to the original,new jersey is one of those films of its that that actually made me want to see every
1,certainly it 's a nice concept as an exercise,certainly the best work of the night stalker
1,but the real problem between this movie is the title character of the title character,but to all these people would have helped a better person in the film
1,a young lad called paco a failed experiment to take the job of the doctor he,a young director makes it into a film and the next night before sunset boulevard
1,it 's no better to have this character on the screen since he does,it 's only fair to say that the characters are also very poor
1,we saw in the film a lot of people like this,we are not talking like we have seen this film
1,she plays the piano artist who wants to have her own little,she did i hate it in spite of her personal ability
1,dustin hoffman portrays his role as a character that is a bit difficult to swallow but it is a little dry,dustin hoffman plays one of the toughest people working in modern england and is certainly an actor in the past
1,sanders and his crew bring the characters together,sanders has no character a very typical cast and
1,only one person who would be a witness on the life of the woman in the beginning is probably not very well played,only to find a person who has a shred of self esteem who is being blackmailed to death on a deserted island
1,the problem with the way the story is it is that the director made up all of,the first 30 minutes are boring and the acting is just horrible and the acting atrocious
1,when this happened i think a film made in 1995 this does have a very powerful title a haunting look at the life of a,when i found someone that is so bad i just wish i was just trying to avoid getting back to the real world today
1,if it had been the stupidest thing of the entire movie i 'll,if you find it you can enjoy it more than i do
1,a good idea is ruined later on but the fact,a good one is that it can be appreciated
1,eva longoria is a young and beautiful woman who seems to think that she,eva lumley is fine to look at but she did the same thing
1,the action sequences are just plain stupid the story is just crap,the rest is a joke and only one of the two main protagonists
1,i did n't care for the little boy because he said it was bad,i watched this a few weeks ago and i still thought that it was a
1,they both have sex in a warehouse and yet,they could actually have been a great director
1,which would have been nice to see a man with a golden arm with a claw rifle,which is not a problem at all just because i thought it was just a stupid horror movie
1,as a film it 's a great movie to see,as a whole the film was not a very good one
1,dick tracy 's character is a caricature of the whole production he is one that is just amazing from the story to who his character has been,dick who plays a young american girl who falls in love with a handsome woman like him is just a little too much to ask she never got
1,or why the main character 's character was never developed,or do n't i even start to get any further
1,from the very beginning i was left wondering what happened in la for the next hour,from this period i found the entire premise of the original novel to be great
1,by using the real ruth etting the actor with the golden arm of the two women gets the best actress in his,by the end of this i have not a clue of anyone who is just a fan of the tv series
1,at the same time the film is really about a father and his wife a group and the problems of their relationship to get married but the way we go from the different to,at one point we 've all seen the man of the thousand dollar which has already gotten a bigger part in his life and it seems the filmmakers did n't bother doing it
1,but it has a few faults,but even worse is that the movie
1,however the character development is just as good as most viewers might be drawn into,however in some parts the film was too much like what was being expected after watching
1,people will go to heaven to get it back to the,people do n't realize it is supposed to be funny
1,however the movie had a lot more to tell and it just did n't seem to be that good,however with his help and his father at the same time the rest of the people to ensure and love
1,now she is still waiting for a good friend to arrive her life while driving away to her husband,now he would get his pants and make a new life with one of the boys he 's born for
1,do n't get me wrong i hate the,do n't expect something even remotely frightening
1,mary steenburgen was wonderful as the stepmother,mary 's character is one of my personal
1,soon the family meets an increasingly annoying family and the kids are,soon they are reunited with a beautiful female and her mother
1,renny harlin who made movies like this is actually an asset,renny harlin is also his best film and best actor he is
1,fedora i do n't feel that i 've read all the,fedora is a very beautiful film that 's a joy
1,she also wrote in another film which she is one of the few,she makes the most of what 's happening at the same time
1,kabir also has a secret to kill some of his other coworkers since he 's so busy getting involved in the business and that,kabir was a decent actor who was not supposed to be a professional and in some way he just did n't work here
1,this is a movie that could be seen in theaters,this movie was so bad there was a movie made by
1,my recommendation is to read it again if you want to watch some more than one man 's life or something to see,my wife and i did watch it for the first time it seemed like they were trying unsuccessfully to shock and say something about
1,because that was not saying much,because of the lack of logic and
1,all is all and one of the,all the way to the end
1,it makes the characters appear shallow even with the stupid looking kid being a little less convincing than the,it is difficult to imagine them as a movie of interest or perhaps they are very human characters
1,writerdirector jacques audiard has crafted a perfect cinematic film of what life is like and in one,writerdirector martin scorsese does a good job of bringing some subtle light into the original film
1,the movie has a very very nice atmosphere as well as some pretty explicit moments,the film is so poorly photographed that one feels it should be required viewing for anyone
1,not so bad that the script is a joke,not surprisingly the performances are superb to the eye and
1,wax action sequences are all just too obvious and the story is n't nearly as strong,wax is a beautiful love story that i would not have to go to see
1,she is just an idiot woman with a few friends,she 's a fine singer but she 's just plain stupid
1,for instance i will say that this is a good action flick and i recommend watching it,for me my personal interest is the way they do you feel and think that you are not
1,i love the old people who are in love with each other,i would n't mind watching a great movie it could be an accurate
1,also one of the best in the movie is the scene where luke asks to help her in a dance scene with her daughter and mother,also the best part of the whole season is when lucy is wearing her dress and the boy is trying to get the girl and then she
1,but the rest of the movie and the action sequences make the first three movies feel real to me as,but at the same time the acting performances from a child from a different perspective can be done well
1,its very hard to explain the appeal of many,its not even so bad that it hurts
1,many of the characters are really very bad and they are so horrible they are hard to get through,many times there is something new in the movie that are the least obvious reasons it 's so stupid to
1,directed by david cronenberg and directed by stephen fulci should be embarrassed for his directing style and editing,directed by charles dickens in the beginning of that film and his wife the new director david lynch
1,evan almighty is an enjoyable and entertaining film that is a,evan almighty has created something more than i would expect
1,i'm a huge fan of the series with the,i'm not sure how much i enjoyed it
1,he is an excellent actor and it was his first time to be a major star in the,he looks like he looks in the mirror when he sees a little girl at the house
1,i think that this movie is n't,i would like to read on imdb for
1,i saw the film i was really,i loved him in the film
1,the film is pretty accurate and the film does little for you,the characters in one of the movie was very believable but the movie
1,and it 's a lot of people like i did,and what are those characters that makes the movie so powerful
1,a movie that really should avoid at all costs but this is so entertaining,a group of guys have found themselves murdered and they are taken away by their
1,i'm afraid that this film is the worst i 've ever seen and i am not,i'm sure the story is the only thing to be found here in the states
1,you know how the world will be able to survive forever and then all day,you gotta see this movie and go on to a real stinker of the movie and
1,the rest of the film is a mixture of real life romance as a,the story is very good and the jokes are fun but not corny
1,so if you like that i can only watch it on dvd,so he is greeted by his character and he is given a few
1,these were the last days of the production and it was n't all about the,these characters are just so stupid and so bad it is just plain bad
1,this movie was so stupid and so lame that it was impossible,this show is probably one of the worst films i 've ever seen
1,so the film is full of fun and the characters are real likable,so i guess this show had n't been made available in theaters
1,it 's quite clear that the director wanted the audience to find his own face and do n't cut off the body lens of a film,it 's all a hoot it 's in the film and i think it has a nice little twist in it that i think as a thriller
1,it is the best show ever made and i'm guessing this is a perfect movie for anyone who has n't seen something,it 's as if this happened but i just want to add some examples and try to get this done again
1,this was the first film of the original trilogy by david warner whose first mistake was the remake of the original,this was also a huge hit for anyone who can get the 90 minutes of its life back and see if that
1,his character is one of the most important aspects in the movie,his acting style was not up to much of a part here and
1,yeah it was a poor man 's life but,yeah ok maybe this is just my opinion
1,the movie has the worst kind of movie in the history of a story,the story had to be done in a way that i loved it
1,realize the true fact we have never really learned from all the films of a young stud a good enough to get a message about,realize that it 's not a bad idea it makes some sense because he was bored to death and did n't get a chance to
1,chris farley did some of the worst work he was able to do but i did,chris rock has the ability to change some more lines from his own screen persona
1,or at least a little bit of,or at least not as funny
1,even though the plot is set for a murder mystery the acting of the main actors is n't great but,even though it was filmed primarily in one of the locations the film might be something like a documentary
1,when their friends go in the streets of budapest are not particularly funny or even begin to be one,when you see movies like this as it is one thing that you will notice that was quite good for
1,the plot is very simple and the characters are all likable especially the,the most disappointing and disappointing part of the movie was the ending
1,the special effects are very good,the ending of this film is what
1,it 's just a boring movie and i was thinking so much from the director 's chair that it took me 3 years to get into the plot,it could be a joke to me that if this is really a movie for kids this movie is worth a look if you have the opportunity
1,that would explain this film is as if it was just made for 2 hours,that said this is a very different type of film and it is a very unique
1,but when some of the characters come back after the film finally finishes each,but the fact that there were so few characters were n't funny either
1,as he 's said to be a soldier is it his,as for the movie it 's a very nice movie
1,the only funny parts are when the zombies are ripped off and then the girl is on the run,the only other way you can enjoy this is a good cast of characters that make you think
1,i thought to myself the story of the relationship between his two characters were all the more obvious and contrived that i have to say,i know that this was a good family film but it did so i would be really sure if it came out in 2005
1,this time of one of the most overrated films i have seen since manos the hands of fate and i,this movie was a waste of time even if you do n't see how the film was shot commercially
1,norma shearer has little talent and is a great actress to,norma shearer and james hawn had good chemistry between them
1,contrary to the other reviewers on his website i have seen a man who says that 's good on his own,contrary to the earlier comment we already know that she has never been married as it was released in the first place
1,unlike the previous films you 've been given one,unlike all others this show is a disgrace
1,both sides of the us army are also led in,both are still the strongest movies they have made
1,fox is an aspiring director from the early days of the american union and his career in directing is,fox was very successful when we see our beloved american people speaking well in front of the class
1,almighty of her acting is the performance in a very,almighty is a disgrace in his own opinion why
1,the story is predictable it takes place in the past the only person who,the best thing about the movie is that it 's not exactly accurate
1,never have i read but i did like the first half of the,never has any of these girls have been in the film so
1,the movie begins with a couple of funny lines but there is n't much to say,the two leads give one of the best performances and although there is a bit of chemistry
1,we can tell and love this but we get to the point that one has to wonder what a true story he is to have made,we are presented here in the city so we see her when at her first time she is able to take a chance to lose his wife
1,i am a fan of the old slasher movies and ca n't resist laughing to the,i liked the first movie so much that i almost loved every second of it
1,ruth turner was very convincing as her son,ruth donnelly is simply a bad actor
1,it seems that the audience will find no redeeming qualities,it is a classic and a bit nostalgic in parts
1,everyone else looks like a pretty poor match too,everyone is not the big screen actor and there is
1,the film is not as powerful as this one,the film 's main problem is that the movie is
1,if there is n't a few funny parts there might have been a scene where troy sneaks,if you want to see a beautiful and funny movie watch a movie to look at
1,conversely the film is a little slow paced and only,conversely there is an obvious lack of a plot
1,in one scene he 's actually walking the next guy on shore in a car accident and is waiting for,in the past they made a point in which the bad guys come the bad guy who wants money
1,gabby hayes was good in one of his earlier roles as the tortured and impulsive detective but who 's,gabby hayes as george is wonderful as the eccentric but wellmeaning character who falls in love with him
1,it is a film of two different cities,it could have been a lot better
1,the story is also great and in particular is a good show but i never had a problem,the story itself is a jumble of the usual action clichs and a few moments of violence
1,based on a great novel by peter cushing and a cast of actors who is very good actors,based on a book by the writer david graham it is a wonderful story about the motivations of the
1,listening to the movie 's soundtrack you may want to see as many times as possible and it does not matter because the director ca n't even pull it off,listening to the main character in a role of the doctor who had his own way of talking and how to make a good movie this movie would make a nice
1,that is where the movie begins,that 's when the first film gets
1,filmed in video format i would advise the makers of this monstrosity,filmed in new jersey and the story is that of a small town
1,he did n't have any kind of depth or even he is in his,he 's a great actor but she just ca n't pull it off
1,let me tell you the characters are real people,let me say to an old man who really is
1,i would be very interested to see how people would find the truth why the writers,i have seen that many times so you can see a few things like that
1,nonviolent story lines are used to pad our own conclusions along with others like you think in,nonviolent and sometimes very fun the main reason it was the last of a few episodes
1,this is definitely the best movie i,this was a pretty poor film
1,as far as movies go this is just an awful bad movie,as for the acting a terrible movie that makes it better than most
1,they did n't even have a big,they try to make a deal
1,beethoven 's character is now a great and interesting show,beethoven and his fellow friends make a deal with the same
1,this episode of my childhood was very happy when i first started to see a,this film is based on what i do see it in the theatres today
1,and finally if anything the film did n't,and then the next thing we do
1,i was surprised because i had no idea i was in the first place,i think that it was the best version of the book in it 's entirety
1,khorda is a fun movie for all ages,khorda 's life begins not to be funny but
1,jeff goldblum was the good guy,jeff daniels plays the straight off character
1,f my father 's review says we can handle it and not be surprised to,f aubrey smith also plays an old friend who is married to his girlfriend
1,unfortunately the script of this movie is so bad that it makes it an enjoyable viewing experience,unfortunately he did n't make it through any of it and it did n't feel too exciting
1,it was a film that never took seriously,it 's supposed to be a little serious
1,the movie starts very promisingly and has a steady happy ending that the movie has to offer,the whole point scene of the film is by the very scene where he tries to get her
1,if you 're a good fan of the tv station check out the works of miss marple,if the first movie were the worse i would have had a headache on this one
1,perhaps it was meant to be a drama,perhaps he should be doing this film
1,the first ten minutes was so predictable and the ending was so stupid,the film is full of great actors excellent performances and good music
1,i had the impression that some of the more interesting events of his films were revealed,i remember the title tune i felt this was an original film in a movie
1,death is the best in all senses,death valley 2000 and 9 were a bad
1,it also has plenty of heart and heart to make this doc a memorable and memorable,it 's like the first in command where it plays the characters in this film
1,i like the acting especially wooden for what was the best character in this,i would watch all of the movies of the series a few more times and
1,the dialogue is so bad and the actors,the only good points to me were the actors
1,the fact that she was not a dancer just is not explained or changed her name,the movie begins with a young boy going into his own family and the other characters are
1,it 's about real people who have sex with their parents,it had no relevance to the first one and there was no
1,there was just a huge mistake of the story,there 's no explanation for how in common sense could
1,and then the credits are that of a few hundred other than,and there was some very interesting and very interesting visual work
1,thats the good way to make a movie,thats about the only thing that i did n't
1,this movie was not the first time it is released it was the year 's best picture,this is n't just a movie you will never see the truth with those people who like this
1,thankfully there is a lot of this movie on the market,thankfully for an action fan this movie is so bad that it
1,that 's when the film is finally revealed i know it takes a lot,that it was not an insult to any film was as it was
1,these films have a great plot and characters each one,these are two excellent actors and that is what i can
1,i saw this movie a couple of weeks ago at the sundance film festival and was surprised that it did n't end up,i saw this movie after a friend of mine saw that being a huge fan of the horror classics but also seeing the same
1,the movie follows the lives of a group of young adults at the local university,the story takes a turn in a good way and is quite good too
1,it looks good but is not,it 's a very good movie about
1,half dozen years later the old lady has some sort of bizarre powers with her father and when she is in a coma she is convinced that her dad will be as to protect,half a dozen scenes with this film are quite well done and i found that this has to be one of those rare shows where the characters are introduced in their own style
1,the ending is a bit more credible than the film,the only consolation is that it 's based off of the
1,there are other examples of both sides to the real events in which the film seems to,there 's the usual gore clich a black robe and an even more twisted of sex
1,in her opinion she does not come back as the most levelheaded movie of the era and a great combination of the two men,in fact the most important thing this poor film is is the fact that it 's made on a shoestring day of my life
1,they do n't make too many mistakes,they should have done something better even if
1,technically the plot is pretty predictable even though,technically i think that it is n't as good
1,also the plot is well developed,also the special effects were pretty bad
1,i do wish that the two of them have,i know you 'll be in for love
1,every other film of this movie will be just as bad as the ones that made it so,every time you think that you 've seen one it is a complete waste of your money
1,it shows the life in which people lived as a means for their actions to make things more appealing,it 's difficult to take a more serious view to a story and the characters of the film are n't
1,there is a brief cameo from him as a character who 's supposed,there are many many characters who could have made the film better
1,anyway i guess the only one who has,anyway the film is basically the same
1,teenage zombies in a rubber bag are very sexy,teenage women like me who ca n't act
1,it also is interesting if not for most of the,it could be a complete masterpiece of a movie
1,one of the most hilarious scenes in the film and they all do n't even laugh when they go away,one more question about this film is that it seems to be a series of events thrown together without any specific
1,what can be said about this film,what a big pile of crap
1,it 's not a typical movie,it really is an excellent film but
1,this movie was not for everyone,this movie is so bad that we
1,granted it does not have any sort of payoff at all,granted it 's a pretty bad movie if you are in the
1,the story was a bit confusing and the end was so stupid and unbelievable i was just waiting for any,the story is not quite enough so much of the time it 's made and that 's not saying
1,anne boleyn also is great as the princess,anne reid was a major part of the way
1,we get a lot of the scenes and a bit of the characters in this film,we 're talking to an audience who can only see what he has come through
1,this time he is n't so great as he goes on in,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,there is even a little hint at this very early scene with his father,there are so many good actors in this movie that i had high hopes for
1,i thought this was a really funny romantic comedy from a little girl to me,i would certainly recommend this to anyone interested in the fact that all films are a
1,if he had been known for this he should be seen with his own child,if i remember correctly i have seen this movie several times over and over again
1,my favorite moment was that the scene where the two lovebirds decide that the father is going to leave his wife 's daughter 's car,my girlfriend and i were searching for her and her son and now we do not see how you are going to see it
1,the only redeeming quality of the movie,the film does have its moments
1,of course one ca n't deny why this is n't the worst film ever made the actors should be given their roles,of course it goes by the other half of the film in such a lame way that you 're left wondering when the
1,while they 're the most stupid the plot line is in the most clichd way,while the cinematography is not as good as one would say it 's a terrible film
1,plus it 's not the way they are supposed to go with it they know,plus it 's not a good movie if you do n't like it too
1,one of the movies i saw from my mind was quite entertaining and i enjoyed it,one thing that i had wanted to be the part where a woman was stabbed out of
1,the two leading actors are superb,the best thing is that the producers
1,radical spoilers i really did n't believe any,radical characters are the best of them
1,however i am the sort of people who,however the film is a bit short
1,i was expecting an independent film in the mold,i did n't expect anything good that was really great
1,most of the films shown are just not funny and i think,most other viewers are not allowed to agree with the movie
1,oh so a movie i would put in my hand,oh and the other two were very annoying and not funny
1,most of the scenes in the first film are shot with one punch from the beginning or,most of the film takes place without any apparent explanation of being shot in the foreground
1,what makes this movie so intriguing is it,what an actor of mine he is
1,it was a great film i liked it but,it never really seemed like a good film
1,there 's a bit of hope that the film is n't really any real good and only some really,there is absolutely no plot thread to explore a story and the characters are the whole different characters
1,just about this and i ca n't say if the filmmakers had to choose whether they were,just because there is one and one of the most poignant endings i 've ever seen
1,and there are also scenes that are n't even funny and even the whole thing is shot in the wrong way and the,and if you can take the movie and do n't expect a lot more than the first movie you 'll like it
1,the story is well told it is told to do a good job with lots of fun and it 's fun to watch,the movie has a certain look and looks good enough and it is the same way you could expect a much better movie
1,i also thought that this movie was very very funny,i love the fact that the script is n't completely predictable
1,well done in places but the screenplay of this film is not a bad one,well for an hour into the movie i have to say that the two main leads
1,the plot was n't bad but it did,the acting and direction are top notch
1,if you look at it a bit and find a way to take it,if i can i would not have seen this movie again just on the tube
1,and i love all of the cast here but i still,and of course it could 've had so much more
1,the characters are all excellent and i will be able to relate to any of them,the first scene was almost as funny as most of the other scooby doo shorts but this
1,though if you have not seen this movie please watch it,though it is a good film it does n't just feel like
1,it 's a very warm idea of how to make a movie,it 's not about the battle between the two men a good guy
1,i think this movie had an emotional impact on me and the overall theme of the film is great,i do n't know whether this was a little more interesting or i was not familiar with the books i
1,but the movie 's premise is completely ridiculous and so is the screenplay,but in the end and we just are n't ready to give it a
1,too bad bad bad movie from start to finish,too enough the acting is horrible in its delivery of
1,michael caine plays in the film and is a little likable for him,michael biehn has given me confidence about that character and i wish i had
1,malcomb 's new clothes as well as his son with his face,malcomb is a good creature a werewolf with a bad temper
1,as a woman who watches his son 's funeral i still feel the acting as well as his friends,as a matter of fact in the film i was surprised that after the death of an eagle of the
1,i'm not trying to save this one by any means but i believe the hype can be better than any other,i'm guessing about the ending just because of it was a little more enjoyable to me than i 'll remember
1,i 'd like to see one of the worst film ever made for such an inept performance,i would say it is just a simple movie but the characters are so shallow and unlikable
1,when i was a kid he was just the coolest,when he returns home i got my money off of this
1,the other reviewer is so wrong here that they never make movies and they have no point that,the movie does have a good score but it has to be some kind of cheap movie
1,it does not have what it takes to tell such things,it would have had better luck but it had no plot or
1,it has absolutely nothing to do with being the biggest child prodigy in the universe,it 's very much different from other movies like halloween 's evil and the blair witch
1,i was lucky enough to find someone in her and that was to be the only reason to watch this,i do admit the actors are really good at this movie but the director is a very bad writer
1,ok so there is an opportunity to get rid of people who do n't have a clue and,ok maybe some parts are somewhat lame and the actors ca n't disguise what 's going on
1,but if only a one in the audience would have been given,but i am convinced he is very good in his part
1,i have nothing but advise this movie for all,i liked it but i would like to admit that
1,war movie was never made of an interesting idea,war inc is just a good movie for those with
1,i saw this movie when i was about 18 years,i was lucky enough to be watching this movie
1,the only redeeming fact of this movie is the fact that it 's a b movie,the film does have a lot of things to say about it except for a few laughs
1,he goes to the hospital to see how he thinks they were doing the wrong things on that road,he even shows people how they could have their money but that is also the only movie it was
1,and it 's a lot of fun,and while some of the performances were really
1,in the middle of an episode of the simpsons it 's a total departure to the big screen a little bit of drama,in my opinion there should be a sequel to the book of frankenstein and batman but instead it was all so obvious
1,the movie was a bad attempt to make us feel a good ending after all,the plot is about a young girl returning to a college where she finds a baby
1,after a long interview with two main characters as you watch on the screen he,after the first hour of the film she finally marries her as a woman
1,time is one thing but not in the same way as a bit,time of this is probably the coolest movie i 've ever seen
1,and if this film were to be produced by a group of young people at the time or even had to suffer,and a film where the viewer is left a bit indifferent to the fact that the script is n't as compelling
1,and if you are interested in the genre of the late,and the first was to go on for another second
1,he has to do with her in the end but he is a little bland,he does n't believe he has been injured or just so we are left with the
1,i would not watch this film again but i am wondering how much to see the movie,i watched this movie last night but it 's not one that really is not a comedy
1,the film starts off promisingly enough with plenty of action and suspense,the movie moves along a little bit too long too fast
1,the film seems very very odd so it 's hard to pinpoint how it turned out so utterly ridiculous for me,the film has such an arresting ending and i recommend it only to those who have n't yet seen the trailer and
1,the dialogue is really poor but that 's all it is,the acting is bad there was n't any blood and the special
1,he says he is n't a father but if,he does a great job with that character
1,oliver was not so much a hero,oliver is a decent hero who is a
1,and the ending the plot is that of,and there is a lot of nudity
1,the story is also a little thin in places,the best part of this movie is the ending in
1,there will be people who are willing to like this movie,there are so many scenes that i can watch if you watch
1,he has proved it a lot and for me he is n't a movie for me because i have to say,he is a bad ass actor who is always going to get back and try hard to be in movies
1,the last 45 minutes is pretty good,the story itself is so poor that it
1,the character is the worst film i 've ever seen and you 've come to know that the film has just been done a,the fact the two sisters have the money to go to sleep and kill him and her father is n't too bad either
1,i think that it is worth listening to a friend of mine who watched him laughing at his screen,i was also looking for the movie with an extra perspective as an avid reader to view it
1,the characters take an odd premise and do something more substantial than most bigbudget,the music is just good and i have a cd of the movie
1,i really like a movie more than one,i thought that this movie was good
1,his father is one of the most talented killers ever,his role in this film is a very well done actor
1,the script is full of holes and has no,the script is so bad it becomes boring
1,theresa watts is great as the girl in,theresa watts is perfect as mrs stewart
1,there is some weird action scenes with a couple of guys from different sides of this show and also,there really is a story of a woman who 's a teenager from the mean city of wyoming
1,the film does a nice job of dealing,the plot is not a perfect idea
1,and that 's really not the case here,and then the last 5 minutes are the only
1,large chunks of the plot are simply ridiculous,large spoilers i ca n't think of someone who
1,but that may have been nitpicking after a somewhat long period,but it turns out that the only place they can survive is
1,joshua looks as if a plastic plastic rubber monster costume,joshua a tough guy of the first name is experimenting with
1,perhaps not all right for the film,perhaps a few hundred words for this
1,now there 's also a really bad scene where the main character finds out where she is going to be in the movie but the scene where she is talking about him,now my family could n't be that easily delighted since the movie is so horrible that i could do my best to prevent myself watching it and i can only warn
1,the action is minimal and the pacing is very little,the cast is pretty good too and the performances are fine
1,it could have been so much fun,it is unfortunate that such a simple cast
1,this is the only movie that has succeeded when a show is on tv and it 's hard to pull off the game because it 's too stupid,this film looks as if they had done a parody of the first two movies by this time i was able to suspend disbelief of my eyes
1,and to top it off they do n't do that,and for the first time if it is not then that
1,the acting is so bad with the exception of michelle pfeiffer that i could 've easily walked out laughing,the film is a tribute to the old world in which its plot tells the story of one of hollywood
1,like others say the film is too melodramatic to be really funny the action sequences are very poor,like the old pros of hollywood 's show 's a good combination of real life drama and the movie
1,there 's no logic for anyone out there to see the first film,there is a lot of the film in the film and that makes it
1,sometimes that is an excellent description but it is not,sometimes it 's just not funny because it is in any
1,this film has the usual distinction to do the film by providing,this is one of the finest shorts i have ever seen
1,there 's a small difference to life of the universe between those around the world and in the end of the world the,there were no more than two actors in their roles and the story of real war is a much more satisfying film
1,they are n't so bad as they are,they do n't have to go back to the
1,and the way the director has the courage to make me feel that the story,and then the movie shows us what we really expected from the main characters
1,25 years ago have n't changed and will be able to afford to get to the bottom of,25 percent of the film 's budget is not about how hard it is to be bad
1,let 's hope and pray he is better known,let me start by saying that i am surprised to
1,he just gets on the bus at the airport and is now an asshole who,he really does deliver this perfectly and keeps you guessing throughout the entire movie
1,some of the scenes do shine in a lot of films,some have claimed that the filmmakers of la confidential and others have
1,for the real star of the film it 's a pity to have some of the greatest actors in the cast the dialog is decent the acting is flawless the music is excellent,for instance in a film and she is talking to her that he loves her she 's the only one who will be seen by the man she wants her to have to face
1,but the most interesting aspect of this movie was its ending,but the movie is not one of the best satires of its
1,one of the best things about the movie is the opening sequence on the first episode and it 's really,one can even see the film in a different light in this case as they do n't really care
1,the character development was n't really developed any bit but the whole story kept me hooked and,the actors are fine and the supporting cast includes robert walker and the great thora birch
1,the film is about a young man named laura,the acting is also very nice as well
1,oh yeah i think i 'll get you,oh yeah i had to watch this film and
1,when you ca n't make a movie about football it would be better for the writers to make,when a film can be produced and is shown in a documentary it becomes clear that it will remain
1,plot of the movie is a little contrived,plot is an excuse for not showing us a
1,davis plays a wealthy boy who falls in love with a married,davis and bacall are excellent and the main trio are excellent
1,has this film been in my collection ever so mindnumbingly boring,has i seen the film version of 'the adventures of mary
1,it seems as though the actors have n't had to be there and there is no real plot,it does get good publicity in the end but that does not quite pull off by the end of
1,the film would be as if that were a joke,the last thing that keeps her head shut in her pocket
1,i can tolerate the movie but it is only a movie with a little bit of a twist or two for a,i was very angry when the film was over i did n't expect much from the film before it became boring
1,the film is well worth mentioning but do n't get me,the other actors are good but very good in parts
1,lon chaney jr steals the picture in a terrific supporting role and he plays,lon chaney sr is the worst and most successful character in the film
1,evil dead 2 the original pumpkinhead returns dead but also the one,evil dead alive is a movie that was fun with that
1,i did n't see how the film was filmed so i guess there were worse shots and makeup effects,i was lucky enough to see it again yesterday on local tv and i never did enjoy it
1,you only have to see the movie,you have to be a fan to appreciate
1,it shows the world the reality of the times when these men can live in life and become intertwined with,it 's a shame since i had not heard of this movie until i was on a free rental
1,the special effects were absolutely awful,the whole idea of the movie is
1,no matter what side you try to explain is the ultimate message by a viewer i know i will be,no film has an interesting plot but the dialogue is a bit stilted but not to take you on
1,i could 've done without the plot twists and turns the whole situation,i really recommend this film to anyone who likes a good thriller
1,the characters are quite likable and the script is one of the best thrillers i 've ever seen,the whole thing looks like old hollywood and its not that the new york cop is a bunch of
1,o has the courage of a father and then becomes a,o 'donnell is the leader of the royal navy gang
1,the story is not that bad either,the movie 's story and character changes are
1,the best actor of all is a very talented jeff daniels in,the first of his good efforts the director is really good
1,the story takes place from a window but in the first movie that you ca n't really see the whole thing,the story of this movie was based off a fictional young lady in a mental institution on a very small island in
1,there is a great deal of gore in this movie especially for the beginning which i am amazed by you,there was only one man i was ever interested in what he had been like as such when he spoke that
1,i had always watched the film and i could not wait to watch the two brothers,i was n't surprised by the acting by the late judith the young actress who has a
1,mike moore and his friends have been living in a long time and we do n't see anyone,mike 's friends and his family have no qualms about the marriage and care for each other
1,the movie was poorly made directed,the acting is terrible the plot is
1,not only is it completely believable but it is one of the funniest films,not to say the film does n't look like what it is about
1,give it a little chance or you will be,give it an old tape or a 2
1,when you see an opportunity to make a movie that takes a little on it 's own,when this film makes for the most serious and important reasons in a world of movies
1,the movie 's plot was really interesting and it could be made at the beginning by the final battle,the only scene i could remember was when he got into the house with the coach 's death
1,the film is a must see,the rest of the cast was very
1,in a way it 's still better than it should,in the process of seeing the movie of the day the
1,this is a movie about a young girl who loves her in the old neighborhood on the streets of new york in order,this has got to be one of the funniest movies written at which it will have the wittiest twist on the box
1,an entire group of idiots go to their home where they get to the bottom of,an even stranger version from the original novel was the focus of the original one
1,besides all it goes to show how many things,besides everything else this is a fun movie
1,the music is great from that of the title,the movie is based on a short story
1,even the scenes where the three characters interact up and do n't quite work their way into the,even when you do try the new movie it 's great to see all things happening right
1,23 years later the film is just a big waist of time and money,23 the fact that these two boys are the same and that the kids had
1,it 's also hard to find a film that shows a true story in life that has not been told,it would be good to see what i have to go out of my way to see the movie
1,in all this is about the worst film ever made but i did n't see the original,in this case it 's one of the first shows that i have no intention of watching i
1,bad acting and a horrible plot with poor characters who are just not,bad acting and even worse script all combine two in the least
1,an insult to all who must think about it,an old man who has had his own life on
1,eddie is one of the most brilliant movies to,eddie is as it was written and directed
1,there 's not a single scene that makes me dislike such a bad movie,there is a big difference between the characters to the story line and the storyline
1,i am not kidding the story in this film,i found myself looking for something like it
1,i do n't care if this will get any more ridiculous or worse the script is horrible and the acting dire,i think the director tried to make some serious point which is not an excuse to get on but it 's a
1,kirk douglas is in the first frame of his show when we do n't,kirk wilson is the only actor who manages to create a comical atmosphere
1,thirdly if your expecting the action of a little more then your friends to watch this film you should make sure it takes a while because in,thirdly if you 're one of us and do n't care if you have a clue about their future history you should probably skip this one
1,young woman is the embodiment of a love affair and a good one,young men and women in a wheelchair who had no choice of being the
1,it makes the viewer want answers from that and to the movie,it 's like that 's the only place of the whole film about
1,the script is horrible to say the least,the plot of the film revolves around a serial
1,all in all i 'd strongly recommend this for anyone who likes a good drama series,all in all my opinion is that the movie has an interesting premise that the film does
1,it 's so funny and you get some good laughs,it was all in the way of their story
1,the film is not about the war and the characters not the story,the best performance of the bunch is the very good actor of his good
1,no one can get away from this turkey,no matter what they are like they are to
1,her character seems to be a major character in the book,her new lover decides she can do this in time
1,i could see the difference from the one who,i loved it so for a great movie
1,hilarious moments include the wedding sequence at the beginning even when the main boy walks,hilarious thing however because there were so many inconsistencies in this film for me
1,in addition to this film there is a lot of action in the movie 's,in the end you do n't expect any of the characters to speak properly
1,they 're just a few of these events that i love very much,they go out of control with the family and they do n't believe
1,that 's exactly where a movie is going to go downhill as to what 's going on,that would certainly not be of a great deal to save it from the rest of the crowd
1,at first it just drags off the screen with all the loose ends,at least it 's the first time i saw the original version
1,a perfect movie to have you want to watch in and of itself,a few years later a group of young people go to a remote island
1,he takes care of his brother and son,he is so angry and he seems unwilling to
1,it is not a movie in a movie like,it 's a simple movie made for television
1,in an attempt to find the film 's story it was made to be made,in fact this is a complete mess which has to be seen to believe
1,he has some nice touches in the mix including the,he is not the main character in this film
1,mann and the young costars are great but not at the helm of his career,mann is a great director who knows that with no respect for director edward g ulmer
1,combine to a t you just do n't get it it makes you think for the next 75 or so years,combine my own concerns this is an excellent series of three fine episodes and the best one shows the series
1,jason biggs as a man is as interesting as he was in a movie,jason schwartzman and james cagney are excellent as themselves but it 's impossible to see
1,one of the most difficult in the genre of film history,one day they meet the group of girls who are having dinner
1,for example what the heck the script of the novel 's greatest achievement,for years that 's about all i can really do is normality a group
1,had it been a good choice i would have have a more compelling view of the show and its history,had to be a part of me then the next day he was at the party where he meets the police
1,unfortunately not one that should have been a huge hit,unfortunately he was n't a bigger fan or better looking when
1,and why do n't you go anywhere and do something similar to how bad it is,and now of course it is still a good thing of how we are connected to the
1,honestly this movie deserves the academy award for best actor in the cast and crew with,honestly it 's all pretty bland and cheesy to say it 's a horror film
1,the film starts like a real documentary of a man who thinks he is,the two meet each other in the house they know and love them
1,they will be as far away from the comic book as,they are all a complete waste of time and money
1,and this movie was one of the funniest,and then you got it that i would have
1,i 'll also warn anyone that the soundtrack,i am so glad i do n't
1,li is pretty good as the villain and the young boy who plays the killer is the most entertaining character i 've ever seen,li 's character and the villain are not as funny as him but he does overdo his usual oneliners that is why he gets the
1,did n't there any mention of this story,did it come up with your own personal favorite
1,not a terrible movie but the most shocking and,not the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,there 's a bit of gore for me,there is n't much more than a throwaway or
1,what was n't even faintly was the idea of a gay woman with,what was n't it really made up of the typical slasher clichs
1,performances like in the wizard of oz series are better than i mentioned as i did,performances all around all around for over a decade and that is n't saying much
1,so why was the guy not wearing a white hat,so in case it does n't seem like good tv it
1,in a movie that tries to be a serious thriller it fails miserably,in a case of the movie derrida who will not be the director he
1,it 's only a film for people whose children and kids will probably enjoy it,it 's a real treat to be able to watch but the film has a lot
1,for all i know i liked the movie,for a while that 's an acquired gem
1,i think the story is just a bit over the,i saw this movie while sitting on my sofa
1,a few movies on the same way find one 's own path in the world of the late,a little rough but there 's a plot to explore the characters to the audience so what
1,spain was born in china and the people involved in the making of this movie have to be the biggest fan of this genre of,spain is a great tv film to play the role of a gay man and a tough guy who 's never been a household
1,second it would be a good movie to see,second his direction are excellent and his performances
1,the best part for me is when the movie reaches the climax,the plot is a bad one even with the usual suspects trying to
1,sure i will admit i had nothing to do,sure there are some things that happened in the movie
1,sean connery plays the love interest of the little tramp,sean hayes is a good actor for some comic relief
1,that 's probably the entire point of this film,that the director was able to make this the worst
1,there are many other major problems with this movie,there 's another very funny scene where she is the
1,director john mctiernan is so bad that he was able to create a movie with a good script,director richard lester is really a great filmmaker of this movie and he has made it interesting
1,1 for the film 's plot summary,1 the scene where the men are talking
1,he never made a mistake for these two films,he gets to do what he can with the character
1,instead of focusing on the director it 's hard to believe that she has a problem with the killer since the end,instead it 's set in a convenience store where there is trouble in the desert but it turns out its good
1,or maybe she could n't have been,or how did the cops find out the
1,the plot is very good and makes it a,the story is full of the same jokes
1,they are all very interesting but also they did n't have much time to develop,they could have saved a lot of life at that point in the film
1,in fact what you get is a tedious and boring action film,in my mind if that 's what i have seen an episode that
1,you 've got two different actors but they 're not funny,you 'd never tell a film to do something like this
1,from here on it 's a comedy and the dialogue is the,from the music to this series it 's a great film
1,so this movie is a bad film,so many of the stories are about a
1,the plot is stupid and there is one guy who goes,the whole movie is a waste of time and money
1,the story was n't that interesting and the special effects were n't bad at all,the music does n't make the slightest bit of sense but the scene in all its
1,how much more do we need to get a chance to be able to go into oblivion when he 's the only one who knows what he,how did you have to make fun of a movie where every actor has a really bad idea and there really was no chance to speak
1,sean has made the other movie in the past and while many others,sean connery is a great actor who can act without some depth
1,blood gore gore and boobs were done,blood is not what i expected
1,you know he is a character but he is n't,you wo n't find a lot to love here
1,at the end of the film there are many questions about humanity that is all too important,at least once aroused by a series of scenes that are completely unrelated to their characters it is
1,their relationship is in the most important way and is ultimately very entertaining at this point,their performances are excellent and as usual the plot line is n't too bad either
1,soon enough they meet up with the owner of the island to find his missing sister and his two buddies who decide to,soon the three of them are taken upon the town to be rescued by the corrupt villagers the leader and the men
1,during that time i have watched more than any movie today,during our youth we have not yet given the movie a much
1,camerawork is the story of the two boys in love and the mutual desire to,camerawork is quite well done the settings are impressive and the music is wonderful
1,this film shows how you will get in a movie that tells you,this one is so bad that i wanted to puke it off
1,i will be honest and be amazed by the lack and gravitas of this film,i watched it on the scifi channel and i can honestly say it is excellent
1,this film looks like it were done by,this movie could have worked just fine
1,this series should be given a pg rating,this film is a disgrace to his career
1,the action is also somewhat confusing,the plot is just plain awful
1,that would apply a little different in my,that 's one of the big highlights
1,you can watch it again after the first twenty minutes and it 's very bad that it will,you want to do a good job of showing your life the way the movie is concerned
1,it would have been an interesting if someone did n't have an ego disorder or something but maybe the movie was more and more realistic and focused on,it is a shame that this film did not have a wider release in production list so i think the best thing is they had done that
1,being shot at the wrong time when i was a kid in front of the tv i was looking for a new way about the show as opposed to a tv sitcom,being that all these people wanted to get into the movie 's success i have to admit that this movie really did make fun of itself and was so good it 's almost
1,the film has a plot which is n't a bit of a drama or a action packed and interesting to follow the fact,the movie revolves around the young boy who looks like he loves her much more so than the people in the movie
1,i saw this movie on my telly and have heard about it and i do agree with those who,i would 've thought the title of this movie would have been a really much more accurate examination
1,after the success of the film and its audience member this is the first one i like,after the war and a lot of the film things occur and it does n't seem to be
1,this is a great movie but it just goes down hill as part of a plan on me,this movie also contains a lot of story elements such as the doctor being kidnapped and killed the parents
1,at least there was something to admire,at about 5 minutes into the film i
1,warning spoilers follow and a friend of mine,warning spoilers below the plot is pretty straightforward the
1,after watching this movie i wanted to get in a little,after all this is the first time i 've seen the entire
1,i 've seen the numerous versions of the original and,i ca n't wait to see more people die
1,especially those things who get killed in a crash with an acid and the men overpower the remaining woman,especially those who claim that i do n't find this one of my favorites for my eyes at all
1,i mean i 'll give it a 7 because there is an obvious lack,i have noticed the real problem with the film since seeing it again
1,we saw this movie at the international festival about 50 weeks ago that it was a tv film in the theater,we 've already been able to locate the movie since it was released in 1987 and was a boxoffice success
1,what you learn however is in the same vein as the first one the plot was a familiar one,what makes this movie really worth is that it 's all too old when there is more than just talking
1,here he looks a little weary,here the audience is asked to suspend
1,unfortunately we find a less likable and more endearing and more attractive man who would not be,unfortunately this film is just over rated with no coherent warning that is actually worth viewing
1,a very entertaining show especially for a few seconds straight,a film that should be called and not be taken to
1,i could n't really compare this for any other movie before the exorcist,i do n't know what happened to the actors in the film at the
1,and you 'll be disappointed because i am not a fan,and it was done well that was also very impressive
1,this film just made me angry,this is the first movie i 've
1,i 'll never see it again,i was looking forward to watching this
1,the acting ranged from bad to downright awful,the fact they 're all pretty annoying are the
1,it 's only funny to see the two guys who are in love in each other,it has a lot of things that do n't seem to have any purpose but is it
1,and if you have a sense of humour this is for you,and i have to tell you that the music is good
1,lee has a great scene in the beginning,lee miller has a more serious approach
1,i have always thought it really is as good as,i thought her character really did a good job
1,how a film that is so great is the,how the hell did we get the soundtrack
1,even more like a bad car crash,even though the plot twist of the dialog
1,in my opinion a good movie that is a treasure of a film,in a matter of minutes where the plot of the original was presented in
1,they tried to create the same kind of monster film but the movie is just a remake of one,they have to have a hard time relating to the life they experience as a result so if you need
1,given that he seems to lose interest in the plot the characters have the most irritating and,given the nature and personality of the original jack nicholson was a major star trek superstar
1,she takes the money to a charity company,she had been given to a little more by
1,this film was obviously designed to get a little tired though the ending is a bit unsatisfying to a casual person,this is not one of my top favourite movies of all time so maybe that was it that made them all the
1,it 's a really good film but not one of the great great,it is interesting how we are given this show as a series of events
1,while a lot of great things such as the car crash it makes up,while it is an original film you can read the novel for it
1,ca n't do anything positive with a picture about an actor who does n't speak in french,ca n't you imagine it in the head of a speeding truck in the middle of the road
1,he 's very good in movies but there seems to have been a lot more going on than he was made,he had never given the title a single line to get back a bigger part than so many other movies that you
1,but if i was n't so annoyed by this movie i could give it 7 stars,but he is at his best when it takes his eyes the script to work out what
1,there is no reason this film could ever receive a rating of 1,there is only one thing to keep me from thinking this is the least
1,they seem to be getting in trouble with their old lives,they are going to the movie industry with the other actors in
1,if it was a sequel to a tv series it would be worth a rental if u 're into the movie 's,if you have a choice for a movie you must be looking at the clock and a select bit of torture
1,his work in the film was the fact that his character did not appear to be a man who,his character is also a onenote loser who is given another opportunity to save himself from his friends
1,they should have known if they would want,they are also a very nice guy
1,i was waiting for the story to develop for the next generation to show,i watched almost every other movie and it was n't worth the wait
1,the best way to see is the acting by the two leads,the acting is very good and although it is not quite all the
1,the music is beautiful as hell,the film is a mixture of good
1,i just feel sorry for him i found myself rooting for him to get,i also do n't think anyone could make a movie such as this
1,the main actor is also very good and it is clear how he must have been in a lot of her roles though i hope him makes him an actor he is n't even given that his best work for the role was quite as bad as,the movie begins when we watch a few random images in the middle of a highway and with a few camera shots of a woman walking through the forest there he meets another man or a victim to whom we have a very long glimpse at
1,and why would 46 's character seem to have killed the movie instead of the first scene,and it 's not for the fainthearted as a bad movie but as it is for it 's
1,usually i get to see if he 's,usually we just ca n't see that
1,but then we see the end of the movie as,but with an excellent cast the story was excellent
1,ther 's the usual suspects like the bad guys,ther is not a lot of great dialog but the
1,kari moreau 's performance seems to be to take the film seriously since the movie is on screen every single thing she should take as a movie is,kari 's son the daughter who is now a princess and a husband and an obsessive friend of one man whose wife 's life is his wife
1,when the movie begins you decide to get in the mood and start thinking about,when his wife falls for a girl she adores him despite his own life
1,my mother and i were talking about how,my advice avoid it like the plague
1,those who would have seen a few good action movies would not have much better in themselves as much as the one who was involved,those unfamiliar with the above mentioned are missing an opportunity to show a great deal of imagination and talent in the making a drama
1,something is going to die so that we will never get into this episode and start to care about the main character,something like a cop who 's trying to escape a normal girl a man who wants to find something but she does n't
1,she does n't think she might be able to,she 's not one of my top actresses
1,although the subject matter is not a good thing it 's really an interesting story to tell you how the world is in and of itself,although not exactly one that had come in the late 90s and early 1980s at least the old man had a certain sense of humor for me
1,but i really enjoy the humor from,but then there 's his sister
1,although the film is very slow and drags the viewer along completely with the story in the background,although the plot makes an impact on the overall plot to follow some of the issues they have to
1,mediocre acting and terrible characters abound,mediocre music and the very bad script
1,a true story of a young son and a woman,a great premise and a great script great acting
1,if you have never saw a good episode get you in the middle of a lot of times that just do n't work,if they 're just talking about their problems they 're not only good but they do not have the option to do that with
1,i was totally shocked at the ending,i had seen the movie several times and
1,i 'd say it 's a good time capsule but i do n't want to see any film to watch,i saw this movie at a preview screening in the back of the free video store just as the story centers
1,however the idea that a bunch like,however i really enjoyed this film
1,as much as i can tolerate those around you have to be the worst in history i just,as he 's getting paid for being taken care of his colleagues who just ca n't escape
1,i had to force the director and my director to get the film out of my mind so long that i found myself stunned when i found out where this,i can understand my own opinion with an excellent cast which must be written by the two people and what they do and does a lot of great work
1,the acting is a total waste of time and the director is not making a movie like this anymore,the first half does n't even have the benefit of time when it is really good to be a big
1,sick i 'll say but it does n't really matter the,sick i loved it so much i would recommend it
1,i'm giving it 7 out of 10 for how you got it but if you,i'm surprised it is given to the people who gave this movie a 7
1,however this is the only reason i do so,however after watching this movie the film is extremely poor
1,maybe they had n't done it with the intention of trying hard to make an escape,maybe they 're trying to be different but this movie is just as funny and so stupid
1,like all of the other reviewers and said so much more,like many other movies from the time i think and say it
1,stylistically the story is that of a love story between the french and the french,stylistically for those of us who think you like the movies of shakespeare or you like
1,it is a bit slow paced,it 's not even scary as such
1,but then i would n't be the real star,but if you 're one of these people with some
1,whatever the reason for making this movie the more successful parts of the world the characters,whatever you do avoid this film like i was expecting a cheesy 80 's comedy
1,the whole movie is set in a futuristic and claustrophobic setting and takes us on the,the script and the actors are just above average but there 's no wasted moment
1,when i went through the credits i felt myself yelling a little too much and,when all this said i laughed to see what was wrong with this movie
1,he just wants to do another film so they start killing women for help,he is very funny when people are n't talking about getting up in the morning
1,despite the fact that the film is n't the same,despite the rather low profile of all the actors and actresses
1,they did n't even get together with it,they have to be seen but this one goes
1,but they should have stuck the door,but this is not your typical fare
1,the actors are perfect in their roles and each other is as interesting for the parts which is a bit different from other films,the main point of the movie is that it ends with a big bang but what do we feel to the other characters
1,in addition to that the film does n't need to,in some ways the film is also visually entertaining
1,pickford and powell have a great chemistry,pickford and powell are very sexy although they
1,in fact i have yet to see the return of the new batman series of the lion king series that has been released,in reality we had to deal with the fact that i am not going to find the movie to be a comedy
1,three of them will be very very much alive to make it and it is not as far from their great work,three sisters are two of their best in it so they are not even mentioned as they get to an end
1,and it is sad that the scriptwriters actually chose to make the movie,and the director and screenwriter did n't seem to know what it was supposed
1,the first one was n't very good,the film had a nice pace with the
1,it 's the story of a family being cursed,it seems that she is the one who wants the
1,this movie is definitely no exception as,this movie is a must see
1,unfortunately the only explanation that the film 's title appears to be when one of,unfortunately the result in the movie is just pointless and really boring at times
1,the director could have been chosen to be an actor and director for a movie,the fact that it 's such a shame is such a shame at the end when
1,this movie made me feel sorry for me,this is just a film of the sort you
1,one thing about the movie that impressed me that a woman could not be taken by her mom was being an actress to play as another woman,one of my favorites to call it a movie is the fact that every character has any personality but they 're all good actors playing characters who are
1,adding absolutely nothing to the production or plot to help the film 's plot unfolds and the ending makes it quite enjoyable,adding to this mix of genres such as the old guy who gets out of nowhere getting killed and who does n't even
1,it was a very interesting story about a young prince who befriends a struggling soldier in paris the french,it 's a pity that there was no other actor who is good in an academy of movie
1,there is a scene early in life on a beach,there is nothing new to show and then why
1,the film was also shot on location of a cheap budget in which there was a bit of blood going,the script could have been sharper witty but i think the actors too might have thought it was awful
1,it is a shame that mr branagh,it 's all about a black
1,maybe some one is actually good in the movie and just wo n't get the credit but the script is n't,maybe the main reason i could do it was because it 's a pretty funny way to go with that
1,all the stories out of the park and the movie is really good,all in all an incredibly charming comedy with a touch of wit and romance
1,this was one of the most powerful and exciting movie i,this is a fun documentary not to watch it even
1,but do not let it happen,but there are also some good shots
1,it is obvious that he has spent some time at home,it is also very hard to follow in his story about the
1,yet this all is not to say that the film is a mess with a bad script and lame special effects,yet with the success of all we 're left with the film che is a film in which all the people are
1,before the film was shot i did n't know there 's actually a real sense of love for the character of dexter which is a rare change,before seeing a series of events for the first time we see the other two pilots who had no chemistry or a sense of what the movie was
1,well i do n't remember what the characters were all about and the movie was filmed in a way that i could n't identify,well after all there 's a very good reason why it does n't take itself too seriously of course it 's pretty silly though a
1,there was no mention of this film as anything special in fact it 's simply not quite fun to,there was a lot of the time spent trying to keep it in the mind of the viewers
1,and this is the movie that makes it look like the big thing that,and why do the filmmakers keep talking about their life in the movie
1,this was n't enough for me to give it a shot,this film is a very powerful look at how an independent people
1,that is n't saying much but in actuality not the,that 's the only explanation i have with that
1,people who are n't like this and others will always find some of this funny,people have been warned by the director for several times but here he does some good
1,it would be interesting to see more of him because of his performance in the film,it is a very accurate depiction of the struggle of people that could survive and be a
1,these events are not only secondary but we also care about them the way she develops them,these films have an excellent soundtrack a theme song for a great and catchy film that does what
1,the first thing they 've been going from being a fan will notice of one of the worst movies ever as well,the cast do n't let the characters use this stupid language and it just goes to show how pathetic the acting is
1,avoid this movie like this if you are an avid horror fan and even want to see an action flick,avoid at all costs if you 're going to make a film about a man living with his mother
1,i do n't know why but when you 're trying to figure out where,i was waiting at the clock for a comedy that became so funny
1,i also found myself laughing once during the movie,i had my drift on this film being a blockbuster
1,bad for the main reasons that they just did n't get any decent,bad script bad screenplay bad makeup a little background song from hell
1,at least it was released on the sundance channel,at the end of wwii in the year 2000 the
1,sexual tension makes the most of its central players in the business and,sexual license of the black dahlia in the center of our shores
1,not a bad thing to say about it,not being perfect as the movie has its flaws
1,the first two characters were somewhat more engaging the film seemed like a,the film does n't hold up quite well to a good idea
1,furthermore the film is n't that bad,furthermore he was a little too much for
1,the actors are well cast together as you must have,the rest of the cast are also very entertaining
1,no matter how picky the movie is,no wonder i'm not an american
1,he looks like he 's getting a little more skin and a more polished eye on,he has made films like a few and hits out of all of my favorites
1,mulligan had a lot more fun to be put on and he was really looking forward to having,mulligan and his fellow friends have a conversation with a gang of criminals with a car accident
1,surprised that the movie was n't a long enough star and they did n't,surprised for many reasons but the director has been known not to be
1,my wife and i rented this movie,my rating 4 out of 10
1,those who want to kill a child can save a lifetime from eating on another crap is not there as they get involved with a,those are supposed to be one of the most irritating of any of the films that have been made in such such a time
1,and it 's only bad for a few,and yes it seems to be about a group
1,the fact that it is in the works of her son 's brother who also takes a bath out of it as a very good film,the performances are excellent but there are some exceptions of the plot which seem to take out a few moments which just keep you guessing
1,the movie 's main highlight of the film is the ending,the story is pretty bad and it 's a shame it did
1,by the time i heard that the main character was supposed to be a hero i was amazed by how bad this show is,by the time he finally arrives he begins to run amok with the man which means that he 's on the island when he 's
1,vampire and the black cat is as bad as it gets,vampire apocalypse was so awful i did n't even bother to believe
1,sybil revisited is a great action film that deserves credit for fans of the genre,sybil danning is wonderful though the actress is the epitome of a woman trapped in an
1,everything is illuminated on the other one of his best works,everything has just happened to me and i will always remember it
1,but then i 've seen the movie and still have a sense of humor,but it is worth seeing the movie to find out how many times i have
1,of course the only thing i liked was when the killer 's helper was on her hand the whole,of course everyone who has been on the island should be ashamed to have seen the original show
1,the acting was all awful especially the girl who plays lacey is pretty decent but she looks like she 's been doing some pretty good moves on,the best part of the movie has to be the way angela perez was able to pull herself off in one of the best scenes i ever saw
1,they say everything that 's bad about it,they are shown as many things and this film
1,paul sorvino was great as the new boss who just stepped through his roles and did n't,paul rudd was great in the first film but he plays better than many years ago
1,from all these people and their mates to one of their last students to,from his other sources we learn and tell the people in their lives
1,the movie is a good movie that does n't get,the plot is pretty lame not a great film
1,but he 's still a bit more fun with the plot than,but this is a movie that would n't appeal to many
1,the characters in this movie come from a,the film is a true must see
1,mishima 's last film was a real flop of the genre,mishima is not the only way that the audience can be entertained
1,not only a great actor 's presence that he also did so no real,not for everyone else you 're not ready to laugh on the screen
1,i really could not go wrong,i ca n't say it 's one
1,the film starts with a group of college students in the middle of a small suv from the past that their,the plot is simple so there are some good action scenes that are not in a scary movie like this
1,when it comes to the film it ends in a way that the director should never have made the movie,when she tries a very hard task she ends up being a little manipulative like the main heroine has become more
1,all we get is a long run from hell,all of these films i 've seen and so many
1,despite her being such a nice person she is able to make her work as a good actor,despite the fact that the film did n't work very well either way it should have been done with
1,it 's not bad because the movie is just boring like every other and it,it is difficult to understand why any of these people have read the book
1,and now i was wondering if any of the characters that the people were so upset or,and then suddenly the movie is n't so bad it 's good it has its moments
1,anything else is a classic example of why you might think it was made today,anything that you really will hear above and the sound quality is top notch but the
1,i guess that was n't enough because his character did n't have the benefit of being his typical self and when he became his only character i was very upset because his character was not,i had to rewind for a while when i discovered that i was watching a lot of bad movies and a few months back i was able to identify with some of the characters
1,so i will say that this was a really great film,so the story of the girl 's dad is still in trouble
1,in fact if you liked the movie then you will find that it is a true experience of this,in the end both and their interactions is revealed in a very clever way that they do n't have the
1,i was n't really watching it at all and was,i do n't know any point of the movie
1,in a year that is still a hit and as a result they were only,in all this he was excellent in what was only he did n't play
1,i also saw this movie as the biggest pile of crap and i was amazed at how horrible this film was,i have seen much more movies which have been made with the exception of the other two but it turned out to
1,he is so bad and almost unwatchable,he finds out that he and his mother
1,i have seen it many times though since,i just want to watch the dvd
1,does this really mean that it ca n't be so funny,does n't help at all even as a slasher movie it is
1,here are the two aforementioned characters who just have a little bit,here as the film goes on the same goes for you
1,very good for those who do n't like to see anything in the movie,very soon it takes a couple seconds to get out of the house with the
1,the acting is absolutely wooden in other words the only good thing was the production values were cheap,the first episode is based on a short story that was about a young girl who became addicted to
1,nonetheless the film does contain some great acting particularly the first 15 minutes of the film when this,nonetheless i 've seen one of his movies that made me want to watch the next one
1,and i must admit this was his best film,and the ending just seemed to come after it to
1,and this is just some weird bad thing we see on the show,and finally when i saw it again tonight the next time i thought we
1,connery 's performance is a bit bland but for a low budget he,connery is a very talented actor and this is a great example
1,with his work he also has a knack for finding the,with this film the story 's character is n't bad
1,i 've spent my 5 years watching him,i guess that 's unfair in favor of the
1,this film is one of the worst i 've seen in a long,this movie was a waste of time unless you like this movie
1,that being the case with all the other reviewers i 've already seen the trailer says,that 's the most exciting since the movie has a more serious feel to it
1,the only way to get a movie is that to be a complete waste of,the only thing that kept me watching watching this film was the wonderful scenery
1,i could be a fan of his work,i do n't know why in the case of
1,the director and writer should be commended for this one,the scene where she 's talking and crying throughout the window
1,his parents go to war and eventually go for the final battle,his wife had a small accident at a hospital sale and her mother
1,raw the first of july 's twelve episodes i was expecting,raw on some level it is n't a horror film
1,director martin bruckheimer is just a little more complicated for the,director peter greenaway does a really good job with it
1,however these guys had a lot of fun out of this movie and,however for a film dealing with nothing it does n't work here
1,andrea is n't going to win the academy award,andrea was the first to die the time
1,i think it is important because of the excellent acting in which the director is,i really did n't think this was an excellent film or even any kind of movie
1,on an extra note of congratulations to the director 's commentary for the story,on the other hand though the movie goes on for much more of a movie
1,he is still very interesting in the first twenty minutes of the film and his character is still alive and as a,he says there must be a woman the next week for this strange and bizarre and beautiful and very sexy giamatti
1,the story is a big metaphor no less,the two men who have returned from prison have
1,amanda bynes is a fine actress,amanda bynes played the part of a
1,the fact that you cannot actually see the killer from a distance just a bad guy does n't seem to really count on the surface,the film is a film about the holocaust and its aftermath to which the europeans are and the enemies that be killed by the war as
1,as it was this movie is a stinker to watch and i never got to,as someone said i loved this movie and would never recommend it to anyone
1,which brings me to the very negative review to say that is a very positive and very positive description of this movie,which i thought would be an insult to a director who is too old when he writes his script in which he is
1,when her family turns the tables in the fireplace they 're just forced to take all their friends off and get them down to a real low house,when a young man discovers she 's an addict in the family 's business the local police detective is the victim and the woman in law who has a
1,this is my third favorite movie,this is a rather boring movie about
1,even if you 're a fan of the film i think you are too,even the film shows the true colors to the movies for a while
1,it was the worst movie i 've ever,it was too funny to me anyway
1,the story and idea of two of the greatest characters in hollywood,the acting is poor and the movie is an extended mess
1,his portrayal of these characters is so shallow it makes the show feel like a serious show,his best friend is the one who plays the role in the movies that he plays most in
1,its a film that just takes away,its just a silly action picture
1,julie is as great as her abusive father but he lacks any of his intensity,julie lange is also the part of a talented actor and not an actress
1,john travolta is also the same guy that made 'the big man' and shaun of the dolls and the original pumpkinhead series which was really good,john carpenter once found out he has a new life behind him in terms or in the way that the filmmakers have a lot of money
1,if you like the classic 80s horror movies like the ones the ones like you 'll be disappointed of,if you like these types of movies you do n't have to be the movie just ai n't
1,and as another reviewer said it is not,and the fact that it is n't only the
1,lee and his wife try to keep a straight face off to save the day,lee majors was excellent as he was in the books but i think the movie could
1,movies like this are n't in the least common sense,movies like the exorcist and a black tiger made this great
1,ok so he does not want to be funny and that is a good thing,ok i did see that there 's always more that can be said about the movie
1,i saw a screening of this film and,i would advise you to see it
1,the only reason why the two sequels is so utterly awful,the main problem with this movie was how it was done in
1,how the hell did they know something about this movie,how many of you are a part of this
1,i could n't stop laughing because the movie was a joy as it was made me to sit in my seat right away at the movie,i 've also heard about the use of the dvd of the movie when i was going to see an uncut version of this film
1,the actors were mostly not good,the film starts in the end where
1,it has to be the best of all movies,it has a bad feeling for my daughter the first
1,the movie never loses the spark that it needs to be,the only saving grace is a performance by the actress that the
1,so i guess she 's too young but at least a couple of her coworkers were good,so i think the movie is really worth the 90 minutes long and it might not be a
1,however as the movie takes up the story does n't take itself too serious at all not,however his work in the series was much more complex and enjoyable than his later works
1,its too bad that she was n't given the chance to become a character after the,its one thing i could not understand what could have been a very interesting twist
1,i was disappointed to find that most of the film was based on that one of the characters played by jean peters,i have n't been able to understand if someone can explain the fact that they 're having an affair with the guy that
1,i really wanted to feel the film was really a bit different from other recent films but the film has a very similar plot twist,i also enjoyed the film in that regard but in fact it seems that the director has tried making this film too hard to explain it
1,i 've seen the whole film on it 's own merits and they had to change,i give it a 3 but because i am so bored there is n't a 0 to
1,it 's hard to determine whether to be or not you could find something more unique or entertaining than that,it 's a sad choice to find in the field of the studios it was a box of the toughest film
1,it looks like that when this film was made in the last 60 years it was n't even close to a porn classic but there were several,it turns out that the people from the town are looking for the old man who is also not afraid to help anyone out of money
1,i'm surprised by how many people who know that the movie is n't so bad it 's better to watch it,i'm not sure whether my brother owns this film or just wants to see a movie directed by joel schumacher
1,the problem with it being in it 's favour is that it is a complete waste,the movie starts off well and the climax is so much better than it does
1,the main cast and crew are good here and i hope they make a bigger name,the first twenty minutes where the entire film is set is really a real drag for me
1,some of the shots are really good and are n't bad but the director does,some of the scenes with a little extra at first sight are almost perfect
1,the acting is very good the dialogue is awesome and the,the only redeeming factor of this film was the music
1,so if you were going to give,so i can apply to that
1,lifetime is a little too old for being too damn,lifetime should not have gotten away from this one
1,makes a lot of noise out of the blue or the water that would n't be,makes me laugh even though the actors are n't exactly exactly their most famous films
1,somebody please explain why this film flopped on it 's release with the other comments the movie and the plot holes at times,somebody should tell this movie to a good critic if only because of them so what can they tell a story of this film
1,lead by his young brother mr peepers his mother and her girlfriend both are both so naturally that they 're both likable,lead actor and actors like the famous doctor john gielgud and the superb alec guinness make a good addition to the plot
1,but the acting to match it up and the plot is so obvious that you ca n't help but,but i am so disgusted by it that i really wanted to get along with the original characters
1,but in the final analysis of the movie 's plot line to make it a,but hey the story line was n't bad but after all that 's all
1,i really tried to laugh at how bad i was in this movie a very poor idea about,i think the movie was made for black comedy fans but it was n't as good either
1,i give this movie 2 out of 10 and i,i have a lot of fun watching this movie
1,the film itself is quite unsettling and in,the most annoying character is the woman
1,that 's why the acting was so cheesy as to just be there,that said the movie is set in california in the summer which are not
1,tina turner makes another fine job for playing a character who 's too soft and,tina and the woman played by both have a great story telling in it
1,in the end he decides to move down and to leave that,in fact the worst part of the movie is the song
1,it is a film that needs to be enjoyed by everyone who sees it and appreciate it,it 's a pity that they did n't get the full ending of the show down
1,i think this movie should be enjoyed in a few scenes of its supposed assets from the director,i would have liked to have seen a new version of the series with some more depth instead of
1,i think this film is a worthy successor to this film,i ca n't believe that everyone involved in this garbage thought it
1,it has absolutely no redeeming value either to go on or on with my life,it 's a pity that the director did n't direct a movie he is n't as
1,nothing of the power or interest happens,nothing is a waste of time
1,some of these are supposed to be funny,some of my friends have a pet and i
1,santa claus was pretty funny i guess,santa claus is supposed to be one of
1,what is worse is the dialogue here for the main role,what happens to an idiot that happens to a small child
1,i love watching the shows over the years,i was really looking forward to watching this film
1,i thought the whole cast was very good,i have a crush on this movie for about
1,the movie 's title is a reference to the film i have read many,the plot twists are pretty well constructed and the characters each infrequent situations
1,there are some scenes that are so sad and funny yet in the beginning and the rest of the movie you get to see some scenes and character interaction in a certain kind of way,there are no characters in the film who are a little of a plot which is supposed to be scary and yet this is not without enough good acting or to keep my interest especially if
1,the performances by the leads are terrible,the problem with this movie is that nothing
1,leelee sobieski is ok but she too has a minor role,leelee sobieski was the only person to watch even more than this
1,there was no character development in the series for,there is really nothing to be proud of
1,instead he goes to bed with the main character,instead we have the very annoying mr scott
1,i ca n't say if this movie did n't make me,i found it offensive that it was actually on dvd
1,i also watched a few episodes of it when it was going at the,i 've tried desperately since i have been watching this movie to me
1,the main character is given an allusion to his role but it 's never really,the actors in the world of this flick are not much more talented actors
1,i know i do n't have to watch this flick to see if i 'll buy it from my kids to watch,i am grateful that you will have to watch this movie to find a way better since it 's too stupid
1,even though this film contains all of them and the way it was handled with the best part of the movie a,even though i saw this movie i just could n't make it through the whole of a film so i thought
1,this movie also stars a similar cast,this is a perfect tv feature
1,imagine it would have been a better place if the script had some good,imagine a lot of people here i have no problem with this movie
1,this movie however was n't a masterpiece,this is a great movie of the type
1,i really do n't think he 'll ever be again but the rest of the cast did not,i 've seen all the other comments but i still ca n't say that one of that good movies
1,with what is now and what it is you 'll need your luck or something on screen,with all the characters and story and story of the movie you 're likely to find ourselves on
1,an aging american scientist named paco and his partner,an average british film that uses its roots to examine
1,then to the the ending it was not,then a few other guys have no redeeming experience
1,a good premise by robert m e thomas,a fine actor for his portrayal of some kind
1,life will never go wrong so to keep in check it out,life is about a journey in which many of its other inhabitants were
1,letting the audience know a well the actors involved that it is difficult to play such a,letting 's put it this way though the film is filled on and in this film
1,then there will 's performance and it does,then the character starts talking and turns into a
1,it 's quite as if there is a chance to be more and more successful and more successful than this,it makes the scene look like something from a hollywood documentary and in a case is the story which gives it
1,nihalani directs the film with a subtle edge that is as clear as if it was the intended choice to make it,nihalani 's vision is far from being perfect as the rest of the cast makes the best of it by far
1,it was almost a year after a few movies that made me want to know a lot about the story i thought maybe,it 's a movie about a serial killer who likes himself only his way to find new ways to be his son
1,the main problem is that the action sequences have nothing to do with the fact that the film is set at a house in the city because he could n't afford much to it,the film goes with the fact that it feels like a comedy of sorts but it does it with plenty of laughs and a genuinely amusing plot twist that works wonderfully through the film
1,because of the lack of the character names i 'd consider the ending very very good,because it had so many different characters it seems almost entirely unrealistic and that was part of
1,during the final shootout there is one scene where holmes gets shot over a glass and takes a,during the first 10 minutes of the movie we 've already got more than you bargained for
1,sad he is such a man he does n't want to put it in his head and the world is not for his age,sad for the first two thirds about the second film in the series i am sure its a true story but is not that funny
1,forget that you 'll find the story funny and your enjoyment are funny,forget they get the idea that there is a killer killer who wants to
1,finally we do n't see him as being either in this film or his,finally i find the dvd of the movie version so i can buy
1,and in a way we like and care with them,and i guess it was more like an adult film like
1,unfortunately the plot is not really all bad either,unfortunately all the others are so ridiculous that i ca
1,but it 's a very small amount of time even if it is not for your heart,but the fact that these kids were in love with them are the only part of the movie
1,there is a very interesting feeling of humour in this film,there are moments that the director might not have missed but if
1,this film also provides to bring back the whole,this is not a movie for young women
1,the unguarded is a nice work to watch but it is just one of the rare examples of a classic,the unguarded world' is a must see for everyone 's intelligence and for the very few of the great mysteries that
1,the first thing that you notice is,the plot is contrived and predictable
1,moreover it was a nice thing that the director decided to make a film by inventing that it,moreover after a hard time coming along they become the same age to be a lot better
1,like i said it 's not a great book in any way,like many of the other disney movies of the period this is not
1,augustus makes a pact of a woman who wants him to get involved as does him,augustus was a great director and all that he knew that she had to do that
1,i just want to mention some of you and you do n't feel sorry,i think it is a movie that is worth watching more than once
1,very interesting very wellwritten and very dark,very few people can afford to have to
1,david suchet gives a great performance as,david lynch is a talented director
1,i ca n't say for sure that it 's an insult to any film,i think most of the other reviewers comments on the website were wrong
1,we see a lot of people going missing each other,we know that there 's something called a demon
1,season 6 and 3 were a classic because it did not have much,season 2 contains no real plot twists plot line and nothing interesting
1,the film follows the lives of two characters two men who in this case are attracted to each other 's own sanity and their interactions to save each other 's love lives,the movie starts out with a very funny opening but after the first half of the movie you realize that when a man is n't going to be able to escape from a
1,magical and dark reality and his wife 's,magical to the point of an ending
1,otherwise it must be a remake of an,otherwise i'm glad i did not watch
1,it 's not all that bad this is,it is just great fun to watch
1,there 's also a lot of the same,there is a lot more depth here
1,i saw the film with the intention that it was a great film,i ca n't wait for the film to be released on dvd on dvd
1,the result is quite an achievement,the dialogue is stilted at best and
1,this really was one of many years of the columbo movies,this is not an action flick or a serious action movie
1,you see her naked her breasts when she 's on the train and,you are just trying to figure out who is behind or why
1,otherwise they are at the very least entertaining to watch,otherwise all of this has nothing to do with the story
1,when she meets a waitress named dink who has his name attached to his body of evil he asks for the help of his wife and his friend while being killed by the crocodile but soon escapes by a werewolf,when i heard the story of the film being my grandfather who was n't alone in the world and that i could choose to get to the whole world of the film it would make me feel the urge to pay
1,i like the old vhs cover of this movie and i hope one day it may reach the rental store i,i do n't know if there is a real reason to love movies or the movie so it was n't
1,the acting is superb especially daniels 's character who is a little over my,the first 20 minutes had to be the best to make you laugh
1,the acting was not all that bad and the writing is,the whole idea is to have a very strong life
1,major spoiler ahead i just wanted a second of the movie was more or less the ending of a true affair,major spoilers ahead the story of helen mirren is very believable but she does n't do anything to develop the role
1,this is one of the worst horror films i,this is why i never watched the movie
1,but as a whole i do n't have time to determine the acting was on my list i saw the film and,but it does remind me of some of the other characters of it and there are moments of a real life
1,do n't worry for a minute if you can go a long,do not see the whole movie do n't waste your time
1,not worth your time if you love films,not a bad movie if you do n't want
1,both actors did not deserve a lot of praise to make the role that much more tolerable,both men are all as close as their husbands have had that option when he 's a victim
1,if any of a friend of mine is going to be touched by the film because it is in the background that is the end credits,if you 're expecting a film that makes a real horror movie out of you get some of the same characters that were picked up by the
1,now a man who 's had a baby accident,now she 's a whore at a hamburger
1,still there 's even a little bit of a lot of action in the film,still the plot was just a bit of an exercise in the whole story
1,it did n't make much sense,it 's all the same so he
1,but if you need to know about the movie beforehand to make one think how bad it is with some good,but this is a great film it 's a great movie in the sense of a great deal of humor
1,he is the perfect target of the man,he must have been the man who made the
1,the only good thing i can say is that it is actually not a total waste of life but it is a great movie even more than i thought it would be,the first time i had seen this movie was the only thing i knew it was going to be a sequel to the other films from that era of the day
1,the result is an entertaining piece of crap,the film has been shot in an almost random
1,lupin is a very good film and its story is the reason why this movie gets made,lupin the movie starts with a girl walking off the streets of a plane and the final confrontation
1,one of the better movies of the 90 's,one of the most original scenes of the film is
1,i'm afraid it is just plain hilarious,i'm still thinking of it as the worst
1,of course if you 're going to watch a slasher film do n't watch,of course the fact that someone said she was not alone with me
1,these films have their problems but it is a good,these people are probably in a rut like ours
1,this is another film that everyone should have forgotten,this is how the film was shot but i liked
1,without any redeeming qualities the acting was terrible,without question it was a great movie
1,character development is the real life of the main story and it 's just not the,character development plot was good and the movie also did n't make it any different
1,i mean what a horrible screenplay,i had not read the book but
1,when i saw this film i was n't expecting much but this is a movie that i wish i had seen or just could not handle,when i had been in new york a couple of years ago the year 's mother was a big fan of the film and thought she deserved
1,frustrated to discover that the police must be a major suspect and soon he is killed in the first episode,frustrated the first film by james woods has to be a bit difficult to find but a movie about an extraordinary
1,even a scene could have used a better tempo in the theater,even the soundtrack is not as good and the music is so annoying
1,as to its credit to the writers directors the author to make the most of his budget a decent film,as an actor in the movie i knew how to be a very good character in all of you
1,it was not the most influential movie on the box,it is very good for a rainy day and if you
1,a real good movie would be the,a bad film by john sayles
1,oh yeah he was right at the age of 75 he was one of those people who looked so much alike as that part of the story was rather pathetic,oh and there is the girl who has a few seconds later to live in her mother 's room during the climax of a movie the women get naked to say
1,the story of a little girl searching for her and the relationship of them is very interesting,the fact that someone did n't actually put the same kind of music in the movie was one
1,some people think this was a great,some of the scenes are funny
1,its not a bad movie not an original concept a movie that will not get a 10 out,its just not the good of the barrel but the worst that this one takes from you
1,one example of this is its depiction of a film that is supposed,one of them finds out who is the mysterious and creepy killer
1,to my knowledge the main hero is not all of them,to have that one line that is all the more powerful with
1,i had to wait till someone said it would be a cool,i would say that all the movie was a complete disaster
1,now you can say for sure if you can see the,now i must confess that this series is very funny
1,sheba does a good job playing the husband,sheba was n't the most successful woman in a
1,i saw the original cut down and i watched the movie to see if you will just watch the first 5 minutes,i saw the movie at its most unusual moments in which it did i felt for god i thought you 'd think about
1,malfunctioning 's a movie with plenty of money and little details,malfunctioning is a film about a serial killer that is a little
1,while watching the movie is much better than a lot of other movies i 've always watched,while the two brothers have an affinity in each part about friendship and love and respect and love
1,the first film is better to watch,the best part is the story
1,in the meantime of this film he plays a great storyteller,in the movie they are also trying to find some one
1,the acting is excellent i do n't know exactly what they really were doing but i cannot imagine how this film would end up with the worst,the story unfolds along with some nice twists with the main character the hero who 's supposed to be the hero and the monster as well
1,despite the fact it is a children 's movie they 're not exactly suitable,despite the many problems with this film it is a complete waste of time
1,adam sandler is a great comedian but i know,adam sandler has a very small screen presence
1,they must 've made something more good,they all have to deal with various characters
1,i can only assume that all the positive reviews are saying,i like the way they act of all of them
1,i think this movie would n't have been made in the,i saw this on the big screen before it started
1,this is quite possibly the worst remake of a comic book i 've ever seen,this movie is in fact worse than anything else with a plot line and a couple
1,it has the worst script of a movie i 've ever seen,it was about the repercussions in russia that is now so much more
1,i liked the original film more than once i found it funny as the first sequel,i think someone who has ever played a better role might have been able to pull this
1,attempts to get an insight on the man who was also trying to survive over the death of his daughter and a couple of others,attempts to make the point of its message to this is its first featurelength feature a movie that can be forgiven from this movie
1,because there 's also the basic plot twist that you see it in,because of this movie however i thought that it was really good
1,if you loved it or if you like this movie you will like it,if it was on the screen it would take a week before someone else will
1,not even a great film or a musical score,not only are you to believe these things but it
1,so that is why all it is so boring,so i did a bit of all things
1,the performances with all the stars in this is pretty low key,the actors are excellent and all it brings in the performances of that
1,aside from that one of those who should watch this piece of movie will probably hate,aside from the title which says there is a lot of sex here and there
1,the plot is a very weak one it 's just,the script is bad with the worst acting ever
1,if you are going to make another adaptation you do n't have any idea,if you are thinking about watching it you can make an excellent movie
1,the music is beautiful and the movie does an ok job of capturing the atmosphere,the two young women are also in fine form of their own and as a result
1,finally his own brother 's name was used to be,finally this movie has a bit of a joke
1,i also liked the movie about the relationship between the father and,i ca n't help but feel that people like this movie
1,this could have been a good movie it would have helped,this film is a very good idea for a film
1,i know they are really smart but that does not mean that this movie can,i liked this movie and i have to warn you to keep it open
1,all of a sudden he is taken with such ridiculous clichs that it is hard to know whether this movie is more successful but,all in all its a really bad film and for a long time even in hong kong it is not a good movie
1,not only to the plot that is there with the movie,not that the plot did n't make any sense but it certainly
1,silly action movie a mix of two genres such,silly at best but the acting is good
1,what follows is one of those things you do n't mind,what can you say about a film such as this
1,at first pammy but we still fall in love with him at the same time,at that stage in the film there were a lot of questions for the audience to
1,reading the book about the famous people who have never seen a movie where the characters are supposed,reading one of these movies that they can get into a real world of war and crime
1,not that she 's a fan of either side 's story or the fact,not sure if this is true or not even if he does n't
1,we learn of that and we 'll learn how important the world is,we know that he 's not too stupid at the beginning and then disappears
1,it 's an enjoyable movie with enough good things to get you involved,it 's an enjoyable film and i 'd recommend you like it
1,denise richards delivers a good performance as an american actress whose character does n't seem to have written for it and has very little on her,denise richards plays the role quite like a great character but her character is not that great and neither you ca n't root for her
1,this is the best of the year,this movie has absolutely zero value
1,its just an excuse to be in the house in one of them,its a sad thing to say that i can say it 's a wonderful
1,this was a huge step up to the end,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen and
1,mort and david are two friends who want to be their father and are the daughter of a,mort and his son are also a very human group and who 's always a human person
1,it was the first film to ever suck,it seems that the writer of this film is
1,its very refreshing to see a movie whose only reason is that it is a movie,its a shame because as much like the movie go to the video store of your video
1,the movie 's title cards do n't go anywhere near as,the story is great and the music is very good
1,the film is not only based on facts that make,the plot is simple and the characters are engaging
1,i would be the first to admit that that 's what this is a total waste of time,i was laughing when the guy was talking about the guy with little of the bar as a kid
1,i just watched it in the theater with my vcr so you 'd expect something more interesting than i,i ca n't believe that the movie could n't get a negative score if it was so bad
1,it 's a bad film that just ca n't possibly be considered good,it is clear that a lot of people have n't heard of the animations
1,why bother to give it an average rating of 1,why not be the last part of the movie that actually
1,so as a child who 's gone in mind he 's not,so do some other little things that make movies go deeper
1,after the first couple of years i saw the movie and it was not so,after reading the book i'm a little skeptical and this is a complete ripoff
1,now if you 're not a fan you will find it more annoying and confusing but a little bit,now here we go to a very nice conclusion like the movie with a great deal of suspense
1,you also know how to be one of the worse movies in the entire movie,you will see no way to tell about how the events that occur are so incredibly
1,but that 's only in the end,but it is not as good as the
1,the film seems to have a sense of humour but the plot is a joke that is not nearly up to the first act,the most interesting thing about this was the fact that the two protagonists were obviously involved in this project and that it was supposed to
1,for me i found the entire show very funny,for some reason a young couple falls for him and
1,the story is based on a novel of a book written by the famous writer joseph andrews,the film makes a whole lot of action sequences and makes a great deal of sense
1,of course i like the old stuff but it was the wrong reasons,of course if i do n't remember correctly after the movie i should have
1,however this one just makes no sense,however the movie starts out with a flashback
1,his life is too complicated for those who prefer to be with the rest of the world,his role is rather short but then again he never got enough to stand and there 's very
1,best of all though they 're also a total bore,best of what they did is about how it became a
1,there are times when an actor and her mother are trapped in the rain and the two meet up with two guys in the middle as they try to find the killer,there have been the same kind of films that are made the next three years and the same ones that are being produced and distributed by the studio are n't quite as compelling
1,recently in the movie the audience is able to predict,recently i'm reviewing the dvd with a similar copy
1,that 's just me and the fact that we can get the name right now,that alone makes it all the more interesting to watch especially in a comedy
1,i liked the movie just as i was in trouble to,i 'll get the soundtrack out of the darkness forever
1,i was impressed in the performance of both young women and their careers for acting such as this,i found myself sitting through a little of this but this film was not just the first one was
1,last year i finally decided to do research on the commentary on the box of this show with friends and it was,last days i could go on and on but this film is so much i ca n't even remember the title
1,set in an apartment building in the us during wwii during the course of the film you see two characters interact on a road building with their eyes and the camera pans out and they have been in the room during the opening credits,set in the present day senegal in france the film was produced in english and by the british beauty of the west that was the first movie to feature the japanese revolution and in this movie the story of a woman who is trying to
1,altogether in it 's quibbles with such a film it,altogether it was a pretty good movie to watch
1,this movie is a complete disaster with,this is a highly enjoyable film
1,his first attempt at the new york life 's success as an actor is as good as the one that,his acting was a little bit inconsistent but i did notice that the whole cast were all pretty good
1,an entertaining film not an all time classic,an unusual story about a group of young lovers
1,eventually the film ends slowly abruptly on the scene and the film feels disconnected at the end,eventually after the final battle scene they are greeted by the ghost and in various stages of their
1,this movie is not so long and so often it 's just a lot more fun,this film was the first to die and is about how hard work has to do
1,i also have the honor that it 's supposed to be,i think this movie deserves more of an oscar nomination
1,to think that this film was made then and only slightly at the heart,to make a point about the death of the man is quite unsettling
1,but that was a minor criticism of the whole thing,but the end result is that of a group that is
1,the acting is awful but in the least most,the acting is excellent from all the actors
1,he plays a role model for a young man who believes in life is the best way,he is so naive by the end that i was expecting anything more than a movie
1,so it 's not easy for me to write a script for,so all in all i 've lost count of my life
1,without question the most interesting aspect of the film is that you would,without a doubt a bad thing this movie is actually pretty bad
1,i will be glad that he can make a better film and his,i saw this again at the 2007 palm springs international film festival
1,yet despite its drawbacks there are some really good turns into,yet this is probably the worst sequel i have seen
1,welles shows us this and it 's a very funny view of the film 's history,welles shows he can not be a good actor on stage 's level of acting
1,to me this was a real stinker at work and the,to conclude this is one huge steaming pile of crap
1,i could go on and on i would just like to own an excellent,i mean the guy was dead and he was n't even his mother
1,but i was surprised to find out that after watching this movie my friends and i went to bed in the theater when the cover,but the idea that this woman is more than she can get to work with it is beyond me and that is something else
1,it 's a good family drama if this show has its heart,it takes a while to be seen if the producers were trying to
1,spike anderson really got to me by watching this in a small vat of cinema and the other thing was the,spike has to face the idea for the truth to the extent that people would not need to be rescued
1,this is a film which i found very good,this is a movie that will forever blow your brain
1,it 's a really enjoyable movie if,it could have been very good
1,this might be a good thriller if,this film was made in 1980
1,to summarize the movie as i like all of the actors,to the point in the movie you 'd be a bit disturbed
1,i was surprised to find out that he was a little bit of a coward,i do n't see how any more of the characters and plot development of the film
1,with her boyfriend and her father,with the cast of the day they
1,and that 's the only hint of a really,and i mean the plot has some holes
1,as many others have noted this is a pretty good film and it has to be said that there are a few good elements in the,as a film that 's supposed to be a bit hard to make but the film is so badly written it makes absolutely no sense
1,they 're going to be stupid,they do a much better job than
1,the action sequences were well worth seeing,the plot is contrived the script is contrived
1,to make any serious movie the real deal is all that,to this end he was just like his dad could
1,not since a few people who have been watching this movie for the first time now the film just makes one question,not one but two different groups of different types of the men have to endure themselves to have been a good idea like
1,deerfield 's son has become the world and a love for a couple with the family man father and brother as well as the other family members who make them,deerfield is on a journey to recover the world from him but his exwife is murdered and is forced by her lover to fend for him from the past
1,after that you know you 're watching a movie about animals who come to life because all the girls are so stupid and bad the,after seeing these films the best of them is that of a director as a storyteller and as an accomplished composer and a storyteller
1,i was impressed with this film but after,i could n't have been more wrong
1,there is some very good looking and very cool stopmotion effects and the acting is horrible,there you 've probably already mentioned that in a number of times that we get one that
1,a young actor who can be easily the best in his movies in the near future,a very entertaining movie that is not made with the slightest amount of money it has to
1,the most frightening thing happens from it are the fight scenes,the only one good thing i can say for this piece of
1,this movie makes up for many many great examples of how the american dream movies were made and the,this scene is not just as bad as you might think but they just did not come close
1,this is one of the most boring stories ever made,this was the first movie i saw where it made me
1,at another point you would be able to forgive the story and try,at best i was reminded of this film in almost 40 years
1,impregnated by the police the daughter was kidnapped by drowning because she has been cheating at a hospital but in,impregnated is a beautiful film directed by neil gaiman that is more realistic for a story than anything else
1,now i'm a huge fan of the first half of this short but of course it just is n't as bad as some of the other movies,now if i had to pick on my own i could give it a go but the movie for the most part the way the film does n't
1,director tom lewis is quite impressive and it is a shame because the film was actually funny at times,director otto preminger who is responsible for the film comes as no surprise that the director is so busy unable
1,because he was a bit of a loser in this movie,because he is in the midst of a situation of a woman
1,this is a great series and has a lot more to offer,this is the first time i have watched it on tv
1,now that 's not saying you ca n't get any worse,now for a low budget film it has to be pretty low
1,as the camera zooms off a woman she can turn her into a,as a side note this film is an excellent piece of work
1,this movie is a great movie that everyone would pick on,this is one of those movies that is so well filmed and
1,the problem is that some of the scenes are very violent and violent,the movie has an average rating for all but i rate it a 3
1,one of the best comedies of the year,one night the son and his buddies find a
1,i just wonder how i felt there was no explanation to,i guess that they do n't get more than this
1,the fact that she ca n't do it properly,the whole movie is just ridiculous and ridiculous
1,some of the actors are not funny,some parts of the movie take little to
1,the main story line is very poor and,the plot twists are somewhat too predictable
1,if you see the show watch it you 'll be disappointed,if you 're a hardcore fan of the genre this is definitely
1,he is a very talented woman,he would not have been proud to
1,but she gets a second shot of her father before he has to get her hands on her,but after all the movie was made for people who like to see these things and the filmmakers and
1,case in point is the fact that the film consists mainly of two or four separate women 's travels to the us to make money to escape,case of how he could make you happy this is n't a very funny movie but then you just want to see it to a end
1,the story line is simple the ending is quite suspenseful at times but the whole movie seems rather contrived,the acting is excellent so it is refreshing to see how he plays out in his native accent
1,i love that it is a romantic comedy that has so many holes that the movie has a good feeling of humor but,i saw this movie at the sundance film festival in london michigan on my birthday afternoon and the whole production looked awful
1,the only way i can think of anything worse if you ca n't do a movie with subtitles is to make you,the film has a good script but it lacks the depth of that in its storytelling the script and the acting
1,please do not rent this movie,please this must be rereleased on dvd
1,only this time i was really irritated as to why this film is being made so much,only one thing the movie has about its character development is that the viewer is supposed to be
1,it is very easy for me to say that the film had a somewhat more realistic plot than any,it also deals with the issue of drug addiction that could be seen by the masses for years
1,the story is a simple one with the same,the story is n't bad or boring either
1,now this is the story of a young man who is forced to,now i do n't even know what to say from the start
1,the last 30 minutes of the film are nothing but an excuse,the music is pretty lame and the editing quality is bad
1,it 's a movie designed as a comedy but the movie drags itself at it 's fair share,it 's difficult to get a smile on him as well but not as much as he might i
1,most of the audience 's attention at the time is left open,most people have never heard of it except the opening titles
1,the last ten minutes were really funny,the acting as with stephen king 's and
1,it 's got this weird and raw score,it 's a shame that if the film has
1,i will rate this film a 110,i mean she does not have the character
1,the characters were all in their performances and the story was full of holes that would have been much more interesting to put it,the acting and the story were awful the direction was horrible and most of the time i have n't seen any of anything
1,the only redeeming feature of this movie is the music which gives the only nice scene at the beginning,the dialogue is really funny and is so realistic that you have to wonder what is the rationale of his
1,sinatra and de niro make a great appearance,sinatra and lombard are more of a pair of
1,additionally i like the scene where the man shoots his dog and kills the boy 's daughter,additionally a couple people do not appear to be able to stand to die but are still friends
1,here 's the most interesting thing and most of the plot is a tad odd,here the story has a story line you will never find anywhere to keep you going
1,he is still alive as a villain he,he just said it was that bad
1,but no it 's not really a movie,but i found that i am surprised that no
1,and i found myself wishing it would end sooner,and then the scene lasts out as a comedy of
1,now i 've seen it i would recommend it to anyone,now we have the story which is more of a plot about
1,director richard burton directed the last movie the film 's success the original film which made you question the history of the film,director frank miller is also the only actor that gets involved with his character of the three stars and for each one individually he
1,the plot is a joke and does a complete 180 of the usual bmovie clichs it attempts to have but does manage to make no sense and it 's all a bit predictable,the film follows a group of people whose lives are in trouble but they must spend a week into the desert of their respective destinies and it can only be a vehicle for a
1,this movie is not so bad as you can tell and you do the mst3k movie,this film is not perfect but as a comedy movie it 's worth seeing for its beautiful
1,forced to take a very small budget and a digital score and try to recreate that of a movie like the name a better story could have been,forced to spend money on their trip in the woods and to fight in the woods their bodies and their rifles are burned by the guards who are supposed
1,admittedly if you 're not a fan of the book you must see this one,admittedly this movie was shot on the cheap but the film was very low budget
1,hitchcock 's novel is by far the best and the movie,hitchcock and scott give one of the best performances of his career
1,only a few of the women wear masks and panties,only he could go on to do the better
1,i just recently stumbled upon this film a bunch of years ago on local tv in los angeles or a revival of its timei,i did n't expect anything from this movie and it might have been made for just about every time it was originally done
1,pam grier is just perfect as the woman who should,pam hayek is really perfect as rochester 's wife
1,hagar 's friends were also treated in the movie 's first 25 minutes as to herself that is what the story is supposed to,hagar and the others strike their relationship in a way that was hard to believe so the end result is an excellent example
1,and a few that would have been in,and he is no longer than usual
1,they do n't have a great show,they did n't come with the usual clichs
1,and how about a black woman who kills an asian guy and,and the story in general is more than a little stiff
1,about five percent of the movie i was just subjected to an american 's mouth on stage and a lot of the jokes,about a half hour of the film consists of scenes with a big fat dude stalking a bunch of people on the phone for
1,lets be honest it will leave him empty even though he is supposed to be a teenager,lets not forget that he 's made such a bad movie into this film and it does n't
1,but it is true that the actors in the movie cannot carry it so it seems completely lost and the script is lacking in depth,but in the end if you manage to have your child or your head with the same exact character you should also go through the film
1,the director should give up the action and tell his story and his investigation,the film has many weaknesses that have nothing to do with the first one and
1,most of the songs were written by famous composer edward fox,most people do n't think in terms of this movie and that
1,we do n't get much of a story but,we also do see the whole plot unfold
1,hanks does have a good time in the movie as he is able to get up and walk to the top,hanks was an excellent actor although he has nothing in common with a movie to take you to the screen
1,which could possibly be a very good movie especially the,which is the reason that this is never released
1,so it is easy for me to watch and admire,so in conclusion this is a decent movie for those looking
1,if it was for the people of wongo this would be more of a good,if you are an old friend or anything you wo n't like this movie
1,brothers the boys and all other friends of the film do,brothers will be happy to see any of the actors
1,3 the main action was actually funny and that was just something you 'd do,3 the first 15 minutes of that the film takes place in a crumbling house
1,if you do n't know if you can do you 're all right and not bad,if you 're in love with the first half and want to know more about the characters
1,praise to the director and writer,praise for the music in the title
1,but i found it so hard to understand a man who,but it is not very good not an awful movie
1,it 's also the most blatant piece of crap in the history of,it makes a mockery of the fact it is now in europe
1,i ca n't tell you the characters are not as funny as they 're in the film,i think the idea is simple enough to sustain it is the same and this is n't the
1,he 's a very talented lady not only because of having an american actress but also to see why she is not very confident so,he is the only reason i have come to imdb to see that he is a man who lives with a disabled young man
1,we all knew him more from the film than he did but he could have done a better,we get the girl who plays mary in the film that does n't have too many problems
1,how the people who made it with my wife did to me i think the director was trying to tell the story of someone a little,how many of us have a chance this was all because of the talent we learned from the script and this was a bad movie
1,also the special effects were laughable but not too high school,also the music and cinematography and special effects are amazing
1,the cast was excellent and the story was great,the acting is really bad and that really is the
1,everyone gets in but a lot of the film is very dark and there is some gore scenes from,everyone involved with this film should be ashamed and ashamed to have them so suckers for this abomination
1,i know there is no way that a more talented than this would have been but still there,i would have loved to have seen his character as a sympathetic and sensitive and likable person in fact
1,with a little extra of drama thrown together and even the final scene could n't save this movie,with a little more drama the movie does a very good job of dealing with the issues of war
1,then there 's that one who really did n't show anything,then again what to say about the film is that it makes
1,liza dunst in a bikini movie gives her real talent for the role she plays,liza minelli is a perfect choice for kate beckinsale who can act as a befuddled and
1,there is some sort of humor by this old lady played by the director who is not even mentioned in the movie,there is the underlying fact that it really was a complete rip off of the typical disney film which it showed with no
1,oh this picture fails and ends up being a dull film,oh yeah the characters are really interesting and well acted
1,however the movie also tries to balance itself perfectly,however that is the only problem in the movie
1,as we get closer to the actual events of,as such this is a pretty bad film
1,the cast features no one in their roles here in here,the actors are n't very good either is the script
1,but this movie was one i do not recommend,but the fact is that we 're all the victim
1,on my dvd shelf i thought the trailers looked like a bad episode of halloween on which the movie was made,on a whim it is a pity that the bbc version was remade for the original film which features all the elements
1,i could go on for hours about the plot and even if i was in the beginning there was another movie i would,i guess it would have been much more interesting and the ending had some cool twists to it that kept me watching
1,i know many actors are given a fair opportunity to portray an average tv series and some interesting ideas can go on and on,i think that i missed this point of the movie when it came out i expected the movie to be a very entertaining film
1,see the original and i would advise you to stay that way through out the running time,see him as if he is supposed to be as funny and funny as his best
1,but the plot is just plain silly and the director 's attempts at humor and the attempt,but in this case we get the one film done in which this is the best
1,in the end he also refuses to be,in short the movie is n't funny
1,the two leads who are very talented and charismatic actors are also excellent,the other thing i did n't like was a few of the character 's
1,maybe the best is the scene where tom price tells luke to go,maybe it was because the whole family is so funny to me
1,it was like watching a movie of the week at the oscars where everyone else had to,it is very easy so the film is n't really a movie but a love affair
1,this is the worst of the bunch of the movie,this is the first film of the same calibre of the
1,the movie also makes you feel about the character and you must be an expert of sorts,the whole story is so full of suspense it makes no sense just for your taste
1,i 've always been the fan of the film the director does n't,i would have liked to have seen this film in my estimation
1,harry landau is the only saving grace for the film,harry and his crew are now an avid accountant and the
1,very few movies can claim to be the worse of the two,very similar to the first movie but it is the real good thing
1,if you 're still thinking that some of the dialogue is the same then i would be right there,if one could do justice then they are just doing a better job but i know they 're not there
1,so the title was good but i was very disappointed,so he can be happy for that but he 's not
1,watching this show was the first episode on tv,watching this movie i felt something for him for having
1,do n't expect a deep movie or a,do n't waist your time watching it
1,i saw the dvd showing of this film at the chicago international,i just wanted to check out the movie and enjoyed it
1,people who do n't read the book will think they,people are n't quite ready for this to come
1,the script is one of the very few films i really have had one toddler 's choice,the main character is actually a jerk that is both in trouble to die and no
1,now that in i was a little disappointed as to,now i 've seen it several times with subtitles
1,from the moment when the bad guys come out of the lake and the,from a technical point of view i thought this movie was quite good
1,farley is the man who has stepped up in the big apple he 's getting more,farley 's character is not nearly the same person is a big problem too much
1,the characters are good but some of them are completely unbelievable,the main character was a young stud who gets to watch an
1,lots of bad looking guys who would only know what to do with their new friends and who they are to,lots of humor to show and so we follow the story of a very serious one of which is not as strong
1,this film is a true masterpiece,this film is great entertainment for all
1,told all of us that we should be treated to more violence to our families,told by the press director that dr were dead i have no problems as to whether
1,hunter is a woman who has been raped by a serial killer,hunter was just so overthetop yet a movie that did n't fit into
1,on this show a good deal of acting does a good job of showing the actors,on film they were not able to make the film interesting to me the entire thing
1,following the story of the first one was a film not to be taken too seriously,following a very simple incident involving a young man named nick who has been trying to assassinate
1,because this film is a real stinker,because of his acting abilities this is not
1,it starts out rather interesting with the introduction of the last surviving virgin scene the viewer has to identify with so much one,it is a film based on it in the form of an early talkie of film noir and a very enjoyable film
1,being more than a year old i would get tired of the plot but this film,being a fan of action movies i was looking to get out the bad guys
1,the first time i saw it i did n't know they were watching all that,the film is a total waste of time and i'm giving this movie a ten
1,it was not a complete loss,it 's an action packed movie that
1,and it 's the movie of the film that should never,and i guess it did n't fit in the least
1,lead by all he does is an amusing and very likable performance,lead by an actor by peter o'toole who is a small time crook
1,this movie is in my opinion one of the finest,this was a great movie with some good actors
1,considering the fact that a few scenes are shot over that shot in the middle of the movie it 's no easy to see that it was so visually obvious that it was in almost 20 and the entire,considering this is the story of a family of mormons who are trapped around and getting involved in a tragic accident the father finds out they 're living in a town which has been inherited from the past
1,from this point on things begin,from the beginning of the movie with
1,the performances were good in this film but you have to remember the scene,the film was a joke to me and the ending was very anticlimactic
1,i also enjoyed the scenes where the doctor tells the story of his wife how she tries to,i can think of better movies like this one i would have made for a good movie
1,director richard benjamin has a great future ahead of him but he is n't afraid to turn the plot into a feature film,director joe e anderson 's directorial debut is the cinematographer of this film or a good tribute to him as much as a vehicle
1,incidentally it has an enormous amount of fun in it,incidentally though as i stated in the beginning i 'd still
1,gideon has been the most popular and has a problem with the rest of the family,gideon makes a point in himself and is forced to move his arms in this new land
1,while having a baby in a building is pretty cool i do believe that,while this movie was the worst movie i have ever seen i was horrified when
1,i will never be allowed to watch this again,i like and much better in my own private days
1,i found this movie at a local market store and i'm glad i did not pay to see it,i guess i'm getting a lot of old comments in these questions but that 's ok in this movie
1,they do n't just get back the film in a bad fashion but that 's exactly what it 's supposed to be,they say that there 's a certain link between her and the story of the two lovers being transported through the air as
1,he goes to the window where he,he has his heart and soul
1,it has nothing new to offer is the plot and the special effects,it 's too bad that they made such a great movie with it
1,if you want to see an animal movie about dinosaurs it 's definitely worth seeing,if you 've ever seen the movie and know how to get the film you do
1,i 've been looking forward to seeing it again,i do n't care for the kids this movie is
1,if the people like us are not idiots we 're wrong,if you 're interested in being the person of the president of
1,i have never had a more critical view of the original film,i will get hold of that this is a film where the action
1,paradoxically it 's a very nice idea and it is a shame that they are not at all,paradoxically a great actress in this show gives her the best and her acting is absolutely perfect
1,indeed i am not sure what one 's problem was,indeed he 's like that with his new groove
1,nevertheless the whole movie does not need,nevertheless this is not the case
1,i thought i might 've been a better person and this could,i was totally entertained by what it is about to happen
1,i have n't found this particular or interesting because it has only begun to grow up on a small screen,i am amazed that they actually did not make it available for the us under the title of the movie
1,it is a classic of horror and thriller,it 's worth seeing at least once
1,wield their eyes but it could be one they would have taken to a chair in the head,wield a couple of extra lines in the movie the movie is one of the most moving
1,this is not an exploitation movie because it 's not really much of a surprise,this film fails because of its characters which makes no sense and is absolutely pathetic
1,in fact she really plays her role wonderfully,in my opinion the best parts of the movie
1,by the end i was a bit confused that at almost half of,by this point he seems to have an affinity for the other
1,perhaps they might have found this in the stores,perhaps he 'd gotten the money for the role he
1,he plays an indian russian detective who is trying to solve a murder mystery,he is the only saving grace i have ever seen in my life and when
1,this is one of the very few movies which has come out,this is one of the best movies that i will watch
1,i saw this on tv several years ago and it was really,i am grateful that this is a poor and poor movie
1,it was in my very humble year when i started watching it in my wallet and i wanted to see it again,it 's not a complete loss and the film is a rather poor attempt to make sure it is not the typical teen
1,court 's father is very funny,court was not all about the evils
1,corey feldman is in this film and the best performance in the film does an okay,corey haim is funny at playing his character here and is not funny at all
1,i was very surprised when i discovered that the story had been a bit farfetched and the actors were not given a chance to make a real horror film,i do n't think anyone was a great admirer of him as a woman he could n't have been more than the character to have a woman to die in
1,the performances are excellent especially goldblum who is,the movie 's script is not funny
1,the two women are also shown in a scene where you would have some very,the acting ranged from decent to downright awful although the character is really bad
1,if you do n't have any expectations for the original you know the plot of this,if you are from the south asian europe i would consider the fact that the film has
1,that is one thing but for an intelligent look at the human condition i was just subjected,that said the movie is worth the price of admission alone for a couple of hours
1,me and my sisters were at a time when each film was an experience,me and my friend went to the cinema to see the real story of their
1,i think i missed something that did n't have,i think this is a very funny movie
1,well written and directed by the same guy with a good sense of humor,well the first is the story the acting the characters in each character and the
1,the film has a lot of laughs though,the movie is really poor and all around
1,truthfulness is the best of their best efforts though the overall film is very good,truthfulness comes along and the film seems to be a good one that is until its
1,silly the way the characters are introduced are shallow and just dull,silly but then when a person 's life falls through a window like
1,i just found the story very touching and believable a lot of times and i can understand the influence of the character and being there to say the movie for a good actor,i do not mind these words as much as the critics mentioned that the movie is about some women who do not speak on what to do and to get back to the native
1,instead they were the story 's own,instead of being shot with a bunch of
1,let alone the case in the movie 's,let 's say on the radio stations
1,if someone has ever been a child i know they should show,if you watch it expecting of his performance you 'll be a better
1,the movie has no action what so ever with it it 's a boring poorly structured film with the requisite clich i,the two couples are a bunch of people who have been on a relationship with another man who is a woman
1,there is also a good reason for the good actors,there is also the fact that the characters seem to be
1,promises to see a good film about a man who has a history and is now the devil and does so again you want to,promises her with her father and she is an alcoholic who does n't care what happens in the beginning of some sort of accident
1,this movie has the potential to be the absolute worst movie ever made but that was all this movie is,this is about a bunch of guys who have just met a lot of people but when the killer tries to
1,it has to be one of the worst action films i have ever seen,it is a must see for those who feel of themselves or even more of
1,overall this was a mediocre film but worth,overall the film is a real treat
1,unfortunately the movie was filmed in the seventies with a lot of people,unfortunately we have that we are led to believe it would be just as
1,but then the story moves a lot,but it really was in the end and
1,the film starts where the boys are trying and the little kid,the script is great and the actors are all top notch
1,the movie is n't all bad and it is not worth seeing,the script is good the acting is good and the plot is pretty
1,it 's really hard to suspend disbelief,it just was n't that bad
1,the story of an american working on the streets from the civil war of india was also an interesting premise,the film does have some creepy moments like when an old man goes home his girlfriend is a guy but she
1,whole premise of the book was just completely changed and i found,whole ordeal is shown as a vehicle for the whole world
1,no explanation the movie is bad,no one was able to survive in
1,but it 's a good watch and there,but that could be attributed to her
1,especially if you 're an insomniac of asian crime,especially for the time period of the day
1,amazing performances by all of these actors,amazing cinematography of the camera 's and lighting
1,the movie starts the trend of the story,the scene at the end involving a couple of
1,as the last episode of season the series,as a movie it 's just great
1,vibe and style are at its best when the story is finally unraveled,vibe and fiction are not a huge mistake but more or less
1,wwe 's a huge winner of movies but the plot is great too,wwe has been better as some of the better ones with many of the
1,after watching a series of shorts like this you are not sure where this is going,after the film i decided to leave that alone on the shelf at the box office
1,there are several things wrong with this film the acting is very fine i mean the special effects were so bad i actually,there was always a great deal of humour in the first movie though the first segment of the film is really good
1,they have to do what they did best the way,they really do n't have a very good movie
1,scott bakula plays the head of a great character and the movie has to take a long way to get,scott bakula does an admirable job of portraying a very human character and even more than he can ever
1,some of it i felt cheated was for the acting in the first,some pretty interesting plot twists to make the movie even more memorable
1,cleese is excellent as a cop who tries to get his money and a life insurance,cleese is a good actor who should have gone back to directing school to get up and
1,but that is the message they made to the characters by the end of each character 's eyes,but in the context of our society you must have been afraid to watch it and then the whole
1,why ca n't you see how people can watch this thing,why it would be such a failure at home on the back
1,i 've seen all the bad guys in my life and i really,i have always wanted to see a lot of people from china
1,he was able to take the time of his life for granted,he looks very angry and looks like a normal old lady
1,and i never forgot all about this movie because i thought i really,and if you liked the first you 'd know nothing about it
1,the script is very good and the,the film is not for everyone
1,but this film is n't bad,but that film could have used a
1,malibu 's story with it is still a good film,malibu 's only good thing about him is that he has
1,but it is too much for me to think about this film,but if you do n't know your characters then you should get a
1,i watched this film yesterday and i just love the acting and the characters,i think everyone should buy this movie and tell the story to get some interesting
1,hey i really hate movies i hate to think,hey no the person who gave an oscar for a
1,the script is awful and the plot twists is very basic in places,the script is awful with no real development and you can see the actors
1,he 's no one ever seen as the lead character,he is shown a mile away and he is also treated
1,sam waterston a great actor is always on the mark,sam mendes gives a fine performance and is both extremely funny
1,here there is a man who is constantly trying to,here is where the acting of the movie ends
1,island of god was a very poor choice that was n't in the same,island and space are just a few of the minor points of all
1,i saw this at the sundance film festival in 2001,i was looking forward to to buy this movie
1,i 've tried to get a copy of this show because i wanted but that was ok i just wanted i could,i had a hard time getting this show from a friend 's mouth and i think it might have been funnier
1,the only positive thing i can say about this movie is that it 's a,the characters do n't show any more in depth their faces is even worse
1,then the film is set aside in the climax,then you see a film from this story to be
1,last tango i was surprised to see the other comments on this turkey so i 'll make to my own name that this movie is not as,last october you can have a real stinker of the book and the acting is quite different and the actors involved are great especially charles bronson
1,according to the trivia i think this would have been a good idea as a film if the characters were in their own mood,according to his imdb jacket she was asked that she was a huge box office failure a million dollars but a long hair
1,the film does n't really need to be too good because,the acting was bad but the plot is really awful
1,when a young man loses his mother and her son he makes an acquaintance from his parents' wife,when i first saw this film i came to it and i really wanted to like it
1,some of the jokes are lame and not funny not,some have criticized the critics for a film which also makes
1,it is a comedy that deals with the same problems,it 's just another of those who make a movie about
1,the characters are a great mix between both the plot and characters,the best is the part where she gets a divorce over a phone
1,she makes a point that she cannot do it with the boys,she 's an actress that could make a movie more or less of
1,i would suggest that all the skaters out there could have been good,i have yet to tell that this is the worst horror movie ever made
1,some parts of the movie are simply ridiculous,some of the acting is very good
1,i was able to see it,i 've always thought a lot of
1,i remember that he was in it very similar to it,i also love the music in which everything was mentioned
1,mayer has to contend with a handsome and healthy and,mayer 's friend says a better word she says
1,excellent performances by the leads and they are pretty effective actors and the acting is,excellent acting great script great direction and even a single shot of his own
1,the only consolation i have with this is the terrible ending which seems to get in the way of being a classic,the story was not the least bit engaging in this movie but the way i was in the original film gave it more
1,then it 's all about a movie with an evil alien and a guy looking for a very creepy way to gain a better place,then you have an interesting story that moves along in a good pace that leaves the viewer to believe something was that about them
1,there 's a good reason to see it,there 's a few interesting scenes in this movie
1,this is where the real big screen starts,this movie did not come close to the book
1,i really wanted to like this movie a lot,i was impressed to see that the movie was very
1,so far i was disappointed as a bit of a lot and,so what does the filmmakers have to take in the movie
1,judy garland is excellent as her brother,judy davis is excellent as the love interest
1,i just watched it on my local cable station and i had never heard of it i decided to give it a,i 've never thought you have never heard of that and you 're supposed to get some pretty angry reviews here
1,worse yet the rest of the cast,worse yet what 's worse the film is
1,i found the end and the end when things are,i watched this after a friend who got annoyed
1,i was so disappointed for almost 30 minutes so,i love the movie and i love it
1,the result is a bit of a thriller so much,the acting is excellent but that does n't work
1,it 's a classic and well worth it,it 's a very simple film and if some
1,it did n't do much to entertain the audience for a reason as it seemed to be the film was actually supposed to be a movie,it 's almost a disservice to a certain degree of the plot that just seems to make no sense though the entire film is very well done
1,there are moments of this kind of story about a group of scientists who come into all sorts of shady and uncaring people,there are several other films that i would like to see but that did not make it worth the celluloid i saw this one
1,the only thing missing that was the scene with the giant cockroaches,the story is very simple the fact that this movie could n't take
1,but there are not only a few exceptions,but the acting is excellent to play and i
1,night club was an impressive and engaging story that got the recognition of a lot better now,night to kill a little boy who is being chased by the local cops and winds out with
1,the ending is so bad that we,the main character was very good
1,this is why you should check it out for fans,this film is not bad but nothing is wrong
1,the fact that it was written by a 14 year old boy puts it the best way to go,the only flaw here is that the main character is a little more complex than it could have been
1,aside from making a good movie i can only say i just want to give it,aside from that he looks just like the guy with the mustache with a glass
1,although she 's a bit stiff at times and even some things are n't bad either as this is n't,although the film was about the battle of the sexes you would expect this movie to be too good
1,there is a lot of footage and little continuity in the storyline,there are the usual twists which make the suspense seem gratuitous and unconvincing
1,the acting is terrible the only saving grace in this movie,the film also touches the tone as the plot unfolds
1,she is in love with a married woman,she is also a very nice character
1,the only good thing that 's going on here is how bad the show is,the film deals with a few things and the film follows itself well at that
1,well the story is so original even a slight,well a good movie to get out of
1,but the first time he has a chance to work so hard he has the,but the real story of this movie is so well done and so real
1,you just saw the movie and felt bad,you get to see the end of the world
1,however at this point in their lives i saw an awful attempt at a sequel to a film that was not scary,however with all its shortcomings it would never end up being one of the few great films by an unknown master star
1,but it is pretty much nothing new except for some of the,but i am not complaining that i have n't seen it
1,i found this movie a little hard to get through to the end it would be even,i mean she should n't have been nominated for him but the script could n't act
1,all the actors play for a great movie the plot,all in all nothing is very very very bad
1,i really do n't know what the director thought when they,i do n't have any hopes of watching this movie
1,and in one case there are other reasons for,and that 's all there is to it
1,also we learn that the killer who is,also the whole plot is not original
1,cronenberg was a master of the macabre cinema series who would have directed a better and better film,cronenberg tries to get his inspiration but a few other moments seem forced as it tries to be some
1,shadow of the fireflies is one of the best,shadow of the fireflies is a real treat for both
1,i love bad movies but only for the good reasons,i would strongly recommend giving them to any film buff this
1,i have n't read the book or seen an animated movie but i like the,i had the honor of a young and talented actor as an actor actor
1,they get a lot of people,they are as close to the real
1,the plot is full of holes and the story line is so simple that it makes a very poor and illogical storyline the,the director is the sort of person who thinks he 's gay or a pedophile and is too young to find one
1,if it were n't for the fact that the camera was obviously designed to make sense through the camera lens with its bare lighting,if you can catch the director 's intention to be let not forget about the plot it 's too easy to be charitable
1,this movie had the very last 15 minutes that you,this movie is definitely one of the more popular
1,dana fiennes is one of the most talented actors at the peak of his life,dana andrews gives a stellar portrayal of a young woman who is still dying
1,the rest of the cast is top notch except the lead and their performances and the,the director chooses to find a killer on the loose and that 's his name
1,he gets a chance to get on board for the crime as he tries to kill some kind of guy a little bit,he takes the movie as a joke while providing comic relief to his fans and he does n't let the movie go on a
1,never to be seen again however not to be missed,never mind the whole affair that would involve him so badly
1,they can make the same mistake without sacrificing their minds,they did n't try to make the story a good film
1,she is just so beautiful and the love she makes is that,she also appears as if she did but with it being
1,there are some scenes where they are not going to be any,there is n't a second character in the whole movie that could be
1,i am not impressed but now this is one,i loved the characters and they could n't
1,this movie is like an exercise on the wall with an interesting message of the world,this movie makes me sad that the people who gave this film 2 stars and voting for
1,this is a perfect movie to watch,this is a film that has been released
1,now if u 're not impressed with these kinds of,now for her the story is an intriguing one
1,i really wanted to give that 1 because as the story,i do n't think i would call this a movie
1,the film begins with the death of a girl,the first two films are a real masterpiece
1,much of the movie 's running time is quite long though for little kids the,much of the film is about a family in paris to celebrate their parents
1,when i came to the theater on the tv that aired i was the entire,when a very funny scene occurred when this film was made of his friends
1,the whole thing is about an alien of four separate people who,the story is a joke and the characters are all unlikable
1,the only reason i could rate this movie higher is 1 star jd,the whole idea of the film and the book itself was written by the
1,the only problem with this movie is that it has the very very low budget film badness where it does deliver on a scale of,the movie starts with a good looking black guy trying to act in a few movies but they 're too different to his role
1,this is a great show even if you are watching it on,this is a movie that makes it all worthwhile and uplifting
1,it also shows a lot of movies to like,it makes some parts of the film that do not
1,this is the worst episode of smallville since deadwood,this was a movie that did n't look like the
1,this is a good family movie for adults and children will enjoy it because of some of those who might know it is true,this is one hell of a boring movie because you could n't figure out what was going on and the acting and directing was horrible
1,nevertheless we have the main actors as well because they all had their own agenda,nevertheless the most interesting moment is the one where the father turns his head around the
1,although the story had a lot to do with the story of the man who could n't figure out,although i love all the kids who go into the movie i ca n't think of anything good
1,this movie was one of the best i have ever seen on film,this is one of the few movies i 'll watch with the lights off
1,despite a few glaring flaws the performances of the leads are very well done and the editing is flawless,despite the bad acting there are many moments of mild and utter amusement and tension that would have left the
1,the rest of the film was a complete waste of time but the cast members did a great job the locations were breathtaking,the acting is decent although this was definitely a big budget film with the acting the film being the first and better it is
1,also he did this with his performance but what 's the,also many scenes have come from an overly long dream
1,this is probably the last bollywood musical movie it has produced,this movie was not funny at all although it was obviously intended
1,so far as i was surprised after reading my review on the comments posted how i felt a little surprised,so if you 're a fan of italian horror then watch them in one of those films i would like to
1,you know what to expect from one of the leads,you 'll have to be a little to ask if you
1,and they do n't even think of a good reason to view this movie a remake,and i hope he has taken care of the old saying it should have just been called
1,it might have been very much the worst movie i have ever seen,it is difficult to follow what a movie should have done and if it
1,tiffany michelle geller is very good as the main character and is a real pleasure for me,tiffany is one of the cutest actress who have appeared in any movie since her husband
1,disaster is just plain silly a must but only to,disaster is not as good as the other two
1,it also works because it plays many parts and they are all,it is unfortunate to see that he has a few lines
1,that 's why it deserves more than,that 's why i liked this
1,well the plot line has a lot of potential in it the only good thing about a movie is the acting,well not long after it happens and the ending of the film is just not as great as the first two
1,it 's a shame that no one could give the two leads to a small town,it 's a great time capsule and that i am willing to bet it 's a better
1,finally the action does n't get its message,finally in a series of scenes and a scene
1,the film is just plain boring,the script by larry simon and a
1,in my opinion the film deserves to be called mst3k but it is just not worth your time just put it in the library and watch the,in the first movie the camera crew had an important character at the beginning and the story was not only to showcase the very basic plot
1,the movie is just a series of clips that are hard to explain,the other actors are so funny that i actually felt they were reading the
1,a few scenes are in the book one of the,a must see for those who saw the movie
1,similarly bad and stupid and all the same,similarly the movie is almost like an extended sketch
1,after all this is what happens between the three,after you 're on the dvd you will find a
1,mindblowing music score by john sayles and the musical score,mindblowing music and great camerawork and a few scenes in which
1,with only one minor event the movie lacks,with great action sequences and great acting
1,and it seems that some of them are just as good as this one,and the last quarter of the movie was just stupid the whole show seemed too
1,they are all quite attractive and likable,they were all a bit unbelievable at age
1,maybe the writers were trying to make a movie based on the success of,maybe it should n't have been a lot of fun to watch it
1,solstice is one of his best as he 's a terrific actor,solstice is like nothing more than a documentary about nothing sacred about a
1,and when the killer was over the whole two was just another dude,and even though a true message is needed to the characters that appear to
1,the fact that it was produced by a wide array of other reviewers,the film is in parts a poor excuse for a serious drama
1,a lot was missing for what would have been a great and original movie,a simple story of an abusive woman that has a severe breakdown and ultimately does
1,i'm in shock at all the people who made it so stupid that they never,i'm not even sure there will ever be another movie this year or so
1,roger corman is trying too hard to be different and even tries to tell you what he thought you,roger ebert who played and directed this film should just as well have a strong respect for this
1,but i was n't looking forward to,but it was a good movie
1,julia thompson in a part that is actually better than her son,julia stiles was excellent in her performance but i ca n't blame her
1,an interesting premise for a film made in,an amazing actor from director anthony minghella
1,it 's too silly an awful movie and i have already seen it countless times,it made me feel i had spent my time trying to understand all the negative reviews
1,the only reason that it was released is the way that one of,the problem with the film is the way where it gets boring
1,maybe that is the point of the movie that does n't,maybe they have a soft focus of them in it
1,now one would hope for my review i'm,now i would 've just watched it
1,at first the audience is treated to a couple of vignettes featuring a bit of sexual violence for the younger crowd when they have an orgasm,at times it seemed to take over some people but the filmmakers tried to make the movie an entertaining movie with a bit of comedy
1,this is a very realistic movie and it gives the film an extra sense to it that are,this film had a similar story but sadly i could n't get that movie of my youth
1,a true story of a girl from the mainland and in one of the,a true story is the director for the first time of the film
1,my only regret for the movie was it was a remake of the classic film called 'the game',my grade f eye candy this movie is one of the worst i i have ever seen
1,brad johnson plays the evil dead girl who tries to save rachel from her parents,brad pitt plays this character a man who is so confused as to be unable to
1,the music is well done and very fitting,the first thing i had to do is take
1,forget about the plot that follows the storyline,forget the fact that it is set in paris
1,each of the leads has a great supporting cast,each one is a very nice but interesting way of
1,it was as this guy was trying to talk to her dad,it is not as simple as i hoped it was n't a film
1,except for this fact the film has an extremely dark atmosphere in the first third of its short runtime and an impressive soundtrack,except to those who are willing to live in that area 's mind to live and accept what would be a fun experience
1,charlie is a quiet and loving mother with any,charlie sheen is brilliant as a ruthless gambler
1,soon the woman discovers this woman is cheating on her,soon they end up in a strange place where the entire
1,the result is a complete dud that 's only mildly funny enough to hold up my interest,the only positive thing about this movie was the acting and the casting by the kids
1,we got the movie and we do,we were n't laughing so much
1,big wednesday is the most intelligent movie ever made at a screening of date movie,big night after watching it we get to see the same old time and place again
1,more like a dream that has not been done before,more people should not waste their money on a dvd
1,the whole picture of all the bad guys was n't,the cast is perfect the script and the cinematography
1,invite this one by it 's sheer badness,invite me to say that this is a poor
1,she has n't done a great job expressing this,she also has an affair with a pianist
1,if you can handle this film with a very good understanding and you want to see an example of how,if it has an flaw to be that of a movie that 's not a complete waste of time
1,this movie does n't have to,this movie is a waste of time
1,disgust to the viewer if you are n't paying attention from the acting and the acting skills that,disgust on all people who are all that of such bad movies and this will be ok
1,also the soundtrack was great i thought,also his mother and two sons in each
1,for me it was like watching the paint dry,for instance after that point of view the whole story
1,average and cheesy for the first 15 minutes or so but it seems that even the screenwriters ca n't decide if i want it to be that good,average action film from the 70 's but even though the acting was terrible it is mostly unknown with a cast of a low budget b movie that should
1,in fact this was only one episode,in all it 's very good
1,depalma 's direction is excellent for the most part and the music score,depalma 's best remembered has got to be the best way of dealing with
1,the movie is also a spoof of the genre and while the storyline is quite simple they,the character was played by one of the characters who really cared about a mysterious child
1,i saw a preview and the only film that makes it better,i would watch it again but i 'd rather see in my eyes
1,in a time when he was in trouble with a friend and his wife the kids were pretty hot despite their differences and affection and the affection for him is a little strained,in the early 1950s of new zealand hollywood it was filmed and filmed at the peak of day of that time when released in the early 20th century with the director of a film
1,you can get a lot of fun but even then you know the ending,you 're getting into a taxi chase a guy that happens to be an undercover
1,you can just hope that 's one reason to feel sorry for the poor child,you ca n't possibly forget that when the kid is in the car he gets hit
1,oh there is a lot of things wrong,oh that is not true it does
1,just do n't get me wrong i like the way he portrayed,just do n't get me wrong i'm not kidding at all
1,in my opinion he 's an evil cop,in a very subtle scene when the daughter is
1,this is a film that should be a must,this is one of the best movies from bollywood and
1,this movie is a must rent again and again i can only,this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,norman bates is one of the most underrated actors ever to have lived on and is great as the ruthless prince and this is one of his finest action movies together,norman barrymore stars as paul a struggling american man and a perfect place to find a girl who 's been invited to live in a home by the people on the street
1,the music is the usual annoying and annoying rendition of,the main problem with the movie is the pacing
1,her performance in this film is very very bad and her looks even more as well as her body was,her boyfriend is having trouble getting involved in the investigation because the woman is kidnapped and then when she is killed
1,can they find no real life in that film,can the same old plot be told with his own
1,not only was this movie boring but it took me a,not really any movie should have a story like this
1,in this movie he also plays his usual character,in the end what could be called the film 's
1,this is by the way of thinking the movie was,this must be a good film on your face
1,now that 's it 's obvious me is it is just a total disaster,now in the end the series gets a little predictable towards the end
1,the movie seems to take off much more as there are characters running around talking about their actions and how they can stand in the woods,the story of the relationship between two is one that is so over the top that you do n't see it even on the screen
1,i do n't usually see the film industry of movie blockbusters but as an,i was watching this at an outdoor screening and i was not impressed
1,why ca n't people see the movie at any of the best,why is he trying to find people or in the case of the
1,there are some very funny scenes featuring jack damon,there are moments we are not aware of on the
1,you can see the point with this production,you must surely do this kind of thing
1,kimberly 's character is one of hollywood 's brightest most famous characters,kimberly phillips is good as the main character who 's been kidnapped in
1,the acting was also not too bad but in fact,the plot is ridiculous and the acting is awful
1,most of the story takes place in the late 1950 's where the town seems to have some very interesting places,most of the scenes are filmed in an old fashion and the acting is so terrible that they 're hard to believe
1,what makes this a good movie for me is in its portrayal of it all,what more can we possibly associate with a book about this woman who does n't have
1,robert englund and the main characters just keep getting old and funny,robert blake as an evil wizard of his mother was always a joy
1,watch it again and am glad i,watch it at your own risk
1,there are things wrong with the movie and i did like that because they do n't quite have the personality in the movie,there would be a number of survivors as the main character played by donald pleasence is given the opportunity to show him how to
1,so the story is a big letdown,so the film opens as a result in
1,not even the terrible acting in general is good,not being a fan of the genre but the tv
1,just like a few minutes or so i have not done it any longer,just a bad movie about a bunch of bad guy people who are so wooden
1,now you can have it with the original,now it 's so hard to make any rational
1,it is almost impossible to watch anything in the past,it really has nothing to do with the story of the
1,watched it as a great movie but it is absolutely hysterical in its own way,watched out again if you 're thinking of watching this awful horror movie i just have
1,read your summary if you want good entertainment then,read something else but you should n't think
1,when in reality a movie gets you through the age of 30,when you take a few minutes of crap into the film you will
1,when that is n't enough there actually was n't a lot of gore in the movie that i did n't like,when i first met mr rochester 's character at a television show the series i was expecting this was going to be
1,it 's the story of the same kid,it 's a movie for all tastes
1,when the man is talking a woman has to be stabbed,when the movie is over you get the feeling that the actors
1,schreiber 's direction is the usual and tedious the plot is a bit of a mess,schreiber 's script was a bit farfetched yet he is still a very good man
1,because as well the script and direction are solid though the music is very good and the film keeps us from our eyes,because it had a good cast including john landis bob taylor and chris farley in this picture it was pretty obvious that they were
1,so in my case i 'd say this movie is worth it,so it 's the sort of movie that i can guarantee but that
1,she plays a part of this very sexy young man from her home home with a small,she is a young man who lives in a mansion after the events of the depression
1,some people say that the movie does have a few of those elements,some of the scenes are obviously designed to be a little disturbing like the
1,one might ask for a refund to be released,one thing 's to have done with the new footage
1,the only film we see in the movie that was better than this,the film is a bit overlong and too fast paced and predictable as a
1,recently i have this film and i did not want to watch it all the way through,recently the other side of the pack is when a bunch of thieves have to deal with a
1,the movie would really have been made today,the film is full as the movie is filled
1,it 's a shame it was never,it really is an entertaining story
1,thank god for a couple of years ago,thank you for the cast and crew to make
1,people who want to see themselves get away with the bad guys do n't rent the movie,people who do n't want to see them take up their souls are not going to save their
1,come on if you think the idea that a movie is a little bit too farfetched for a horror film the acting is absolutely perfect,come back as if not for a moment in the script by the way and the end of the movie it seems more like a comedy
1,on the other hand he could be a man who was responsible for the murder that he had committed the murder of both his life,on a technical level the cinematography is decent and the soundtrack is amazing and i think the composer is a really very talented man
1,there is a lot of violence in the movie and the whole thing should have been cut and the characters were much better,there 's no need to be a fan of this movie or if you are a fan of the genre you will not be
1,i have been a big fan of the,i know there are some better scripts
1,despite the fact that the film is not only a visual style i can forgive that,despite the fact that the movie is very close to being a typical of what hollywood should
1,also there are moments when the camera is speaking of,also the music is just a little too loud
1,during the film u never really want to see or hear of the movie so much in it but that does n't mean it 's not,during this film i was expecting the first two chapters of the movie to end and i liked the ending but that was the end
1,i have to admit that i have n't seen anything like this before,i love this show because i'm going to go buy it and watch it
1,his movies are pretty entertaining and i liked this one,his portrayal of people who know very well when i saw
1,do so a lot of people have done research on this movie as i,do n't know what to think when you watch the same old film
1,all this leads to a very nice ending but i have,all of those who do n't need the extra bit
1,screams are a lot more funny than,screams do n't work on it
1,it 's about love and violence,it has a very strong story and
1,highly recommended for a younger audience,highly recommended to anyone who enjoyed this
1,in fact the only good part of the film is the casting choice as well as a nice supporting actor in a cameo in this movie,in fact the most remarkable aspects of this production are the incredible songs the soundtrack the score and the score which is probably the best
1,i think the film 's subject matter is too simple and the,i do so i could n't believe all the other actors
1,hughes' mother has problems with a boyfriend who loves every girl with his daughter,hughes' work is great if you 're lucky enough to have a good night out
1,dennis hopper was a great actor in,dennis quaid is excellent as always
1,andre is such an enjoyable little boy that it does make a couple of laughs but they do just what it,andre braugher plays him in the role of the police detective who is a bit more than he bargained for
1,it has lots of humor and humor,it may not be the worst comedy ever
1,it has to have a bit of mystery it does n't come across as,it is a shame that many of the reviews here were pretty awful
1,but there is no doubt that the script for the movie is n't bad in every episode,but then this movie is a very low budget film and i'm so proud that i only spent
1,but the most important thing about this film is,but she 's not a real good actress
1,they make sure that he 's not the one who would win the academy but when he does get to the house it 's all about the dog,they did n't show the typical suspects that they are going to be in the same way but it is clear that there is n't much to the story
1,while most of the action takes place in the most brutal and mysterious setting,while it 's not just a bad movie there is something about it the film
1,it should not be enough for a film about a young,it 's a real tearjerker of a movie like this
1,how can you really want to miss the main,how about the plot was n't any existent
1,a bad case of a long career the movie is so bad its laughable it 's funny and i'm a big fan of low budget,a couple of days ago i was in the mood and i saw a very touching and caring sadness when the film came across
1,so many times i saw the movie and thought something,so this goes along as a very nice movie
1,this was a fine example of this when the characters,this film is a real treasure of a movie
1,i could go on but i wo n't tell you more,i do n't know if i should not see this movie for
1,but the film 's story and acting is just bad,but you do n't get bored with this one
1,would have been more suited to the original,would he even have an eyeopening actor that 's
1,well after i watch this movie that i am being in my twenties and seeing,well this is a must for anyone interested in the acting of jean gabin
1,other than that the movie lacks a lot of action and that is,other than that if you have n't seen this film do n't
1,how many viewers have seen the film beforehand to be shocked by the lack of imagination,how does one say that he has n't done anything to work this life anywhere
1,in this case the film is really hard on the eyes,in the book however the movie would have to have been less
1,that 's an act of brilliance,that is the most disgusting thing about
1,i just wanted to watch him die before he,i would like to see more of this
1,do n't misunderstand me and go to the movies to see this crap,do not misunderstand me but that will keep you laughing out loud when they
1,the movie 's script is the biggest piece of crap i 've ever seen,the other main attraction of the movie however is its ability to get out of
1,it could be a good movie to see i do n't recommend renting,it 's not as if he took on the whole movie either
1,and then there is the way this movie is done,and in doing so i was surprised to find that i
1,here we go and look like a,here he meets a few days
1,she looks great and the voice cast is great,she was a lot of fun to watch so when
1,the acting is all of a good note,the script is very good the story is a
1,instead i would n't want to see the movie but it is,instead of watching this it was a complete waste of time
1,many of the lines were good the acting was ok the,many years later they seem to be in this story
1,the only reason why i liked the movie is that it 's not just another teen slasher flick a lot of the action,the movie makes me think about the lives of two men of the church and they need to do the right thing and say
1,also i ca n't help but wonder,also the special effects were awful
1,having read somewhere about the film beforehand the book i saw it in the uk version on dvd,having played many roles and having recently been in a movie with his wife and a son this is
1,i would advise everyone to watch it with the hope that it will be as enjoyable fun as a horror film but it was not very convincing,i was lucky enough to see this on the sundance channel with a friend of mine and for a few years the film 's finest picture of the
1,i was so excited for the role of the villain i forgot so much he was n't one dimensional character,i love lucy mars 's acting in this film and it is quite a good idea she 's such a fine
1,when i had the opportunity to see him in this movie as being a young person he seems to be the director 's inspiration,when an independent production company is going to have been involved in this project and all films of the same caliber are usually a big
1,david cronenberg is excellent in the first film which this one has roped into,david hasselhoff is good as the sheriff who 's a bit too young to have
1,yet another character who could n't have been killed is either a delusion,yet they were probably more concerned with the quality of his filmmaking
1,the movie is also the kind of,the result is an overlong bore
1,it seems that the people behind this production should really not be the only one who can identify with this movie,it is a shame that these two actors could not have chosen to act out a couple of years better
1,it 's a shame that they did n't make good actors anymore on this one i will never get a second,it 's a shame because they have no place in the film and do n't tell much about the main character 's
1,allbut it 's the main plot of the movie that has a bit of,allbut the whole movie is just a vehicle for the girl she plays
1,we get to see him dressed through a woman 's face,we learn that he has learned a valuable lesson and a love
1,there are many twists and turns that i liked to give it a perfect,there is no such things on an issue of some level of film
1,the action is minimal and while some scenes are quite shocking and some of all are very effective it 's,the rest of the movie and the performances are just awful and it should be avoided at all costs
1,while the film has a lot of fun in it it is a beautiful and very entertaining,while the characters try to make things funny the result is also just a bad movie
1,in conclusion if i was a student or something i would n't be able to distinguish the film and tell him that,in the end of the day the tables is discovered and we find that these weapons have been in the area
1,it 's not worth your time if you 're looking for a comedy you,it really does n't matter that a lot of movies make this mistake
1,however this is n't a bad movie to begin with,however his new friends just never do the same
1,and that is a great premise,and as an example of the culture
1,his sister is a little naive at all and is just a good,his movies are not all that good at the best of them
1,cassel 's direction does n't have to be a,cassel and matthau are very good in here
1,i just finished watching the video and i thought,i was n't able to give that away but i
1,i found a lot of the movie and the story to go back was the biggest letdown in life but the acting of course is pretty good,i do n't see the point to the end but the ending is quite shocking too and it 's hard to say about what to do the ending
1,what a sad way to spend a couple of hours of a,what makes it so great is life it 's a movie
1,so she can say the f word and that she is,so why did n't he become obsessed by his brother
1,however despite the lack of a decent plot it 's also pretty well,however the film 's climax is really really sad in the end
1,the director 's acting skills are pretty bland but it 's,the rest of the cast is great in this film
1,then again i was totally bored,then the film takes a turn of
1,even the soundtrack is n't even half decent,even the score was lame beyond belief and in
1,the film feels a lot more interesting and more of a thriller that it is so hard to relate,the story is about a kid named kenny who wants to be a child at the local community
1,check for the moment when you saw the trailer,check out the director 's commentary about this
1,and then when the guy is over it,and that 's what it 's like
1,robert duvall plays the lead as the evil leader of the police,robert siodmak 's directorial debut here is a marvel of quality but at
1,i 've seen this movie dozens of times and i 've never seen anything like it again,i thought it was a real treat to have a lot of the time and money to see
1,the script by william s robinson is great as the,the ending was very abrupt and was quite laughable
1,not even a film like that,not that i would purchase the movie
1,please if you are a fan of john candy you may,please for the very moment do not see this movie
1,the only part you can recall that i had found was the fact that this was made for,the acting is superb the story is so complex and touching and the characters are so sweet
1,production values are high which is enough to give it a,production values are n't bad and the acting is terrible
1,i really do n't know much about it but i have a hard time caring for,i would give this film a lower vote on imdb 's vote on the box
1,it 's a good movie to watch and for some strange reason it was directed by,it was n't the worst movie i have ever seen but i still enjoy it
1,even when the script is not the good it 's as,even the title song in the background is just awful
1,but the fact that it is an excellent story makes the movie watchable,but we have a bunch of actors who look good in the lead roles
1,what kind of a future did they make this movie,what can i say about this film with a lot of
1,domino 's father is also as an actor and he,domino just happens to be a very sexy figure
1,since a large percentage of the other characters did n't get killed there were,since this is a comedy it is a film about the real life
1,it does n't matter that this guy is supposed to be a serial killer,it is so rare that we need to find the story and we have the
1,janeway 's girlfriend tries his best to get the best of his colleagues,janeway and the snowman are always at the top of the game but their
1,john cusak as col john malkovich as a small detective who does a good job of playing a cop role for the first,john cassavetes is a master of modern genius and his craft in his book seems to have no idea what it is
1,why would you put me to a bad one movie,why are it called sequels that are actually pretty funny and
1,i mean how did they get the car and the engine is about the killer and the,i was excited that the movie is one of the most influential movies in the genre
1,as for the rest of the movie it 's an interesting story,as you can expect you 'll feel more interested in what
1,we get the impression that it is in some ways a little too heavyhanded but a good enough,we all knew a little bit from the movie but we could only understand that they were in a
1,i 'll tell you what the characters are n't in the film that they are,i guess it 's a bad thing but it was so great and funny that it
1,i guess i had to laugh at times,i had never heard of this movie
1,some of them might have been a lot more interesting,some of the jokes are actually funny but the only ones
1,it is so awful that it is even laughably embarrassing to watch,it 's a shame because it 's a pity she is so popular
1,it seems so much more to me than it 's predecessors i did n't get the impression,it shows us that a film that will make everyone feel a good deal is at home when
1,there are two scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the first two films,there were two things that just could have had some potential but i think the film
1,in an attempt to make a point about this situation the audience sees no reason why the filmmakers think to make it even remotely watchable,in order to avoid the movie which is supposed to be a success it comes across as being a great example of bad filmmaking
1,oh and what 's worse the music,oh and what is the point in the
1,i think the plot is very bad,i will be able to watch the film
1,this is a very bad movie and not worth watching for any good,this is certainly the best film i have seen in my life
1,the script by stephen king and peter falk is as follows from the perspective of the novel by james cagney and while it,the first one i watched at this time is the same but not so much as to be quite like the original
1,he is as the lead character who makes a very interesting appearance,he was the one who was able to kill him out of a
1,it 's a really bad film,it 's difficult to believe but you
1,definitely if you do n't like the original you 'll enjoy seeing the original as a child,definitely a mustsee for fans of those who are desperate to see what is not ranked among them
1,in the end the only person left to have his own wife,in my opinion it should be said that the entire movie was a
1,lake placid is a very moving and very moving film with a strong plot and story development,lake mungo was one of the first shows that was more realistic but it just left me feeling
1,sadly the movie is poorly directed and not very compelling at all,sadly the first movie was just so awful that even though they were
1,she was killed by a couple of men who were fighting and who fought with them,she was really quite good in her career as her mother although she did not have her
1,in the first one she is not given her son and she is not afraid to leave after which,in this episode a man has a daughter named missy the girl she loves is actually an interesting role for
1,but the only thing worth seeing is the,but it is still a good movie
1,but what i loved about this film was how the story started out well and the,but to all who would watch the whole thing you would see it as inspiration
1,kids should watch the movie without the slightest hint of sexual orientation,kids like you might want to put the kid next to you
1,miller 's character is completely different than anyone else is and that is no reason,miller made a brief effort to make a successful film on that famous director
1,we are given a bunch of characters who have no clue of what happened during their entire lives of a young,we are never really sure whether or not the character of jesus or not are more than enough to survive
1,you are not able but the plot is totally unbelievable,you know you are not going to see any of the
1,you get to see the first one and the second is the first half the movie,you cannot watch the actors at the very least times it would make any sense
1,what a complete waste of time,what are up with the story in
1,then they get married so she can give it his best,then the film starts introducing the characters with a new dimension and
1,every other aspect of the film was really entertaining and i loved this film the plot was pretty good,every frame every parent is allowed to identify with hisher life 's family and they are very different
1,instead of being the same to the same destination,instead we start with a lame twist ending
1,i thought that this movie was great,i found myself wondering about the guy and
1,it was a waste of my time,it is truly sad that the movie did
1,if you 're lucky this movie will be forgotten you do n't have to make the,if not the worst movie you will ever see and just as much of it
1,no this was n't a pretty good movie,no one else can be compared with other movies
1,an excellent cast and well made with a superb soundtrack,an interesting one however is a story of a bunch of
1,secondly it 's all pretty boring and the ending is predictable,secondly if you have n't enjoyed any of the film skip this
1,i also like the idea and the acting,i have to give it a chance and just
1,if you want a good b movie go rent the dvd or,if you are a fan of the movies then see it
1,each episode is set up and the characters are very compelling,each of the characters had the ability to really care about the
1,there have been a few movies with him like the shining that are even better,there is n't a laugh for sure but it 's a joy to watch
1,it 's as if someone in the cast has tried,it 's got the perfect combination to show it
1,i will tell u i 'll never be allowed to go see it again it really gives me a few lessons regarding why i feel this movie deserved any more praise at all,i think that 's the point of the game that most people are not in who might have been to have been the only person who had thought of it as they did to
1,this movie is a disgrace for any fan of that period,this is a film that has only a few laughs
1,the movie ends at the very beginning when the police officer and other guy decide to go straight,the characters are n't even funny either as the acting is poor it 's bad or bad
1,this is by far the worst film i have ever seen,this film was just horrible and the worst thing i can say
1,this film is so awful i'm just a tad horrified of it 's stupidity and just about anything,this one is nothing like i 've seen since the 1930 's in the first place and it was
1,said the story for the most part was a little farfetched,said no matter how stupid a horror flick can be
1,nearly every scene features a closeup of someone walking out of the woods,nearly every episode was the most popular sitcom of the 70 's
1,although the film 's soundtrack was a bit heavy it is still a great movie nonetheless,although it 's all very important to the plot it just seems pretty obvious to me that
1,this movie is a must see for everyone interested in the history of war and the history,this leads back to the future time after it happens and finally the rest of the people who
1,also with that being one of my favorite characters i really enjoyed the film,also the actors who could have had in fact had been done something
1,i have never seen a movie depicting them in such a manner but at least their performances are worth mentioning,i saw many people thinking and i found them totally lacking but a movie that i did n't like
1,i really enjoyed this movie because it kept on going through some great moments and the script was,i 'd give this film a rating of 410 but if only it is an average movie
1,but the director 's screenplay lacks the depth and,but as it comes it is about time
1,also there is something of a subplot in which the movie was set in a small town where a,also he is a man with whom he gets a role of a hitman from time to time
1,a must see for all kids,a group of teenage adults are going
1,thank you for allowing me to stay awake for,thank you for making films like this one
1,it also has a good mix of action and suspense that should have been required viewing only because the acting is a joke and the actors who played the script was atrocious,it also shows how everyone should be done what you have been thinking of this film so i will not deny that this is a masterpiece of film for those who like independent
1,maybe it is the reason i have no idea why,maybe this movie was a bit of a stretch as he
1,he 's a bit naive or that the director of the,he had a pretty good idea of the first film
1,you ca n't help but wonder why anyone would want to kill the girl without his dad,you could find some kind of love that develops to a family 's relationship as well as many
1,the actors seem to have been doing the right thing,the scene in the shop was done by someone in the
1,i mean it is a nice movie but not as good as the bad guys or the better plan 9 from outer space,i would like to say that the characters was the only real depth of the piece but i had to deal with one of
1,it 's a really good show,it 's a shame when i saw
1,the story begins with a young boy returning from chicago,the performances are excellent and the photography is good
1,there are two main characters in many of their roles,there is absolutely no plot and the script is boring
1,tierney is very sexy in a brief but convincing,tierney plays a beautiful woman in the film
1,using of actors who do n't really try to make up for this,using her first words in a song he sang a song called babel of
1,but for the most part the story,but it 's still too short
1,sam raimi in his first film,sam waterston in the cast is just
1,here we are seeing the main character who is played by the main character who is,here the show revolves around two boys that would be the same year in school
1,i mean what the hell am i doing about it,i thought this movie was excellent it was great it had
1,some of the episodes with great actors and a,some of it is pretty much a turnoff
1,if you can find the new version and rent it you will find it well written,if you are a big fan of asian horror flicks then this movie is n't perfect for
1,her performance is the poorest in the film,her husband is a woman and an aspiring woman
1,the film is shot in technicolor and the scenes with his family are pretty well executed with a sense of humor that is the only reason for the sheer impact in this film,the most interesting of the series is the way it ended with two seasons of the final episode of 'the series that started the show was rushed the storyline was good too
1,the acting is terrible the sound is bad,the acting is pretty bad as well
1,yes it might not have been good as there were a lot of,yes but there are moments where he has a lot of fun
1,it 's like a really bad piece of art,it was interesting to see a movie like this in
1,i am not one of hollywood 's hottest people,i think a bad thing this movie was
1,i was actually hoping that it would be a movie i could,i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies
1,dennis quaid does what most of you think it looks as if we want to know how the people in,dennis rodman has his own good but it looks too stupid and he was too menacing in this film
1,ron palillo stars as a former scientist with a secret conscience called the secret police department,ron perlman plays his wife who is a prostitute and is very fond of him
1,if anybody thinks the film is funny i would rather,if you love it you should have been warned
1,are we supposed to care about the characters,are you trying to tell these people that you
1,the movie is also a very clever adaptation of the novel the adventures of a,the film was a lot more effective and more impressive in the second sense
1,i love the story about the power of the family life and for every viewing of a certain life where one is left and right to the middle age and the,i 've been watching this movie every now and again on video stores and commercials i was thinking twice as i thought it would give a great chance to come
1,many of the movie references are not included,many people will actually relate to this film
1,this movie is a mustsee for the family,this is the first of the many of disney
1,not that the movie was any big deal but it is,not too much and it was very funny watching it
1,those who find out she 's being stalked are one of the greatest things ever to grace for,those that are still with me and do n't have to worry about any movie being a good example
1,even the director and director do n't even try to make,even though i think the fact that the main character 's character
1,nihalani never had an eye candy that he was not allowed on,nihalani does some justice with his film 's success especially at the end
1,it is a pity because it also suffers from a lack of talent the production values are terrible and the editing,it has to be seen to be believed that he did n't have a clue when the script was over the top
1,night was the last film of the great bogart in the title role,night i still do n't have been taken to a high school and that
1,the film is filled with moments,the actors are mostly a pretty poor
1,i will always remember it as a comedy classic,i saw that many more years ago after the first
1,the story has a couple of decent actors like richard and david and the movie is an excellent example of its genre,the movie has some very funny moments especially with the girls in the basement and the hot chick looks as though she was
1,sublimely enough for all the action sequences the camera work is minimal,sublimely bad movie that will make you watch but its just bad
1,it 's a very fun ride,it has many faults to say but
1,pretty the film is the most interesting thing to be ever seen on the western screens of the twentieth century,pretty good but the story just seems to fit the theme of being a romantic comedy in which the character 's
1,he then gets killed because its so a man who could destroy his wife and he was just,he meets the real linda etting whom will have many problems for her own and for her
1,the story is n't much different and the movie is about a guy who is trying to make it out of,the movie also features some of the most memorable shots ever filmed but it is n't a very good movie
1,we see the movie to be a very good example of how the world view,we learn one thing that this film is supposed to be trying to be
1,then again i do n't really watch it again or even enjoy the,then the film switches slowly for a series of the brightest scenes
1,i have heard some of that it 's a lot of different ideas but that is,i have to say i did n't think you can really identify with this movie
1,however the only reason i give this dvd a dvd was because it 's not a movie that the audience does not need to experience,however the plot of the movie is pretty basic and the story line was boring and i would 've never watched a whole episode
1,do n't worry too there 's a chance to get through the entire thing,do not watch it if you want to see the best in the world that
1,a very young and touching experience and a,a lot of the jokes were funny
1,the film is very funny though,the dialogue was so stupid i thought
1,the film is a mishmash of a film that explores a common thread that exists,the movie is also filled with the usual romance and the comedy and suspense
1,oh this is an important film that never had a touch that i could have enjoyed but it never seemed to hit the ground,oh yeah well anyway in that respect there are other films that will bore more than you want to see and make it easier
1,for all those viewers who want to be entertained and appreciated by this movie i could have really taken it as if it were an art project,for what it is for the first hour or so of the movie you know you 're watching an alien film but not even remotely original
1,i like the fact that this is one of the worst films since sliced bread,i am not sure why this film flopped on dvd and made in the netherlands and
1,he 's supposed to take revenge at night to save humanity of the evil he goes in and saves his life,he is just a little bit of an idiot who does n't seem to have any respect for the character he tries
1,pimlico and his band members in a war,pimlico is n't a very good movie
1,i hope he has been cast as an actor on the case of the,i have watched the same movie as the first movie to see it
1,really what could have been an entertaining psychological experience is an engrossing movie,really they have two friends who is killed in a car crash
1,this movie is a complete failure to watch and it is not long enough to waste a fair amount of time,this was probably not a movie you could watch with friends and would not have forgotten a thousand beers or two about
1,however this is the real world of people 's hearts of a woman in,however i must say that this movie is so bad it 's good
1,the first season were good but the first series was pretty good,the whole film is a complete package of bad acting lame dialog and
1,he is obviously a little too infatuated with the younger generations too and,he 's still on the side of the road with his daughter
1,or not to find the courage to take a family at the top of an international building and to be the recipient of the real world is it,or do n't you repeat the same thing again as this time so let me get it out of the way let 's emphasize it to the first film
1,following all the problems of life it is a story that keeps you glued to your seat and will not lose your expectations in your memory,following her family 's affair with two children whose lives is discovered by an old woman named cesar played by a younger brother and is forced to
1,suddenly they discover the secrets of the ship,suddenly there is just something so stupid
1,everything looks fake and not so,everything that makes this movie good is
1,til you have to wait for the director to get a decent movie with the director andor a director to make you laugh,til the first thirty minutes this film is a complete 180 of a film on imdb but i would n't do so
1,just when they take to a real house they 're,just a hint of nostalgia at a young age
1,it 's worth viewing that it contains many twists that can cause me to fall,it 's hard to imagine how this film can be viewed on film festivals
1,and if you 're not a big fan of,and we learn that everyone can replace him
1,i found myself wishing it had been written as a straight drama and i suspect,i 've never seen a movie emote that of a person with a camera
1,in other words the people in this film seem to just be killed by the movie and they are not,in general the film is one of the most compelling movies that i have ever seen but they all just look
1,or even a woman who loves it,or should i say kudos to a great
1,my favorite scene is of the two guys hitting a horse and saying something and one of,my friends and i sat down and went a while my grandma and i were on
1,hanks 's best is to make your eyes bleed,hanks is the only reason i love this film so
1,i love that in that one movie of the highest order of the 80s this one was almost all it has,i think that the story of ned 's wife and the father 's relationship with each other was more interesting
1,otherwise as this is a low budget movie with no redeeming qualities whatsoever because the main actors were really annoying,otherwise it could be quite scary if the director had an intellect to be a part of the plot
1,the acting and script are n't particularly original for a film student,the first episode was very poor and i was very impressed with this
1,blade runner is another one of those movies,blade runner is not one of them
1,now there is some real talent on the part of the,now there 's a small plot twist between the two
1,they made them up to leave a lot,they have n't done something with it
1,the ending was great i was shocked as i read the film,the film was so horrible that i thought that the whole cast made
1,but after about 20 minutes or so i 'll just have to wonder if it 's just a film to make a movie to watch,but for its time it does n't make me worry about the acting chops of the plot to the point where a woman is the worst
1,in spite of its deficiencies it is more convincing than one of woody allen 's movies a true story,in a movie he has never shown anything with his other films so what makes this a movie
1,the movie is n't the only action film it 's shot in,the movie has a real life story and i feel that the filmmakers
1,for those who want to know what they were going to get on a plane crash you 'll definitely want to watch a film with a,for a few years there are many films about those who want to be so happy and so realistic by the reality of the world
1,she is constantly dressed herself down in a chair and looks,she is one of the most famous actors in hollywood
1,they did have to contend with each other they are supposed to be so that the,they 're on the right side of the road for an obvious amount of sex
1,although a movie that is based on a true story i would rather have seen the movie,although the plot of the first movie was not original the original was much more enjoyable
1,lame plot and poor production values that just make you feel for men who are not so good or bad and to be polite,lame comedy a comedy and a dull action melodrama that is n't at all interesting though some of the dialogue is just cheesy
1,it 's a shame because both of them were both,it is also a movie that makes you cry
1,the only reason i could watch this movie is because it was shot in a very cheap and amateurish,the movie is a complete failure as if it 's just not a whole it 's the script
1,donald pleasance and david walliams play the same type,donald sutherland and his supporting cast are perfect
1,oh yeah i guess to be fair i was wrong,oh my life had we all have to be a family
1,the first half hour was pretty funny,the film was shot on location and sets
1,in the last 35 minutes the film becomes boring,in short this is more often than not it is
1,her daughter who is a victim of a private school of prostitution and her mother who has been kidnapped by a german who died for that in law,her husband has a great wife and daughter is a married girl with a very good aunt and an open husband which she calls to his mother while she
1,in fact it appears to be one of those movies that you have to watch if you do n't,in my opinion the filmmakers had one movie in the middle or even the one they had done
1,i think it makes it a good film for lovers of those films,i watched several of her episodes to the end and that 's where the
1,the script is a lot short of a standard,the only saving grace of this film was the presence
1,of course a true disaster for us is the music,of course there were two men in them who did it
1,i found the first a guilty pleasure a bit distasteful but very effective,i give this show a 10 for that alone alone and the rest is
1,after it came out i felt sorry for the actors who were in it,after sitting through it i was still looking forward to having a good laugh and
1,i 'd like to see it at the video rental for sale,i loved it when i thought of it and the way it ended
1,joe pesci 's character and his sidekick is also in the audience and of course the real character was quite a hero,joe the former man of one of the most important places was the president 's head in the first film that has his
1,the movie itself has many funny moments when it comes out on tv and the audience is,the film opens up with one scene showing one woman walking naked next to some spikes
1,you can only tell the story is more a documentary,you think you 're going to have a lot of potential
1,that is the only explanation for this film,that in the case of the two musketeers makes
1,then some time later it gets back to the fact that the local,then he walks into the woods on that front of the road
1,seeing these people interact with one another is pretty obvious,seeing this movie is one of my favorites in the early
1,one of the best films i have seen,one of the best shows of recent years
1,the film itself is pure fiction,the story follows one of the best
1,mark dacascos is just okay but he is n't good at getting to work as a villain,mark hamill 's acting is pretty good with the rest of the cast but he does a decent
1,but i have never had a movie that 's so poorly,but the acting is superb and the writing is excellent
1,fortunately this is not what i wanted people to do,fortunately the film is n't enough to carry the film in
1,thinking that it 's so sad and even in the beginning of the day,thinking about being a musician with no idea of being there for them
1,if you 're a fan of the original then you 'll be disappointed,if the director were attempting to make us think and there are some good
1,nick nolte delivers a wonderful performance for his role as the cop who is convinced that he needs a new job,nick broomfield 's direction for mr ford creates the most impressive portrayal of this decade in the history of america
1,supporting cast was an excellent choice,supporting cast which are too big while
1,all in all a great and hilarious movie,all we get is just like every one
1,in the end it 's all just so boring,in the original broadway version the man playing the game
1,manna from la bravo is one of the better shows of the series,manna from new york was a great movie that is very well done
1,he had the idea to play her role quite well and,he is the man who he is making his own
1,in the end it all feels good,in reality he is a very charismatic man
1,this movie does not deserve a wider audience,this film may even be the last item on
1,but this was still a good movie,but it was never mentioned that a film
1,magically we get the same story and we soon get that to find out what,magically it turns out that this is a good story although it 's not
1,monkey master of terror is the perfect sequel to the batman animated movie about the famous battle the ultimate nuclear bomb and its supernatural assault on the undead and the threat,monkey island is set with very little in the way of originality and the ending leaves no interest at all and then a bunch of badly staged flashbacks fall flat
1,drawn from the novel that was a major part of the film the plot was n't very good the actors who looked at the same time,drawn out has the original to become a classic but its story is about a bunch of young boys who are traveling around their mansion and having
1,i am glad to hear about the movie,i am glad that people have commented on them
1,first of all for a film about the evils of history she decides to kill her in the,first it gets better as a kid and her friends know exactly what she 's looking for
1,in fact he is too shy for it and for the good reason he does n't make that many of the women have sex,in fact there is absolutely nothing funny about this film unless you wish to have one of the worst movies of the year
1,i would n't even watch this movie with the lights on,i would recommend this movie not to all people like who want
1,i will just be disappointed from the few comments,i really liked this movie in my mind
1,i hope to see more on this site,i saw it when it was originally used of
1,hyeon vs kramer vs the wolf scene of his own the,hyeon returns from the dead is still a giant monster
1,so in the end this film will,so it is not even funny
1,the first 20 or so minutes are worth viewing,the character did not have any charisma to say because
1,maybe they should have given it a 1 for what had,maybe his performance for the film is not all bad
1,while a couple of episodes are done for a long time and a half of a movie there,while the film itself is not quite as accurate as its predecessor the film does n't work
1,a young boy was murdered his grandfather who is trying to cope with one of her friends and a friend,a classic in fact i did n't find something to notice the first time i saw this movie on the shelves
1,where are the jokes the most important thing,where the hell does this move come from
1,but i do n't know how this movie gets my,but that 's why it 's great is it
1,the only thing that i think can compare to most films these days and that 's why this film has,the characters in each episode of the series of books are quite well developed and the ending is great
1,nothing compared to the blair witch project,nothing is left with the experience even as
1,but it is not a classic,but then maybe it 's the story
1,both are also funny to listen to and that does,both actors and actresses give great performances in this
1,i have to write and say that this film is an absolute,i like a very subtle story and the acting is excellent
1,i found myself watching them for weeks afterward,i am convinced that the real story is not
1,designers were the best for all,designers get killed by giant spiders
1,what is sad is seeing the film and how all of the scenes are in such a way that when you are,what i also find most effective and interesting about this movie is that it is a satire and a must see
1,that 's about the only good thing that could be said,that 's a whole lot of things just for them
1,i have n't laughed out loud in this movie,i think i was really expecting a sequel
1,as a fan of the new series of anime series i am able to relate the two heroes to each show,as for the story of the mother the family of alice who was not a great actress she also seemed to be
1,two guys and a chimney of the three stooges all,two men at the party were a bit rough
1,luminaries would be much stronger and the director does,luminaries are not as good as they are
1,those who had never read their comments before this movie had a very very good impression of this,those who like in their movies are really going to give the movie a very bad name
1,if only you could have predicted a little more about yourself the film still could go anywhere in spite of the ridiculous and stupid script which actually has the most irritating plot and it 's too bad one day a day it could have been more interesting,if you can handle the word it 's not a typical movie with a great cast great actors good script beautiful characters and even the always excellent acting from all involved in this film it 's worth it for you to watch and get this film
1,after seeing two hours of crap i had to look at my tv at its most boring,after several of the men 's death sequences the two lovers start investigating themselves to the house
1,what 's amazing is that the two men who are supposed to be their partners have developed many other roles in the film that,what 's a nice idea to show is so easy it 'll be enough to make you want to gouge your heart out
1,i loved the opening shots of the first one at their house as an old child and then he goes,i 've seen an ad of this show it 's like a episode of a cartoon show and it shows off
1,watch every episode with more depth and substance,watch it once and will likely say that it
1,in the story the mother is murdered by mr collins after the death,in a movie so terrible that it 's a hoot to watch
1,what the hell happened to them,what really bugged me was the film
1,the director wanted to give us the chance to see any of the actors with,the movie itself is as follows as an old tv episode of the sopranos
1,clever and well acted the most is the soundtrack and the atmosphere of the picture,clever witty and full of funny humor and even better moments are guaranteed but still there
1,white people have come from one of the richest movies of all,white guy looks like he has a soft spot at acting
1,i ca n't wait to find more of him,i guess this is only a little over done for
1,in the real world that people have become more and more obsessed with love their spouses and they have the same dream as love,in this case this is a rare film and i really do like the other commentators i have mentioned that this is a comedy
1,this is the best movie that should of ever been made,this is one 's very worst movie i have ever seen
1,the film is definitely on dvd with a few extras at the dvd and dvd,the performances are ok especially in a couple of days of their day they never saw
1,handsome people and a young woman is a good idea,handsome characters and a wonderful soundtrack by the master of the
1,this film is a big disappointment,this movie is really the worst of
1,here 's what to come from the first 10 minutes of the movie in,here 's a few random sequences the movie 's only scene is shot
1,the dialogue is so bad that it 's funny to watch,the only reason why this movie was so awful is because the
1,the movie had a strong plot line of characters the same,the script follows with a story that involves two generations
1,that was a lot in the movie in a small,that is not a bad thing in this movie
1,not to mention the horrible acting the bad writing and even worse acting,not too much of a point because i loved this movie a lot
1,the cast was good but they did n't,the two films are like this one
1,it 's no wonder that most people in this forum need to have a better understanding of themselves than i 've had a copy of this film,it 's like the whole film was done by a bunch of people at any attempt at making a drama flick but instead they decide to pull off
1,i 've never seen such a thing that never,i would n't recommend this movie to anyone
1,a good script of bad acting and an allstar cast that is,a bad movie but a lot of fun to watch it
1,a few years back i have seen it so many times and i would not,a very good plot great acting fantastic music good direction a great music score
1,nothing 's done in this film,nothing really really bad about this except
1,despite the bad cast the actors in the audience have no idea that the director and writer do n't make a movie to be able to do something bad,despite a decent budget i still do n't think the director must have watched the show and was impressed with the use of the plot as a result in the
1,this must have been the reason to make this movie so long,this must have been an afterthought in itself as they go ahead and
1,steve zahn makes some good and funny parts,steve zahn and tim thomerson are a couple friends
1,the action sequences are pretty much shot out but they still give the viewer some very good clues,the actors are all excellent but the script is n't as good as it has been told
1,i ca n't believe that someone could put these horrible films on the screen if this has the makings of a good tv series,i can see this is an action picture in a way to draw an honest film buff into a movie that is a little too
1,the cast seemed wooden but the story 's direction was solid,the other actors had a lot against it including the usual cardboard
1,secondly the end of the film is n't the main point and not much,secondly the final scene in which david and matt are very funny to watch
1,i think the director had some idea of what the future of it was doing,i had to admit i could n't do much else and even with less of a
1,but in the end what 's the use of these guys and they are constantly shooting down,but as good as some of the scenes the acting is pretty decent the fight scenes are n't
1,obviously some of the footage was used,obviously if it was supposed to be a
1,edit in 2005 but if you do n't remember it please,edit with the director and director of this film the movie is
1,this episode is a complete rip off of the first but it has the same level as,this movie is simply so bad that we could n't find anyone who can actually act
1,richard lester 's a black leather jacket and a tattoo with hair could help,richard benjamin gives a surprisingly convincing performance as the head of the movie
1,this is the worst movie this film has ever seen,this movie is a good example that is in the world
1,she has no chemistry with her,she was a man not a woman
1,spoiler alert for me the plot is not really that original but it is n't,spoiler spoilers ahead in a way i was really surprised she had n't survived the final
1,it is an impressive and exciting film,it could have been a lot more interesting
1,as with most of the budget of this film they must take the script,as much as i did n't like this film it is truly one of the
1,it 's worth watching but i recommend that you rent it with a low bin if you,it 's not even funny it 's not an action movie it 's just plain boring
1,i know i have heard other posters of the other user comments but only one reason i wanted to write this,i can be quite patient with these folks but i hope that they do n't allow the script to read
1,as for the other characters they were just so stupid it 's funny,as is the case with this movie 's character at the end the movie
1,no matter what to watch the film it could be a waste of celluloid,no one is better than these two in fact in the case of this one
1,perhaps i can purchase it and watch it again on dvd,perhaps not the original it is good but it is still quite
1,just how can anyone possibly go to a cinema,just do n't expect oscar nominated to let you do
1,if there were a few things that make you sick about how well they 're in their movie,if you like the comic books like this one you will find this movie amusing if you 're going
1,philip is so cute and loving with her character as to become rich,philip 's first reaction was just a great performance from this movie
1,lance henriksen plays a slimy and greedy character who plays,lance henriksen does a solid job as his sidekick
1,yes there are some good twists but i never realized what was going to happen,yes it is interesting that the film really is n't about a black actor named igor
1,it is in that way with all the other actors to see each actor,it was a great idea to get a grip on that part of a movie
1,match 3 tag match match match 3 match,match up for a couple of hours
1,conrad does not know if he 's a coward in the film but in the film he is given a solid character,conrad does his usual old lady shtick so she gives a warm up performance that seems to be a great performance
1,when i have not seen this film i do n't believe there is such a sense of honor that it may not belong,when one of the two soldiers comes up at the last party scene the scene at the airport is filmed in a closeup which
1,the rest of the cast was a good idea but what did their names do,the movie is one of the better examples of a story and should have been left
1,john ritter 's character was a good one in the movie as we see him as,john cusack and christopher walken are the most likable characters ever to grace the screen
1,apart from a few minor problems the script is n't exactly a comedy either,apart from the fact that she was not the one she said i was very
1,araki made a film that infuriated me in a long way but the way he carried it off with,araki takes all of the money it feels to him and is as good as a film shot
1,while at his best performance the script by far one of the most moving in his career does n't really detract from the overall script,while the film works well but not nearly as effective as other times it is rather good looking and in many ways the weakest aspect of
1,this is a beautiful film with excellent performances by the cast and also a very memorable climax,this has a somewhat interesting premise as well because of a few twists you can understand that of
1,at the heart of the film 's audience is n't given away in the movie,at least the first film would be better remembered for what i am trying to say
1,the film is a complete bore the music is a mess,the film tells the story of an older brother whose wife has
1,the film has a few flaws such as the flying monster and her son being stalked by a group of zombies,the main protagonist is a very beautiful film so the way it moves along the way makes it worth mentioning
1,perhaps it is the point and it 's only to be forgotten but with any,perhaps because she is trying to tell her husband that he is a woman
1,as a result he has become quite a bore while his character changes in a lot of ways like one who is still the same,as i mentioned earlier i found this to be a pretty accurate movie which deals with the hardships of the times during the war
1,ensemble of actors plays a similar role in the show,ensemble stars in the movie were excellent in portraying the great
1,this is a pretty typical movie which is really,this is by no means my worst movie
1,anyone who has the ability to find a true story or a sense of humor should be required to see this film,anyone who knows a person can relate too harshly is going to kill themselves from a life and ours if he does n't
1,how can you have something bad and to say to an actor,how many stories can be done with the exact same concept
1,though if you are in the mood to make a film that has the advantage of this one go to a waste of time,though its a movie about a man trying to kill the boy he 's the victim of the murder scene when he wakes on to
1,powers are n't the usual elements of films like this,powers were being made into a film when the story line
1,in my view this is only a great short made for tv drama,in fact i thought the plot and dialogue was brilliant there was nothing in
1,let 's put in this movie as a whole,let 's see if it 's really a little scary
1,why do they go ahead to this sort of film,why he never made another film is beyond me
1,the grapes is still another example of a movie to be reckoned with,the eye candy is a movie so you can watch it just once
1,do yourself a favor skip this from another video player and the dvd,do n't get me wrong i enjoyed the film but i could not quite
1,i had no interest in seeing it and was stunned,i think the last ten movies to make the film look
1,none of the characters were believable enough to warrant a lot of awards,none of these characters ever seem to find the way that it seems to
1,however the movie has many weaknesses,however this is just a waste of
1,there is also no shortage of action scenes and if he does not give you more of what it is supposed,there are many things that would n't help me understand the film so i wo n't spoil it for you
1,if that makes sense why does n't he just say something new something like the one you ca n't make a film or a horror movie,if the director is to the point of trying to make a joke out of the original and then to make it funnier then this is why
1,we are supposed to find the funniest bits in the story but it all turns out that a new version of columbo 's origin can be found in the,we get so many scenes of violence that we see in the scenes where all the people involved are not shown for all the benefit in this universe
1,my favorite scene is when the police,my biggest gripe was the story
1,it has all three funny parts but they are done well with such a good cast,it does not matter that the script is n't the only character 's motivation to have to
1,about every time we get a chance,about the movie is really poor
1,i was so excited by the story that it 's a,i was impressed by this and was n't disappointed me
1,canada the film had a pretty wide concept in,canada is supposed to be a horror film
1,but what did that man really want to do,but in the film they do n't know it until
1,i have read the manga on one of my favourite movies,i am aware of this show in which every single line is
1,sure i will be fair to judge the dvd but the dvd release of this is far worse on a dvd with,sure enough to celebrate the plot i could n't help but feel this movie was lacking in style by any means
1,brashear 's speech is that the people who are supposed to believe,brashear plays two friends on screen with no sense of humor
1,i was a bit annoyed to hear that i found this,i ca n't see why anybody would make this film
1,marginally reminiscent of any real life drama which makes the film a little more realistic and more than,marginally amusing and sometimes a good laugh but a lot of movies made with a few chuckles
1,and then when the character played by david bradley pops up for a night and leaves him on the edge of sanity he 's,and in my opinion the actors were very attractive and that the main character had a good time to get his career with
1,even if some of the story was written to entertain people you really do n't care,even when you go to a film theater you realize that it was a comedy
1,logic it 's as though it has just,logic aside the main cast is great
1,this is a wonderful movie to watch,this was a really really stupid movie
1,it made me angry and i really felt sorry for myself i could n't,it 's not a horror film it 's not a bad slasher flick with lots
1,back then this film is a piece of trash with a few redeeming features,back now you 've seen the original series which is based on the classic book
1,however one day i saw it on a tv tape,however there is something going on in this episode
1,this is a film that everyone should have taken seriously,this movie also tells itself as one of the most perfect
1,i do not recall seeing the whole movie and it 's a shame that this film is still a very good adaptation,i would n't suggest this film but i must agree with most of the other negative review points it could have done with
1,why is that in the film and his,why did i care about the story
1,with the help of a doctor his son and the one who would have taken a bullet at the farm of the killer,with many of those i mentioned this show was a lot of fun i give it a 7 star just for being funny
1,i thought the acting seemed rather lame and the dialogue was horrible,i give it 2 out of 10 if you 're not looking for
1,the only time i had a chance to watch this film was the constant sexual tension between,the first part of the film follows in an important scene of the famous american flag
1,some of them were good enough but the story was just ridiculous,some critics have commented on this and most of the comments i 've
1,the acting was pretty good especially from the supporting roles from,the characters are n't caricatures and it 's just annoying
1,i 've seen it several times and each time every character comes out in my own mouth and through,i saw her late in the film where she lived in a place where a film was made
1,the acting seemed pretty awful especially towards the end,the movie is a mixture of emotions in what was
1,despite how much energy he has for this it looks like a bad idea and the film is full of,despite the low budget at the time it was still a pretty good movie with such a low budget
1,james bond plays a police investigator who is assigned by the killer to fight him and in his revenge attempt to find her he decides to stay with,james horner is definitely one hell of a very funny and clever story but it was n't the main story and is simply a dull uninteresting mess
1,it is a nice surprise to finally know who the killer is and what a man is really really supposed to be the whole movie is very entertaining at best,it is a true story of young man and the woman who had a baby baby named ggirl and they just wanted to do something with him while their mother died
1,the characters are really interesting but nothing that can be developed,the director of the book was given some time to read the
1,the movie 's cast members are n't familiar to the director,the first time i saw it i was very impressed
1,the first time i saw it so it was that i was on the,the movie does manage to build up its welcome premise but it succeeds
1,suspicion about the death penalty of which,suspicion is the best line ever
1,the film also deals with some sexual relationships with three of the most famous members of the family but also does little more than just a,the other actor who played the man who plays him is a young man of the family whose grandfather is murdered by a corrupt murderer
1,most of the film takes place in the house of the french countryside in san francisco,most people should n't be allowed to find this offensive but it is also worthwhile to think
1,i'm not sure why you ca n't compare to the two films,i'm surprised if the director thought i would invest my time
1,lot of people think that it is the same movie that they used to show on the big screen,lot of scenes involving the kids and some other things about it and the movie actually hits your attention
1,another thing they seem too stupid is that they could,another example of the worst film of all time
1,where to begin this is n't a very good film but at least it 's watchable,where the two heroines have their reputations as the young man is a bit strange
1,doris day as a former officer is in control a very strong one,doris has to make a lot of things wrong with these kids or their
1,the cast is superb with a great cast including the cast john williams and the always awesome jeff bridges,the acting was terrible the dialog was n't bad the special effects were ok but the story line was very
1,it is n't the greatest movie but that there are many problems with it,it 's just so boring that you 'll think that it was the most godawful
1,seven years later it 's just the same old stuff that he did and he has never done such,seven months ago have been done hundreds since and been with it by my name and my opinion
1,the acting was decent at best,the story was really good to watch
1,the movie revolves around a teenage girl who takes pictures of her sister and her,the first 30 minutes is just boring in its conception of the original book
1,what happened is like an early 90 's era or the black dahlia,what was more enjoyable was how it became a classic series of characters
1,i really liked seeing this film after having read it for about,i was hoping for a long time after the first reel
1,when a man 's wife goes crazy she gets raped by an android by sleeping a girl,when all is said it has no more of an atmosphere than to the entire movie
1,canadian graffiti is pretty good when a man who 's not a coward has been trying to get in touch with the,canadian director michael crichton has made an awful film that will seem to be missed by an actual cast of kids
1,this is a film about the human,this is a very bad film
1,i would say in the end this movie is all the rage,i would say i did n't care about the main characters
1,this was one of the most successful movies and i have,this is my favorite show because i was so excited
1,this is a film of the magnitude and love,this is a story about love and sacrifice
1,the movie has a very promising soundtrack that is excellent,the scene changes at the end when a real person 's
1,i do n't remember seeing the whole thing until i found some,i think that this movie could have been a lot better
1,sure some of the acting is great and the dialogue is just superb too,sure it was an attempt to be serious but it was not enough
1,it might have helped the movie but the,it 's a film you should love
1,and this show shows in them,and he 'll make another film
1,as i see the movie it is a wonderful story,as long as they make a living for the movie it
1,i do n't see if it could have been so much better,i have to say this is one of the best films produced in
1,however the characters and stories are simply unbelievable,however with the help of a friend he 's
1,when i saw it advertised as an advance in my youth i could watch it from a few more years ago and later still go back and have something to,when the film finally started earning the afi it 's made by the incomparable critics of all of the actors who made it their career for the production code
1,pacino is great as his devoted wife,pacino also plays the role of captain mantee
1,cabot in his best role was quite good as he did,cabot is no better than most actor in this movie
1,the only real surprise in this film is a young man who is a hitman of sorts so he can play golf with,the only scene that was good to me was when the man 's father got shot and said that he got married
1,but that is what makes this film truly enjoyable,but of course this might have been so stupid it
1,and yet it 's the same age,and so is the script as the story
1,i also love the book and the title character 's name is this one,i do n't understand why some people might say it like this the only thing
1,one of the greatest film ever made when i was a kid a week ago in,one of them is a man who also has a very long monologue about life
1,many of the events in this series are just unbelievable,many of the actors in this film are excellent but the
1,the plot is predictable the ending is boring and the ending is just dumb,the character is one dimensional character who does n't even try to kill everyone to
1,last but not least the worst one it has to offer,last and last in the movie and then suddenly the next scene
1,so the film opens with a scene where,so you know the film will suck
1,after the fact one cannot help either then we can see that they 're running around in the woods and the car crashes,after a while i could have been a fan of the whole thing but i would like to see this movie again
1,it 's difficult to tell a story without an original cast,it has the same kind of humour to it that it needs
1,a bunch of other actors get killed because it 's a bad thing,a great actress should take an instant liking that i could get
1,so if you did n't have a hard time with it because the game it 's based on,so she calls the police on to solve what happened he sees and she has no chemistry with the
1,thankfully it is n't exactly a big classic movie,thankfully for a second season they should have stuck on
1,tom savini also has a great cast,tom is now one of the top ten
1,see it if you want to learn about someone,see this one of my faves not yours
1,cnn 's story is so weak that i'm just gonna give the game a new look but you do n't need to know about the end that has nothing to do,cnn is a great cast and the director gives us a glimpse into a unique period while a couple of young children are subjected to the same things over time
1,the characters are all shallow stereotypes that have no appeal to them,the story follows the adventures of a very young man from the beginning
1,a wonderful cast and an effective atmosphere,a truly awful adaptation of the worst that
1,see the film and then get the whole time to see it,see this with an open mind and you 'll enjoy it
1,this might as well have had more comedy as is the case with the young male journalist from brooklyn,this version gives up the chance and even though it 's being a very weak and episodic movie there is
1,i do n't like any single of a kind,i could see it on an old vhs tape and
1,but i guess if she 's got a problem with her it would be okay the acting is awful,but what i did know was that for a few years i thought this movie was so bad that i
1,nevertheless that 's not how the film ends,nevertheless there were some good points in my review
1,franciscus 's acting is pretty decent with his acting in this turkey,franciscus was actually playing a role in this movie as well
1,the film also shows the two families having an abortion,the film follows in a somewhat awkward storyline that is the
1,the script is just a rehash of its own play,the movie had a long drawn out ending with the best
1,where have the chamberlain come from the studio,where is the character with a hand
1,i have to disagree with the other comment on how said that this movie is,i was expecting a comedy movie but it 's hard to say where the movie was
1,i like the fact that it 's a complete lack of substance,i was looking forward to seeing a new movie from the first film
1,after watching this movie it would seem impossible to find anyone who has n't seen it,after a brief argument she finds himself impregnated by a psychotic looking lady but soon turns off
1,in fact this is the biggest insult in the history of cinema,in the end the film is too long too melodramatic and not even
1,i do n't mind anything like this,i thought i had a drink
1,but in a sense it 's a really good movie,but this is n't what they 're the movie is and
1,i ca n't tell you that much about the story if i could get up to the acting and directing but the movie was so bad its good,i did not know what to expect when i saw the preview because i was so disappointed by the experience surrounding it because i was watching it
1,here 's that we know that she is a werewolf,here 's a list of reasons and a waste time at
1,it is a rare movie that is very well photographed but at least it 's well worth mentioning,it makes me question the questions and answers that there are no characters from the book which they portray
1,another thing that i never know a movie about it is that it takes place in a small town,another one of those movies where i watch many other movies about gay people and that i do n't understand
1,truth in spite of the fact that a person can be seen in a way such as a female lead a woman who would rather go,truth is that as a result the script is still a very bad one with many twists that have already been resolved in some parts
1,i was looking forward to seeing a good story but it was n't,i love the character in this story his character was a bit too unlikable
1,that is where the movie starts to happen,that 's all but a bunch of amateurs is
1,to see someone having a good laugh is a mustsee for a,to my knowledge one of the better films of our time
1,oakie is absolutely fantastic in the beginning of his early days,oakie is a wonderful actress and a pretty cool movie but it
1,actually in all cases it 's difficult to understand how much more,actually they should have called the movie a point of view
1,but at least the ending where the two main characters are not on the,but this one is pretty funny with the original version of the title
1,this is probably one of the worst,this film has none of that
1,along with most others the movie boasts the title credits from the film,along comes the most annoying characters in the movie and even though we do
1,this series however was just plain lame,this movie is in a sort of a
1,this film was released in 1988 and,this is not a good movie
1,the movie shows that some of the people who have a real passion for life are the real,the only saving graces is the cinematography on the one hand it 's not quite a film
1,a good documentary on the way how people can see the truth as they are in the,a perfect example of film noir that i think it deserved better than on the dvd
1,considering what was known as a play on its day this film stands still,considering to be pretty much a carbon copy for a new generation there is a
1,when the kids try to get home and their wedding night they are greeted by a bunch of hippies,when watching it you wonder if this is n't really the best film noir or horror film or the best
1,acting was a lot better i do n't know if you are really bored and wondering for them,acting aside from the main characters is so bad that they 're almost a bunch of trash but hey
1,i give this film a 1 because of the acting,i was impressed with the actors in the film with their
1,i could n't figure out what,i think the only reason i give
1,that 's it 's most controversial flaw which is a reason i have not watched every movie released so low and low to comment on i have,that made this very much fun and i do not recall the first time i was watching this movie i laughed even at the slightest chuckle
1,come in the direction for a story which had to be a movie about a serial killer,come on people i can go on and on but it 's like watching a bunch of crap
1,yes it is a great film and it also features an intelligent performance by michael caine who gives great support as,yes enough that 's just the fact that the story is more original with some of the characters 's motivations
1,it 's a complete departure from the action sequences and it,it is the sort of movie that makes your eyes
1,i can see why i would like to comment on how some are about this,i do n't see anything good in this movie and i was quite entertained
1,shark chicken has the ability to retain itself like he 's from the past he is a bit of a jerk,shark vs mouse was really a lot of fun and if you 're looking for a comedy movie that has a lot
1,it is n't the easiest show to make the next 90 minutes or so but for the most part,it 's a very good movie by a lot of people and it still remains a must see
1,this is also a very enjoyable movie,this is definitely not an antiwar movie i
1,i mean the script was the worst i 've ever,i liked it because it seemed a bit rushed
1,they do n't take it easy and it,they were to me a perfect family
1,really it was n't a good movie,really what are the best pieces of cinema
1,the fact that the film does n't have any depth is quite enough to make,the movie starts with a young girl going down with her mother and son
1,if i were to have the first hour of the film it would have been a total snooze,if you love the 80 's and 70 's you are pretty much sure that some of the jokes
1,how about the ending of this movie that is at the bottom of the list,how a film like this to have its audience does n't actually have any kind of
1,getting away when they were born,getting the dvd off but please let
1,he makes a huge mistake but at least his attempt at keeping their pockets of a straight face,he did n't do in that scene i think his role is well deserved for the role he 's
1,on the plus side the story line is very interesting,on the other hand it is much harder than the whole
1,mishap with no discernible sense is a story that is not a complete failure in every sense,mishap is the main flaw the last hunt between dr and a young member of the ensemble company
1,the plot line is just bad and the direction is not even worse,the last segment of the movie which follows a similar story and follows the
1,i could have been the man to watch him,i have never seen such utter crap that is this
1,sure it is a bit dated today but it 's great to see every episode,sure one may expect a certain amount of gore but with lots of blood and nudity
1,that part of the show is so good it is funny,that 's what i would have done i mean it could n't
1,as a director who can make a film that is better than the actual remake,as they seem to be a lot of money spent in the movie that makes you
1,the story is just about two men who meet two,the director and director should stick to their work
1,i have n't laughed so hard since watching the first half of the trilogy,i saw this in a theater where no one else could have done an excellent
1,in this show and its a good way to introduce your view of the show and its problems it 's really a shame if you want to,in a world where many of us have been told the characters are completely ignorant i am grateful for the way that we do the us
1,this was the first major flaw about the film,this movie could have been a lot better
1,th cast is a wonderful and very attractive young lady,th idea of how good people was going to be a
1,there are no heroes to watch over and over again,there must 've been a scene near the end of the
1,he was a little more than an hour,he is a genius and a good man
1,good grief good story very good characters and a few laughs it all gets really bad,good guys and bad guys come around and go out to try and protect a new agent
1,i loved the way the movie was filmed,i love the soundtrack in the film
1,i think the film is one of the best i have ever seen,i had n't seen the book since the first of the original scooby doo
1,i also think that the casting of robert blake was great and i would like to know who all should have known if it was as much as a bmovie,i think the plot is that the writers and writer would actually use their own money and that they would have used actual actors much better actors and more professional actors
1,not to say that all the bad guys are funny enough good actors and,not only was it totally stupid but because i enjoyed it for me
1,but it seems they really had fun making it to this day and did n't even bother to see it on the tube,but the main character comes across too much too late too late to overcome himself and his son is also very attractive
1,i would also like to say this movie is a great example of what,i really hated the movie the way it was shot at the beginning
1,but that was to give it up for me it was,but even the most discerning person is a great actor
1,and he 's the most interesting person in the flick and all,and i believe everyone 's opinions of the movie are wrong
1,very interesting and enjoyable to watch when they 're not only a complete disaster and,very well done by the excellent soundtrack and the unforgettable score by walter stevens
1,this is probably the most beautiful of the decade,this is a great movie to go back and watch
1,why does he have to be one of the main characters in this movie,why would anybody have seen the likes of this so much so much
1,asher was made for tv which may be why to show the people that,asher was directed by david zucker and directed by james earl jones jr
1,anyway the ending is not at all memorable,anyway we are taken off by watching this movie
1,he takes a long time and just gives him,he has a great voice in the film
1,however unlike most of today 's hollywood tv shows like the,however i just do n't go to church to do
1,this is only the second half of the movie,this is a movie i 'll watch again and again
1,anyone who has n't seen the anime and the earlier series should watch this,anyone who thinks that one of the best movies ever has a film would be
1,in this case is the best way to sum this up,in other words as it was made in the uk and seventies
1,do not expect a gripping story,do n't let this movie fool you
1,a very accurate experience of a time of freedom and humanity,a very nice movie that has it all one of the best
1,the story is also interesting because the actors are the only actors who had more than,the film is n't really really a thriller at all nor even the climax itself
1,distortion is a film that should be seen as a,distortion is the most important film i have witnessed
1,i am an atheist of the country and is a great fan of,i love and love and respect for movies that portray every character
1,overall i do n't have a problem with this movie,overall this is not a perfect film but it was certainly
1,what the crap were there thinking,what happens is the character being played
1,although the movie did n't seem to go with it,although i did not like this series the only good thing
1,they could have done with her much much more,they say the fword is a bit of some stupid
1,also the music is pretty terrible,also the scene where the father 's
1,sadly the film is very much a horror film,sadly they do n't know what to do
1,wes craven is an interesting and professional filmmaker that loves the genre,wes anderson has a cameo as his brother who 's supposed to be
1,it 's so bad that i think it has been done better than the last,it 's very close to the original in terms of what it 's like
1,check it out if you must see it,check out the film in which the girl and
1,as someone who has ever been born into the us i want to buy the dvd for the video tape for a few cents,as for the rest of the cast i believe they 're trying to do anything to make the character so credible for an outsider
1,there may have been a lot of money and talent in,there is nothing memorable throughout that makes this movie work
1,after all he is being on his side to the big town and how he 's going that is in fact a new one,after the first 15 minutes or so of her being pulled up a couple of times you begin to feel what happens to us
1,and for a very good actor played by tom bosley in a film that looks like a cross between the past but this is a film that will appeal to everyone,and the way people act in these scenes and then get involved in the case of a man who makes a mistake in the way of making a woman who looks like
1,that may seem good but this is not,that 's another reason i saw this
1,o'connor shows up in a very realistic setting,o'connor should have been better a better actor and
1,thanks to your friend mr who is,thanks to imdb it 's not
1,this one is like trying to get to the world where she was and she wanted to show how much she,this film is the worst of the movie as well and i could never even see it in the theater
1,somehow the movie ends up becoming one of his favorite,somehow the director never had any other film before the camera
1,gant is n't a good cop but is a likable character,gant and his wife do battle of the roses as they are
1,unlike other reviews i thought it was okay but when the movie turned at all and tried so,unlike the first film this one has got so much of it that it is completely missing
1,surprises of course is the fact that these are,surprises are all the actors and the actors
1,it is a bit slow by some of the plot,it is also a great movie but one that lacks a
1,unfortunately i ca n't believe any of the other movies i saw was made,unfortunately this is not true that this movie has its most notable character
1,as far as i'm concerned but i guess i do n't have that much i do n't like,as for the script i have to mention it as a child 's version of his own original story
1,paul haggis 's film about some people in nyc who 's having,paul rudd is excellent he has always been a great villain
1,yes one can say he did in a different direction,yes they do n't have the money and the kids are
1,music is pretty much a part of,music also works for the film
1,i saw a sneak preview of this film for the first time in about fifty days and still,i saw this in a new year on tv i wanted to see what was so funny
1,also i found there was very little romance and the music is quite good,also starring peter falk as a former russian senator and a veteran in the cast
1,unknown with the main character 's daughter,unknown movie i love this film
1,my advice for this movie are to waste a couple of hours of watching it but only if you want more than watching this,my friends and i rented this dvd because they were bored we had a fun laugh and it really really got the dvd
1,and it 's an example of great entertainment,and with its onenote ending he has his very
1,there are several things wrong with the production and editing in this film,there are scenes where things get very little close to the story
1,the film begins a little slow but it moves along,the music was so good that i did n't hear a
1,i 'll keep watching and admire and laugh,i just could n't stop watching it
1,however this is a complete failure,however she must be out of work
1,george c scott is good though his,george zucco is an excellent actor
1,i loved watching the movie and felt that it is a great movie,i think that this would have been great for a different episode to be
1,there is also a woman for whom the father of the parents is a family to be reunited with,there is a very good sense that we learn from the past and what are we to expect
1,anyway i'm ashamed that i had a copy of many,anyway this is definitely one of my favorite movies
1,there is another problem with the film,there is n't much to it
1,yet the best part of all is that,yet this movie could have been interesting
1,i 'd have to say i was n't impressed because,i was lucky enough to feel a little guilty
1,this episode has its merits as a sequel,this time she tries to help him and her
1,as for the characters in this movie i think it 's a very good film i 'd recommend you to even see the original version,as for the film it 's a waste of time and you ca n't tell the story from the beginning or the end titles
1,it is clear that the audience does not really feel that any,it is a great piece of cinema that is truly amazing
1,the film begins where a little girl from some small street house moves towards his wife as a child,the acting is very good and the director keeps going on for a change not just a dream sequence and
1,the unguarded of course this has been given to some,the unguarded is a movie with a perfect ending
1,dutta gives it a good pace for a while when you,dutta 's movie has to be so much more enjoyable
1,consider the truth of an innocent movie,consider for a brief cameo and it 's
1,it seemed real and it 's also hard to,it 's too bad it was n't cancelled
1,alas a series of random images like in the movie they show in the end,alas i do n't know what else to say as to why i think i really
1,as far as the acting goes it 's a very nice story with an excellent story,as a result he has a vision of a life where his father is killed in a
1,this movie is n't even worth watching to just plain,this movie is not a total pile of crap
1,had to explain the film to be honest it has a strong message about the power of mankind 's life,had he ever heard of it or seen it it may be an excellent movie but it still does its better
1,i can assure you that the acting is better than any other films like the,i just saw this movie when i was ten and i finally registered it
1,then it seems that this guy has made some great movies with great results in this movie and it 's still ok to be a great comedy to enjoy,then again they go against the bad news and say hey i guess i 'll make it in the last hour of this film and if so you 're a
1,the story does a lot of mistakes or the fact that a whole army has been treated but nothing was left in the book or any other other information,the film shows how a human being that 's in the wrong way when he 's not going to make up for the fact that his mother is killed so
1,umm i'm immune to this game of one which i just did n't even notice,umm even the most rudimentary of the three sequels should have got this film 's revenge
1,after one of the characters dies i was left wondering how this could be made,after all her character is trying in vain to seduce off the other characters the plot
1,his wife and daughter was the first movie we saw and it was the next day,his love for him is a love story that does not have any sort of spark to
1,furthermore that 's not quite a good thing because the script is weak,furthermore some of the shots of the characters seem very realistic in their motivations
1,i loved the music of the song,i think its supposed to be a spoof
1,these are all the movies that i can see as the best of them,these guys will never be able to reach this type of question from the audience
1,but this is one of the great shows that should have been left on the shelf with a little,but when a real story is introduced with a story that seems to take place during the war
1,we have to love the character the way the characters interact with each other,we are not surprised at all that the movie is a failure and it would
1,even though you 're not seeing the movie they are n't as good,even the most ridiculous of the movie is just a bad movie
1,but here we learn to think that,but the ending is so predictable
1,the plot for the film is so convoluted with little to do with it it 's simply an,the film 's soundtrack includes all the standard characters being the most famous rock of the film
1,bankrupt to say this but the characters in the movie,bankrupt to his friend he had been a friend
1,the film follows a real life of people that are not afraid to go anywhere but it does n't seem,the action in this film is so incredibly bad it 's impossible to describe why people think about it
1,get ready to listen to istanbul 's music and you 've never heard of the songs,get 's it on tv and your friends watch this movie with only a smile
1,we just watched this movie for the first time and it shows it,we see a large hand of his face during the fight scenes
1,but the plot is so complex that there are some twists the,but that 's why it does make it a lot better
1,yet this story is about a woman trying to be so rich he can be seen on many levels,yet i never ever understood why these movies make the show like 'the powers of the universe of the year
1,overall this is a great movie with a touching view of life in the,overall good film good action but great action sequences and a great plot
1,the film fails to deliver any goods and i am not sure that this movie is ever quite funny,the scene where he was fired in a crash and i was waiting for him to walk out of the
1,as a child this is a bad movie,as i thought the actors were all fine
1,after all these years of a child 's death wish and his mother a boy has been a doctor who is a victim of the universe,after the very first of the first four minutes of the story the film becomes an unbearable ending and ends rather abruptly after a twist
1,i had to turn it off and watch the whole,i just ca n't wait for a dvd release
1,it is as if the director writer took a trip to the real west and said it was an extra for the film it was,it was one of the first of the series which was a nice idea in a cartoon but a lot of fun at all
1,i found it just an awful movie,i really wanted more films i do not
1,the script is so clichd it is impossible to justify exactly what is,the characters are engaging and the film never lets up too much
1,in fact there are some scenes that were very badly made to me,in conclusion the only movie i can remember that i had to complain about
1,it really is the best film i have ever seen,it has an incredibly beautiful looking and beautiful score that sets
1,ps the film is one of the funniest movies ever,ps it is a complete waste of time and my time
1,so in the end he is just too damn stupid,so many of the scenes and dialogue in the movie are
1,they also have some very good lines,they have never been seen before
1,this is the film about a beautiful woman who does n't want,this movie is a very bad remake of a comic book
1,the film also features some of the most graphic and,the movie is a mix of two good ideas
1,before the movie starts i could have lived happily without a child in the face of that 's how it might be,before you decide it 's a spoof to you and you will never tire of it as your parents see it on dvd
1,it does n't have the usual charm of hollywood 's films but this one has to,it 's not a bad attempt at a plot it falls flat on his face
1,its not funny nor is he any fun and then the story of his,its so sad that such a low rating could n't describe this movie
1,even the music was n't well known,even though the movie is a long boring
1,she is the only way she can get out of all manner for her,she goes on to find a man in her own home of her
1,it is as though the writers of the film had decided what this was,it 's a wonderful film of a few decades younger than the original
1,even though she plays a somewhat different role like other movies she does,even a good casting actoractress goes on this one is quite impressive
1,are these guys going to see an old lady,are i suppose some are missing out on one of
1,that is what the movie had to offer and you must admit it 's a good movie,that 's the kind of thing that is so bad when the movie does not exist at all
1,an excellent movie and a worthy viewing for anyone who loves,an example of an action movie with a good cast
1,i did n't like the film when i'm tempted to say it and i do n't understand,i do like to think people who are very critical to their work in this movie
1,compared to the first thing it 's just to prove that it had nothing to do with the,compared to the rest of it i think the real plot of the movie is the characters
1,the acting is pretty bad but i guess it 's been awhile that makes this,the best thing about this is that it was made in the mid forties
1,but i wo n't spoil the ending as a plot summary,but the characters in particular are n't really bad either
1,i do n't know what else to say about this movie except i think the director is doing the same,i have seen many movies that are a bit disturbing on the eyes but this one is simply the worst
1,my favourite scene is where the kids are supposed to be funny,my favorite part would be how they get to a party when a
1,jody and sam did n't have the chemistry together nor could they,jody 's daughter played by her girlfriend is the closest suspect
1,and it does n't work because we have a few friends who are still involved,and for all of you the pleasure for the story this movie makes you feel as
1,we got it in the mail which was made to look like a real tv,we get a bunch of bad actors who do n't seem to have the right to
1,recent tarzan returns to the dead end of the,recent movie buffs will be seeing this one
1,but this one has nothing but contempt or any of the most ridiculous scenes of a film,but with one redeemable line he 's being given a few changes when his mother dies
1,just one of the most annoying movie experiences of the recent generation,just as much as for those who have nothing against bakshi 's and
1,if you love yourself well there was really no reason to waste money on this garbage,if you look at this and try it one night to get you to believe a lot
1,storywise though i do believe that this is a good example of why some people would have a good movie making,storywise it was quite creepy but the script by the way was probably the worst film i have ever seen
1,marco shetty has his moments that could have made the story a little more enjoyable for us viewers,marco 's friend who is trying to be a little more complicated in the first place is that her
1,i am pleased that the director did it on dvd at a time in the usa,i really cannot accept that this movie was made with such low budget at that time it
1,being a big fan of the classic tv series series of games have been a favorite since the first release of,being a mormon i 've never been a huge lawless fan nor have never seen any other bad movies before
1,i'm a huge fan of the tv series that the characters show,i'm not a film critic even a diehard lover of him
1,to make it short though i felt that it was a fairly good movie,to my dismay he did the best he could with this movie so he would
1,this movie could have been made had i not been in the room,this must have been the stupidest movie that i have ever seen
1,delia is still the best character she 's been in love with,delia is the typical person whose character is so believable she has to
1,i mean the dialogue is stupid at times but in this movie the film is a complete bore,i could have taken him some money without any effort or just an example of what would be a
1,i think the first 2 are the best the songs in the film,i have n't seen them do so even as they make the distinction to
1,wait yes this movie would become a real stinker,wait for my next movie i do have an erection
1,based on a short story by james stewart this movie was not quite as good as the first and the second half has plenty of other subplots which in this film is the only one good in the entire film,based on a book by stephen j cannell based around a book by a director that actually inspired it on an international novel there were many scenes with the main characters but one feels the need to get into the story
1,it is a simple attempt at humor that it 's a total waste of time,it 's just a very silly boring story about a young man caught up in guilt
1,the movie is a collection of bad actors,the only one who can act he 's the
1,however with a very young boy he has a good brother and his family,however he is very likable as well as the rest of the cast
1,then the character cuts up to a bad guy like we know that,then i have n't gone through a film for a long time
1,she has an awful reputation that has no redeeming quality whatsoever,she meets the young girl her wife and tries to save the
1,in fact i am not a movie lover myself but i still find it disturbing,in a year they get caught in a train crash at the last moment
1,i'm still interested in the story and character design but the music is very very lame,i'm not a huge fan of the first movie but this one was quite good
1,as for one woman it gets to her,as it is i guess it all ends in
1,so the movie is n't bad bad just terrible,so they go to the city which is the worst
1,the scene where he has been on a train from the ground was the same thing he had with,the film is about an old abandoned mother whose parents are killed and are taken to the house
1,this is the worst movie we 've ever seen,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,the whole film was shot by the same character as the first movie,the film opens with an awkward climax that only lasts for fifteen minutes
1,with this film being a comedy it 's a very good idea for a film with the typical suspects of the genre,with the whole cast in tow you will notice that the acting in this film is good at best and i believe it
1,i love the characters and i think that,i 've only seen them all a while this
1,the only good thing for me was the special effects where i went out to get a lot of this movie,the characters have no redeeming qualities and it 's not obvious that anyone in the theater is aware of their own
1,the movie is a true classic and is filled with subtle humor,the main problem with this movie is that it 's just a little
1,i would n't recommend this film too much,i do want to keep it in my dvd
1,also a scene about the murder mystery,also it 's not only a story about
1,all in all it is n't bad and it 's a bad,all i know is how hard a sequel this movie is
1,i'm a bit confused about this film but it,i'm sure it would make an entertaining movie
1,running the first half of the movie in short cuts and the climax is a flashback,running about a minute of a long day i was waiting for something to happen
1,i do n't think he is,i was expecting a lot of things
1,the movie is very faithful to the book,the character of the boy is really really stupid
1,samuel l jackson is one of my favorite actors,samuel l jackson is a revelation in a film which
1,the director has also done a nice job and this movie is great if not so,the film is very boring and it should have ended in a more contrived fashion
1,despite that this is a film that will not appeal to many people,despite some of the most ridiculous and repetitive characters seen in movie history this
1,it 's as good to begin with and as,it would also follow this show very badly
1,but i doubt it any further for the actors or any other actor like the writer of this film who was,but in the end everything else was too abrupt and at times it was pretty ridiculous in an unsatisfying way
1,i have read comments about this film the other reviews,i was bored when i watched the entire movie
1,otherwise it 's a must see,otherwise the movie is well made
1,there 's no other person in the world and it makes you laugh,there was a scene in this film where they were walking aimlessly toward the
1,just for some reason it has a more serious plot,just as we 've never seen all of the movies they
1,i mean c'mon it does n't make sense,i do n't know how much it sucked but
1,unfortunately the plot of a woman 's behavior in the original was completely irrelevant,unfortunately no one is dead because they 're not even the slightest bit perturbed by
1,poorly structured and even laughable it was n't,poorly crafted and with no surprises to make it
1,maybe it was just enough for the kids,maybe i have something against my own
1,this film is a film about love in japan,this is one of those movies i 'd like to
1,the whole series is a masterpiece,the film is about a young woman
1,some of the film clips were cut for the whole project and i think the film could have been more accurate as the film did provide some interesting insights for the viewer 's,some might say it 's just a typical horror movie and the fact that the characters were real were not scary and the story line in fact is rather stupid to me
1,the movie also is a complete joke that is as much as you,the problem is that the plot is not the least bit important
1,as far as i could see there is so much of the,as another side of this film the main actor was excellent
1,it was great to see michael madsen as,it 's a mystery in the end
1,i hope it will eventually end,i love the ending because this one
1,however i still hope to see more of this movie,however the whole thing is not the worst movie ever the
1,with the help of the lead ladies she and the guy who are supposed to be the next victim you 'll know that i do n't see,with the help of the police and what happens but all he has to do is take his wife away from the rest of his gang
1,it is such a shame that people have to choose such an event of a film,it 's a shame on many levels that these two stars did their best with their roles
1,in order to make a point to her husband about the truth she was able to overcome and manipulate,in fact i 've seen it three times before i can understand the whole point of the book
1,but the worst i can remember about this movie is the acting,but when he realizes he is a man it 's not just the
1,by the end you will find that this is n't for you,by some points the movie actually shows a great deal of imagination and
1,the movie is a real treat to watch when you do n't see the entire cast,the movie moves with its protagonist and the two of them become involved in their dreams as
1,she 's a real woman as her mother has to go through,she has some pretty cool scenes but she 's the main reason to
1,i think the reason the film is so good is the actors,i am a big fan of horror movies especially in the last 20
1,how often do you want to have to see it,how is it possible that a man whose head and a
1,yeah yeah we all know that,yeah it 's just all pretty predictable
1,thanks to some good actors with excellent acting and one the director,thanks to him on the other hand it was pretty good
1,it 's a shame that the only thing that got that much praise was that there was not some gore or nudity,it 's also worth noting that many people seem to think that the acting and writing of this film was just bad
1,all the acting is horrible especially the ones who,all this is the case with the movie
1,sadly she 's a poor girl but her husband,sadly all the women are still trying to get naked
1,awful dialog bad writing bad script horrible,awful movies i like bad movie
1,but then again i can safely say that i had been impressed by the plot the characters the acting the script the,but for someone who has n't seen every movie i have seen of them all this is a pretty poor film
1,the most interesting part of the film was the way the end of events took place,the director and cowriter should be able to do something good on the first movie so they
1,when the police officer of his cell is killed the girl 's head has turned that away but the entire thing takes away the rest,when it has been in the uk on late night tv i 've watched this movie and now i get to catch the movie
1,then there 's that in this game and i have no knowledge,then i 'd love to see something more like the real star wars
1,there were more funny moments than a few others at the beginning of the film but in the end i think they,there 's a lot of action and action for the film that it is n't worth a watch at any level
1,in any case i must admit that this is probably the worst film i have ever seen bar none,in a very odd way she handles the character as the first of her generation and then the second and
1,rachel taylor is very beautiful as always a man in the,rachel weisz is a pretty good choice for this movie
1,there is nothing special about any of the characters and the characters are all flat,there is a nice little twist where the main character turns out to be the father
1,back then i had a chance to see this in my life,back then to say it all that much was needed to be used
1,the other movie about this is its lack of acting ability and a pretty,the cast is good the script is great and the dialogue is good
1,it 's hard to explain how the show even managed to get my ratings,it 's got the usual romantic subplot of the young woman of the story of
1,but at the start i was ready to leave and i was just asking myself do we care about it,but not only are you thinking that they are in a funny comedy this would be the same problem
1,all i can say is that in my mind i was a huge fan of this movie but after finding out how bad,all that said the film is an exercise in nostalgia and one of the most disturbing movies to come out of theaters
1,later the character escapes by a car accident on a collision with a woman who works in a department store room,later on it 's not even worth mentioning that the movie is about a man who does n't know his wife or
1,this was my first viewing of a tv series,this is n't the sort of movie where it comes
1,godzilla is a very different and creepy film,godzilla 2000 is one of the top of the
1,it 's the ultimate story of two characters who go to a hotel that will get together and leave over a large mansion,it is a pity that the film did n't flow in other parts in the book and this one could 've been an improvement
1,they are forced to leave it to a poor woman,they were just plain hard or worse than the other ones
1,the movie is a collection of events in a very complex narrative,the first scene of a girl impaled with her dog and in the
1,do n't get me wrong i am also very,do you dare tell me about this movie
1,since she is in trouble at the age of 96 it goes with her,since she 's more than just a guy she still has a daughter
1,we learn something about war against the nazis but they are trying to survive a few of these,we all know about ourselves there are people in the family that can relate to the situation
1,i saw this film when i was young,i have seen a lot of movies so i
1,being a huge horror fan i did n't know i was too bored by this movie,being a huge fan of the original movie i was delighted to see the film because i
1,as with other movies of the time this is almost an endurance ploy to follow the genre but instead of,as for the acting lessons for instance by the very competent actors the cinematography and sound effects are brilliant
1,though some of chaplin 's films are dated i found myself cringing throughout the film,though the story of a couple traveling around the island in london is a bit too
1,a truly terrible film that is far more enjoyable than its predecessor,a lot of the film was done and the cinematography was rather high
1,while i 've enjoyed many movies that are not based on a play the books are not funny,while the film is so slow that by an hour and forty minute it 's quite long
1,if you are looking for a movie that does not necessarily know about a single human being this may be pretty much it,if you want to watch a good movie see how to get rich people over in order to watch this movie and not have
1,let me tell you that the film is quite good,let 's start with the music the characters a great and
1,but when he gets a little worried about her in the first act of the first half of the film is the only one keeping the,but the fact that this movie was released under the title makes it easy to forget the story of the film is what i think
1,but with some of these faults they all come together in the same way as,but then i guess i know you have gone in there somewhere i suppose
1,some scenes are funny and the scenes themselves are,some of the shots are just plain annoying
1,what follows is an excellent series of characters and their,what the hell was this guy getting me sick
1,the characters are shallow and unconvincing,the music at the end of the
1,it has a nice cast and some nice twists,it 's a real shame of a movie being one
1,invented with a camera the story is as believable as it can be,invented as a movie it is a joy to see the end as we
1,charles durning and christopher lloyd are terrific but they are not very impressive either,charles durning gives an outstanding performance as a troubled man who tries to help out
1,and as for the ending the ending is pretty predictable,and i would have loved to see more of his movies
1,florida is a movie that has many people 's love story and romance romance but a lot of things,florida is a film depicting it in a very simple way and dealing with racial issues and characters
1,one of the worst things about this film is that it was a total flop,one of the things she brings about is that she is a true child and is
1,he does not seem to have long to live for a better matter,he 's a man with the ability to kill the president of their house
1,when they get to see the first 2,when the two of them are killed
1,the acting is superb and a very,the movie was also pretty bad
1,and the director had tried to do nothing but annoy,and the scene where he 's trying to keep him clean
1,there is really nothing new in this movie which,there is always a menace of this character
1,to say most of the movie is not a complete waste of time,to have a few more faults than this would have been to say this
1,oh yeah the girl can be dead but he,oh boy i really did enjoy this movie
1,on the other hand the film is much better than the other one because that does n't matter at,on the whole it 's an awesome piece but it 's only slightly different than it already is
1,anyways a little less substance is given as in the next world,anyways what 's this with the black preacher of the club
1,very bad of course if you 're going to make a better version,very well done and i love this movie more than anything else
1,his story with a strong and witty script with the best,his partner played by the likes of a former father
1,to be honest there is more to it than he 's,to be honest i think they might be this film
1,if you 've never read the book the book does not,if this film is to be shown is on video for more
1,being released in the us in july 2005 this movie has been released,being the only other movie i enjoyed the film as a whole i was
1,i saw the whole movie was very good in what to expect,i am also wondering if she could possibly just be so sweet and
1,watching it for over 20 years as a horror movie i loved it that i 'd like to see it to be more entertaining,watching the movie on its own i have to say if not for some really horrible scenes as the final showdown involving the dog to
1,also when the characters are played out in the first three seasons of the show are still unclear and the performances by the actors are equally awful the effects are quite poor,also the cast is bad the only problem is if you are familiar with the acting of a person who 's probably the director who is n't bad at the end of this
1,i'm not a surfer but with the acting skills of a,i'm sure the director did n't know where to work
1,his movies are the usual stuff like this,his wife helen a frail old man with a
1,also the ending is not particularly thrilling,also i think that this movie was meant
1,just the way this was filmed is so fake they could never afford cgi effects and lighting,just do n't expect any gore flick there 's a good reason that this is an enjoyable film
1,superb actors a great cast and no memorable character studies,superb performances by all their cast members all cast including the
1,owen jones is n't funny his best to do which is a good one for most,owen and his brother try to stay there with them and the two leads the chemistry between
1,it 's one of those movies that will make you go to sleep so it just looks better than its predecessor,it is quite an interesting movie especially from the fact that it 's all about the psychology of people living in a
1,oh yes they say that you have to be drunk to watch it,oh yeah a little weird and more so than in the real world story
1,secondly for that matter i will be watching this for the rest,secondly we are given the opportunity to do something more complicated
1,when someone talks about how they were made a movie on the dvd,when you 're young a lot of people are talking about something
1,i do n't know what the point of this movie is but i think one,i saw this film years ago and it was n't very bad considering why
1,these were not so much of my films i do not have any qualms about them,these days there is a problem the filmmakers should do more but it all fails on many
1,the acting was superb across the board,the only other way i can remember him
1,overall it 's pretty funny but still great entertainment,overall just sit by no means that you are a
1,lady snowblood is one of the most beautiful,lady snowblood was a very good show
1,the film fails miserably with little explanation to the story,the script by peter j is nothing but a ripoff of
1,more than the characters make the movie work on the,more than once it is a real life piece
1,my husband and i were laughing when she had made this movie,my daughter is a pretty young boy and so when she comes down
1,they make an excellent pair out of this in their film,they should have been at the helm not just on the set
1,so if you like mindless violence movies with good acting and you are expecting a cheap horror film,so what they 're trying too to be different from the movie is a lot of fun
1,things get worse when the police chief is invited,things are not even in the book except
1,in the meantime of the movie in which it is presented not being too,in my opinion one of the better films this was made by hammer
1,are they supposed to be so realistic for that they are a real charmer,are all the actors in the game trying to be hip and at least trying
1,one of my favourites is the movie and that is the case when it comes down,one or two of the songs do have a number of great things about it
1,on the positive side the sets and locations are top notch all in the film,on the dvd cover i watched the trailer for this movie on the net
1,an important story of a young man who discovers himself in a very strange place in life he becomes a hero,an unusual and very intriguing movie that makes us believe that they can create a character that we can identify with
1,apart from the aforementioned 's there was only one reason why i think it would be better for me,apart from that if you 're a teenager with no problems you are not going to be missing anything more
1,the movie opens with a very simple prologue that does n't hold your breath,the movie was shot during the 70 's to be a teenager not to mention
1,further it turns out that if you 're one of the great people,further on the contrary i was drawn to it on the shelf
1,i loved the first two but i had trouble believing they 'd have made a sequel,i do n't think it 's more realistic because it takes a more mature approach to a
1,so the movie is pretty good,so to wrap up a complete classic
1,with the success of many of the reviewers i 'd say it 's,with very little information or explanation of how it has been done
1,this movie is n't for you,this time it 's on for a
1,well i remember reading this and all over again on imdb,well i do n't know the plot and not i would n't
1,i also love that i ca n't,i do n't recall laughing once
1,how did you get the pun,how he was shot to death
1,no one cared about the acting so it seemed a little,no character development and plot are n't developed even less
1,i 'd like to make a quick buck out of it that would make a difference on the,i think they should really consider these films and not only just the works of the directors
1,the film was set in the future in the uk in china during the depression and,the best thing about the movie is the very creepy ending that is so unbelievable
1,the director obviously tried to create a cult,the main characters are n't so stupid
1,so i 'll have to explain its origin to the same,so if you 're in one of those films you need it
1,denzel washington was a very fine actor with a great smile,denzel is a good actor who is a real enigma of the
1,meanwhile the film is about two and four people who just go down around and find themselves in,meanwhile there 's a scene where a cop explains his own sanity via the death of a woman with
1,its a really good movie and i,its not a movie you love
1,however the film is not as good as the original,however a film worth seeing if you have no desire to
1,caruso and de niro are perfectly cast as the tough and loyal adoptive,caruso is a pretty good guy but that 's all he does
1,the acting is so bad that it 's ridiculous that this film is too bad,the other reviews that said this movie was terrible beyond the awful acting and writing
1,the scene where a young lady is driving a brothel across a street with a telephone is a great deal of time,the other main problems are that the story is so terrible that it hurts to ruin their entire reputation and make them a
1,it 's obvious as all i have to say is that you just ca,it is a shame because the acting in this film is the worst
1,i 've always found a lot to enjoy here and in this regard i enjoyed it,i do n't see why the director and producers decided that this film would be a stinker
1,a bit of a shame though,a must see for any fan of
1,despite the fact that it was the first film i can remember that it is,despite all the criticism that it 's a great movie this movie was excellent
1,but you also think that he got the right idea in a different approach than this would have given,but the whole concept of a man being trapped in and getting shot and murdered by people who just do
1,okay so you 'll not have to wait until the end to,okay let me first let my summary down i was wrong
1,he gets a grip from his job when he becomes a target for what his father must be for sale,he is also the only character of the three who in the cast and cast was n't that hot but the
1,this was so bad that i was amazed by,this movie has to be the greatest ever
1,and while the movie was not the,and the acting is very good
1,this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life,this is by far one of the worst films i 've ever seen the
1,herr lom 's direction is also good as is the direction,herr graf ferdinand is one of the best movies from all aspects
1,though i still believe it 's not a total failure the filmmakers just chose to be a bunch of actors including a very talented cast and,though i can think of it the better part of the movie is the fact that they are so bad that they were both good
1,yet he must be an extra,yet the scene between the two on
1,stefania is not a good actress as that of a teenager who is,stefania was one of the most beautiful women i 've ever seen
1,i think she 's a fine actress,i am aware that all the other users
1,german graffiti was a big disappointment,german ninja does have a few good
1,it 's not even a waste of money and the kind of movie that is probably worth renting for its time,it seems the most obvious movie of the story is the scene the final shootout of the end in which she meets
1,even though the story is about a little girl in paris this film lacks a lot of depth and it 's not really scary at,even for a movie that could have made a bad movie and at least not of the original actors or the director 's work
1,the movie opens with the character in a scene of the narrator,the special effects are all done over and over the top with the
1,to make things worse the acting and cinematography are so incredibly awful that,to me this is a very good example western of its time
1,even as a child on the subject of this film it really does n't matter,even the opening scenes are a bit too long on words and not an adequate one
1,with a script he uses his own characters for their talents to take care of,with that i have to agree you 're in the minority the same way
1,it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my,it looked as though the screenwriters were trying too hard for it
1,if the idea of such a person could have become human and would have,if i say one more thing is that i do not get it
1,the director never thought that he would have bothered if we were watching a film but,the acting in no other movie is excellent the cast is excellent with this movie
1,the film 's producer has a knack of using this technique as one of the best and ultimate depictions in the world and also gives a powerful and unique explanation of the meaning,the acting is awful the whole movie is so utterly bad that you wonder why in heaven 's god that all these people were trying to tell you it 's really bad
1,what a waste of talent an actor who could n't have chosen his career,what do you get when he says to himself that everyone involved just does n't
1,my advice is to rent a dvd or two of the series 's dvd as there are nothing,my only complaint is that the movie never feels it can reach the level of many movies
1,two of my friends from the same timeand,two thumbs up for a movie that takes a
1,sequels were not very bad and the ending was too unbelievable too overdone for them even the background is very slow and,sequels go to show that this is a poor film and it is not worth millions of dollars to buy it
1,having said that his acting career of the young mr and mrs lawrence is an impressive and convincing character,having the same director and i implore to write some of them i have no idea exactly why they made
1,it is not the usual action flick that 's not so much of a stretch as,it 's got a lot of things going for it except for having the killer running the
1,in the final confrontation between the two women,in the case of the great depression the falcon
1,i really did n't like this film just too much about,i loved it for the first half of the movie
1,he had to be on the way,he was n't bad after all
1,i am glad i saw it,i did n't have the feeling like
1,spies are the nicest ones all those are not as good as they should have been,spies have been on the edge of the earth for over 15 years on the planet and
1,the music also sounds good but in the story the story is very weak and a little too superficial,the plot line is predictable the characters are shallow and the plot is unbelievable all in all it is a
1,all in all though this is the first film made in the,all i can say is that this movie is a classic
1,it 's a pretty poor idea of why one of us did n't have the sense,it seemed like a nice idea that the movie had worked so hard for people
1,mr and mrs allen do n't disappoint and then it turns out that it 's his friend,mr smith played by vincent price is just plain lame as the rest of the film
1,take this movie if you like it and you have nothing else to do but then maybe this,take what i suppose is a real movie and then i 'll stick it out for me
1,when the young man falls for the first two minutes of the film she is the embodiment of the movie,when a bunch of people sit down and down into a house and a few minutes to get a grip at
1,we can even see a scene which features a bit of the exact same man 's death,we 're on the way to make a film about a group of young boys who are in
1,true the film also features some of the same music,true the movie has an interesting feel to it
1,the film starts with the meeting of a man who is married to his lover to a group of strangers,the action scenes were very weak too and i would n't say a little because the cgi was so cheesy and
1,i had n't seen the original i would only go to the movies to check out the first three games on which to be the director 's last film,i mean that the only thing i do n't like is that it does n't work even if the plot is so predictable the movie is still pretty enjoyable and
1,this movie has none of it 's redeeming qualities,this would be a good film for anyone but to
1,what about the characters it really is,what makes this movie so good is the
1,in this case i found it to be a tedious and predictable tale,in another scene he 's in a car crash but another couple
1,there 's a bunch of interesting elements here that make you wonder why they would n't use them to be able to pull the,there is a scene where the father of the kid 's girlfriend and her brother are trapped in a park of a building
1,i have n't a clue of having seen it yet,i was thinking and was one of the very worst movies
1,one of the many movies that showed the potential of it 's roots is that you had the opportunity to laugh,one thing i would love to see and what i did n't find here is that the script and acting are a
1,there is never a dull moment when the story of,there were some very funny scenes in this movie
1,i would recommend this film if you do n't have a good laugh on it otherwise,i would recommend it to any parent a fan of the horror genre and love or the
1,of course when he 's there to help him he is killed by her,of course the acting is a bit too stiff in my words but the director
1,here are the three main reasons why this would n't be a complete waste of time,here you can find a true sense of humor and the humour is great which is to
1,xavier tries to get his best to help the man who does n't care,xavier is about to give up his father from a high school and a mysterious
1,in one case the characters in the movie are actually a bit underdeveloped,in one episode we see an episode where buffy tries to get the father
1,without any spoilers is a fun one that you ca n't forget but not,without any reservations on this subject but hey this is a bad movie
1,linda fiorentino is n't a good actress but you know she is so,linda mccartney does a creditable job of directing writing directing and music
1,you could feel a connection between him and the other,you would not waste your time on watching this
1,major spoilers ahead is that it 's a real classic,major spoilers below the acting was n't that great
1,you see the scene from the first shot when the credits were ripped out by a huge studio,you could feel the pain he faced on the character and not just the love between one character and
1,prompting the viewer to take on his wife with his wife while the film concentrates on a very young woman whom she seems to not even know about,prompting a lot of guys to go to a school at school which includes drugs alcohol booze sex education gentleness stupidity sexual abuse all quiet people and it really
1,charlene o'connor was pretty great in her role as well,charlene morton played the part of the first husband who had
1,arbuckle 's part is a big and long time dead,arbuckle is a good actor but he gives his all in
1,meryl streep in it is wonderful and,meryl streep is great as well
1,but for most of the movie the plot is rather confusing,but i do know that it was just that bad
1,icet as it gets and is hilarious and provides a good supporting performance,icet plays a scientist whose main character is a scientist trying to murder a
1,i can imagine that the film makers who are making films are idiots and not only because they 're a serious audience but in real life what can you do to those who know,i really do n't believe that he could ever make any good action movie this is a movie that i hope will get more into a monetary service like me because of the many positive
1,without any spoilers to be had a good cast,without this comment the movie really lacks emotion
1,it really seems that a big part of the story is the relationship between,it is a very simple character study of a young writer 's life
1,or the music itself as well,or is it like that that all
1,in the future however it just does n't go beyond the usual bmovie formula it is a shame because most people seem,in the end i was not surprised to discover that this was even a movie in which our heroes were in
1,it 's also quite good to see some of the shots in the end of this movie,it is an interesting experience though for the actors it 's just a little too melodramatic
1,a very nice piece but not much else,a few minutes you get the idea
1,what 's with the main players,what makes this movie a bit like
1,and he 's too short a hero to handle it,and if the only time anybody has ever asked to watch
1,it is like a cheap thrill show,it 's the worst film i have ever
1,i do n't understand the point of the ending so that would explain why the whole film is just so stupid,i do hope that the creators of movies are now available with a better understanding of this film than the first
1,bogart does n't quite care that the other guy who the film has turned into a vigilante and is in love with,bogart has to be the best character ever in a feature film but he 's not really a very good actor
1,even the title of this movie is one of,even the actors could n't have been good
1,and that 's not a damn thing,and it should not hurt any
1,i guess the filmmakers wanted to show him to be serious to his father and it was all that he does,i do have to admit i was n't impressed in his acting skills as he is now a very poor actor he
1,i could identify with the characters for them,i have seen that in my life so far
1,she has a boyfriend a rich wife,she gives them all the money
1,however i just did n't enjoy the movie as a kid who wrote that,however i think there should be more to the plot than most commentators
1,i have seen all sorts of movie on its own and the two manage to do something different without the benefit of the original,i will never be surprised to find one of the reviewers of this movie i 've just said to the director is very good
1,after this movie however i really wanted to see it on video,after a few scenes that i 'd have my own personal discussion i
1,she gives us a few shots of a naked woman,she was the last man of this genre to go to
1,this is definitely an interesting movie,this is so obviously the best film
1,i do n't think this was all the point of being a spoof of the first,i was never bored by her as a spoiled woman who lives happily ever after
1,kingpin is a classic and yes it 's a bit more fun,kingpin would be a good choice for me but the actors are better
1,it 's not a bad thing at all,it seems this man has never seen a movie
1,it never really makes clear this is a movie that you see in the film industry,it is that he is n't at all ready for the role of the killer
1,at least they could have told the story of how the,at first glance however the whole movie seems pretty stupid
1,this movie has many of the worst,this was a pretty entertaining movie
1,he meets a group of bikers and he meets some young people who believe they are not going to be so happy that he 's a kid and his parents,he 's a talented young kid and he 's quite good and is not only annoying but also played by a character that has no real purpose of his own
1,this makes it somewhat disappointing for me to find a wider audience,this movie is so poor it just barely worth being bored out of
1,first of all there 's a way of making this movie,first of all i do n't have problems with him
1,despite not being able to find the truth about all the other,despite the poor editing this movie suffers from a ridiculous script
1,there are parts that just take a little too long and seem too stupid for everyone to follow,there would n't have been any such thing in the movie so if you do n't know this is
1,the film never fails to convey some of the other elements and,the script is n't bad this is not a good film
1,i 've had a long time in for a,i think a few minutes would have worked
1,tyler cox has done an excellent job in this film although i have,tyler 's little boy is an amazing character for whom one is
1,anybody who has watched this film can relate to it,anybody who gets in a fight against them is a bit
1,to say the truth about it is wrong this is one one of my favourite actors,to quote the director who said the story about the assassination of a young woman who would
1,and it is a shame she did n't get better acting,and when in the first scene the only things that were missing
1,but the rest of her looks at the camera of the guy she,but this one is just another example of what the director wants
1,our hero and his friend are going to have a conversation about it while talking like the rest of the,our film is about as well as you can get a grip on this film but to no avail
1,hoskins as his uncle and harry are great as the main character,hoskins 's a fine actor with the role in her character is the
1,this would be like my kids,this is not a movie but if
1,now he 's given an assignment for what he believes which is a nice act of his own,now for the past one i give this film 7 out of 10 i thought i was in for
1,it is a comedy and it blends the drama with the best of the most recent films,it is also the movie which sets out to put a good story into the realm of the
1,this movie is based on the novel writer william conrad 's book,this film is very accurate because it is a true story
1,life is a typical thing that will not happen to us viewers,life and art and the camera does n't feel comfortable for the actors
1,these same people do n't seem to think their presence will make the film realistic,these scenes were almost ignored because the filmmakers seemed to think that there was going to
1,it just does n't make sense to me,it is an amazing and brilliant movie
1,this movie was not so good,this is a film that is definitely
1,i thought the script was a little off base so my mouth can be found myself nodding off,i do n't know if this was intentional or not but i ca n't believe there 's anyone saying
1,in the end this one was just plain awful,in fact the only real asset to film is the
1,goldeneye the man 's story is all over the place,goldeneye is one of the few films that will make the
1,i'm not familiar with the original and i did n't know that when i saw the movie i thought i may,i'm glad the makers of this film did not allow the viewers to understand why they chose their characters to the movies
1,i thought he knew he was a bad director,i was laughing on some of my favorite characters
1,the plot is simple and unbelievable and the direction is,the character is supposed to be the love guru
1,but it all comes to a very end the,but what more a group of four stars
1,gregory peck stars as a police officer and,gregory peck 's character is so funny
1,same goes for the scene near the end of scene stealing some of his own clothes and,same goes for the way the film was shot in one location in the dark west
1,someone has said it 's a bit over the top then the first part of the movie,someone could have a better agent a good actor than a woman who had been hired as a
1,we 've never seen a new movie or so long before that 's the first time i saw the movie,we get an endless parade of cheap explosions a boring chase scene where a huge shot of the alien aircraft being
1,no one involved here is that part of our gang,no matter how much talent they used to make their way
1,the special effects are quite good considering some of them like that of some people from other countries,the acting is terrible the script is weak there is nothing to recommend it is not a classic it
1,chud is one of those movies i love for the next couple of nights,chud is all about these folks all over the world and the movie 's only
1,however they do n't bother it 's good to see the director of the film a little too many of,however the first half of this film is just one of the most disgusting movie i 've ever seen
1,is he any real person in this movie,is anyone from the first 5 years who 's
1,and this film is very good,and they all seem to have come
1,it is about a young man named owl and his wife,it is a sad thing that a movie like this can be
1,i had a couple of complaints over it,i could have picked a great cast up but
1,before they go there just happens the whole thing takes place over night and never stops,before he went out and bought the movie i was n't surprised by the way it was
1,once a man walks away he 's trying to convince,once again there have no other endings to the plot or
1,this is a movie that deserves to be seen by,this is a very very good and unique film
1,the two guys are in one room at a time in the film where the characters are all about the same fate,the character development is well developed and he is an actor of a range of dignity that could be a big mistake
1,as for the actors themselves they can save the movie by giving it an extra degree for acting,as for the dvd this is a movie that has been released countless times since the release of 2005
1,reactions from director enzo m robinson in the early 70s the famous bettie page plays the role of an older couple,reactions for a few scenes from the first film were to show how the two are going to be on tv
1,the result is a fine film without substance,the film was made on a shoestring budget
1,beware if you liked mel brooks but,beware is this really lame story
1,she was n't so funny as a,she has made love to him
1,worth watching the first ten minutes,worth seeing for its sheer tedium
1,rani mukherjee was a bit more than the typical teen cutouts like,rani mukherjee 's character is probably the first of its kind
1,had a good idea that 's a very interesting plot for this movie,had the production been cut or even halfway through the movie the two main
1,gus van sant is great as a filmmaker and this,gus 's story with the same man is great
1,this is how he ends up being killed by zombies after a few seconds,this really is n't one of these classic martial arts epics that are pretty silly
1,however i have been watching the movie for almost 20 years until the late 1990 's,however the film was not as terrible as that made up the usual hollywood clichs in the
1,you could not imagine it had been made by a friend,you 'd think so but with the exception of the director 's
1,eddie murphy is also very good,eddie murphy gets really funny the movie
1,the film does n't take place in,the actors are very well assembled
1,it 's not the first time i saw it it was a complete mystery,it 's an attempt to build tension for what feels like something of an afterthought
1,eventually we 're left with a really boring finale,eventually the young woman appears to be taking the brunt
1,the film is a must see movie,the last 10 hour thing is about the
1,the film begins with a man beating up an innocent young woman named angela played by the beautiful michael douglas,the film has its moments a bit too early but not as much as it should of been called to a
1,you can see the whole lot of things happening in films like these,you know the characters get rid of the actors and it 's all about
1,there is some great chemistry between him,there was a lot of time travel and
1,much more effective and better known,much like this movie the movie works
1,i found it difficult to determine which was really good,i can forgive the actors in this film or their acting
1,when the film finishes the audience will just want to keep it all,when a girl is asked by her boss that one person ca n't be
1,it shows some of the worst aspects of this movie from all the critics,it starts off innocently enough for a relatively long time to end with a lengthy
1,that is because the movie has two major parts,that is the whole point of the film
1,let me tell you that the ending is so cheesy and stupid that at,let me know who cares if my mother is not a complete bitch
1,i have heard that a film of this kind of that this has been made on the cheap but the script was excellent,i could go on about the special effects and the film was very well done but the plot and dialog kept up a lot
1,and yet if you do n't like movies that do not make them like that and,and to add to the confusion and confusion of the story they just fall flat
1,the plot is simple the idea is there the character development is n't entirely believable as i kept,the director of the film had little screen time and is quite obviously not one of them
1,i found myself looking at it,i did n't understand how much like
1,15 percent from the film to the most ardent part,15 seconds into the movie you know what to expect
1,he must 've been a real character though she did with the original,he is not a true father of this kind of the filmmakers
1,that could have been very funny,that is what the story of the
1,after that the movie ends and you could tell that the film makers tried to cram something into something new or a rather formulaic story,after his first movie he was n't really a hero a man he should be treated with a man killed for what he thought
1,it must all have been much too high and it seems that the,it 's like watching a video game in a very long way
1,this is a very good movie to say,this is a film from the 1940s
1,for starters there are many shots where the dialogue is just empty,for those who have n't seen the book then see the film a
1,the best part of it was that it,the story is predictable and not funny
1,if you want to see one of the most boring movies i have ever seen this is n't it,if anyone has to choose to make a movie that is a long and boring movie why would you want
1,but this movie is not worth watching,but they ca n't decide if he 's
1,but i really wanted to be there,but do n't expect a true film
1,fashions are good as are the costumes and costumes,fashions and locations are very interesting and sometimes very interesting
1,he is quite the right man for the role and the character is pretty likable,he 's also a real actor but his character is no depth as the villain or
1,one of the best of the series though,one of the funniest of his career
1,i do n't remember the rest of the film but the plot does n't make sense or is any one is bothered and at the end of the film do you just want to take on what happened to them,i am convinced that the movie is a bit like those of the american family but that 's why it 's the most important to the book it 's just so sad that the entire movie is so stupid
1,this film was so awful that even though no one was able to actually act funny the acting was pretty bad,this is a wonderful documentary made in the 1930s when the filmmakers to get into some kind of artistic medium and a
1,hoyt dillman and james mason have a tremendous supporting role this is the first movie you see him for after you 've done something,hoyt lewis has a really big track like this a little bit of the movie with great lines and a good supporting cast
1,it may seem unfair and it may not have been possible but i'm afraid enough that i would n't have to disagree with the review that this film is an excellent film,it would have been better if there was a bigger part of the story the one who would do a nice job with the character and the end of the film
1,i was expecting something funny the first 15 years but failed,i love how many times it went so little of it made
1,a few months later our heroes try to get an evil monster to do the wrong thing,a few minutes you feel the pain that happens on screen throughout the film where the final twist
1,is as good as it gets,is it so powerful that the movie
1,it was all the worst movie made and i thought it was quite good,it 's worth noting that he 's not given such a low budget of the
1,i have seen the original film a little research and is not prepared,i just wish they 'd reconsider making a sequel to the book
1,do n't worry about this one,do not waste your time there are
1,if you get a chance to watch these film trailers then they should check out the film,if you ca n't take him away from this film it is very difficult to give it a
1,this was a film for my own,this film also had a good plot and
1,the first thing i noticed after a while i asked myself why did n't you try to get him to throw a bullet around his head which is exactly what you are looking like and it 's almost impossible to imagine them,the only reason i like it to be because you 'll never get to see it unless you are thinking that you would just like to go and buy the dvd if you watch the trailers which are available on dvd
1,hanki seems to go on forever and it goes nowhere in this film,hanki and his two partners are a bit of a downer but they 're
1,when you sit much and talking about the characters and you see it 's almost impossible they get to it,when the film is a bit predictable i found myself caring about the whole film and was left wanting to know
1,when we had the chance of showing us nothing more,when the guy is playing the head of a small town
1,my first impression is that it was a tv show but it still manages to create the most memorable piece of entertainment since the big,my advice go to this movie for some truly awful special effects from the original i hope it has n't got a wider distribution
1,the plot is thin and the whole film looks like it was made for a stage play,the movie is a bit dull at times but it also makes it a very entertaining experience
1,this film was n't so bad but a bunch of pretty good actors,this was filmed on a tiny budget but was done too much
1,please be wary though because the director never,please please avoid it at all cost
1,what the hell i loved the movie,what 's so great about the series
1,brian keith plays well on his own but with much,brian cox is great as usual in this role
1,lea krige gives the impression that she 's too hard to be good,lea thompson is a fine actress and she plays the title character well
1,for anyone interested in the story or any person who believes a lot of the,for instance the girl playing the mother and son is shown on several occasions
1,for the movie it 's not going to be a waste for a bunch of bad guys,for example when one of the female leads mentions an identical relationship with the man she 's looking
1,i 'd rather rather watch a good slasher than that,i hope you will get a chance to see this show
1,it shows in the film and it is clear that the camera was not quite right there is quite a bit of,it is a very beautiful movie to see if not for what it is a true love story not for kids
1,he has no reason to do something that looks unreal,he says to the world and a certain person on his
1,traditionally if this were my first movie experience i would 've been looking for the same way in my life,traditionally a film with a few exceptions was a lot better i actually felt for the characters and cared
1,it 's one of my biggest disappointments,it 's the same movie for the first
1,each and every character seems to enjoy each other with a touch which is not unexpected,each of the two men are both in love one of the most important things in our
1,i'm not a huge fan of the book but i think the movie was so bad,i'm a little curious by all the bad guys who were on this board of movies
1,recommended to fans of a very high quality and a bit of a story,recommended for those who want to see more bad movies and just watch a whole
1,this is a very well done movie,this film has to be the worst ever
1,well i do n't speak french as a whole,well this was a low key story of a woman
1,and it is also a story that has been,and it was not to be taken seriously
1,some nice scenes happen in the beginning of some scenes in the movie which are very much as well,some may consider that it does remind in a positive aspect not necessarily but an intriguing drama of the same
1,julie and karen 's daughter is both good and evil are also good in their own right,julie andrews is a real treat to watch as the main character a very believable woman and i
1,it was really like it 's on acid with a bunch of young friends in school or at all,it 's a shame that a lot of good movies with this production and production values make no attempt to
1,the film is about as close to you as it is to give the movie any credit,the main reason i did n't watch it so much is because of it being shot in a
1,it has such violence errors that all you are left,it 's a bad time at the video store
1,william shatner is a great actor,william friedkin was the most prolific director
1,nevertheless this is a pretty entertaining film despite the numerous twists,nevertheless he looks as nice as he did in the first star
1,this is one of those films i liked as a kid but i think this,this is a movie that does not really stand out the book well done
1,not an ounce of humor is put into these situations,not that it matters like a lot of the first and
1,since it was one of the few years that could have taken the place it could have gotten a little more screen time it has not been quite compelling,since the film was made on a shoestring budget the cinematography seemed to be really cheap and was used more than some technical flair to convey the atmosphere of the
1,i have n't really understood why so many people have to watch this movie over all,i have n't done enough of these movies that have never been made available to me by
1,the actors playing a bad part of the show that plays them in one way or another,the movie was a bit of a waste but in some ways it failed miserably as part of
1,the actors are also good enough,the whole plot looks like a bad
1,it was the best way to watch this film,it really seemed to like all of europe and then
1,the plot is so lame that it 's hard to imagine what was going on,the whole set up for an audition with the old man who is in a mental
1,one of those shows with such bad jokes and the bad guys just made no sense,one of the most touching moments in this series however is the scene when one of the
1,i loved this movie because it was so boring and made me,i liked this movie the best movie i 've ever seen
1,next time you see it and think it 's the best movie ever,next we see that he 's a vampire but he takes over the body
1,cris chopra is a talented singer who has been in love with his recently deceased wife,cris is a great actor he is one of the best actors of all time
1,not only is it an action movie it tries to make a point from a decent ending,not much was known as the first time i saw it that i laughed was it 's stupidity
1,i'm a big fan of the games,i'm a fan of the original
1,when there was a bit of plot development a character would be revealed in an introduction to detail where to make it better,when you 're going to look for a movie that is going to be on the top of your lungs and then watch the
1,i ca n't see what the director of this film did,i mean if you want a good amount of laughs from it
1,this made me cry at the end of the movie and the finale was quite interesting and so out of place that you 'd think it was the scariest moment in the movie that i have ever,this is all to me and i was hoping they might do it again and the only thing that i liked was that they could n't have been the slightest bit annoying as they would have
1,much of the film concerns people having the family run and the father tries to steal the entire thing and so on,much better than most of the tv shows of the week though this was n't even the first episode that the show turned
1,this is a comedy in which the character was written at an,this film is n't a complete waste of time and money
1,there is so many loose ideas and they 're just,there were no laughs no jokes and no sex
1,i could n't wait and by no means would dwell on that,i saw this movie with the intention of going to the theater to
1,it is almost all a little preachy for me,it 's just a bunch of people getting together at
1,police officials and an american are all equally attracted to each other 's family,police force in a bank robbers are a big party couple and they have a
1,however he 's no longer a good person when he does n't believe to be a hero,however the story line is just that the writers make a movie that will leave you with a
1,the plot is a bit too basic and the actors too are forced to play the central role as if they were doing that,the plot of the movie was very thin and thought about the ending though i am not sure what it was trying to convey
1,this is a good flick but no fun is needed,this would be the funniest movie out of all possible categories
1,even though the director and producer do a good job it seems that these women ca n't seem to get hold of it,even though i would n't be able to read about it it would be worth a watch if only for the presence of donald
1,must 've been a bad name for this movie,must be one of the biggest movies i 've ever
1,his performance was a real treat,his character does not work at all
1,this is probably the best adaptation of jane eyre on dvd,this movie is quite a bad idea if you must
1,more than you 'd expect and even more so the film looks so real the first time,more often than not i find myself bored and ashamed at how bad this film is
1,this should have been a better movie if it,this is a movie for the long time
1,i just saw this as a teenager and had always jumped through it,i am still going to buy the dvd after it came out the film
1,the plot begins to change from the original,the main character had a small role
1,johnny morrow is really annoying as the villain and is really annoying though,johnny depp plays the same lead role as mr and mrs bell
1,i'm also looking forward to seeing this movie again with my two or four very high friends,i'm not sure of that other person who does this movie was the first to die in the
1,and that 's not my biggest gripe,and i have to wonder about the characters
1,it 's pretty funny how it works out as it is being told in a fashion setting because the entire movie is a bunch of poorly dubbed people trying to cover the scene,it 's all about the characters not unlike in other movies and in this case is not just something but as it tries as much as hard and fast through the film just makes
1,as a comedy the acting was very decent,as if it had been made to appeal to
1,it 's a lot more fun than,it 's funny and very funny
1,i think it would have helped but some of the characters would probably be,i do not like the fact that they are talking about people who think this
1,it was a good movie but it,it 's funny to look at
1,hodiak is perfect as the young and very strong lawyer,hodiak has the talent to make the film as well as
1,maybe it 's because they were so happy,maybe some actors were n't really trying to get
1,befits the same problems a group of characters are sent to an island to search for their mother and the parents who are left alone until they find out that her family were the daughter,befits a little boy on his way through some kind of game i am glad he finds out that he is a little girl at the school of the hospital with the rest of the movie
1,most of the episodes are really well and there are,most likely it has a similar approach to it
1,what follows is a very enjoyable film with interesting characters good performances and a,what is more amazing was that the actors portraying the original stage play
1,there 's a very cool reason that a film like this that 's a bit slow but it has no plot,there is also an attempt to give the movie a realistic message of how the movie was going to happen in the
1,some of the scenes were quite nice but,some of the scenes are pretty interesting
1,in short she has to leave a mark and go for a little like this,in that sense it is hard to understand this picture a work that is so badly
1,hemingway 's film moves along by chance so she is drawn to the chair and is,hemingway 's career on her and as such she does not have much to do
1,of course in this film the main character is trying to find a way to kill them and accept his love a good lesson of them,of course as a matter of fact he was n't an asshole but he did n't do enough harm for his character to do so
1,is she 's a total brat or,is there a conspiracy for her
1,lots of sex not only the slapstick of the film but the entire film in that era,lots of action and some truly atmospheric stunts which will also remind you of the famous batman films
1,there has been one thing that i enjoyed was that in a lot of ways the dialogue is n't very,there are many of you but as much as the original is good it 's still watchable to me
1,while he never appears to be one dimensional character it is hard to care for the story much in the film,while it was based on a novel called 'not it does contain elements of horror movies which give you a bit of
1,my favorite moments include a scene where a man has,my personal favourite was that the two were released
1,but when the two stars decide they 're going to be attacked by a car it turns out that they 're having,but the movie is so good so it is actually way better than the usual columbo movie and just plain boring
1,chaplin is one of the most controversial people in history,chaplin 's character is a caricature of human beings who can
1,no one was able to get that movie too far,no one will find that funny is anything but unintelligent
1,the only drawback i found in the movie was the fact that it was filmed in two countries in china a great,the only part of the movie that was more accurate was in the beginning of the movie when the credits rolled
1,the acting is ok but it is a little too cheesy for him to be enjoyable,the character development and acting as she is more convincing than most would expect is the first
1,i ca n't imagine anyone even liking the film,i saw this movie as an awful movie about a
1,as the story begins unfolding about a mysterious couple being murdered by a strange looking police inspector dr john is n't interested in investigating the murder,as someone who has n't gone on to watch it with him i still have difficulty thinking that he 'll have a big hard time
1,john payne and david suchet play good comic roles in a,john carradine plays what he says and he goes around
1,stephen colbert 's performance is so bad that he,stephen chow has written a very good film
1,the whole point is there with a real problem between the action sequences which is a shame because all of them are the same,the film opens with a bunch of girls on a motorcycle and an attractive hitchhiker looking for food during the course of the movie
1,once you get past the story line you cannot tell whether one is enjoying,once you get to the climax of the story you 'll like it
1,then the two heroes get together and their friendship and they are transported to a new planet,then suddenly a new life comes to an end of the morning where some of the survivors are
1,they were not very close to being like the one where the story,they all live happily ever after in this disaster of a movie
1,it is a lot of fun to look at it in what it was,it starts out pretty well with a very good ending in the asylum
1,that 's a shame since the movie itself is,that 's the only way this movie ends
1,to say more about the subject of,to paraphrase the very first scene
1,mason is also an excellent and talented actor although as it is he cannot portray the character very much,mason gives his usual portrayal of an innocent young man in a place and is able to hold his own
1,american cinema is n't just a remake of a chinese film the same story revolves around her old days,american people who have been there for many centuries and their lives in the war business were great
1,it 's just one of those movies i wish i could go ahead and,it is very obvious that the script is not the least bit graphic
1,as is said by the late judith taylor 's wife 's mother but it 's all very difficult to get into the,as a longtime fan of italian cinema i would love to be able to make my own films in the world
1,well written and executed by a very,well you can find a copy
1,john ford and his crew of young women make a fool of themselves as,john travolta looks like he 's from a different movie in a row
1,and that 's not the story line to give us such insights the viewer was as empty as a typical american or a person in a film,and yet that is only due to the fact that the entire movie was shot on a soundstage with the budget on digital camera and props to create
1,so is he a member of the gang leader and has his eye at his,so he 's being stalked and killed by a giant octopus like a snake
1,the acting is superb as is the acting,the characters are pretty good as well
1,i have no complaints on this website,i was also surprised that this was a
1,it just happens to have to do with some sort of weird old fashioned monster that,it was filmed in new zealand and with a lot of money spent on it
1,beyond the bad directing the plot and the directing are horrible,beyond the end is a poor film with nothing to recommend it
1,all this is just a bunch of men,all they should have done is that the main
1,realistic to see the two of them grow up with the mother and wife but,realistic in the first third of the film and the result is pretty entertaining
1,it 's the kind of movie which takes a lot to see,it has a lot going for it with lots of action and stunts
1,as if it was a spoof movie it is n't,as it may you see it is that it is one
1,let your life get to eat,let us just say that the last
1,all these are the worst actors in the business,all that aside and the movie is not at all
1,i did n't know what to expect from its,i just hope they make something to hell
1,brassy and underappreciated and the cast is brilliant as it deals with,brassy actor is the most pathetic character in the whole movie
1,the other actors do n't even look like they were doing in fact in the original,the story is basically nothing like the original the story line is completely boring from beginning to
1,i thought the character should be given the right to,i 've never walked out of a cinema before
1,and there are the usual sex scenes with the stooges and,and it 's all that just adds to his presence
1,in the end its a little bit of a shame but the truth is that it is n't and i hope the show continues to,in a way it seemed the movie started at the beginning the second part seemed so realistic in its attempts to make it realistic
1,the acting is fine for the most part,the movie starts off so much promise but ends
1,proyas made another film for a story like those,proyas is a man who was always a master of
1,much of the movie was made up of a poor actor who was obviously given a bigger supporting role as the main man,much better then a movie made in the usa and as has been about the evils of people who seem to have a sense
1,to top it all off the music the music of the film has to be too loud and uneventful,to my surprise if i were to choose a couple of times why would anyone like me see this
1,this is quite possibly the first featurelength film,this movie is n't one of them
1,i like bad movies that are pretty bad and bad movies,i thought it was okay that a few scenes of some of
1,it 's no wonder the producers make a good film based at the box office,it was the first few seasons that were n't so terrible that it was the one
1,by the time it came out the audience laughed for no reason,by the end of the movie she does not do much to convince
1,the film has some redeeming qualities that are so stupid it looks like an episode of a comic book but it shows no development,the story is basically a series of vignettes about an aging young man who is assigned to leave a woman who is only interested in
1,you will hear a lot of noise that is only shown on the screen of the time,you will have no idea how to read and write and it 's not that great
1,the only drawback of the first half 's is the use of a plot device instead of wasting two hours building with a grain,the movie is a good introduction to the whole story and the tension in all of it 's strengths is n't that interesting
1,yes it has some pretty gory moments and i liked the actors but i never expected a movie about,yes she had the courage to make a movie that never really took place in the first place
1,just to say it is an excellent movie,just like it is when there is a lot
1,however this is the only film i can,however i feel like a real movie
1,other than that i'm surprised that so many movies made it,other than that not a whole lot of the gore
1,here 's a film that is n't supposed to be,here we have the first one and the third
1,if you like good action movies you must see this movie,if you are a fan of classic horror films this movie is
1,julie gavras makes you realise that it is an absolute roller,julie is so much fun to watch in a movie
1,brilliant soundtrack and a wonderful cast,brilliant script and some good acting
1,the script was n't so much as the plot,the action in this film feels somewhat rushed
1,i was n't impressed at all i went for it but,i watched this show religiously on a sunday afternoon late
1,the characters go into some sort of bizarre situation the characters are supposed,the dialogue is a little weak the characters are stupid and unlikeable
1,it also makes you cringe and feel like an idiot,it must have been very much the sort to the fullest
1,i will take the time the writers take it in a movie that will end up being very good,i 've watched a lot of bad films and i was expecting the film to be pretty bad
1,it could easily have been more like a good movie if you,it 's the main attraction that i had the entire movie
1,everything the bad guys seem to have done that is,everything he touches is the best in the book
1,karen looks too old at work and is very unattractive and the fact she just appears to be,karen gordon plays jane who also appears in the scene as a mother in an old building
1,if you are to an oldtime film this will likely be your cup of tea for a movie like,if not a plot about two people who do things get the way up to the present side
1,by the way do n't waste your money you 'll miss everything that is n't a lot like the film and the rest of the film is,by a end of the movie we learn why the evil man was killed by a zombie bat who kills and kills the people with nothing
1,the music is really quite wonderful it 's not about the beatles the story of the famous band of the two,the end of the film was very much as the viewer would know each other in the first fifteen minutes
1,then the two men go about an abandoned couple on a,then he turns out to be a nice little girl
1,no matter what you are the movie would still look fun on the subject matter,no more than a few scenes like the one where a camera was filmed in a
1,the first 30 minutes or so were,the plot could be so good
1,he has proved on a pedestal that this was one of his most moving,he has an unusual role as a child actor and a good actor
1,wayne was a huge star in this picture,wayne had a chance to be at work in
1,needless to say you do n't care about the characters and they are so stupid you should ever consider the story very important,needless to say if the audience is supposed to have a conversation with him and the audience is laughing his life is crushed
1,it is a pretty boring movie and the direction that was also made up for me seemed to go on forever,it 's so poorly acted that the director makes an uninteresting phone conversation with a single parent or one of the most
1,i liked it but it is quite dull,i can honestly say that i have a problem
1,i was waiting for a movie to be released for an evening to come out because,i remember about this film in the theater and it looked so much more professionally
1,let alone put it all up and move your teeth to shreds or something,let 's just say a lot of the dialogue is bad and the plot is
1,the acting is wooden the dialog very little,the script by the director is terrible but there
1,they did have the same actors in this movie i guess i would agree that,they never give him a break but he soon goes over in the dark
1,almasy has no business value and is a result,almasy also had a few problems with it
1,sinatra is one of the most famous and most controversial actors of,sinatra is a master and his character is a little hypocritical
1,for me the most poignant part about this movie is that it is n't the sort of film that you just had n't experienced in any of the previous movies i 'd like to know how it is rated nc17,for the rest of you they wo n't get you a lot of money and there 's no real way to start watching this movie it 's still a waste of time to watch in a hurry to see it
1,if you 've ever seen a movie you 'll enjoy watching all his films and do n't really look,if you ever saw a truly great film on television this is definitely one to see and enjoy
1,was it a good idea to write,was this a really good movie
1,an excellent thriller by its director tim,an entire movie in a row
1,in real life the man from the moon is a very tall woman who has always been on the verge,in the meantime he was n't a coward and he only saw him for the duration of the film
1,he seems to have a bit to say on the silver screen,he 's a very talented director and it 's easy to believe that
1,it 's just a bad movie,it 's just that the director never
1,this is a beautiful and powerful show,this is one that 's really good
1,in most cases the film was shot entirely with such artistry and panache which is the reason why the,in the end i did n't want to go but i wanted to make sense of the plot
1,but all in the family is really a bad movie,but a true classic with a script that makes no sense
1,the actors are great and the characters are,the film has a very gritty quality
1,she has his hair dyed glasses and the head is one of them being a,she could n't be more beautiful and even she 's a very nice addition
1,everything seems forced and it has not been the fault to the audience 's mind,everything seems rather dull in this movie but it still does n't fit into the story
1,it 's a fun and fun scene involving four dogs with a pizza and their first blood on a tree,it is not the type of movie to which i can imagine a very serious person with an iq record or
1,i'm still a huge fan of the original dracula,i'm not just going to add my own opinion about
1,stunning costumes costumes work and excellent cinematography and costumes,stunning cinematography great actors and very beautiful scenery
1,black robe white hair a few of the songs,black robe is my personal first of the bunch
1,i did remember her and her character but it was difficult to,i think the writers should learn more about his acting skills
1,this is one of the best movies of all time,this show is pretty good because of the acting talent i
1,even i had no idea of its potential it would n't be the easiest i give this,even though he has n't been on the stage ever since in what is meant to be the
1,the story unfolds around a bit too often but at the end,the plot moves from all around the place to the end by the
1,perhaps a very underrated performance is perhaps the best performance of the film especially if you see,perhaps if they were n't on all movies then they went back to a time machine
1,thank you for giving great reviews so far i am a fan of,thank you to listening to the other reviewer comments of your movie
1,so we just sat there wondering about the movie after that it was a long journey,so now if you ever really liked the original series i recommend 'the lion king'
1,its not a horror film it just does n't make sense,its a movie that has a wide variety of interesting scenes that
1,pacino 's career must have got more money for himself,pacino must be given the same sentence a film as the
1,complicating crime with the usual black is the problem with the character 's motivations but even when he takes,complicating your soul is a movie which i think it was a bit of a shame for me
1,i had a few beers with a few beers but the film itself is not worth bothering not a laugh,i 'd like to state that this flick is a film about something more important than american politics of war
1,the movie was shot in english and had no place in it very realistic and in fact it was a cheap look,the only reason i'm giving this a two is if one were a fan of the series in the first place
1,furthermore one thing i did n't expect was his performance in the film at every turn,furthermore while it 's not great in any way shape it 's not about it
1,in terms of a more positive review it 's the ultimate product of a classic,in a scene i could see where the audience were from laughing as the movie continued
1,and the rest of the movie was pretty much an insult,and if that does n't explain why the film is n't just
1,but after the long run the movie has some very strange moments,but the problem with this movie though is that it has an attractive
1,acting is fine and the cast is wonderful,acting has got to be the worst thing i
1,there are some pretty good scenes the film really begins with a prologue of,there 's nothing to offend you as it has a fairly complex ending
1,generally it does n't get any kind of message the acting the script is just terrible,generally the only reason to see this film is because its the last one out to snuff
1,when the movie begins to lose its grip on the viewer it 's not that,when you are n't watching this you will laugh to tears in the plot
1,things are not so stupid as there is n't much of a,things went wrong because of what one of the boys had
1,a few seconds later there 's a woman walking with her mother,a group of people get on the bus to find a hidden treasure
1,i saw it in the cinema with two of the ten stars,i think they were all in the background at this film
1,lee 's character was so annoying that anyone would notice,lee and his pals are very funny as well
1,the story has a few good ideas,the action is a little farfetched
1,in one of the most ridiculous scenes ever there was no sense of what was happened here,in the movie he 's a guy who really wanted to make his dad a very good movie
1,the film deals with problems in the life of a young filmmaker,the acting was horrible and the only good parts of them were the
1,to be honest the movie is terrible but the acting is generally quite bad and the,to me it 's a movie that i recommend you see to it 's true
1,the fact of the matter is that despite being a great book,the acting ranges from being just awful on screen and it is difficult
1,just in case it happens that he has a problem with his wife he was a hero and that guy did n't come in after the death the mother says to one,just for the part of the two young men in the middle and the fall by the end of the movie it 's a movie that gives all the clues a great deal
1,i have to admit that i liked the film,i did n't remember seeing them at the theater
1,lots more i was really expecting an interesting movie not to mention all,lots of time spent in watching the same man as the 'hero'
1,maybe if they are trying to come into the real world with this movie they,maybe because the director does n't have to put a lot to the movie
1,it 's worth the money and a ticket to see,it 's really not so much to say that the characters
1,but when the story becomes convoluted all around the film is not just based on reality,but when i say you ca n't tell what a good horror movie you are seeing on
1,wallace hunter was as charming as a baby and i hope the writers can get out of that field and,wallace beery plays an unsympathetic character that seems to be trying to be a failed agent in the movies
1,i will be seeing this film again on dvd,i am a big fan of the series
1,there was no mention of this film that 's,there are a few problems with the plot
1,next up until a new orleans to start it,next to nothing more it 's a very good movie
1,and it shows her character the way people die,and the other characters are interesting as well
1,mainly due to being shown the film is the first feature length film,mainly because of the lack of depth the film lacks the impact and the
1,we find ourselves wanting to watch the show again,we 're going to be watching a movie for no
1,pleasant enough and yet the film still manages,pleasant is a good film for everyone
1,whatever the reason why it happened in the first place,whatever it was a little too much and was a great
1,the performances are pretty much all but it seemed as though they were trying to,the first ten minutes of this film were a big bore on the audience
1,the characters were all excellent and the music is awesome,the movie was shot in black by far too many times
1,it was so horrible and so boring that i wonder if the writer could not get rid of his acting,it all starts with the same man sitting down in the street talking to himself he was trying to talk to
1,however this movie is one of the worst movies of that period and i think it 's not the worst film ever made,however it is a shame because the movie was so bland the dialog did n't take any risks and the plot was weak and
1,karloff 's film is just plain funny though and one thing i 'd probably consider a little less entertaining,karloff as an aging man who turns on the corpses and kills some guys who were the same as men
1,he does his best to keep there the way,he plays an important part as a whole
1,the character is one dimensional and unsympathetic character 's motivation for them,the whole thing seems almost like there was something to be done in
1,they should have made it to the bathroom,they also make a good movie in the book
1,rachel has a good performance and i liked her performance,rachel mcadams is in the film in the same way as
1,the cast is strong and the writing was superb and the directing by the characters is very strong,the only reason this film is so wonderful is because of the acting abilities of peter falk so much
1,card is a film that is definitely a gem in those categories,card park 4 is one of my alltime favorite episodes of this series
1,the other characters are the best,the first half is a rather formulaic
1,and what i liked about the acting was,and for me though i like that
1,he and his brother play a very conservative woman as is in the movie,he would be just an alcoholic and it 's a shame because we just have
1,by that time i was bored the movie was a little disjointed,by the way not even his own character has an explanation on the
1,i found myself rooting for him and it was his fault that he made i felt for,i saw this film at my school video and this film disgusted me and did this
1,i thought the whole thing really was a good example of a plot that was too boring to be,i do n't know whether it is the plot or the dialog but the script is too cheesy
1,few people have talked for the pleasure of watching this,few actors are just plain bad especially the cast
1,i had never heard of this movie,i watched the show and loved it but
1,in fact it 's quite funny to watch,in addition the soundtrack is also terrific
1,not only is it a little tiresome it has something that you ca n't forget,not the worst movie he has ever made but he definitely has the chance to make
1,firm this is a really good film,firm and it 's an interesting and well
1,in fact it is very hard for me,in my opinion this was very good
1,and the movie is just a mess,and what were they thinking when they made
1,i have n't just seen rumors of how to give a damn and what its the best,i do n't agree with the fact that this movie is so bad it is funny
1,finally the story turns around and you get to see a lot of people 's mistakes,finally the action sequences are very cool especially since some of the shots are very memorable and
1,legion girl was n't that bad and it was n't,legion 's edge as well as the actors is so funny
1,it is n't funny at all the only good acting and dialog in this movie is that the story is pretty cool except for a couple of laughs,it seems that the only reason this movie is a classic is that i had n't watched the first half of this series and had to wait
1,the best part was the story which,the movie could have made better
1,but the film is about a guy in school looking for a guy who 's a little boy,but that is why i do n't see anything of it in the end when i got a chance
1,i saw this movie last night for a second time in new jersey so i decided to watch it tonight,i found the story more than i could believe it to be and is so predictable that they are more of
1,have you been a fan of john waters,have they not been seen in other movies of
1,the film is not bad though,the acting in this movie was also
1,but it 's too obvious it looks like a poor remake of the other films from the director 's rear,but the problem is that he has such an attitude that he does n't know what it all means
1,go out and watch this movie,go all the way and give up
1,unfortunately the director 's vision of the story is just as compelling after that film as,unfortunately the film never rises to the occasion or even on the plot at all
1,the movie opens with the guy being chased by the guys,the story is as follows but the acting is poor
1,funny is n't a good thing,funny as is the entire world of
1,this is a film about a man who lost his love and he and his lover and the end which we 've never met,this movie makes no excuses and i know exactly why this should not be shown to have taken one star in another movie
1,let 's not be fair about how it ends,let 's start off with a few points of the
1,he is a good actor for a screen and there is not a bad actor in,he is so convincing and so subtle that he can do a very good job
1,i just think that there could have been some more interesting things and the character development is interesting,i 'd never heard of it until then but it was good because after watching the previews for this
1,it is a pity that it does n't receive itself a big star,it makes you feel like you are watching the whole film from one perspective
1,and you want to go to a movie with the characters,and finally he 's a little too old for a movie in
1,alex also has been living in the middle of the depression the family does n't have a,alex goes to see the movie from start to finish but ends up being killed off
1,though the film is a work of art in the form of art direction the photography is breathtaking the editing is very good the settings is beautiful and are often fascinating and beautiful,though she seems to know what was going on with her life she is just left in a very simple state of danger a little unsatisfied with her in her face and a desperate
1,midgets did n't have to use the word fck they would make the movie,midgets was like this and then we saw the same thing twice on the same
1,like the other people who saw that i liked this movie and i just hope they get it a,like any other movie i can still feel for its characters and it is a very clever experience
1,and that is what it does after this movie is finished,and if we do we 're just trying to find this flick
1,they seem to be going on around the same way they have not made much sense,they get a few decent performances which are not enough to make an entertaining thriller
1,i did n't have much to write,i did n't think that this film would
1,yet somehow it would be fun to see a sequel on my website which has the same exact premise but in this case i saw,yet with much of the movie 's success in a small budget film the effects are completely lacking and the performances are merely poor
1,it 's like watching some sort of a good episode by christopher lambert,it was the year you saw the series after seeing this the first time
1,its a great movie and one of the best movies i have ever seen,its an interesting movie i just saw this for the first time last night on
1,the fact that it 's on the,the film was a major letdown
1,why should my sympathies that one of them could actually be,why did he get killed even after a few seconds
1,the only other cast member who actually shines,the music in the world is as well as
1,a few good actors in the cast could,a little more entertaining and more exciting
1,there is just too much humor and a scene with a young boy dressed in a balloon is probably,there are several characters who seem almost always and seem to disappear or act like the real ones
1,i do n't see how this movie got made,i guess i was the best way up the line
1,his acting is quite good i mean what a,his acting as a film is quite good
1,and a young woman with a heart attack at it 's,and how many other bad movies can this have had
1,the first three movies that have happened in the series were the two stories of the original novel,the best part of the movie is what i saw on the other side of the dvd
1,she is the best known singer on her body,she is the only person who can save this poor
1,i liked the movie and i liked the movie as though it,i know it 's a big hit in a foreign country
1,i know he 's a bad girl,i can relate to all characters and i
1,all in all i can say that this movie is a waste of a great cast of actors,all in all the first movie that is worth a look at all the very least you have watched
1,who 's behind his camera was on the scene,who are a great fan of the genre
1,and i do n't get that right,and that 's what a brilliant director the
1,the movie is just the worst of its ilk and the other 2,the action of the story is the main interest in this film
1,this movie is a lot like i ca n't describe it any year as it was intended for children,this is an absolutely great film and i hope you get more with it the story line is solid the
1,after the first few of the cast have a strong,after all his lines are delivered in this movie
1,when the film starts moving out of the hands of both minnelli and the characters that they make they are forced to speak fluent and yet they are clearly influenced by the same old actors of the,when the movie fails to connect with a single shot of the killer 's point of view it could have been the deepest premise of two different movies about the dangers of the one 's life
1,nevertheless i thought the music added a little touch that was good in that,nevertheless a few people will be aware of the ending and it will make you
1,the story does n't do n't have the usual thrills of the original and the plot is,the script was so poorly written and so poorly written that the script was almost horrible
1,this flick is so bad it 's funny,this movie is full of great characters and the
1,this film just does n't get it,this movie is so awful you wo n't
1,in the end they do n't believe that this is a film that leaves them with no surprises at all,in fact the movie feels more like a horror movie than horror because a few moments were actually explored and made
1,angus was still alive and had to stop on,angus tells this story of four sons who get together
1,to sum it up this is a must have,to watch the movie i have lost comments
1,the film was a great piece of work but it,the script was excellent and it was very believable
1,regardless of its technical limitations the film does,regardless of that it was in this
1,and what they are is really just so stupid,and in fact he was a bad man but that
1,it 's all about the sex sex and it 's just getting going a bit too fast to find,it was the sort of movie that i got the joke and i really wanted to slap it
1,the scene is a bit too dark for me,the cast is very well chosen but that 's why
1,i was n't really expecting any real acting in,i can imagine he was in this film
1,i think you 'll get a chance to see these movies only get out of hand,i do n't know much about the plot but here it shows how a movie can be
1,but for a while my god i 've heard that,but the best thing about it is the music
1,three extremes are the very first,three people do very few things
1,all in all for all you guys out there then check this,all together and as it is that was a big disappointment
1,by the time of my brief time i have never seen an old movie that deals with me,by trying to avoid the film the story gets complicated after the first half of the film
1,usually a movie like the one that is supposed to be based on a book is something that,usually i'm surprised that anyone should check out the original in this sequel to a better sequel
1,ben affleck gives a brilliant performance in this movie,ben murphy is at top notch as the captain he
1,the actors are not nearly as wooden as they are in the movie and they really look at it and the movie could have had more,the only good acting was by the always hot tara collins playing a young woman and the girl who seemed to be a good actress
1,although you would have to wait for a very cheap fix,although the film did not appeal to its audience the movie could
1,imaginative and very simple and i highly recommend,imaginative camera work that works is great
1,all you 'll find in a movie is an old man from hell one 's mouth a,all i could see were the characters but the fact that so many people have talked
1,most of the film is shot in a very dark area at sea and the story,most likely the show has a plot that can get a bit boring in general
1,the story is just so real,the plot to it 's climax and
1,anyone who has read the book should see it,anyone who did the film have a chance to watch
1,we 've all been told that i was expecting the film to be bad i would not be surprised if i saw it in the theater,we 've seen a lot of the film and you probably have to wonder why he has one other film that has only two stars
1,but then how do you lose a man in the end,but as the movie continues on its way into the middle ages
1,through flashbacks this is a movie i can see again and again and again,through most of this movie he seems to be at the center of his career
1,i'm also pretty hard to believe in people who have watched this film for their little bucks they did n't,i'm not sure why the director wanted to use this movie as a vehicle for a lot of money
1,is n't that an example of this,is so poor it 's painful to watch
1,but as it stands this has just one drawback a very good,but we are too close up and it makes us cry
1,a story of an army of men in the early 1950s but also,a good premise was missed by both the cast and the casting
1,kelsey russell is excellent as the son who makes his way through,kelsey grammar is one of the best i 've ever seen
1,however i was expecting a very straightforward and interesting story about the evils of war and the aftermath of the holocaust,however what really made this movie is the music score by richard and it was nice to watch it all the way
1,while a great cast do n't have their presence in films like these,while not quite a masterpiece the film also lacks a sense of what could
1,your typical hollywood movie will make you think about a,your kids do n't know how to stop it
1,i'm really shocked because it got such a strong name for imdb,i'm afraid i would n't have minded if i had just picked up
1,the dialogue is a joke and the movie also makes little sense in an attempt,the story makes it more than just a straightforward story with twists and turns
1,the fact that every character were a likable group of girls who never lived and had been brought in by an equally racist woman who,the only reason why this game made it through my vcr is that it does make the show great or even better than tv
1,it must be called the ultimate worst movie ever,it looks good but it 's too bland and there
1,the fact that it was n't made for tv did n't seem that the movie was n't as good,the characters are well done and the story is based on the reallife exploits of the evil killer
1,my girlfriend and i were scared,my rating is high but the film
1,there are few films that actually take me out of the way,there seems to be no attempt at telling us about his character
1,jack lemmon is good as the detective but it turns out that he 's doing nothing,jack was a good actor and that 's why he has the right to suck
1,this leads to a great scene of rape and love,this film has got one good thing to it
1,meanwhile the police inspector decide that the only time that they are given the police is the one responsible to find the boss,meanwhile the man is rescued by the beast 's hand is so close that it almost becomes a character he plays his hand on
1,the movie is about a girl who is engaged in a situation that she did not know,the scene where he and his son meet by two guys and then they are a bunch of
1,this movie was made by a very large film producer named robert altman,this is my favorite movie of all time i think it is a must
1,if you do n't watch this movie you will love it more if so one just wants to take what is so right by the title and you do n't,if it was n't for that little film in a place with this film it certainly would have had something to do with the book of his last film
1,it 's a real shame that i,it 's not a funny movie
1,dylan moran is so out of place at first as to be the worst,dylan mcdonough is one of the greatest actors he 's ever on screen
1,whatever i like and i have seen him do this work in movies,whatever happens to the viewer and then it begins to unravel and when a
1,the script is a joke the dialog is awful the actors are just crap,the actors involved were not well done in the past who they were in but
1,jacko a new one is just a really nice film,jacko is the worst film i 've ever seen
1,it was so poorly put together that i watched the movie with my girlfriend and we really enjoyed it,it makes me want to rip up a movie with every time the story and start to fall into the
1,the characters are just plain stupid and they try to save the best of his life,the film starts off with a bunch of men getting a kick out of it
1,i hope everyone can make it an excellent movie,i had n't watched this movie since then
1,let me say more with this statement,let me just say a few things that
1,there is just a lot of stuff left and right in this film,there will be some people here but if you 're in a dark mood
1,this movie has a decent mix of good,this is such a perfect family drama
1,the only positive note for me was to hear a song i hear to my,the script itself is full of the clich and not in a funny way
1,some of the worst special effects i 've,some of these scenes are truly priceless
1,instead we are shown an actor called anna who also gives the impression that she had been born in the late 1800s,instead of being taken by the police at all it does a better job in the film than to the truth
1,you may like it but this version has all the ingredients that most,you do not see the world of film makers for that matter
1,the film is n't even funny the humor is funny and the,the film lacks many twists and turns all the way through
1,this is a very underrated movie by the way it is so much more than any other film in which to construct film,this is certainly one of the last and only movies for those of us who want to see it because its not even the
1,cabot is an absolute disaster and is never fully appreciated by his brother,cabot who was just a kid is a bit of an embarrassment though but
1,roberts and his partners try and find a killer and the killer is in the woods,roberts was good as always a little too much too young for the part too he was
1,that should be a problem for my children who have,that 's what the first 45 minutes worth while
1,their own father shows an image of one of the most notorious and influential and most feared women of the,their characters were obviously written and needed to make their mark believable and more interesting and to show up
1,while the story is set in 18th century greece the movie is very good at the outset,while the show is much less faithful to the comic book the show is still rather funny and
1,then i have seen it three times now now and i,then to a surprise with your own life and love
1,the acting by everyone involved seems forced and,the plot is contrived the acting terrible
1,if anything that was a joke to me when watching this film i was,if you want to like the bad movie check out the other ones
1,beautiful but also a bit confusing,beautiful and haunting as you are in
1,in this movie she plays the role of a high school student who,in this case i ca n't believe what the hell is this
1,and as a result of their time they,and the story itself is well told
1,i will not spoil the plot as it does n't make sense,i have heard a lot of people who 've read and heard this
1,the characters are good and the acting excellent,the main characters played by eric bogosian and others
1,this film is an insult to that classic,this film has it all with a strong plot
1,my biggest problem with this film is that i am amazed that the movie actually got to release,my favorite song is the one thing that i do n't like to make in this episode
1,happy days after watching the trailer i can safely remember it and i,happy ending and i 'll put the two leads down the stairs
1,the fact that we never actually get to see these characters or even a little of one another is more than enough,the fact that it 's just the same old same old same old same old does n't mean much to me
1,sean connery had the potential to try,sean connery does it quite successfully
1,on the other hand you see a woman trying to survive the killer by the end of the film she,on this occasion they are on the verge of becoming a classic the oldest 's adoptive and other sister
1,in this movie it is a nice balance for any director that has made him look a little like one,in this game a director of the original novel said that the author wanted this and that it was a remake
1,frankly in the process of a good movie this is a,frankly i 'd put this film in the trash category
1,with it 's bizarre nature the story develops very nicely,with many other films as the last century of death or
1,later the main character is just as convincing,later at the end he gets the chance to
1,this has got to be the coolest movie i have ever,this kind of person is the most dangerous to me
1,unlike his last movie and it is his best one,unlike many of the movies that have been called the same
1,would n't there anyone have been left with,would have had no background of course
1,for those who thought that there were many films about life it was also quite,for another it is a film about an alien trying to find a girl
1,salman khan gives the most subtle performance of his career with the script,salman khan has done some excellent work but this was n't really a bad
1,i 've done my review for this movie,i would say that the ending was a little
1,someone needs to tell the truth,someone was a good guy like me
1,after all in this film the two men were born in prison and have all the right,after the fact it is not a film you will want to see it again and again
1,the action scenes are ridiculous and boring and pointless,the acting is horrible at best and worse the plot
1,or a couple times he 's too smart just,or in fact that 's just a tip
1,someone gets killed by a guy who has nothing to do with the movie,someone who loves to have to sit through a movie for one thing is that
1,toss out the cash this is a classic film and a fun one to see,toss a few words and a dash of you 're a total ripoff of what can
1,to begin with here 's the thing about this film,to make matters worse the plot is ridiculous and predictable
1,watch it and be amazed that it has n't been released,watch for yourself if it 's still on your website the last
1,the acting and script are horrible,the film 's plot concerns a young
1,everything was good and i just finished watching a movie,everything in this film is a bit slow and incoherent
1,and she was very good in making a great film,and you will have a few times better to see
1,a good action film which keeps you wanting to watch more of our films as long as you do n't get any,a classic tv episode that has a great deal of humor and a great story telling and the excellent story lines
1,unfortunately in a movie in which this movie would be made available on a small budget i ca n't begin to remember that that would be an easy,unfortunately for some viewers the movie is actually rather slow and the ending is too abrupt to have so much to be resolved over and over again
1,i'm sorry this movie is n't for everyone,i'm afraid that no one wants to go to
1,date is a very interesting show about a guy that 's been around for no apparent reason but a very simple guy who lives up to,date has been a hit in the united states or has just been a big star on a series since miramax is just being in the united
1,that 's as far as i can tell this was in no way to me,that does n't mean it ca n't be any worse but at that point i ca
1,ed 's acting was great as was her,ed does n't seem to know what to do
1,this is the worst sequel i can think of for any age,this movie is a must see for all fans of art
1,complete crap but just how the hell is the story this movie sucks,complete trash but with some kind of suspense and the occasional atmosphere of a
1,the story is n't entirely ridiculous,the director is a master of the
1,hopefully there are some people who can make better movies and to make that point in their career,hopefully you know this show does n't come out in the middle like that it was a long time
1,budget constraints and a script that are,budget limitations are not very high
1,but the film is not as much of a statement the story is,but then this is a film to watch over and over again
1,i was n't expecting to see this film on the big screen but i was surprised at how good the movie really was,i thought i could predict that if this movie did n't show the effects of a big bear the film would be better
1,add real horror to the mix of story line and you have great acting,add nothing to the plot and instead a plot to move forward or make things
1,the movie had a good balance to me,the first time around with him is the way
1,it 's also just another movie that 's actually more interesting in that,it was all just amazing and i love the way everything happens
1,i'm glad i was watching it for quite a while,i'm not saying anything else but at least the first 20
1,as i saw it i was left wondering why she would be there,as to the main character of every crime she utters a lot
1,i was very disappointed by how he became part,i was also struck by what i felt
1,scifi channel had its place up in a trailer,scifi fans should know how this should 've been done
1,falk 's character is n't really a bad guy that 's just awful,falk is a woman a woman and a love story between her and her
1,i have never seen more like any of the other reviewers on this board so what,i also noticed that the plot is simple but this movie is a real bore
1,i would n't have liked it even if it came out on dvd,i would definitely recommend it for anyone who loves good or bad movies
1,it 's just the way it comes from and it has all the subtlety of,it shows the true horrors of the human race and how many things are
1,maybe for some strange reason someone who has a different orientation to a good man has n't done anything else better,maybe he does his best to strike it and i do n't believe that he 's as bad as the others in
1,in my opinion the greatest of the best,in the first third of the movie the group
1,i do n't know why this movie was written or not but i 'd rather watch it a second time,i watched this one last night and even think that it was good to see something good in the past but
1,as others have said it 's a very moving and touching look at how the media can be able to find their own way,as to whether there is one or two good things to make it a good diversion is the film not a big one
1,occasionally to say that his wife 's daughter has no idea in the movie 's past,occasionally the film goes as far as to draw you back then it has more than a
1,the first scene is excellent though with a bit of romance and a few of the scenes between grant and fonda,the acting is okay for their time with this film is great but the film 's weaknesses are not enough to justify
1,also a few minutes of the dvd that it 's in pristine form that are rare for me,also what really gives the movie its edge is the fact that the director uses the camera to depict
1,at least that 's my favorite movie i have seen,at other times this makes me mad at times
1,i love bad movies and this one was terrible,i love movies but it 's too little for me
1,this was not a movie for those interested in cinema or film,this film is the one to watch and it is a fun movie
1,the movie begins with two very nice people the two actors involved are very good,the fact that the filmmakers got a lot of screen time is beyond me
1,technically this movie is worth seeing for the characters and the direction i thought it was great,technically the film does n't have to try as a result or a movie of any kind by
1,is his brother to be a man,is it really that hard to put into
1,i love this movie and will watch more than once as it brings,i did n't see a point until the ending of the film
1,for those interested in war or history this is not your typical movie,for all the criticism involved is that in the story it could n't make
1,i was impressed by many different stories,i really do n't remember the fact that
1,the most irritating and unfunny thing about this movie is its casting and the acting,the rest of the actors are really good and it 's an intriguing story
1,if you think in the last few minutes you do n't have seen this movie,if anything like the film is not a thriller why is it as a film
1,my grade f dvd extras and then trailers and dvd interviews a few months of extras and two deleted sequences that include,my advice is to just avoid to buy this garbage at first buy it cheap i bet you 'll like it
1,but then the film switches gears as they move and they discover themselves the next morning,but after all i have been a fan of hers and has a different side of what
1,though not a good movie they also seem to be about the director 's imagination,though it also has some interesting scenes the dialog in this one was excellent
1,though some of it is rather dated and in a few scenes of the film appear in some of the others that do n't,though many of the people around the globe and me think he had some redeeming qualities it 's hard not to like him
1,i have no problem with the story it had a point of view,i 'll see this again with its commentary of an excellent time when watching
1,nero and his friends have been murdered one by one by a mysterious tribe led by a young girl who wants,nero is the center of the film for all those years and in this movie he is a natural believer
1,this movie is not just plain bad it is the worst and funniest movie possible,this is a true life lesson so what to say do n't expect it
1,i'm glad and have a good time explaining why it was made for tv so how could it,i'm really surprised that this got the rave reviews that i really wanted to see this movie
1,her only redeeming values have never been done by any number of other,her only friend is the fact that this guy is the best that can
1,well i have to say that when you think they think a sequel,well in the world it 's the best and funniest movie ever
1,or maybe its supposed to be in a good idea with the right frame,or even other than that it 's not a movie to be there
1,this is a very good movie to say it reminded me so,this will have to be the film to show a few
1,the film has a great director sam elliott was actually a great cast with a lot of great talent,the acting is mediocre at best and the production values of the movie do provide more atmosphere than any of
1,in fact this is not a bad movie,in the end he is also on my knees
1,based on the story of a serial killer who is now a murderer as,based on a true story of david gein is not a horror film
1,an enjoyable cast of excellent performances by robert duvall and a script that is not at all gripping,an attempt to recapture the dark side of the earth and a few other works as well
1,though it is not a bad film it 's a bit cheesy that i could not be,though the film 's plot twists were good enough for all those who enjoyed this film
1,anton de almeida is a fantastic actor in the,anton ruehl and helen scarwid had little dialogue
1,it was a very simple and accurate movie,it 's all in all and nothing is happening
1,i ca n't believe it would be a perfect film to watch in many countries,i 'll leave the room at what i did find interesting to see the movie without
1,only in one person 's family would be the center,only one thing right from wrong was his death
1,after his death and his death on the island and his death of the police the cops finally reach the target of the,after the movie they had a group of mates that would have come out of their house and they were left alone
1,he just had a few seconds of the movie and we were really happy to pay to,he 's not really a typical villain who 's been a little bit of an ass
1,the first half hour of this movie was actually about 1 hour and fifty minutes long spent with the rest of the movie,the first half hour of the film is n't about an audience or is a person who is supposed to be in the cinema
1,this film is like watching paint dry as,this movie is also full of violence
1,a couple of really interesting subplots come on,a good movie that i enjoy but i ca
1,i do n't think i know what it is after watching this series now you know how to deal with you and that,i 've watched all the episodes of this one when i first heard them on screen i had forgotten about this one
1,where was the suspense and it still has the capacity to deliver the worst,where do you come from when you sit down in the chair when you watch
1,had this movie been more enjoyable in the us the movie would have been great with his performance,had the two cops been arrested or the woman who could n't believe a man was being chased by
1,a lot of the scenes are in perfect harmony and the ending feels the same but i must agree that the one that i did was,a woman of choice is an aspiring and dedicated actor but this movie is full of charm and is one of the greatest most beautiful
1,i hope that someday someone is able to make a movie that 's better,i think the main problem between the film 's depiction of the holocaust
1,oh i suppose that 's right the first,oh yeah a good friend like charlie
1,the film moves along without resorting to anything like the main character and i was hoping that some would say something very original and entertaining,the story of the relationship between two men who have n't given a chance to be seen in a very idyllic film while the protagonists are
1,cliffhanger is one of those film so for the last thirty minutes i really like it,cliffhanger is a great adventure for all of us who just love the classic horror movies but
1,but i 've seen this one several times every time it 's on screen and so is the second to,but he still makes a good impression the latter is a very good action movie it is very hard for a
1,the music is haunting in contrast and the songs at,the plot was stupid i found this movie offensive
1,so to sum this up by giving the ending away the end of the movie,so they are trying to convince them that they have to use a new job but
1,mia farrow is in her role playing the same character in the first movie that 's what,mia farrow has a few memorable scenes and has a very credible presence as a woman
1,the most annoying thing about the movie is why does n't robert ryan in a sequel to his earlier work,the film is so incredibly entertaining as to be like it 's made to be a parody of a very popular
1,mcdaniel was a bit of a distraction in the movie,mcdaniel does n't realize anything about her as the young woman
1,it 's a shame that if that is n't that great this movie will make you,it 's easy to relate to the way the script is set in the plot
1,you are not watching the movie,you can watch all three movies each
1,it 's about the conflict and how to take responsibility to make up for the,it is a great movie with a plot that was interesting for the day
1,now you should just say something that happened to everyone like this,now he 's the only thing of interest i can say
1,it is a complete loss of all other peoples that i am aware of it,it has a really really cool performance it was good and i think that is why
1,there are movies that have good casts that are good especially the ones with no name,there were several scenes where the character would have been a little more interesting and the movie
1,a classic like all of those in the past,a few more years ago i was a student of
1,the acting is atrocious and in that scene 's dialogue the script seems to hit something,the problem is not the ending but the plot and the acting were not bad the story
1,the script by charles band is the real problem for a film that has the feel of the first one of the great action flicks,the only thing that kept me watching is from the outset that this film is going to be a sequel to other peoples' films
1,it is so very sad that it does not seem to be the same as,it should not be that it deals with this subject but a total mystery
1,the only person who was really good about this film was who he,the first time he did it it was a very enjoyable film
1,ha ha ha ha ha ha ha and the two,ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
1,how about that old person that could be funny,how this film got made is beyond me
1,if you 're a diehard fan of zombie movies this is a very funny film,if it was n't for the great use of cgi it 's also very low budget
1,his father and mother decide they 'll be in the car,his character is so stupid that you simply want to smack him
1,a woman 's family has been told that the town has a hidden meaning,a man born on a small mountain fishing camp or something goes nowhere
1,watch it every sunday if you know this is a good movie,watch him at least get some chuckles about how he can turn people
1,watching this movie a dozen times and still have an iq for the film,watching the movie was like fingernails off the road and you 've come to know
1,not worth tracking down a few bucks for this movie,not to mention that she was not a woman who had
1,ok so the film is set in a post apocalyptic city where the city folk are,ok so it was a very long film but it was also a great comedy
1,that being said that 's not quite a good idea not to mention the whole concept of the movie for,that 's a good one at this point i will see how we get to watch and not that
1,however a few of the most important messages are in order to convey the reality of what is being done and,however if you like it go and see it a little but you 'd be not so confused by it
1,it was like the director made no mistake or anything else,it 's all been told to the audience and that 's all
1,11 it will n't be easy to make,11 12 points from his new lover
1,my rating here is that the film would still be a little longer than the usual bollywood feature,my recommendation is see it to find out how well this movie is worth i could enjoy it
1,at one point the camera pans out,at least the cast was excellent
1,the film takes over the course of the story to follow,the story has none and does n't really deliver any clues but
1,gary cooper playing a slimy jerk like a cowboy is a classic for some of the worst i 've ever seen,gary connery appears briefly as a very human actor and he is in love with pacino as he is in a film
1,when i saw it listed it i was curious,when they have it 's bad guys all around it
1,obviously an overlooked version of the film from a,obviously that 's a part of the film
1,if the film makers were a bunch of friends then have the main characters from the first one,if you 're going to rent this movie to a degree please spare yourself money and rent it do
1,i give this movie a 9 instead of a 7 because it,i really wanted them to make a movie out of him
1,in any case the film is a waste of time and space but in it 's own merit the only real merit i can think of is for it 's production value,in my own eyes the film is set in the near future like a film in a decade like the old film noir in which a director and director have to work with
1,although the script is not entirely faithful to the novel it 's one of the worst movies ever,although i did n't see the plot much and i found the movie to be quite interesting
1,owen 's character is a caricature of a man who has a heart attack and makes a person to come back to life to punish the world,owen wilson stars as bill the brother of his sister and he 's just another annoying dad who is a complete idiot in school to become the world
1,for years that he had his face at a high school he decided to take the easy road,for a moment in a film that is all over the place how to make a film
1,a little of the plot is n't that,a big disappointment from the late 60s
1,that was a good sign to the movie,that is the best part of this movie
1,well you see that you did n't feel so sorry,well if you are at all picky i recommend that you
1,a great action flick by an excellent guy with a strong story line,a movie that should be appreciated by the public to provide competitive emotional responses
1,a very interesting character with an atypical role who is given his,a must see this is the best of the two sequels
1,so the movie has to be one of the most important ideas of all time,so to say it 's not a good movie is that it is n't even a
1,story is just plain stupid for most of it 's duration,story is good the characters are likable and the writing is excellent
1,in many ways this movie is very entertaining and it 's a good thing that all it succeeds to impress the audience in the end,in the end it makes sense that she has to go in the middle of the cold war but in fact her life goes to prove
1,olivia plummer does an impressive job as the doctor,olivia garcia also stars as the daughter of the family
1,but as a film this fails at the,but it 's just one of them
1,what is also interesting about what is in fact is how it got such a close attention in the end,what a shame that the film is so poorly made that you might want to spend the entire movie with little
1,he is an average singer with no redeeming features,he was a real jerk when he wrote this and
1,it 's not even all very attractive,it was very painful to watch
1,having not read the book i 'd also love to learn that all people in the world,having said the word track did n't work for my own reason to see this movie
1,we get to see a new york guy and a woman driving around to the city,we see a couple of characters trying to create the evil atmosphere of living through a house
1,i have to wonder how many people have watched this movie with me to give the film some,i 've seen the old john hughes series and it is all his fault is n't funny
1,there are two of the main characters the main character was shot and portrayed here,there are also some memorable lines in the movie from some of the film
1,it 's also about a young woman who loves her husband,it 's so damn bad and that 's the plot
1,but it really seems to me that this film is a little bit overrated,but if this movie was released in the us so far the people in japan
1,the movie is also interesting and even darkly disturbing,the music was pretty much as bad as in the
1,i give it a 2 because the acting is so bad that the,i 've read a few of his other comments on the web
1,jimmy stewart who usually plays 'the most dangerous is as an actress in,jimmy priestley is on his trail as well as the supporting cast
1,well acted to the point where it 's going straight,well i 've seen the movie many different times
1,every one that has commented on me are as good as the two stooges and that is pretty funny since the movie,every time u hear that scene he 's doing a really good dance score which is more than he can do
1,seriously a movie like the one this is the only decent and worth it to be sure,seriously i just do n't think this movie is going to be called a comedy classic
1,pauly shore plays the character who has to face them in the dark when,pauly shore 's portrayal of a dysfunctional family is very difficult to get
1,remember her the love story between her father and her friend,remember he had been a big star but at least he managed
1,we have three children whose two daughters are a married man,we see no evil and the zombies are so dark that you
1,how anyone could possibly enjoy the film is that the story is quite simple indeed,how does anyone ever tell this story of a serial killer being haunted by a werewolf
1,i was surprised to find that after,i thought the movie was great
1,i do n't know why anyone would want to,i hope it comes out on dvd soon
1,knock in the face and see what should be a movie like the,knock is the only word that i had heard about this movie
1,in spite of several scenes there 's an extra bit,in fact this movie would get a zero star
1,if you liked the book you 'll probably know that there is much more for it to be then,if you like to look at the plot of a horror flick the actors really had a good story and
1,note it 's almost flawless to say the least,note the other characters i 've seen are just great
1,with his family and friends there are many more things about,with such a good premise that 's hard to resist
1,the story line of two soldiers is also linked to the events in the war,the story revolves around young women returning to their home and with their parents they decide
1,over the years she appears as the head of an old flame who does n't see her face,over a course of one week they have been released to a new generation and must be willing to
1,it is a very beautiful film with some of the most fantastic performances of all time,it 's difficult to believe any director like this would ever distribute the sequel but this is
1,i found it so refreshing that it is actually pretty good but the story is quite predictable,i do n't know how hard these movies were made but when they got it on the air
1,all of this should do a better job by showing a,all this is happening in a different kind of movie
1,the fact that there will be a sequel to the movie does not make the slightest bit of sense,the only thing about this film that is watchable is the music and the performances of the actors
1,i will probably watch the movie again for its sweetness and to think of it because i feel the urge to walk at the screen because of a,i found this as a tv series called for all ages and has been done with a lot of other sources but is currently available on vhs
1,but at least this time it 's so badly made,but it 's just that we never let a woman come
1,the ending is absolutely pointless and it just gets boring,the two of them fall into the trap of becoming the
1,i have seen some of the other comments on it and the impact with it 's release here the list of many,i was really surprised not even to see this movie or just have to sit in my seat with my children
1,ann sheridan who had been in such an awful job is a very talented actress,ann sheridan delivers a superb rendition of the great novel writer and a wonderful director
1,there is no real reason to see the picture though because not only is it a true story of how the three sides fall,there 's a really good mix of these scenes with a long running time where the guy playing basketball is actually quite funny
1,the film 's soundtrack is so loud it is like a cheap version of a 1950s version of the classic version of conan o'brien,the movie is also about a mysterious woman who turns up a bit more but the plot is not as complicated as others have
1,how can someone call it a comedy,how can you keep asking who is that
1,in fact a few funny moments were thrown in there,in one scene he tells us he cannot stop and the
1,but for some reason the film has a certain,but that 's how many movies he says
1,let 's move it up it 's,let 's talk about that character
1,it 's all set in a very small part of the world of the time of the coast and the great life of,it is about the human mark and her son who works with the rest of the family and the people that happen
1,your friend says that in your opinion but you might just walk out of that theater,your friend of john cromwell was obviously playing another part of this movie like this
1,the fact that i saw this movie as an adult film is not funny,the movie 's storyline is one of the greatest and most promising of films in
1,okay it may be nice to see the film,okay it 's a spoof of a movie the cast
1,it was made for television but then it 's still a lot,it made me a little uneasy and i loved the movie
1,first off the acting is really bad too bad the production designer is,first the actors were just all over the place in the movie
1,in fact one thing you should n't want to get to is the fact that this film is an american production and it is so poorly scripted that i,in a world where it 's a movie and it 's just a big part of the action it makes it more interesting and more engaging for us
1,this film has a good premise but it lacks any,this is an absolute mustsee movie for all ages
1,the dialogue is n't that bad,the movie moves a little over with
1,if we like us you 'll hate this film and think it is very good,if you are interested in a movie that is worth watching the beginning of the film
1,but in the first half an hour,but this is a classic movie
1,i think the director got the idea of watching a movie,i love these songs and the songs especially the music
1,he has done a fantastic job in,he then goes crazy and moves
1,all three of them look like they are taking a vow to make a big deal they ca n't even make the effort to care less about anything,all my friends and i were entertained as hell this movie is not about a group in their own country who is a bit of a loser who has
1,it has a lot to live up to,it was a funny and realistic drama
1,every time the movie started i started crying hysterically i felt like a little bit,every now this is just like a great adventure movie with no redeeming qualities
1,canadians had to come home in order to keep this series so much so that they could afford the money to make it out,canadians were n't quite as successful as the critics though but this film is not a film of a kind of a horror
1,at least that 's right a good idea,at one point in the series and when it
1,thousands new lows to this wonderful film,thousands of times he 's in the car
1,its not so perfect to watch it unless you want to see a movie with a couple of actors who actually had been in it and had,its a very different plot involving a real friendship and the characters that are the leads are in a situation that was very refreshing to watch
1,i was impressed so many times i feel as though it was one sitting around,i saw this film last night with a bunch of friends who said a film of
1,i'm glad i did n't get it from the library,i'm sure i missed something from the movie as for most
1,and it 's a story on the subject board is just the same,and then it turns out that they just happened to be part of a
1,there is also some rather unusual and unsettling touches,there is no real story to speak of
1,these are films which are in real life but this movie is so much funnier,these guys are actually funny and sometimes you feel the pain of watching them
1,because there are several parts that are so funny,because it 's just another case of crap but a
1,ernest borgnine is wonderful and gives in great performance in this movie and if you do n't care about a,ernest abrams 's direction is amazing and the film suffers from a strong but effective soundtrack by stephen rea
1,fabrizio never played in the movie,fabrizio is a great character actor who
1,that 's just what a horror flick 's movie is,that alone makes it hard for me to imagine the appeal
1,oh dear that it was a little bit too good,oh and i did not like all i know
1,i 've always been fascinated by the acting,i would also like to say that some of
1,most of the actors are really very good but the performances are horrible,most of the people involved in this movie died at the end
1,with the exception of a young man who is not,with a supposed budget of about 1000000 it shows
1,alex was a little nervous and his presence is so obviously the weakest actor of,alex 's life changes so much he seems unsure about her son 's death
1,frances chopra is very sexy as usual,frances das the rest was also the only
1,it is very similar to the real story and with,it has everything in it that makes any sense
1,the whole idea is interesting and i mean if it is n't as funny as watching the mst3k series that,the film moves along a bit to the end but it 's still very slow and has no resolution
1,bridget jones as dr is the perfect foil for the man of love',bridget 's character has a nagging daughter who lives to play a practical role
1,could have been a little shorter but the script,could have been something like having a child
1,every day that he has seen some good actors in his movies his film is a classic,every one of these actors has a big chance to have the same lines over and over again
1,that 's about how it has the consistency,that 's the best you can get
1,the only interesting aspect i had was that i was expecting a cheesy,the main characters do n't come close to doing anything particularly likable
1,not that i am sorry this movie is terrible,not everyone will like the film because the subject matter
1,a simple story that takes itself far far too seriously and a truly awful scene,a few moments of unintentional humor are funny but not by any means a film that
1,a lot from the beginning to the story,a film that should be required viewing for anyone
1,of course there is also a little romance,of course that 's saying it all
1,instead of being a more successful tv,instead the acting is not bad
1,forget the fact that everyone in general is just a great,forget it or the rest of the world 's population
1,i could n't have even found the culprit from the novel by the book 's end,i thought it would help to explain why but it just does n't get good reviews it
1,it 's so badly executed and so devoid of any chemistry between the two leads,it turns out that a killer who has a killer and does n't have to live
1,as the movie progresses the movie becomes very long and seems to be an exercise in padding,as for the movie it was a great movie about a group of kids where their lives are
1,if you want to spend time with the movie and do n't miss it,if they were going to take another hit then they would have a different ending
1,i was hoping for a good story,i do believe that the reason of this
1,infantry officer richard james is one of the first things ever to have the fingerprints and even,infantry man tries to avoid the murders as the killer and the crew fight the hostages
1,but even then things get worse every time it appears,but when the film comes out in the context of the
1,one reviewer said it is a spoof of the first,one thing i did n't like is when you put up
1,using a couple of chuckles like that they 're trying to get out to the big time,using their money not to make an audition for an album that will make it sound like they
1,after she leaves the show just is n't much of the time for the first time,after years i have no idea whether to buy it from the stores or in the movie
1,in my opinion the film was a bit too long to have taken place or at least the impact,in fact i would have preferred for a remake of the book to take this show off of its rightful
1,anyway it 's just another example of an absolute bad movie that is so dumb that it makes for a very tedious ride,anyway a new breed of events might be interesting and a nice but original film indeed as such all the way with great animation
1,this is not really like a very scary movie and is a film that i am glad,this film will be in your eyes for about 10 or 10 or 30 years now
1,also some of the scenes look like the ones that are supposed to be filmed in space as if there was something new in the story,also i would also recommend this to anyone seeking a movie worth looking for but if you 're not a fan of hers it is definitely not
1,this was probably in the top of my list of,this was a complete waste of time and money
1,foreign 's music is wonderful especially john mctiernan,foreign films that made me want to do the
1,the characters are played by the same guy that played the game on the screen and made,the music is absolutely awful and in no way detracts from that of the original film
1,i just wanted to punch my eyes out of all of that and let me know what i will get out of it,i 'd love to see more of this type of film when all we get is some of the great fun stuff
1,the plot is contrived and it has a plot and,the script is very poor and the acting sucks
1,you will know what i mean,you can watch the film closely but
1,the film also deals with real problems with the human body,the plot is very predictable and does n't add to the suspense
1,only because it is all time for the audience 's intelligence to be,only the director and directors have done something original for them all
1,i am not impressed with the story it takes a bit too serious,i love the way that the movie is made for children the kids all
1,the story involves the family of a man who tries to kill him but is still very human,the story of the book is based on an actual event of a serial killer who tries to escape
1,see it at some of your video stores,see this movie when it will take off
1,and then that 's where it works,and a bunch of people are killed and
1,it 's hard to describe a more realistic portrayal of the character of such a person at the same,it is a very touching movie and i will certainly think that it did not go too far
1,or even a scene about a man from the,or that 's the end of the world
1,this is the kind of film that,this is a pretty good movie
1,i think people should take it as they might say,i have to admit i would rather watch the more mature
1,disturbing for those who have n't watched it because of the director being shot as a horror thriller,disturbing to see one thing but i did not get a chance to see anything of it
1,first of all the plot is stupid and the ending makes the movie all too,first the music of the movie is quite good and the costumes are great
1,and in some way a bad movie in which its a wonderful movie could be made,and i can still admire her if there ever was such a thing that is worth a
1,the problem with this movie is its poor script,the cast is quite fine in their roles
1,although the film is one of the most interesting it 's still a very realistic view of,although its a true story as are often the characters are very much a bit sketchy
1,sadly it 's not until the ending when it,sadly i found a lot of the plot
1,maybe it was the filming and acting but it could have been good movie,maybe it was meant to be but it 's just too cheap to be really
1,ps i would love to have my views on someone,ps is a lot of things that get boring
1,it is not the type of story that they show,it 's a great idea but that is the problem of
1,in the end he 's all that stupid,in that regard it is one of the strangest
1,in most of the films he plays it has one funny scene with him masturbating for when the owner 's mother is lying,in the film 's own way this was a film where it felt like i took it in a very serious time to be
1,the film ends up with a bang on that point and you 're likely to have figured out what might have caused him a little bit more but when,the script is poor the acting is bad the direction is bad and the plot is so badly done that the viewer is supposed to hate this movie
1,what i love is a fantastic work of art by mr roth,what would happen had i not watched this crap movie in theaters and
1,if you did n't like this film you have to check the video,if that 's what you get in movies they should n't be in any
1,if you ca n't see these things in your movies do n't bother it is good movie,if your gonna make a bad film like that do n't waste your time to rent
1,if you 're a fan of the novel this might be worth,if you think this review i thought this was pretty cool
1,i would also watch a number of episodes of the series,i 've also seen the same one the other year
1,apart from the fact that a good film is one of the good ones with an,apart from a couple of the cast members there are some notable actors on board
1,after that he goes insane from the outside and lands on the wrong of the plane,after the other two hours of that the movie 's script is an utter waste of time
1,im still asking why i want to see these two people walk around in a,im surprised the whole thing ended up being the dumbest of the 90 's
1,whereas there are some serious parts they are in one place in the movie which is actually a mystery or a mystery,whereas a lot of the jokes are quite funny the story has a few twists and turns of humor and the story is
1,the scene where the characters try to,the story line is very simple
1,maybe it was because the story did n't move,maybe i missed the point of the film
1,conflicts are discussed and there are various moments of the real world and the people in love at the end,conflicts are made of a man who can communicate with his own self and be involved with a very nice woman
1,not just about as much fun as it should probably rank,not only do they not use in their films but it comes
1,maybe that 's how good you can get and make up for that in the beginning,maybe the biggest laughs come from the fact that i watched the whole thing with a bad
1,this movie was made in the wake of the taliban a movie that has all,this is all in the first scene with the man with the dead arm
1,suddenly it was filmed by the director of a studio who 's also in,suddenly he gets back in peace with the help of dr john locke
1,a real shame of this film it is a classic production,a good example of an obscure production from beginning to end
1,when i saw one film i have to see her in such a rare role,when the first man who knew nothing about them they came across another character
1,it does n't fit on the usual clichs and silly jokes,it also has lots of action and a few twists
1,a must if you 're looking for a good family story or even an average horror flick,a very young couple who get so involved in such great events do n't even feel the need
1,he 's got something in common with a guy who 's been,he was a quiet child with great timing and great voice
1,iron monkey is an excellent film,iron jawed angel has a lot of
1,the problem is that it is still trying to get a,the film is very slow moving and very well acted
1,brave characters played by men in a different movie,brave that i could go on and on
1,as the movie progresses we see both of the three members of the group,as i mentioned by that it has already become a cult classic movie a horror
1,harvey keitel plays the leading man a former hero and he is one,harvey keitel gives an awesome performance as the villain of the family
1,if that are a movie you need to watch this and if u love the kind of movie the director and director did you would like,if you 're a fan of either a comedy or a laugh track at the expense of the word fck do n't watch this one
1,although there are some elements in the film that are obviously very interesting they make the film a powerful study of reality,although it does not make me look at how horrible it is if so far the acting was n't the worst
1,i like to say this is one,i liked this movie even better
1,this is an example of that i suppose what it is all about that,this is an excellent movie with brilliant characters and story to tell what is the
1,the film 's biggest flaw is the ending which i personally disliked,the main story about the real people who have a family and son
1,jeff garlin was perfect in the movie he played a somewhat straight out of him but never made the transition to heaven 's career,jeff lieberman is n't much of the director but is also just a really cool filmmaker because he did n't use his gore and gore
1,the story is about the conflict between a man and the woman and the woman and son,the action sequences are great and it is one of the great movies of the decade
1,the only reason i gave this a 3,the movie is not even good enough
1,well it 's not all an hour and half of it is just a little too bland,well worth the time to save yourself see it if you can buy into this movie
1,many scenes like the one where i was watching two of the actors being punched out of,many of the facts are interesting even when they do n't even know how to act
1,but he does n't care if you can believe he is the best thing in this thing,but the film itself is n't that bad and the actors should also be treated as if in
1,what is the point of all of these actors,what 's more this is a film based on true
1,michael dudikoff is the only thing going well he and mcclane were not in it at all,michael dudikoff was hilarious here as batman but he did n't make a convincing hero since freddy lundgren
1,what do you expect when you 're a young girl who 's having sex,what 's the deal with the killer throwing in a bucket of milk
1,talking about the fact that the film 's theme is that we 've all had a more serious view,talking about a little old man who is not the kind of man that makes her own career
1,i think the only people who have ever felt the pain is that they 've spent much,i did n't think this was the greatest performance since he was just too damn good
1,normally it seems so obvious that they just did n't believe in it,normally i am not the only one who actually hated this film when in
1,the story follows the lives of a young man and his son who both have the courage to survive in the real world,the film is about a dysfunctional family where friends are and then in the real world the same school does not happen in the
1,it 's a nice change on this type of horror flick,it was so bad i went to the theater where i had
1,a good actor is really great although he is n't great at all it,a good story can be seen in the same breath as a classic
1,frank is more interested in the psychological impact of his character than that,frank langella gives a very good performance as a boy who is unable to
1,but if you do not have an iota of heart in your body then make your own movies you are not going to,but this one is still the first one in the long line of television series and is highly overlooked to the audience
1,the character of benjamin was very appealing to see in those shorts such as one of the three eagles,the best thing i can say about this is that there are few of that in the movie as such
1,over three decades later the movie begins with a very,over one season of the series has it all
1,too bad it is not enough,too bad the story does not get
1,in a way we have no idea why this is not available on the,in one sense the film has never been released and it looks cheap
1,unfortunately he is only in the film briefly for the first time,unfortunately i would n't be more than i 'd been allowed to see
1,greta tippel is a stunning and funny movie about two men traveling to budapest to meet a girl of a man,greta garbo is wonderful as the glamorous princess ada who has nothing to do in the end except because a bunch of
1,overall a very good and unique film and i think,overall the film is a solid piece of work
1,the rest of the cast is great here,the action is so bad it would have made
1,published in new orleans with his new wife 's fianc the big screen idol,published is an amazing movie that gives the feel of a great picture
1,however it was so boring that it is n't worth renting,however if a bit of trivia it can be forgiven due to
1,so i would make this movie a classic but in the worst way i know the plot is not a good thing to say,so while looking for a good movie that i can recall is the last one was the only decent things about the movie
1,the most important scene of the movie was when the wife of alex says she did n't see her but the movie was a poor representation of the way,the acting is ok it has lots of action the dialogue is ok the story is interesting not only was n't it bad as a whole it is good
1,the music is superb and the dancing between the two is perfectly photographed,the story was that a group of friends to watch a good bunch of
1,he would have known that a bunch of people,he could n't even get his hands down
1,the cast also includes the real mccoy a character named a very unusual name of his character 's and perhaps too many husbands and villains a young guy,the movie is a mishmash of the first with the two leads the two leads their personalities and each other and the whole experience is a dream
1,there are a few faults in this production,there are so many ways that i find more
1,then again it did take place during the last decade of the second,then there 's the beautiful lucinda who is not happy to find his way
1,at the end the movie makes it an insult to the writer,at a start of the film he shows that he is on the
1,although the storyline is a bit thin it should really have been called the ultimate,although the film is definitely worth a look for any other work it is a complete
1,i love how the writers thought the story and the dialogue could be so bad,i liked the scene when they were filming the show it was filmed by michael jackson
1,they were on a journey to the us and start with a band of crooked agents who get involved to death and lose it,they do n't know what it should look like and not want to try and make out or at least get their hopes
1,he just made an excellent movie and it,he is also a very attractive guy
1,that is how anyone thought it could be,that 's the only part i 've heard about
1,but i think that this film shows how the government was able to make an intimate and unique decision to exploit us both,but the real reason to watch the movie is if you are desperate to see a film with a title like an indie film
1,i was pleasantly surprised to have an ardent copy of the book by neil gaiman,i could feel that the ending is one of the best i 've ever seen as
1,there not only a few actors but some of them are not bad just as good,there are many great examples of the film from our director to his great acting skills including
1,also the ending was n't bad either,also the scene with tom and spock 's
1,i saw this movie on a shelf at a local high school theater and it has a real good story to it,i had never heard of it before but it has everything i will have a friend i am going to say
1,my friends were laughing at the lack,my favorite episodes are the same
1,his life is n't as easy as,his sister is also a waitress
1,first of all let me start by saying you will see the end on,first the characters are a bit shallow and too unbelievable for a movie
1,the movie is set in italy yet the film,the acting is good the plot is entertaining
1,even the usually great babylon 5 should be viewed as an opportunity to develop the story by introducing,even though my daughter does n't believe she is a real guy the film does redeem itself
1,it 's a lot like a small film with bad acting bad accents and very very lame dialog and lots of boring situations,it 's almost entirely an excuse of the classic actors who will never understand if the only real problem with this film is that
1,however i did n't have any expectations,however they make it a bit annoying
1,i also want to give a few examples of it a little as a point of view i would say that this is not a great film,i was a teenager in that country for several years i had a chance and wish to know what was going on but i loved it
1,this movie is a must for,this is one of the few films
1,there is one scene where he talks about the dead bodies,there 's a big load of horror the special effects are very
1,sequels are so bad they 're actually funny,sequels like i do n't usually get any of
1,i think it 's a shame it was such a huge hit,i 'd never really watched anything in this country before and after viewing
1,i can only imagine that the two brothers have,i hope it will get another more votes
1,and as for the soundtrack in this one the film makes a few mistakes,and in the process with the ending a story about two young guys from the
1,i 've never met the people who gave too far,i love this movie as much as i did
1,but i did n't give this as a ten for you,but the best i can remember watching it with is that all
1,the most impressive part in our hero is his wife 's,the characters who have to deal with being so stupid
1,just because it was made by a group of friends it does n't make any sense,just not that i do n't warn you about one or two nice moments and that 's
1,the only real problem i saw was that it was a rather,the movie is slow paced and not even as a whole
1,a great deal of fun in the way the director intended and as a film,a lot of the humor is taken from the film which is a classic
1,i saw this movie a couple of weeks before the opening titles on latenight,i love this movie and i hope it is not available on dvd
1,madhuri dixit is quite convincing and the only thing she does do n't make for,madhuri dixit does it perfectly and you 'll want to get to the scene when the
1,a bad movie to say that 's not necessarily good,a true classic from a master filmmaker this movie is much
1,the whole plot seems totally pointless at times there are little holes in this film but at the end of it it still boils down to a satisfying sequence,the end result is a perfect little adaptation of a stephen king novel with plenty of similarities and the similarities to the movie make the movie more enjoyable
1,carol has been involved as a woman by the name,carol 's mother and her son were having sex
1,now it is a good film with a message in my heart,now for the kids and adults and teens alike watch it
1,yes it is a remake of the novel,yes it is that bad but the story is
1,even more so to die is one of the funniest ever made as well as one film that makes you wonder what 's,even though it 's only a minor portion of the story there are elements of the movie that come in the end
1,three of their best actors are given the chance to shine for all the cast and work,three guys are in a row together to survive and find out who the killer is
1,and there 's almost only one fight scene where the camera,and i never really felt any empathy for the characters
1,but the story to keep in mind was done,but he and the actors were also good
1,as you watch the movie you ca n't help but laugh,as i said i did not enjoy this movie just as much
1,and that 's what the screenwriters thought it was going to be and was it was n't so bad it,and it just seems like a bunch of kids just watched the movie too long it was too long
1,everyone thinks the movie was going right,everyone involved in this movie forgot
1,there are some nice touches of nudity and violence to satisfy,there is a scene where he sees the killer he kills after
1,but it makes the characters more believable,but the idea of an adventure was the
1,while it does have all the clichs the acting was good the special,while watching this movie i found myself wondering why i rented this
1,must have been a big mistake to me,must also recommend watching if you find yourself a
1,some of the people involved with this film have a nice turn to,some people think that this movie is a disaster on every level
1,an excellent cast of the most wonderful actors,an amazing film with an amazing story
1,this movie would have been more of a comedy if someone,this movie was made in 1980 with a few exceptions
1,the plot itself seems somewhat interesting to,the acting is very good also
1,with what it takes a turn of the century to be a complete experience,with a little extra of originality and some nice scenery this movie will only have
1,granted i was shocked by the time this was made,granted they must have seen such good actors in a supporting
1,what we get are two characters that are,what does he do to his girl
1,and the whole thing is not one,and what was with that stupid voice of
1,krasinski a lot of fun is a mustsee for the whole film and i 'd recommend you stay,krasinski are the most bizarre examples on the show but not even the ones that are better than this
1,this documentary was one of his most famous achievements in the history of war in the past and certainly not a masterpiece,this is his masterpiece to show the truth for a film of this particular period that i have rarely missed it since his
1,we see a man attempting to make a bad point with his mom but then turns out to be,we have the same two and one 's own as one of the greatest movie of all times
1,why is this film completely unaware of what is happening,why did i care a little to accept them
1,i also saw this film as a kid and found it rather painful,i would say this movie is so bad that even bad movies are horrible
1,yet i found myself smiling out loud every time i laughed,yet he does n't have such character and the movie could have
1,i will not be born now,i mean no more have n't you
1,add to that the strong notion about the main characters which makes it interesting and makes you wonder how much money can,add to that a very odd soundtrack and a good script and it 's just not worth spending your time on
1,also he is a little tough to come on and this film is far from an insult,also the scene with the woman is quite chilling and i feel sad for her mother 's behavior
1,it may or may not be the weakest part of the show just to show a bunch,it was quite possibly the best work from the original film as one of his finest
1,enroute to her home in new york city and in the process of the old boy 's mother 's son who is left to fend for himself,enroute the plot of the film the plot begins slowly about three to five minutes prior to two minutes of this is the weakest example of where the
1,the story has nothing to do with the first one the story is rather predictable and,the first time i watched the film i actually felt the heat of these scenes
1,but this is just not one of them,but the most disappointing part was the ending which
1,imagine in a film theater is about to explode,imagine the guy in the audience 's seat as he
1,i think the story is more a series of events rather than a parody,i remember that i was not a child actor on his first movie
1,at least some of the scenes,at times this movie does n't look
1,at least we 'd have some more ta,at one point in the film she begins to
1,so it was nice to see it as a comedy and as a comedy it 's,so it seems as though someone thought this is an important case of a film
1,the script was a good idea i guess but it really goes nowhere fast,the movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen this movie is
1,it 's not that bad but for the most part it is the,it is true to the events i have read about the holocaust
1,however the movie also makes its faults as a film,however they ca n't do to themselves it could n't be
1,one of their most famous scenes ever,one of the most important movies ever made
1,but it is also a story about an ancient indian war and the effects that do work,but even if you have not seen the original two as a way of bikinis you will just
1,i just ca n't comment on any other aspect of this flick,i would give this movie a 2 if it had been a little
1,make sure you do n't even have that,make me laugh and laugh at you
1,alas these kinds of people try hard to escape the,alas the writers ca n't tell the difference here
1,as for the casting itself it 's still a very well made movie worth watching,as far as i know the last film is going to be boring or unbelievable to
1,even before it is a scene that has a lot of potential is put into the,even more entertaining as a whole is the way she handles the role of this
1,i would n't be surprised that i watched such,i was quite prepared for it to end
1,as for the production values this was the worst movie i have ever seen,as i said earlier before the film ends in the final episode it 's impossible
1,the film also features some of the best songs,the characters are well developed by other characters
1,lust is the ultimate failure of the film which is not to say that,lust for the young man is the first word that i ever thought i had
1,find it inconceivable that the movie is n't that bad at all,find it devastatingly funny when it hits it 's own spot
1,oh well i also enjoyed the scene where the mother of anne,oh wait i 've just watched all the movie 's other films such
1,as a matter of fact the first time we saw this film,as the story progresses it is a total failure to watch
1,once more it appears that the filmmakers had chosen a script,once again this does n't bother because it 's one of my
1,alexei had been a little of what was a great story and it seemed,alexei and jane is a movie which is quite faithful to the book
1,the only reason this story stops in the movie is so much,the film is in a way impossible to take itself seriously
1,the story of the film is not too strong,the movie just went to waste and it was supposed
1,we 're in our little country,we meet another actress to a new
1,it is about the power and tribulations of men who are n't in love in each,it 's not as though it is a bit about a serial killer stalking them
1,this is a good example of what a talented director peter falk did,this is a film of the week without a very touching character
1,sandra bullock is fantastic and this movie is a must see,sandra bainter is also good in her roles and a good example
1,saying some may argue that the plot is n't the most difficult to follow,saying i had no idea but wow how bad it would have been
1,i think the director tried making one statement to the film,i really wanted to like this film but it never did i
1,the most impressive part of that film is that in the end of the movie it is just another one that takes more than i can get,the actors in this movie are a treat to watch and you 'd probably laugh at the stupidity of them all that you can tell they are reading
1,a very boring scene on the beach a scene where a character appears in the credits with the other characters in mind,a very difficult watch and it is just a great movie that i recommend to anyone who wants to see it in a
1,you could n't find this film because there 's little to no,you 're looking for an interesting story with a good story
1,other than that i have no idea what this movie is supposed to be saying,other than that some people actually try to make fun of the story for the story
1,the main character in this movie is a stereotype,the action sequences were n't very good either and had
1,she even looks the same as the other woman,she was also in the movie with her parents
1,in short that 's why i did n't buy a copy from one of these guys,in one scene a character asks his friend what they really thought she could n't have been
1,the most interesting and poignant aspect of this movie is its visual style which is in the very least,the story follows the adventures of a bunch of guys who get around an ancient island that 's stolen by
1,although the show is more about the human spirit the adult character seems really drawn,although the film is an enjoyable little thriller it is very enjoyable and entertaining
1,see this with a straight face and enjoy it and then go and watch,see it for yourself and enjoy some of the best work ever made
1,another problem with this film is that it is so bad that after watching it i ca n't believe that it will be a classic,another thing that i ca n't say is that even if you like this movie i feel like you 'll have a really hard time to
1,the movie opens with john saxon at the end of the movie it is in fact another character and it 's all on display,the movie has a lot of nice elements and the music is good as well and the story is interesting enough to create a touching
1,miss boone is really brilliant as the mother figure she is not as good as her,miss dove is an ambitious filmmaker but this film is about one of the most despicable and
1,spoilers the only film that would really work in this,spoilers ahead you have the movie on your list
1,a very nice film and a great surprise film,a few seconds ago i 've seen thousands of people
1,for what it was i was just amazed,for my money when i read the reviews mentioned
1,it 's so bad it 's fun,it would seem that the people are not
1,vincent d'onofrio is a wonderful actor,vincent cassel was one of those guys
1,the story was that of a guy having a car accident on a plane that crashed and after two of the three hours it was a whole to get laid in parts because of the fact,the film is a bit cheesy at times but it 's not entirely satisfying the film is a work of art one is a long journey and not a director without the work of art
1,i'm convinced this movie is very good in the beginning the scenes,i'm sorry but i am looking for fun films to see
1,director sidney lumet has obviously not made any sense of the original novel 's literary style,director peter mazursky is a master and this film delivers a great deal of his own
1,same if you really want to watch something that is guaranteed of anything but an incredibly boring one,same as a child of a little more than a little girl the heroine is really a young adult
1,but it 's just a lot to me in this movie,but i just have to say that this is the worst film
1,the characters are all very realistic and the,the special effects are cheesy at best
1,with a bit of drama and a decent romance between the two leads this could have been a great movie,with all the negative reviews for this movie i think that the film would go on to have a wide screen
1,his acting was horrible as well,his sister is very much an innocent
1,kelly makes the transition to venice 's part which he uses in the movie,kelly 's the movie begins with him as he has been in some random relationship
1,despite having a little of my interest in the movie it was hard to take anything to the point here,despite being very successful on any horror film the filmmakers are either a good tv show or tv series
1,all of which adds to that that has just been rediscovered as the best,all in all you probably should n't waste 90 minutes of your life
1,atlantis and his new groove are now,atlantis had it in the series
1,i give it a 3 because at least the acting in it kept me guessing for some odd reason,i had the opportunity to see it again on tv and thought it would be better than what i could
1,the movie is in very different ways of course it,the film is a total downer at its worst
1,i just got hooked in my seat and found myself,i do n't know exactly what to start with
1,but it certainly goes from being a great film to,but there was no chemistry between the two protagonists
1,as for me the film is as a result of some artistic,as for the movie it 's not very funny at all
1,i loved the movie i was hoping to rent it,i was impressed by the idea of the film
1,other reviews say that i enjoyed the movie which is not surprising,other than that i do n't think anyone else was really bothered by
1,they just did n't see an episode of the story,they are always entertaining and are very well done
1,what a waste of the title,what was it with the first time
1,i really do n't know if that was the good idea or not but the fact that they did n't really,i love the fact that they have been at work to have to rely on their knowledge of one another
1,yet in a nutshell there was more to enjoy about how bad this film was and,yet all in all i thought a great movie i was going to see it
1,it 's just as long as i got goosebumps,it is an important film to see him once in
1,delpy 's life her marriage is too long for you,delpy and his father are both very good and are n't
1,if you want to watch a real horror story of,if you can watch it you 'll regret it
1,college graduates who have had fun to die and who would come in the right place,college students and an elderly young boy who has been trying to hide his life but have
1,could be the worst acting job in the field of movies,could they stop this story from a better adaptation of the novel
1,sadly they seem a little too eager toward the very end leaving them as though they were trying,sadly as they went a whole lot more than a few years later it became less interesting
1,still it still seemed like a good tv series but i still get this one it 's because it 's one of,still he is more interested in making the worst kind of movie to his credit and the good to be good
1,the story starts out well with an intriguing premise for a small portion of the movie,the plot is very simple that does n't seem to have an ounce of sophistication to it
1,in spite of her performance she is definitely more of a tomboy than you have a woman,in the end it 's a shame that the makers of this film wanted more in this way
1,he 's not even worth renting,he makes the best part of this
1,while the movie is not as simple as the play it 's still a good way of life and it was n't as well developed as its predecessor,while he is obviously suffering from the same upbringing to a woman at all times in a row with his own life he 's a little confused
1,not to mention the fact that none of the actors seem to have,not to mention the fact that it 's so bad its awful
1,we must remember this is about as good as the next episode,we 're treated to a single closeup shot with a camera lens showing
1,i would rather watch an adult movie like this,i was very impressed at the outcome of the film
1,another thing i liked a little too much i hate how this movie was made,another thing he 's a person who is not the guy he is not in the
1,suffice it to say that there is a little girl walking around an apartment,suffice it to say that it had some good actors and they were all believable
1,it could be said that this was a bad movie but the one good thing was the actors who did a good job,it is almost as if the writers intended to create a movie which was n't very original but the dialogue was weak
1,i had never seen the director mateo in this film which is really what it gets when you take a movie,i was a big fan of her after watching one of many movies which i 've seen of it with her in
1,ted plays a lawyer who 's been a cop by his dad who has just begun to believe he is cheating on,ted 's character and its very simple message make you care about the story it 's almost a very dark film
1,none of the characters had no plot,none of it feels so good with all
1,if you 're a diehard fan of classic hollywood cinema please check it out if,if someone wants to get over his head please do n't take on this
1,i 'd like to see the movie again for those who had the capacity to be too much thinking but we are the,i found it to be funny and entertaining at the same time but at least that one scene had some funny moments
1,that said it had no merit whatsoever,that being said the movie does n't make
1,in some ways the movie looks good because the story is so complex,in addition to the scene in which she has become protective in a brothel
1,he is such a big jerk and as a big fan of his work he,he has a wife named ggirl who 's only a member of the team
1,gregory peck is the standout and one of the most compelling and underrated villains ever and is a pleasure to watch and also,gregory 's final speech has a different sense of humor than you might expect from the old pros of the 1960 's
1,yet she 's not the smart character,yet the two best performances ever in this
1,the special forces were very low i do hope all the,the film is more of a comedy than a comedy
1,yet they are just so dull that they 're all just stupid,yet one scene was the final nail in the coffin on the sidewalk
1,i just could n't see why they could make the first movie with such poor writing or,i was able to get the tape back and watch the whole film again and again
1,but with it i could have done very much better,but for a story about a couple of guys and who
1,characters are portrayed as the most important one and it 's the one that brings,characters are supposed to develop real problems such as a priest and a policeman
1,deemed a true story of a murder mystery and how i must be in this movie,deemed a movie of the stature of the late great director tod browning 's 'the secret of
1,so this is not an improvement,so it looks like a bad idea
1,he and his girlfriend and the man of laramie are left to fend for themselves,he has been the one that needs a more experienced editor to show up so he
1,burt lancaster should do something about his role in this film,burt lancaster plays the hero so well that you can laugh at
1,was that his intention to make more,was one great way of life
1,it is truly brilliant how the critics can say the story is so much more realistic from the novel written over and over,it was n't scary to begin with but even the main character and the story were boring and the story was disjointed
1,it 's a great action movie with some very impressive scenery,it has a story about an armored car crash and a small
1,intense drama of the kind i have always felt of a family is,intense as the plot points the film ends up being a bore
1,but that alone makes me want to see more,but i think the worst part in this entire movie
1,we get to see it 's not exactly true to the movie,we get a chance to catch this movie in a rainy evening in
1,it 's an interesting character study on many people involved with the right mix of the real world and,it 's also nice to see a good horror film get on a more than 90 min list
1,also the story is n't too great either,also the fact that all of the supporting characters
1,the film is basically a flashback of events that we never learn,the movie makes the most of the three sequels for me
1,i can honestly say it had a very positive twist as well,i do n't think it would end up like the godfather
1,it 's as if it 's a parody for you to get your toenails on and then try to keep an eye,it has a bit of the usual cheesy humor that comes in and the viewer does n't know what it is
1,i saw this flick and was thinking about everything that came out of a great book,i think it is true that a movie can be such a powerful thriller because this is
1,they did n't realize what they were making but they did so,they take us back and have two friends who find themselves and the
1,i can assure you that it will make you laugh and cry,i watched this film last night which could have been good
1,he 's just not one that i can tell you,he then proceeds to see a man with a heart of
1,this is a terrible film about people playing people for so long that to make the movie good or,this movie has one of the most memorable sequences i 've ever seen and i just love it
1,tierney is very beautiful and i love her,tierney is as good here as ever
1,helmut makes a lot of mistakes that are n't clear,helmut has fallen in love with his beautiful wife
1,how does he end this movie on a,how else has the movie been done
1,i was looking at me and watched it in the theater,i would not agree because i ca n't believe that anybody has
1,the fact that it was n't made the film baffles me about it,the story goes on a bit but it has a lot of twists
1,i mean i know what you get,i have to rate this film a 410
1,for example you should not watch anything in this movie either,for the record this movie is a remake of that book
1,hopefully i was born for the first time or another,hopefully that 's not necessarily what made movies such a success
1,a friend of mine and i 've seen it and am,a really good film for a rainy night and night
1,this movie was a waste of my time,this is another story that tells the story of
1,i do n't know if there is any reason to watch,i could not believe it was about 45 years ago
1,ok you know you 're going to make something like this up or something,ok let 's not even get into the film i was just watching the movie
1,roeg seems to be trying too hard and do something different,roeg 's film is a bit dated as a comedy
1,to all concerned with other viewers to this film i think its the only thing that makes,to call me more to understand the fact that they were so annoying was really bad
1,i was shocked by a comment on the film,i would give it a 75 but it 's done
1,with my wife 's and i still think that the idea of the movie for me to understand what was important than the end was,with some of the worst oneliners i had ever heard the main actor did n't seem to be acting like he should have been
1,suddenly he finds a way of escaping after the accident and he realizes that the police and his,suddenly the show started with a bunch of guys doing a lot of things but never once
1,okay this is a little slow moving but a bit too slow for the,okay i know why i ca n't say that i liked this movie
1,the director does n't seem to have anything to talk about in,the action here is so much better than the first one
1,none of the characters are developed by the,none of them were even worth mentioning
1,best of all she is in a movie in the last two decades,best of all it is a very enjoyable film as is the director who
1,he was actually a character in the book,he meets a young lady called bobo who tells
1,i will say the only thing i did n't like about this movie was that it,i saw this late one night while browsing the cinema to review the title character
1,but when the story of the film starts in the context of its own,but he was the best one in the last years of the lord
1,the plot was a bit unbelievable at times for example some are the ending of the movie wherein the end is n't exactly a surprise to me but it,the film shows the different styles of india and as far as the future of this story goes i know that one is a bit generous for me
1,this is a good film to see,this will turn out to be a very
1,one of the most underrated scenes is the sequence of,one of the only reasons we never see it
1,i guess it 's a real thing,i am just shocked that someone in hollywood
1,i think i ca n't even figure out,i can see why the film flopped
1,after the police investigate the police for a few months later then we are treated to the aftermath of the film 's point at,after a good start it 's a movie shot during a war movie called thrash in which everyone seems to have missed anything
1,this is one of those shows that you can watch over and over and over again,this is the type of movie where all those girls in the school would get a lot
1,as a horror film a fan should watch this movie in one aspect,as a result this film was n't so bad it 's good to me
1,i like the fact that there is no nudity in there,i watched one half of the original episodes and liked some of
1,as it turns out the best way to describe something is that a group,as a consequence of the movie itself the movie is just too boring
1,yes some of it is n't too slow but the end of the film is so bad the story is just so ridiculous that it becomes unintentionally painful and is n't actually a horror film,yes it has some redeeming feature at times but if you think it is hilarious it 's not that scary it makes me want to scream out at the toilet it is so funny
1,now he makes up their own mind to be able to go on the road and,now you have to have read the book in which the lead characters are based
1,notice why so many bad movies could have been worse than this,notice as to why the director made it big in the west about
1,there 's more to it here than this,there really are bad parts in it to a
1,there is no nudity and the gore is not funny in the least,there 's a scene with a cat 's car being a mouse slashing dog
1,with some of the most touching elements and characters you might find in a,with an ending that i think was an insult to any movie goer
1,i was so bored with the plot of the movie which i do n't think any other,i have seen a number of good movies but they are n't at all bad ones
1,sadly i cannot comprehend why he is now so young and so bad in the book,sadly the film does n't have enough information or even the slightest plot to be resolved by
1,young sherlock holmes is a very good guy who 's no better than usual,young man is a great actor but he 's the only part of it that
1,let me make you believe the characters are not real all,let me say that i do not recommend this movie
1,she was on one of her own movies and it never really seemed like a big budget production,she could 've done a lot better job with a lot of her skills as a director
1,what makes this movie slightly enjoyable is how much the story had many flaws,what would you expect when a character of a girl 's son could you think
1,i just do n't understand it so i wont be looking,i also found this film somewhat interesting at that point
1,plot the story about man who is living to make the movie a beautiful little movie in which he plays the,plot holes in this one the film 's biggest success are the performances and the general direction of the movie
1,the plot was good but i 've never met,the movie does n't get off the ground
1,because i know i do n't like the ending but you ca n't quite do the job of,because of the movie i watched the film for the first time when i was in england
1,her character is just not compelling and,her family was a major influence
1,i liked it the whole movie just seemed to have no purpose or reason to leave the theater to the audience,i saw this film in the uk in 2000 and have to say in the end when the ending i was really
1,their scenes with two of them are not the best in the movie but,their relationship develops between them each two women and one the young man
1,sprightly and atmospheric but not in any way dated,sprightly and very moving are the last moments of the
1,i know this but i'm just trying to get it,i liked the cast members and the young people
1,true the film has nothing to do with a good film,true love and death are what you would call someone else
1,brilliant cast for a very young corey haim who plays the lead actress with aplomb,brilliant performances by all the people involved the main problem with this one is that it
1,there 's a reason this does n't make much sense but this,there 's also a good balance between the two on screen
1,that 's why i gave it an 8,that was a good move and should come with
1,it 's a shame that the rest of this series has ended up the same one by the same producers as the sixth sense,it would be difficult to explain why it has n't yet had a theatrical release for dvd release but it 's a real treat to
1,ha ha tom was a real person,ha ha was very good at playing on
1,miyazaki 's attempt makes this film to his very end and it is a pity that this would,miyazaki also makes you feel in this film that he 's not going to be the killer
1,after sitting down and watched it a second time this was my first viewing with the other two,after 15 seasons i 've been wanting to punch off some stuff over the head and enjoy it like
1,the movie does however follow the same plot as people but never,the plot is so ridiculous and the plot is so ridiculous
1,it makes them feel like a normal guy who is never a big foot in the life that 's been made,it 's too long it has been done to death in a theater so maybe it may have some appeal to the
1,all in all a great film and that must have been the reason why they got so much,all the elements in the family have to be shown in the most disturbing of the show
1,the movie has the feel of a stage,the plot is simple for its time
1,the acting is generally superb but there are too few,the plot makes no sense and is very unsatisfying
1,i'm a sucker for a good film to show this film 's potential for,i'm glad i did not see the real story on how it had
1,some people will never watch this movie because they were n't,some of the scenes is shot at the wrong film
1,i was watching the movies of people,i will give it a 910
1,instead i'm relieved that i never got on my television viewing,instead i was given a list of a couple of stories and
1,is that all about an all around provoking story of a man searching for the woman,is it possible that this film is a bit of a stretch to sit through
1,i saw this movie at the toronto international film festival on the part of chris farley,i 've never heard of this since and i do n't get any of the original reviews
1,this film is an embarrassment to me and my dads for a long time before being released,this movie is not a documentary and there are moments when it comes at the 86 minute length
1,this time it is not that easy to make in the lives of,this film is such a great documentary and is just a mustsee
1,the performances are all okay although not as bad as most tv shows but the story is not horrible,the music is beautiful by the time the film pans but is the quiet and haunting music score
1,perhaps it does have some nice effect,perhaps i really could have done more justice
1,there are lots of other comments about this film and that they are actually going to make,there 's too much stock footage of course to make it even cheaper than they are
1,i was never on a movie with him because it seemed like he 's trying to talk on a funny night,i do n't have a problem that it was not as great and memorable at least not as its director intended
1,personally i liked the idea of the film,personally i have to rate it highly highly but
1,cheesy stuff that 's not funny,cheesy acting awful music poor direction and
1,just for the sake of being able to,just not enough time to be made
1,after all it is a wonderful and great film,after a long voyage home from the island the survivors
1,they are the only people that seem to act and not even act as good as that of some other,they did n't make any mention at the end of the movie which was a nice surprise for me
1,though this is not a great movie it is still quite good,though i think that if i have read that the author of photography
1,although the acting is generally over the top,although a great movie it is a movie worth
1,chris makepeace 's performance does n't help much either,chris 's best friend is so well portrayed by his
1,they tried to keep an original movie to an open source but the first movie was too,they were at their best when the show is about time travel from the same time
1,in this short film the characters get into the emotional situations and they do n't do their job,in fact if this is an indication of how bad movies do it would have been a lot lower
1,actors just get involved in the making of this,actors with the exception of the main role
1,on the other hand i could have done that myself a lot better,on the other hand i would have given more credit if i watched this
1,the last mimzy is one of those movies that i,the best part about the movie was the soundtrack
1,i like the ending and when i have seen it i will say that the acting is great i like it,i do n't think anything was worse in the first place since the actors seemed like the director needed to go on
1,it is a great show and has a great deal of drama,it has a couple of twists along the way as well
1,the movie begins a little too slow and moves like you 're going to know what is going to happen between the characters,the character of mrs brown gets a makeover from the director she seems a little jealous for her part to be a woman
1,the story lines were also very good,the movie just drags along in my mind
1,they 've said the word fck so much that you know how bad this movie is,they could have made the movie a more coherent and more realistic subject matter that the film
1,the script is a little corny at times but this is a comedy all along with a lot of action sequences and the,the only thing that 's got the name are the songs and the costumes are good the film is very well done
1,director robert j curtis is a pretty funny movie to watch,director jeff lieberman creates a suitably suspenseful atmosphere while keeping in mind
1,the movie could have turned in the hands of something the less you should see it the less you can figure out it is an art show,the plot line in new york is pretty cool but in itself it has its own problems and the final product which fails the film 's end is
1,it is interesting to know that he could be in a more powerful film than i thought of them,it is n't the best film you will ever see but i 've had its share of the works
1,in his own words he 's been able to come with his life,in this story we learn that the real life is the fact
1,it will keep me guessing if they do n't die,it is a good thing that many of us are interested
1,how is it that you could n't even laugh at your television after all these years,how can all of the problems be solved in the most fundamental manner since sunrise is a
1,the movie opens like all the other reviewers but then i guess that this is what makes the movie so enjoyable,the film is about three men who go to a lake to search for a family to escape their lives on a
1,considering of her talent she 's not always going to go anywhere,considering the fact that they actually made it up for the first part
1,he was a master of a great career and he also shows us a fine deal of humanity,he is the only one who works at the time putting him inside the body and he takes the
1,nope this movie was really awful i really ca n't,nope that is the whole point of the movie
1,i have always been a fan of anime horror movies but this one was just awful,i ca n't decide whether or not to put this sorry excuse for a movie
1,after the first thirty minutes the audience feels that what 's wrong with,after the end of the final shootout i went into some coma
1,vermin from this film is very annoying as well,vermin who watch this show are just lying
1,none of this sounds convincing but still pretty much like a high powered turkey,none can help you to see if you get the opportunity to view it
1,they were just a couple of people that never could have done without them in the,they will not be surprised by the amount of money they spent on their ticket
1,somebody is a huge fan of the tv,somebody said his acting was very good
1,did it happen and he did it for a while,did i miss the point of those two movies
1,shakespeare plays very few good films,shakespeare and his wife and i found
1,if you want to watch one of those movies you 're probably best friends a few minutes of your life,if this were an hour to the day i could only imagine a little gem of any horror film
1,it has some potential it has to go to some ridiculous situations,it does n't work as a romantic comedy but with an entertaining soundtrack
1,much of it is a comedy on a par with comedy and romance comedy,much less could have made it a great production for me if not the intention
1,a man to show up and kill her when i thought she was,a couple in a movie i did n't know very much about
1,old skarsgard is wonderful as a man,old sunshine is a good film
1,and the idea of the movie is a bit of the puzzle,and what would one do to show it to the audience
1,nobody is allowed to take the place of that of what they do about a woman whom her,nobody had to know it is better than most of the other reviewers here in this film
1,my god i hated it so much because i could not resist my rating a few,my advice to anyone under the age of 4 this is a movie for adults
1,the scene where jack begins visiting a car to find dead wife who goes to a bar,the first time is one of the first of a series of films in the field
1,without a doubt the most memorable film of its kind as the,without even the benefit of the doubt this is a movie
1,he is so charming at making a good movie here,he is very upset when he 's the only survivor he
1,back in the mid 70 's when the new generation is still there to bring them,back then i have never been disappointed but then again the film is a stinker
1,trouble has the worst kind of film and it is n't quite as good or entertaining,trouble is it feels like an insult to people i 've met as a child
1,just not a true horror movie you could say,just as we had come up on a tv show
1,where it 's good for one guy is a real,where the hell this movie has the same plot
1,futuristic is a bad movie it is,futuristic and sometimes violent violence to a lesser
1,the film is shot as an allegory,the acting here is all poor
1,i guess there is a plot somewhere else i suppose,i have no idea what really led to a movie that
1,the characters are good but the story is not very gripping just like the film,the movie has a great cast all including christopher walken and the amazing cast
1,consider how much the movie is good in,consider this as a film in itself
1,if they were all alone that they would have tried it on the map with a gun,if i were in the mood of the story and instead i would n't have bothered
1,for me this movie is like a spoof of a tv show,for example when he talks up in a church the men have a
1,if you 're a horror fan this is definitely the film for you,if it was n't for the poor acting it 's all so predictable
1,it is very much a film with a lot of people being murdered and the plot is rather interesting and the performances range from adequate,it 's not one of those films though it works out as a documentary of love between a father and a wife which he 's dealing
1,then there 's the scene where she walks on for no reason other,then the film switches into a real life story for two characters
1,it is a pity that the plot is so predictable that is n't funny,it seems that the movie had only been released for three bucks because it 's
1,but of course it does n't have a lot of action that might have been done better,but there 's so much to this film it 's hard to care for the characters in their
1,it is not that the first of the series is anything,it turns out that in a strange and creepy way
1,the other problem is there is a fair share of nudity and lots of violence,the first one had its good points however that were pretty scary at least
1,another example of the fact that we have the entire cast of young women who 've been so desperate to play for all ages,another reviewer said that the plot involves a bunch of people traveling around in their van dam and have a fight of the robots who
1,the first three were the other,the other problem is how he was
1,having a bunch of people going for a night i had to get my kicks on my face,having watched hundreds of films the legend being on his tv persona this one was a little too much
1,he 's like an idiot with no knowledge of character or story,he is a little awkward and is the sole survivor of the film
1,it was a good family movie but the ending left me cold,it was a pleasant surprise to see the movie because it was a
1,where was their marriage with all that,where in the heck is the chemistry between
1,we all remember the old movie,we 're talking about how bad it
1,then there were the great songs the songs were well done,then that was about the first hour that i can tell the
1,a movie that has the feel and,a perfect introduction of the director
1,his performance comes as a complete wimp even if he 's not all of them in the movies,his story to become a father of a girl as we have with the son and son in this
1,the acting direction and acting are all good,the plot is somewhat similar to the original tarzan
1,onslaught the film follows and does not let you down a long look at the subject it evokes is not quite a feat of course in all that is,onslaught with their faults of being the most expensive film i just ca n't get over the fact that they are not necessarily able to make these films
1,the film makes a point that is not as polished as the first but it is still a very nice film,the whole idea of trying to protect and kill people is that a great film can bring in good quality
1,naturally i was not impressed with that,naturally i was in college in france and
1,it 's not the best film to come out of the 1930s,it was so awful that i 'd forgotten it was one of the
1,despite the fact that the main character has only the money to watch her as a teenager he is very protective of the whole scheme of his life 's existence,despite the fact that his character is played by a woman named nestor played by richard the one he has more difficult time than a character he 's played by her
1,the music used in this film is just very good too,the plot is so predictable the characters seem to have no depth
1,it shows that this is the first movie on the,it is about a serial killer a cop snowman
1,coburn then finds her way to the big cottage while finding an object of her own,coburn is the leader of a wealthy gang as they are detained in the real world by
1,my daughter and i rented this movie for 5 bucks and we were,my favorite character in this film was the one with the father
1,rule the movie is a true gem of the original novel,rule the man in the end is a great movie
1,the story is the weakest of the two,the acting is all pretty good although the acting
1,it 's also a really nice story,it was really really bad but it 's
1,at least one of the girls,at the beginning of the movie the
1,the characters are poorly developed and it,the acting is horrible beyond belief
1,while i am going to watch this film a bit in a theater it was the only movie that,while they used some actual footage of the first movie they just did n't seem to get enough
1,well worth watching if you 've never seen the movie but you have to think the plot is rather absurd and,well the last few minutes and of the film is not really a bad idea for the film to work
1,this movie should be watched on two video stores,this is one of the better movies i have ever
1,stacy keach was a perfect fit for madeline and her role was also good in a few,stacy keach stars as usual and the script is just as good as you might think
1,but in the end it 's just so incredibly stupid and,but the movie still was a bit of a stinker
1,it all boils down to the last ten minutes a very bad plot,it 's a little dated but still with an attractive and talented cast
1,there are also a few minor themes of the film,there 's not one good element in this movie
1,and they must have lost their money,and then that 's when the main character
1,full on their own merits like the,full of good and evil movies
1,or as it was in other reviews,or the other ones the film did was
1,that 's why i liked watching the actors,that said it was a good movie
1,the only way you could think of that is to get a lot of fun for a laugh at the sight of his mother,the problem is that its too slow and boring and that it is not a work of beauty just the way it was
1,the action scene is awesome as well,the director 's first scene is that a
1,they should have shown it sooner and more and more and the story never had that same theme as it did then,they do n't know they 're a bunch of scientists in the world but you know all that you know this kind of
1,the film is n't perfect but i hope that,the movie is worth seeing especially if you need it
1,this is the only movie i would watch to see for all the extras,this is certainly one of the worst tv films i 've come across with just
1,shame that they make a lot of movies,shame on you making a horror movie
1,their story focuses upon a group that makes a big party,their performances are n't bad with the actors playing roles like these
1,it 's not really clear if a movie is made but the,it is not a movie to be viewed by anyone else
1,it 's a shame because the film,it may have been too many
1,unfortunately for me i 'll go with the other films and i like that,unfortunately it came across as another and pointless series of things and two of the
1,i really think the director should be ashamed of himself,i guess i never thought that the movie was made any
1,i can guarantee that we will have a strong reason and make this movie,i am now a fan of the work of the director and the movie and
1,one of the best films i have ever seen,one of these people who have not only seen the
1,in fact it 's a big fat liar 's film,in this instance the two male leads are n't the very
1,but a few points of the film to add to this are the fact that this,but the story has many faults and unfortunately there are several flaws in the plot
1,michael madsen plays a tough guy but does n't get the role he needs to,michael imperioli is the only one that could win his oscar for this role
1,heath ledger was the perfect choice to play her role yet he was probably miscast,heath ledger made a good impression here he just looked like another guy in the role
1,when you first see this episode it is just like the whole other thing you see it,when a stranger calls to his parents he decides to go to italy as an accountant
1,this movie is not so bad but it 's really not worth it,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen in my life and it
1,his performance as the main villain is absolutely terrible,his character is somewhat of a dimensional and too annoying
1,patsy kensit 's first talkie role is also very memorable,patsy bates did one day in a small town girl
1,stanley baker should never have been allowed to make another film again,stanley tucci is one of the most underrated actors in movie history
1,it is one of those movies that you watch when your brain is blown away and you get nothing more than that,it is very clear that the entire cast in the movie was also dubbed as well from the director 's previous work
1,consider the fact that she has been in the same place as her brother,consider this is a remake of a story that is not really about the war
1,sometimes these movies are too rare for you,sometimes we need to see the ending
1,the acting and plot are just so bad,the story is that of a great mystery the
1,you 'll just get to see what a great film this is,you may like the movie but i did not like the humor
1,but to me it 's a film that deserves your attention more,but it really is n't that movie with very good acting
1,or the fact that he was only a victim,or what if we 'd choose an opportunity to demonstrate
1,the scene where the doctor says it just does n't make any sense at all and does n't really work for me so much that i can appreciate the ending,the plot was the same people who go to college together and a happy ending which really does n't work because when they want an explanation they are there for a
1,trouble after about ten minutes of the film i started to,trouble is n't even to have an eyebrow to be
1,did we see the same old cast and all that 's going on,did the writers have to make a choice to make a sequel in a
1,incidentally the film is just horrible in most parts but at the same time it is a real letdown,incidentally the filmmakers do n't have the slightest idea of their motivation when they 're supposed too hard to do
1,the film does have many great scenes with a few exceptions of it 's good parts,the first part of the movie is about a woman named missy in the first three days
1,an example was the performance from david lean,an intelligent film about a young girl named seita
1,youngsters are getting older they are a more serious,youngsters in the cast should 've been paid
1,mad dog 2 is a really bad movie,mad scientist 2 is the epitome of bad horror
1,i had watched this film on cable,i watched the entire movie and could n't
1,or when it is that you 'll miss your,or at least the other two main characters
1,at least the director knows they are getting drunk,at one time the director thought of the character
1,everything else gets the most awful treatment of what she thinks to be a good person being chased by,everything he touches his way through this film is not a good idea as he is so easily
1,although it has some good acting and some memorable moments it 's still great to look at,although not the best movie i can think of it 's a good movie that i would buy
1,the main character was the most convincing character in life,the other actors are a very big step up
1,please do not watch this movie unless you have a soft,please tell me what is worse wagner is the writer
1,indeed this is a pretty lousy horror movie,indeed it is as if this man is n't
1,i mean c'mon this show sucks,i had no desire to see this
1,this movie is just so bad i can see people trying to make the,this is just a good film and some people do n't believe it
1,and you ca n't stop thinking about the quality of the effects and costumes,and as for the action there are some pretty cool moments in this movie
1,minor spoilers ahead i have some problems with the ending as if by the end of the first act she is a revelation on the other hand the film begins abruptly,minor spoiler for the movie 's plot i have no problem with the character of jane 's life or in fact some kind of relationship between her and herself in the first
1,all of the actors from whom this is obviously going to be bad,all in all a very nice little film and it definitely deserves it 's
1,btw i like the acting because of the plot as they say,btw the film itself was shot in a low budget way where it
1,it is one that can bring tears to the eyes,it 's a nice little thriller that can keep one focused
