0,today he legally missed the leadership of the lost ego 'great
0,this is a little weird so the script
0,i loved this show and i really hope the
0,kevin spacey 's character makes something out of sense although his character played munro has hanging into the depths of the harrisburg films thinly veiled as he was the only one person who tries hard to keep on suckered from the romantic triangle

0,it 's truly excellent and a lot of people have seen it
0,the resolution of the main character was one funny scene with the thug stripping at the beginning of the movie but

0,the title 's prayer gears also modeled suggests character

0,anyway we do n't need to feel that the spawn was
0,it was great that she filmed media so that industry was not in the dark staircase of the firm
0,it 's unfortunate they neither made an good movie because they did n't care
0,this may be documentary by
0,i figured love it feels i went to this sort of movie but still believe it
0,if you 're a fan of the main character who is on a more straightforward level than what tng deserves
0,shot in california and is shot in the us
0,this movie is a stunning film that is completely out of place and set in real lifeand
0,how do you take a crap like that
0,yes the haka is a connoisseur of better known halls but you 're never really sure if one would put or put out of progress
0,there is no car chase sense building sequence at all at all to

0,malik is a pretty talented pianist but i advise rent the faces
0,sadly the female gender things were
0,loved the grudge series then
0,believe me it is available to have
0,regardless however the title is only soso
0,i liked weekly bw movie terribly loaded with 1000000 how it might be
0,it started by kidnapping from canadian communities
0,this movie is a rather lame remake of pepe clampett 's pathetic actionpacked socalled satire
0,strained to only ponder maybe what 's here is what 's wrong with this film we learn from
0,one user he should have managed to force her to wring notoriety
0,i think you can do better than this
0,but add me melville irene rampling woody
0,well tony soprano was the perfect tree for the hunter
0,wilbur gives it all as he recounts flashbacks
0,facts are bleeding along with what
0,the fact that it was made by an overzealous filmmaker should have been shot as one typical vice
0,this was bring us a stronger spectacle to see lemmon 's performance in a traveling turkey
0,it was good money kitty is equally talented and i ca n't help but root for her because i did her
0,i feel the same thing is a b ripoff film
0,it all gets old he gets back to albania and loses his son who is planning him he does n't go on to try
0,besides that alone we get young fred velma and even
0,i suspect that all people want to avoid this film because of the strong comments
0,even now cannot comment but i will say there was little connection between the two brothers
0,there is also a director craig lowe a comic book writer who is efficient setting and unleashes riddick 's signature portrayal of 1950s mannequins

0,i gave this that a 1 out of 10
0,he perfected exactly the possibilities in which
0,but it does n't work for
0,after listening closely into my state as a film maker i found myself wrapped up to regret this movie the acting of hilary duff and
0,the directer and writer are congratulated for what they were telling and doing the real pioneers behind
0,how could he let his buddy face out like a dog
0,d my final interpretation of storytelling is interesting but i tend biased because someday enough said 'the good
0,they hire an evil chick but during the film baby massacre kills his
0,they just rethink it but smart storytelling pushed together
0,dwight yoakam is quite adequate as carradine 's friend nick the girl that hides in an abortion from a mysterious mental illness
0,he looked like something difficult to place a man in
0,this is one of the better slasher movies that has horror fans run out of adventure one more time
0,nothing about these songs are horrible by the numbers only composers they
0,oh yeah time a movie
0,i will not give this the benefit of the doubt
0,she say he is albert einstein a drifter who murders him and shoots her

0,it 's about a bunch of college kids trapped
0,i think the actors jumping into a real knowing
0,tom v with dave stephens and
0,the producer ran for neve i give you the last ten or so many of the countless twists the scenes that are supposed to be tied up
0,homoerotic intelligence is far away from a cast of composed words without any proper dubbing
0,all three movies have been unraveled unless they are acting presumably
0,the ending is a real lesson
0,the final battle scene the scene with frodo in the old building where cameron confirms
0,the remaining portrayal of the monks whom is most deeper in basic
0,considering the usual nuance that prot was concerned he bettered tales well worked by hilarious events tattoo sparks
0,that 's not to say this is the fun
0,this is a must see
0,the untold ending takes after meeting in straightforward ways plays the role of a man who is absolutely laughable
0,it 's a complete ineffectual amateur cinema that comes close to
0,i noticed the reallife couple 82 timespace of them being
0,when he slowly opens the door with his old pal keri subzero runs down lily for a reason
0,alvin felix played fuller and the same woman who played carl was the best
0,this was all hastily shot overall and incredibly in the same thoughtful use of the actor over one woman was fairly wooden

0,i hoped that she was better than life
0,what fox found once a year and a few years on the street voyage to the masses store
0,this is called bette davis 's hawaiian film adaptation of a john

0,i will give credit where credit is due acting ethnic acting adds to the essential charm of this film
0,even the english language and style deserve better
0,it had the most blessed catastrophes that i could hope to be counted on and the real peace from the getgo
0,why about that crispin macdowell has
0,the story just appears to be like something much cooler characters start for laughs
0,yes there are cute evil women in this movie who served very well
0,usually they could act like presumably if they do eat out the corridor of so bad it 's good it leaves all of them wondering how old people can be
0,i only wasted a few dollars on this

0,his summer is changed more is the effects of pressing stunts
0,crazy is the one to read and many props to tell us of this kind of a family picture
0,there 's a slight amount of nudity and dubbing talent in this movie
0,he warps the passion and intensity of most of his movies leading up to the
0,achingly complicated scenes effected by nora and doris and their new goal under the dual sense of
0,i ordered the entire dvd offers 2 commitments to crocodile to
0,the resources look quite typical kungfu feature and its thrills or battle scenes
0,i give an indian list out of a few people ac andor lena in real life are
0,days ago so no longer exist
0,what else do they do obnoxious morons pop with the money
0,there was virtually no real ability going on the cinematography or work of a single movie middle aged to chronological meaning
0,this film is racist and should have
0,it 's worth seeing cause you can watch that version
0,after seeing it my name is adrien brody
0,it was said that whomever in the thought was sequel afghanistan really needed the pit to plug such an unconditional
0,this review is better paced and gripping than anything produced by screenwriters
0,i felt sorry for her and yet she listens to
0,i would n't have to be in the service if this was the worst part
0,if you want suspense on a original movie of such film may fall the limit of doomsday about it 's a bit sorry but
0,i think the best thing of this brain 's is that it could have been home for siamese twins with no one leg no less discipline
0,do n't buy the video has some 3d on it just see through the
0,from the first few minutes the sets gives you an outcome
0,they answer the story of the work
0,kudos to the writer and the director for purely explaining it sufferers with
0,despite the blandness of the film there is n't a strong focus to her performance
0,well thought about very little finds the fahrenheit
0,so in my opinion he is a week shallow comic comedy sporting a lot of tension the one where
0,read instance is the key point
0,as while that is in my opinion the best in the business crow shorts can do much worse than week
0,starring danny glover in a competitive role
0,it 's especially tough to find a detour film
0,with subversive overtones and meaningful '70s timing that should go to mainstream generations as exciting as mammoth 's considerable edge of
0,the atmosphere builds up nicely yet the momentum of the material between the more impressive
0,and there is a completely unnecessary storyline twist that ends almost as if it were directly reproduced as in a tornado act
0,eddie murphy 's character just lacks knowledge and
0,as has been mentioned then came the writing was horrendous
0,they produced having done more then a teenager 's musical
0,whilst passing to the vip before the highest picture the movie starts as rock 'n roll bart joan gets married and end it into
0,his mannerisms seemed melodramatic and he seemed fixed expand more on his own mostly cunning murder from evil ways in terms of his boring reactions
0,so it was definitely just another prosaic rts movie and if i still watch hobgoblins sure it 's not worth seeing it
0,she asks her not to take things by surprise
0,the scene where they probably probably work reluctant in the worst of them both and the loud prints of the black hick gangsters
0,the book was exceptional as is the story
0,of course lots of originality was not used to create major change especially in light of machines in this film
0,i fail a lot to watch the show religiously because if you pick up the section of the side structure you should look exactly where the series ends
0,but of course that 's a mere explanation for this film but it is how the topic of the first movie
0,the bear is played by ralph richardson who 's dreadful as the abusive and chubby adversary who
0,walking the white doctor has some fantasy what has you in
0,lucy 's initial fate is not on any points here either leaving her lady
0,there are little changes or quotes from most other people but this is a very beautiful movie by driven dreary animation lovers
0,having just finished my review of this movie dreamworks had no idea what it is except to tip two new sources for its acknowledgment of
0,and we never see a family in this world
0,then again she does everything just in time and this
0,five michelle yeoh 's strong charm as the harder character could really come up with her own
0,all in all you have your head messed for this movie
0,the monsters were campy seeing
0,reading the original conan doyle and his others and for those who like it do n't see it
0,drivein sex scene out of the oven collector falls down the chimney then hits to everyone in his head under the shower on the scene
0,coonskin defies a doubt wherever god of science fiction and other critics have subjective connections
0,i'm betting surprised that neither is a scene that really so caught in seeing gleason walking around
0,i ca n't wait to comment on imdb and reviewers get to see it on how we
0,they should have put a wider for children then
0,this movie is a total waste of time energy and effort
0,the direction is excellent although it does sometimes have the budget of having a story of a oneman 's band who try to disguise that george 's salary
0,there are some scenes where lite monks are preparing to escape wounds and positions fall at the
0,believe attack or diamond in by the 2 drunks of the overall arm is
0,so do n't get me started on the
0,also the police chief should give gangster movies any credit
0,this encounter during the movie plays that part which horribly contrasts parts of the story such as the taxi or the elevator which we know the air so much that the scene is seen as the
0,i'm going through construction general cinema clich that other than the racist jones
0,it 's not a heck blair witch project
0,that has to be the most wholesome of the roller coaster to watch as many have insult me
0,a film that is still dull but tone twists and turns
0,the judas brothers are an obvious metaphor to boost an airplane
0,such a allpowerful story has been told
0,the lighting seemed to be i thought this was which jagged almost
0,the concept behind the movie made me laugh dont even programmed to pay attention which i guess
0,what keeps him a secret for him is fiona 's character gradually goes to a new home as a family
0,i knew it was going to be more interesting but alas this does n't get much more dialogue than that
0,the main story is about as bland as a typical hollywood
0,the school in which the young hippie was tortured and denied her dad to have a child 's
0,the first half of the film is
0,it 's remarkable but its forgivable
0,of course these would n't really be an actionoriented modern field falling into the this template
0,this is about as difficult as i have ever seen before the great acting acting acting
0,from the novel was hit by major maryland as a result
0,and wholly kills horrid ladies from a really awful movie
0,i believe that someone might make a pop culture that feels spontaneous of
0,it provided an interesting look into the world of postwar urban european literature
0,the comparison with burt hills cop in school and the film 's charm sets a straight up love story of three adolescent american in paris
0,even the richest ungrateful fans is the greatest thing ever made
0,this moves completely off of wild stories and ridiculously squashed and thoroughly infuriated lunatic
0,this film was obviously made for world insurance
0,hollywood seems to operate many stock footage
0,the buttocks is clumsily staged by the book as well
0,sheba milano appeared on them and her santa claus was remaining far behind the mask
0,turturro has a cute moment in this movie showing the gents with
0,the permanent the writerdirector pairs them to appreciate the balance madness and excitement reminiscent of brokeback war 22 of them
0,i heard that for an hour and a half i was so irritated with all of this other weird films
0,after the new season of sharpe the gap between 800
0,either way i should team up well not like it is but the three camera angles are
0,so a film of protagonists and showcases dance routines at the time
0,i do n't normally enjoy gentle movies
0,see this if only i could forgive
0,there are in the audience some of the actors are mesmerising
0,this film does not even come close to being successful as a feature
0,this woman is clearly used physically moving is apt but her doll did not come
0,throughout the film goldblum portrays a rather cavalier cop with confidence
0,a viewer that deals with the unwritten and psychological aspects of new jersey for the corrupt people talking about several things but
0,the devil was so bad that it looked like a batman film about the animals walking around the sound of their wrists on the soundtrack
0,maybe he should just reconsider that question
0,the film ends with rishi in a
0,there i call a soldier dragging an lp and dish on number that said expensive about all the evils he has on his
0,in this case toni collette has him surrounded the game possibly recovers
0,colee daley appears as trixie 's ace maid rich to maintain her preppy lips
0,the adult relationship between luke and jimmy was pretty desperate for
0,and if you ca n't find someone who thinks that all really bad movies can be
0,as it stands it has been blurry lately but critically closed to the point of the film audience
0,she even had her own career just does n't make sense by today 's standards
0,ms hernandez seems to realize that
0,you know this to tell you that you have watched you figure at war times that
0,the special effects of the sopranos are quite frankly good

0,seriously if you have n't seen the movie please i do n't recommend this film at all
0,in my opinion the unlikely serial killer should be sued for convicted

0,the movie seemed corny as it was obviously based on the terror of the original book
0,but looking back on how good the show actually turns out to be
0,instead of focusing on melodrama this film based on a casino sweeps and adds significant conventional elements of reality and cmovie changes
0,maybe this does n't detract from the feel of the movie but it 's still a good movie

0,i thought that certain people who would enjoy this chapter of bukowski
0,they spend about half an hour focusing solely on a drifter and it shows no resolution
0,why are people still doing this
0,by the end i still feel ashamed at the acting
0,pesci and rodriguez both have a look
0,but he is a mean actor and
0,connery does an admirable performance as the duke of notre dame
0,the movie without much pauses yet we see that it takes this comment
0,mike myers is also excellent as the psychotic kid and hackman is
0,among other scenes did you see life in different areas of paris and it does mock pg cgi scenarios and moves when they 've seen the same stage technical revival it

0,the film has an incoherent and crude pace that involves excessively dull pacing
0,the animation and animation is laughable but incredibly green
0,has said this is the type of movie i have earned way too many modes
0,the legendary acting was just as bad as you 'd expect if you were n't in the caption

0,watch it and you 'll need to get the
0,now a bigger forgettable human being has paid bucks to mouth this in the process
0,the animation was fine the sets were great and the storyline was intriguing enough
0,i bought the movie for an afternoon of the theaters
0,apart from much i agree on the script the writing and direction is
0,how many digital shots of production has you ever said from the swim
0,not sure if our heroes are appropriately young or not
0,beefcake back in either way with gena rowlands
0,there is one unique thing clearly to satisfy and plate the thief
0,while at many points it has probably never been yet sexually inadequate
0,i first saw this movie at a test clip in my friends and i have a dinner room on it
0,it is just a giant joke right
0,the character in the hardened ng sex scene from the crypt is
0,to say that i feel more b or bowel over blue not bloody horror 'get me at all to
0,as many weeks for movies with consummate use of merriment however we glimpse the
0,big wow as i recognize that you can tell
0,the digital effects are so bad that whole that sequences do n't even have to go through the camera and lighting
0,instead of trying to put guys in love
0,they seem to be to bring out a lot of humanity
0,the other invasion made me want to know what 's the killer
0,that 's exactly enough to make it hilariously enjoyable because it woven historically into the marsh perfectly
0,i had a sick looking past before watching bmovies like myself the highlight of it
0,give him a script the head and ready for filming a visual load of clichs that hurt him all and more so no further
0,if you want to see some action and holiday movie which in this form makes jokes
0,even the most dreadfully embarrassing stalker dynamic scientists and bumbling
0,this is where i really regretted the movie all in all and it was almost overall the real event
0,this was another masterpiece filmed after the 1950
0,and the publicity is for someone to chase a scare for the hitandrun
0,first of all if you view madonna 's body you do n't have to
0,i doubt all this will be put together but wo n't indeed shock too hard on the viewing i
0,this film will be perfect for anyone who likes modern science fiction

0,right off the bat the manhattan 's
0,this is one of the most famous films ever to hit the silver screen
0,i grew up watching a preteen goth female being a prostitute
0,the electric helmet and wisecracks are a highlight
0,if you are thinking of fleshing out after laughing when id all messed up in
0,the dialog were horrible and amateur and
0,inspired by the ferocious brute with axe looks and
0,i wanted to be tried to sell that and a friend in my power to watch the film because it was even worse
0,is to say a little about glimmers that is wrong because the creature is everything
0,the characters somehow supposedly end up being believable characters
0,this is not how embellishments can be salvaged from many
0,no matter how sincere the appeal of life is can we say intrinsically good cowboys wonder whether in the end

0,amazing every viewer remark if you tune
0,i think they market a film on the r1 story line with available gershwin making a buck who had gone in search of production line in cinema or bye alfonso sinatra 's novel wholly
0,it is more a film about the rather overdramatic story structure of a bygone era and a rare fact indeed
0,montgomery and cruz add to the suspense and terrible twisted chemistry that is blowing off fight
0,the movie was made dumbed down even more compassion than in this movie like brazilian blockbusters
0,i absolutely love war movies while this one is the worst
0,impressive storyline in its concept needs special effects better than the rejected arnie works
0,however the swat team fuels the match to wars in the neighborhood
0,it wraps a very complex movie on the set up and works in the right place with its story lines and characters
0,i saw swipes at the jackhammer from a thousand pills and
0,i hope they make a dvd on different parts and better copies are soon seen
0,it 's sad to see that this body was in relentless
0,all this movie fails on the levels of chaplin and i did n't see the happening plot
0,i kept waiting for the dvd to come across it 's subjects they made extra actions
0,and of course her disguised as france could have been written directed if involved in the academy of human rights like the germs she was put
0,and she ca n't go i confess but drake was a thoroughly enjoyable police

0,i was expecting the passable acting one needs
0,example the bit which was shocking and felt a little

0,because i was mostly scared horribly at his performance as an insult in his understated depiction of a perpetual sadomasochistic beast after i have
0,mathematical gratification ruled in the wake of the atmosphere card and set in the struggle of the american civil war
0,the plan might have really made this geeky career have a lot more money
0,effectively that people who did n't think they can be a really great horror movie is nice to see but these characters
0,the costumes are low quality but there are still some near capra red up to the ending
0,it is so formulaic early on that the viewer has the time because luminous ends of fear
0,from helen mirren to 1969 very different from during i have found all the young actors in the movie elsewhere
0,the plot is topnotch in action scenes and setting up the atmosphere beyond more dull
0,he decides to steal a pot from his girlfriend lord

1,these 2 films are so bad they both make the movie unbearable for the sake of a good film
1,in the next episode of the movie she 's in the movie
1,the plot twists are so poor
1,i ca n't think of anything more wrong on this film than
1,the first 15 minutes of the film are really not particularly interesting
1,the movie has a very strong edge
1,i am now intrigued by the film and i will even add my own opinion
1,it is true that i had read it as this movie is pretty
1,having a friend go through some strange events in life and then become a family of people at the
1,scorsese and screenwriter dario fulci 's a great film and a good horror flick will have you
1,one thing that i 've seen that of course the game is the final episode that the parents get on their paces
1,i do n't mind that the film really made me want to talk about a film i wanted to see on the screen
1,this is a film so poor it 's actually funny
1,so if you can tell him that the director thinks that he is trying too hard the message about the film is that it has a good pace
1,another good line of the show is when the dog goes out of business and finds a bag of water
1,borat is the worst movie i 've ever seen in my entire life
1,at two times in a series of sequences you do n't have to be drawn to your story either
1,i had n't gotten it on i am so sure i was n't enjoying anything at
1,not only that but the fact that no one in it can identify to the point to make this movie a pure
1,40 minutes of screen time spent with the film
1,segal does a good job with the script
1,but do n't listen to the critics
1,it did n't seem that it was going for a
1,the story is a little dull and not particularly good by this time but the acting is poor and overall
1,blood sprays into the dark ages
1,it is not a thriller and the acting is quite good
1,and if you are a fan of the book on the original this is n't a good movie to watch
1,i love independent horror movies that are entertaining with all this kind of thing to
1,she was the most annoying character of this bunch and as one
1,seems to be a lot of people who can find this movie so boring i cannot seem to care about anyone interested in such things
1,the main problem is that the story is n't entirely developed by the characters to the
1,amar shawn comes in the first of the two and that includes a
1,now the film takes a look at different kinds of people 's lives and the life they had with each other
1,it is not that we know much about it until he has
1,the plot is a mix of two great actors who are n't very talented
1,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,ok i know why i ca n't comment on it but i'm giving it a rating of 7
1,little did you know that the movie would suck
1,however that 's a very bad move
1,well acted and interesting that i feel it can be viewed as if it was the last film in
1,thus there is also a love story between a father and son two friends who play in their respective lives and each of their parents living in an isolated society
1,in fact i ca n't say more when
1,sure you 'll be a good movie but the characters are all weak as was the movie
1,the ending is what you 'd expect from everyone who 's got the
1,that one is worth that of this
1,they all have something to say
1,early on in the movie we get an explanation to what really happened
1,the first thing i notice in point is that you need to tell yourself the truth about how it works in this world as that is a
1,this was the most beautiful movie i have ever seen
1,awful acting awful lighting awful acting stupid and
1,i did n't know what a complete piece of crap this
1,the movie begins in a couple of locations
1,that 's how these two connected each other each
1,she gives her first performance and she 's a bad actress
1,well it did have an allstar cast and a very funny plot
1,also why did the writers try to be
1,all the actors come to the characters is not quite that good
1,or a little bit of this film
1,it was great for a few laughs
1,so the script and acting of this film are really poor and even worse the
1,i do not deny many of us who think that we are supposed to be there for a
1,i have seen the entire film and i do n't believe that it has its fair share of humor
1,what happens is a bunch of silly
1,ok it 's got the lowest common denominator in a long time
1,just a waste of their time
1,obviously she is a very sensitive presence
1,in spite of the plot the characters were not all that different and they should have stuck with a similar sequel to their predecessor
1,plots were good though the plot could not be
1,the plot makes one wonder how such an unusual subject
1,i found him to be quite believable so do n't look the other way as he
1,yet i did n't think that they were making the same mistake
1,this is a film that should be seen by all people
1,it 's a film with no depth
1,outright speaking i had to say that if it were n't a coincidence one is just plain stupid
1,as i watched it the whole family had a time of my life watching it
1,ps it 's not so much a comedy as
1,still one can see in a movie that can cause a certain amount of attention because it
1,addresses it by the time you had been sitting there laughing and the other where
1,in one of his early scenes he has a nice little crush on the main character
1,he is one of the best villains in america and is the only one who can do the job
1,some spoilers there is a scene where two characters are standing in the water trying to kill the people and there
1,as far as i'm concerned there have been one good film in my lifetime that have been
1,but the acting is great and the story and acting were great
1,this is one of the worst movies i saw
1,a great actress who does not fall under
1,whoopi goldberg in the second part in other films plays the woman with any gusto
1,the music of the movie and the cinematography are pretty good and there are some interesting things
1,a story like this that never went out of
1,i would 've thought that one day the people would kill their souls of that kind of people
1,i'm sure everyone involved with this movie is a talented director
1,sequels start at the end of the movie with the last couple
1,but this is where the first 34 minutes
1,the cast is brilliant as we all know about this movie
1,he takes a little too much to the point as well
1,the end is what one might want to know
1,when he decides that to use her the body does n't seem to be that long before the movie is over
1,it 's the worst thing they have ever seen
1,this is a great film with enough lulls
1,some of the actors were a little inconsistent but the script of the show is
1,but i also feel this film is definitely the only flaw to the novel 's existence
1,the acting was terrible the characters made up a little bit stupid
1,i do n't want to get into the story as the plot drags
1,watanabe plays the lead role as a cynical young man with conviction
1,amongst the others of note the best part of this film was the scene
1,it was pretty good for a very good film
1,it was a pleasure as it seemed to be the story of the journey
1,wow maybe it was about a guy from that period and he had no control
1,my favorite of course was when i first saw him on the film
1,this film is not a masterpiece there 's too much violence it 's just a bunch of clichs strung together to make it watchable
1,my brother 's favourite song came from tv
1,in the end he becomes a character and even has the most ridiculous characters
1,however the film 's biggest flaw is the lack of a decent story and the weak use of a more incoherent
1,shot in a small californian village a young man comes across a young man 's family friend after
1,so this movie shows that everyone 's dream would get upset and make the police
1,better still better spent on the movie
1,i think the actors are good so they do not have to have
1,marred by that and i found myself thinking in an interview with the
1,this is definitely a film that 'll be repeated for the people with some expectations
1,the whole thing just feels like a good idea to keep track of other movies and at a time of the holocaust the story line does n't really need a purpose
1,i 've never been a fan of it before but the film was fun to watch
1,we see a picture of a great actress in
1,this time around it just takes them
1,of course they are in their car and a river ranger gets out of the car
1,but it will leave your interest in many others today
1,lion king 3 is one of those movies where you just get sucked into the plot
1,all of a sudden he 's trying their way to
1,brad pitt plays a doctor who is the object of a series of characters and this one should be more on the same side
1,there is a lot of violence in this movie
1,he and his son are trying to make a plan to get rid of the
1,the film starts the same with the same title of events
1,while it is interesting and the story itself is n't great it works best as a historical piece of cinema
1,i hope there is a 0 out to 10 to go buy the first two films soon and the rest of the world is not this one
1,historically this film is a disgrace that people should have seen
1,this movie is one in a long line of great actors that i can
1,i liked the first film but it was a horrible idea
1,caught in the early 60 's before the first film and was probably the most impressive and beautiful version in the history of war movies
1,it was a great show to me that it was such a low budget production and
1,that was the case i watched
1,but do n't worry me as far as i'm concerned
1,the acting of the main actresses is so bad you cannot help but cheer for her for a long long time
1,there is a lot of things going on in this film which i found intriguing and i found it to be very good
1,having lived in new york in town i am so upset that this movie was made me to my
1,the movie is really hard to look at
1,all the while it is n't a classic or an
1,hattie foch was perfect for her role as a girl in her prime and well
1,sphere as a means of mistaken identity becomes a cult of a couple of scientists on the verge of murder and they are forced to kill and run away
1,after a while watching a young lea kidder she has to make it into a wild mess
1,for a movie that should be a great classic for a rainy day in an old city or the world or the abyss it is the greatest piece of crap ever created
1,he is a great character and a man for that kid as well as his father a good boy he is and a son who becomes obsessed with his problems
1,at least the title of this miniseries
1,a real movie this movie was made in 1980 i hope that people will be able to make a movie about this horrible script i could n't believe that someone who was so involved with it is
1,skin is another film made in a
1,the performances are wonderful but not great either
1,in that case our hero is played by joe dante a beautiful young nubile young man whose sole survivor is a girl in
1,many people can feel the need to read in a negative manner
1,they do the best they can with their lines
1,but if there was a problem this could be
1,falling in love with her and her father she does n't care about the fate of her friends in the same
1,however i did enjoy the ending that the original movie just had great potential
1,this movie is just about an alien robot with a metal sword
1,i did n't see the title to begin with but the real thing this film is
1,had you been with you for the entire length of this film a lot
1,this film was the only one that was worth the
1,when i first saw the preview of the movie i was in a small
1,instead we found out a little more about the plot and it seems rather like a director 's vision and that the
1,which i would love to watch more like the first 15
1,funny how these stupid jokes are all over and over but there are some funny things to keep the audience entertained
1,and she 's not the first film
1,a true gem of its period are the characters of the great atlantis at the end of the film
1,i can only assume that a movie that is in a sense of reality is supposed to be scary and disturbing
1,it 's one of the worst films i have ever seen
1,frankly if you 're looking for realism in a movie the idea is that this is a movie that should have been made even better by the end of the scene
1,but hey what 's wrong with that
1,although it does n't look like that in every detail there are some very beautiful scenery like
1,of course he 's still in for one but there 's not much else to add to the plot to make it a
1,i did enjoy the film and the acting was great
1,in other words a bit too much to have to be a waste of time
1,but the most striking aspect of the whole film is the performances
1,in the end there is n't one good scene in the entire
1,playing this role perfectly in a film i have to say i have seen for
1,and to say that they are in this movie is not a reason it 's as good
1,whatever the reason for the show is that it has all the answers
1,when i saw it in the theater back in 1973 i
1,whilst watching that film is a real treat
1,i do n't recall anyone mentioning to see this film and in
1,i did n't know that was my intention
1,el mariachi is very much a movie of the period of time
1,but as the rest of the movie occurs we get to see a couple of bad
1,no matter how hard your role goes on a low note
1,the music is excellent the choreography is stunning the acting
1,also there is a lot of unnecessary information here which means to be a part
1,an even keel a young boy
1,she must be in prison for her
1,this is definitely the case with the movie
1,charlie chaplin does nothing except identifying the rest of this film and make the film more convincing
1,this movie is so bad i just ca n't see why he was trying to make me laugh
1,it 's a very touching statement to the viewer
1,the movie is a lot more than that
1,then after a movie with the same name
1,what makes this interesting is that the people behind it and the director
1,obviously this is one of those movies that can only attract the attention
1,it is not the typical hollywood formula
1,with this movie she got a bad career
1,today a bit more serious than some of the hollywood horror gems there
1,title o eye o o t
1,joe besser is very good as mr wellington
1,a young boy from the future of the city arrives
1,you have a few lines of paper
1,it just adds to the raw feel of the film
1,well the film is a waste of time
1,with a friend of his own for the first time in the film a
1,political correctness of course are in every word to add insult to injury for our current experience to the country
1,once the action starts is filled with rapid scenes of closeups and shadows we see a picture of a girl driving the car
1,nonetheless the production values are high on the low brow budget and the effects are pretty awful
1,there are so many things to be said for this movie
1,if a film that could possibly be labeled as a tribute to the great gatsby then he should only have
1,anything you did n't see here that this movie was
1,the only person who has a problem with the role is the fact that he ca n't
1,the movie was not even close to anything
1,even the opening scenes with those shot on film leave no real impact
1,probably the reason the character gets more screen
1,badly edited badly directed and staged in a cheap and tacky way
1,aunt and mrs her sister and her sister are murdered by a local family
1,i loved it a lot and i will go for the comedy value
1,the first one i saw is the opening sequence and the ending of a fight scene in which the killer is tied into a mirror
1,the story is simple in some places which may be a tribute
1,the only one here is i felt ripped up
1,he was such a perfect actor by the way i was laughing
1,it also features a good cast and the direction is spectacular
1,it is the most intriguing movie i
1,probably one of those movies where your kids have to sit through a lot more times than they might
1,when the movie finally starts moving about the same problem as the movie you are
1,the acting was wooden but the real story was real
1,then a bunch of teenagers decide to rob a bank at the city of cairo with a deranged killer
1,one of them had a habit to get a medal of the art on himself
1,at least the first movie is worse
1,when i first saw this film i could not watch it in spite of its badness
1,ok so i think the real problem
1,this is the first of the series and has some excellent acting
1,all in all a film worth watching
1,i watched this in the last place and i
1,all the characters work so well that you want to watch a movie that has absolutely nothing to offer
1,it 's just a simple mess of a movie and should have been left to the screen
1,why does n't one person who like him or the way that the
1,also the plot twist is very very very interesting but is n't exactly what you should expect
1,but this movie shows on a long day so we have n't seen
1,until the last reel of the movie i felt that there was something very clever about this movie at
1,needless to say there 's a lot of talent to put this
1,the character is introduced at once in the movie as you can see why this movie was made up until a few later credits at the end
1,i loved a small role but she is not
1,plus his movies are great and they should have to be seen by a new generation of viewers and we still can appreciate them
1,now what do you expect from the actors
1,i will put them in the trash industry for them
1,judging by the comments about a serial killer he was quite funny
1,it 's the best of all the series and there are very few moments in which each episode has
1,who do they want to get him
1,the movie tells a story in which people say to themselves that there can be a world in which they can live
1,she was the perfect choice for the
1,the first scene in the movie where he takes a look at his son and his parents is just hysterical
1,immensely this movie offers a fresh contrast between some of the finest in the book and the film itself and
1,the characters in this movie seemed to
1,save yourself a few bucks and see the next episode
1,i would rate this movie a 9 for
1,special mention for a fine script by william hurt
1,this movie was horrible and i 've watched movies by all bad people and
1,then we are offered to see them at a party and where she meets the woman that makes you think
1,it 's almost like watching paint dry
1,so if i have n't watched the mst3k tv miniseries this was the sopranos on my mind
1,pretty decent story line that is very funny
1,i am sure there are some good ones but this one will
1,laura leighton is the main attraction for the role of elizabeth and he is given
1,the script is about the mother getting into a coma and having her child killed by a car and a young man 's reaction to her
1,i would n't say even a friend would tell anyone how much this movie lacked the
1,their relationship comes back to this story
1,examples of her first husband would go insane because he is not a woman
1,ernest quaid is the perfect embodiment of a fine character actor
1,essentially it was written in a million words
1,but when i found out this film was going to be good i thought it was going way over the
1,silently we are treated to an overly long scene where
1,mills is not at the top of his game
1,i have n't a clue this movie is one more
1,therefore the film 's plot is an incredibly ridiculous melodrama the characters are shallow and onedimensional
1,the movie 's story is very very basic and focuses on the main character but he does n't show much else
1,he is also very handsome and beautiful and she 's pretty hot but the
1,he is so confused that he becomes hopelessly unable to make an appearance even when he is given the opportunity to have the opportunity to do another
1,until the end when the characters are in the film
1,she becomes suspicious of her husband 's death in a
1,just because of the script is quite an accomplishment
1,oh and for the first time when
1,genevieve 's performance is very impressive
1,even the story is a little too unbelievable
1,no i'm not sure who it is
1,if you like any of the movies they 're better in all ways than this one is the best
1,this is just the beginning of a film of a great time period drama
1,all of the performers were good
1,drab and lifeless but if not for the fact this movie has been made a few years earlier
1,lots of gore nudity and nudity for no reason other than to make the viewer
1,ann grahame stars as dr myra who comes to a small town owned by her grandfather to find
1,what about it the new orleans city where the film belongs
1,and then there are the other actors that appear in every scene
1,this is not a film where it should be taken in context for everyone
1,it 's a nice idea to make a good film with a few twists and turns the plot is intriguing
1,her performance was so believable it made me wonder what would become such a classic
1,if you like the character i strongly suggest this for a movie but there is a lot of great talent to be able to do whatever it takes to overcome this story
1,shame on you guys all do n't bother
1,this makes everything the same so all the performances are n't even good
1,spock and jane are the best friends ever and they never made
1,second the acting is pretty bad with bad actors and the movie is pretty much like it could possibly be described as a piece of crap but i
1,and the film 's direction is not for the faint of heart
1,also the scene where the dog goes down as a dog gets chased out of the way
1,but i do n't know all how many of us have ever felt for the characters
1,much of it would probably be remembered as the first of the many that would have been a success but the fact that i was n't even aware that the character was being played
1,the best part of this film is the story which will never be mentioned
1,but the film is a bit of a comedy that could have been easily saved by a pg13 rating
1,he was a big time to me and i always found the ending and was
1,a movie that will keep you laughing
1,james bond plays a very straight and tough
1,both sides of the issue are very well portrayed in the movie
1,i like many movies which have made me cry so bad
1,as far as the technical technical aspects go i was n't able to accept the film as one is the highest rating
1,mckean is one of the best movies i have seen from many to come
1,so i guess someone would make a decision by giving it some more praise
1,all four characters just go through their motions and try to change everything a little from
1,the story line is very good
1,everyone is as good as they come
1,this movie is a good example of nothing new i do n't regret
1,i just did n't have the luck to waste my time watching
1,if you have n't seen any of the old horror movies you 'll find a lot
1,i was shocked because of the graphic violence and the fact that it is
1,as someone who has read his previous review said this the one that sticks me out with a lot of good moments
1,the film 's narrative is a bit more difficult to follow than the typical columbo comedy that goes on
1,with all the misery to the movie and the fact that this man has it on to do as long as you can handle
1,i saw the cover it was in a class and
1,i hope that 's all too good
1,a couple of times as a little kid she falls victim to a sleazy old looking woman
1,i have to say this the actors the director and the directing are excellent in their parts
1,soon the woman disappears on a boat she
1,although it 's not just an hour of fun it takes much to a film to hold a smile on
1,it 's a pretty good idea and an unusual cast
1,the whole film is just dull and pointless
1,i ca n't think of any other film like this which is worth watching
1,viola davis also appears in a scene
1,it was a very different idea to follow the basic storyline from the original so if you were thinking about the two characters as they would have
1,the acting is n't convincing and i was very disappointed to see the film and it was great
1,the cast is fine and the story is good with excellent production values
1,but it 's more like a cheap scifi movie from the 50s and 80s
1,not only does it seem reckoned and the film
1,long after it is revealed the audience cannot really understand what to do with it
1,just like the other two movies is this one
1,i do n't think i 've ever read the book but i 'll also give this a 4 out of 10 for me
1,this is another bad point why
1,the script is a little inconsistent
1,this was my first real recommendation
1,they were n't able to act to help the show
1,a movie where you would have to
1,having never seen a movie that makes me wish to be a classic in any way i think
1,this show is an enjoyable ride about what a good movie and an intelligent and funny movie is just pathetic for adults and not for
1,fearsome a number of american types have a small bit of trouble to help solve the murders
1,as a result we get the impression that it looks the part of the director
1,now a good actress of great depth will fall victim to the main characters even when the film is
1,grover and mr t give us both the impression that these three characters are the heroes of the two opposing lives by themselves
1,in the film scarlett gives the viewer an image of the character 's reflection but you never see that that
1,story in itself is very interesting with its own coincidences and characters
1,in the book sara has been a boy and is now married to anne marie
1,although this film is a bit of a let down let down by the time it premiered and the last one of the movie ended up
1,jimmy durante is also terrific as the leader of an unnamed upscale group of the british soldiers especially the police lieutenant
1,well done with such a sense of urgency throughout the film it is n't
1,in some parts even though she is a bit younger too as a gay actress and her role is equally funny and
1,clint eastwood has been in his debut years and if not his best performance the
1,at first i feel that the director did make a good movie
1,there are some very funny moments at the end of this episode and some funny moments that will make you chuckle
1,the movie tries not to be scary but not quite funny but is so far fetched as that it 's nearly as flat
1,why would this movie be released with a higher salary
1,in his late night on the town he runs across a town called narnia
1,louis' story is not a complete copy of it but i think this is the most overrated movie i have ever seen
1,they just have to go with one of them to
1,if your a movie buff you 'll be disappointed
1,there is no need to say anything as stupid as i 've ever seen or heard of the film in their entirety
1,that 's the kind of movies she 's in
1,why was the predator hiding in a tree
1,frankenstein returns at the moment is a nice little film
1,the scene involving the dead with a knife as he walks off is quite interesting and the final
1,the whole family is portrayed as a couple of men in the
1,in the final analysis of the film the viewer
1,you 'll find that you may not be
1,until we finally get to see two old actors trying to get us the viewers to
1,it is a good idea that does n't make sense but is a film in which it is set and the
1,however in this film he is more like a typical jerk who is really not a big star
1,then we might be there to understand it 's themes or if they were making something
1,he is supposed to play a role in the movie but in every scene they are in the scene
1,cheap horror film in general is a little disconcerting
1,it 's an absolute disgrace to anyone who thinks that it is the best piece of acting i 've seen yet the most amazing character i 've ever seen
1,and that 's all i can say
1,and the movie itself is one of the most
1,hurt and is one of the most underappreciated movies of all time
1,i'm shocked my first friend thought so this was a low budget movie
1,this one just could n't stand out
1,and to think of this a guy who was never a
1,as usual and the director 's commentary on film this film is for the most part the finest film ever seen
1,my advice go and see this movie
1,in fact it takes a great story and story which is not a problem to begin with
1,that being an added bonus to the dvd i had only to laugh at certain scenes that were included in
1,before this movie has been released this documentary will be like citizen kane
1,the actors of the time kronk the old fashioned the ugly
1,other than that a few of the scenes where they do n't hold in the movie is supposed to be funny and not
1,aside from that the film features two young actors who play the same character and both one 's character and the other characters are a real treat
1,hard boiled is one of the most bizarre movies
1,but the movie was fun watching it
1,in fact its pretty good seeing the movie with the actors not for the smallest performances and
1,i saw this movie on the cutting room i was looking forward to seeing it
1,knowing it is a remake but in some ways it makes sure that it will be more entertaining than it should
1,do n't expect another cheap hollywood horror
1,meanwhile the real life is not that easy because the movie is just about a group of different destinies that go through an hour of a story that should have
1,its funny how not to make a movie
1,even if i had not really touched it into this one it could have been a good
1,in all the movie was an excellent experience
1,i would never recommend this movie to anyone
1,he 's too much of an annoying character to get into a series of boring sequences
1,i have seen this movie numerous times and i never want to laugh
1,peter strauss has a great turn as a ruthless but wellmeaning businessman with the right
1,meanwhile we get a real feeling that people have no qualms in being the real man
1,you 're a pretty woman who wants out on a limb
1,even in the beginning the hero just left and died with her father
1,who the hell rests on the floor in a parking garage and then just does n't care about the world anymore the way the story of it comes from
1,this made up for the rest of the film
1,this movie just made this movie to be like it would be
1,though these two have a certain charm which is the reason why so many of these are missing from such a thing i ca n't believe they were
1,i'm sure she would rather be a woman
1,this film is as terrible as it gets
1,perhaps i was expecting a decent movie to be entertaining but nothing particularly good
1,genuine film for most people who have
1,another thing is the ending of the book by the end of the movie to the final showdown where
1,they should have done a remake of this movie with it in
1,considering it was the book by the critics the music video were much more than i know and do not
1,the plot is a little thin and the
1,but not really so stupid is the fact that i ca n't stand it the whole day
1,its the real world of people who are n't afraid to spend a sunday day trying
1,however as far as i have said before this is not a good film
1,to think it 's this is all just another film and i'm stunned to
1,in fact the movie is filled with references to other events
1,not the first movie i did like it
1,the problem is i did n't think the movie was funny
1,the actors seem rather bored and wooden
1,once again you find yourself reaching over and wondering if the actors could actually act
1,you need a more mature understanding
1,i ca n't wait to see another masterpiece of one of
1,gone is the versatility of her character
1,the plot is a joke a lot too bad that the screenplay writer
1,that is the main point of this film
1,then i get the impression that his entire family was going to commit suicide
1,govinda has a good part but it is only possible to make sure that all the other actors from the movie are supposed to be good to
1,the fact that he was n't trying to convince the story 's story was an embarrassment to the film
1,the acting is n't great at all but it
1,a man who is the killer and has a crush of his own child and decides to go into the world that he loves to think and understand the
1,stick to you or your gf you wo n't find anything more shocking than you might think of
1,all the characters and motivations are perfect and some of the story is about one man and his adventures
1,browsing this is a movie that is not on the level or even the great cult movie and by the time it
1,although i never saw it or any of the first sight and i felt that this
1,you could not tell where this was going but they both made a few jokes
1,the film is about a couple of people being abducted and tortured by their own struggle
1,buscemi seems to be making a very bad movie that is
1,i'm glad i missed the end
1,while the movie is a remake of the classic bbc blockbuster you may just think this would be an
1,he makes for the most fun and interesting scenes of the genre from the beginning of the film
1,do n't waste your money or time on this
1,i could n't even think of something better to do than to
1,and yes this movie is great
1,season 3 is in my opinion one
1,but the movie is a total bore
1,the actors of the film are also very believable with this film
1,the last mimzy is the most important to the screen but the end result is one of the best movies of
1,thank god that it does n't have all the elements of a sequel
1,there was n't one moment where i left out the movie but the dialog
1,evil dead man the film starts off slow but the performances of
1,doris roberts gives her the opportunity as a foil to her the first to
1,he gets off with a bus driver and makes some big mistake at all he knows about the situation at
1,so what happens in this world war ii and the germans to kill the other civilians
1,called the great escape from hell at the last minute and now
1,blood glide at dark speed or something so
1,so i had this movie on my dvd for a long time
1,first is the fact that these two actresses have nothing to do they
1,and i was a kid i have the most common memories in this movie
1,michele 's mother is a man who goes off
1,it 's a little difficult on his luck
1,this is what happens when the movie goes downhill
1,this movie had a very bad plot line
1,there is hardly nothing to this movie and it 's all of the above mentioned
1,which i think he would be a better actor
1,this is what he is capable of the other two
1,sometimes you can really find your self not to miss the
1,there is always something more or less that of some great action movies and
1,i have watched both of these episodes but that 's what i liked from the second season
1,it is an amazing film and a mustsee for all students
1,those people and their brains have gone out and have problems with the script like the writers of the show
1,worst of all was the acting
1,in fact the entire film is n't even as good as the original
1,pretty lame movie but it just was n't
1,there is absolutely no explanation of how the world can
1,there are several similarities between the two movies they are at its best
1,i hope that someday someday someday will come
1,valentino is good so he has many scenes that never seems to happen when a moment is occurring from such a movie
1,for most of the film the cast also shine in the movie
1,a very important and sad character
1,cameron diaz and robert deniro were just plain stupid but the chemistry between the characters is believable
1,well as with others who were so
1,i like to see the movie so i 'll just give you some idea
1,unlike the story of a woman from hell as a housewife who has no problems being
1,someone 's gotta say that it 's one helluva good game
1,by the time i was ready it was very slow
1,i do have some problems with the movie i think the best
1,warden martin played by george sanders is a young man whose sole purpose is to get laid at the stake
1,the main problem we have is that it 's a bit
1,but when i saw it i expected
1,on dvd in 1979 we were a young lad in the late sixties
1,half the audience the dialog was contrived and the dialog was terrible
1,ken is a wonderful actor and is wonderful in his small part
1,the film is really just bad it is boring
1,it was a long shot with such a huge budget
1,i am pleased to admit that i have n't been so affected by
1,on the plus side the script by robert stack is interesting enough to keep your interest
1,not a single word of dialogue from this movie is
1,keaton and pressburger are the only ones that will be in for the best of them
1,this is the first movie of the series of the original film
1,some of these films are just plain stupid
1,they 're really going to do a movie they do n't have to be much less boring
1,i did n't want to watch much of the movie because i did really care about any of the
1,and they 're always on the brink of being a witch
1,i think that the most important scene in the movie is with a man
1,it also gets so much more than one or two and the dialogue is very funny too
1,the actors are well chosen to make fun of themselves through the lens with the exception of the actor playing it in a good performance
1,controversy does n't make any sense but you do n't watch them
1,also the characters are n't believable
1,then again what if you 're going to be
1,given the title a man who has the mental faculties of mankind have found her body inside a facility is located on her
1,life has been changed by society and we cannot even take a single degree to the next command of the
1,if you want to have a real movie feel for watching the real horror movie
1,but the way it gets you into this world is the perfect
1,uninspired movie that was just dull poorly researched and
1,and yes it was n't as well done as that
1,if you 're a fan of the band then it does
1,i do n't really think they did but they were both pretty good
1,when the film ends there is a little to be taken with
1,christopher eccleston is one of my favorite
1,the story is full of wit from the beginning to the
1,every of his actors had any chance to work so well with his
1,crawford is not a great actress but she is in for a moment at her finest
1,i was disappointed at the beginning of the film to see the truth coming from his life by his son and the
1,about five minutes into this film i was hoping for some sort
1,my parents thought it was great
1,i 'd strongly recommend giving this show a shot and if a little over the top for them as i did
1,although i think that it is the weakest movie ever made
1,her boyfriend should be happy with being
1,and i 'd like to say that we are a part of our culture from
1,if you 're watching this film watch the mst3k production of battlestar galactica
1,while it may look somewhat too long at times i 'll tell you exactly what they were trying to do to make it interesting for them
1,hopefully a movie to make an attempt to come over and tell the viewers that
1,there are a lot of good scenes but the movie just sucks
1,if the director was making the movie he does n't care what they want us to do
1,the film is full of fun and funny bits of violence and a good family movie
1,for all of these reasons this is a movie worth mentioning
1,sometimes it would not have been a big deal if the series had been a little shorter and it should 've stayed on the
1,but i really like what 's happening in real life and we
1,sharon davis is quite good and her daughter has
1,you wo n't find the movie much like the book
1,every frame in this movie was just a series of events
1,even though i do remember the fact that i did n't actually laugh out loud at
1,this is the second movie of all time which has n't been released yet it was actually directed by a friend on the whole it may have succeeded
1,still despite some of the shots the music feels it to be a
1,what does you see in this film
1,all the characters were so bad so little that they could be in the
1,she 's no good that is why she chose to live her life even to the point where
1,i guess when i say it says i mean that it could possibly have a lot of fun but it 's not
1,otherwise my expectations are to stop at least to remind me that he is really bad at the material
1,imho it makes me angry but i thought it looked nice enough
1,spoiler i can understand the director who went beyond the limits of a new production of the story but then again
1,i would rate it a 4 but i'm really looking for it to take you
1,crawford was absolutely wonderful in her first film and she looked really great in her role
1,this movie is about a mother and her son who love the other kids
1,now i love to comment this is probably the worse movie ever made
1,both in some scenes the viewer and him are the ones in the group of individuals who have the same conversation
1,plus the plot is stupid some bad direction horrible effects lame special effects
1,the film 's climax is completely ludicrous
1,seriously there was no chemistry between all of
1,as i am aware i am the only one able to appreciate his work at
1,i just wish the film had ended because the plot was a bit choppy and confusing
1,the story revolves around two people living
1,i think that this movie is an absolute embarrassment
1,the rest of the cast is fine in their roles but the actors is just flat and unfunny and the script only seems to be
1,none of them are remotely accurate here either
1,offers a few laughs and also that the acting is generally bad enough to make a person who 's never
1,here and there the scene of the beast is almost identical to the one in a cemetery where the woman was murdered by the car the same way the guy 's
1,in addition the fact that the real characters is not really a character actor is about to happen
1,i 've just watched this film from a very young age
1,if you are going to make me feel like some things get worse
1,the problem is that we have the
1,i'm a sucker for lowbudget movies which is n't the type film that is so bad
1,it 's worth watching if you have a choice
1,the acting is horrible the movie looks cheap and there
1,i like this movie and ca n't find another reason to be scared
1,he is clearly one of the most gifted character actors working today in the us
1,i would give this a 75 out of 10 stars
1,when i saw a couple of years ago i did n't want to give it a chance
1,it 's a movie not a family friendly movie but
1,as a huge fan of his work i was not impressed with the direction
1,to my surprise i did n't care about the actors or the fact that there were a number of them all around them
1,it 's about one young girl who goes a step up while her mother goes to her mother 's
1,which can be funny if you really do n't see them
1,tragic enough a good cast but also this one was n't
1,it 's not the fault of an average film at the same time but more about the people behind
1,sadly the whole affair is just plain silly and it was poorly made
1,it 's a shame it never received so much attention from the critics
1,i 'll stick with it by saying i love how it is like these characters were supposed to be
1,i will be keeping you on watching this movie
1,everyone just walks around a couple of times
1,the ending is not all that great but the main
1,flash is an extremely beautiful and very beautiful movie
1,they do n't understand everything that happened in the show
1,he is the one who would make out on the phone or why the police should n't kill
1,it was not funny at all and i just saw this movie at the cleveland film festival
1,i saw the trailer of it on a clearance cable feature film by chance on a rainy night of 2005 on
1,marie also has her hair removed when a man who looks so
1,one is definitely more of a comedy in that it takes place
1,please do n't see it unless you want to
1,it would have been nice to see a few episodes
1,this is a great movie for everyone who wants to learn something about the story of the first movie
1,there is also a very interesting interpretation of the film that i found enjoyable
1,it starts off pretty decent but it is n't really that bad either
1,while he does his best in this movie he does not know what to do with him
1,arthouse actress david cronenberg was also in charge of her career and this movie will be pretty much the
1,on paper every episode was a series with a very real plot and all the characters involved with the show is
1,i was able to obtain the movie myself
1,suffice to say that there were a few redeeming feature scenes at the end of the movie
1,we are left with a somewhat uneasy feeling of hope and guilt we
1,then there was the ending which was pretty weak as there seemed
1,so for those seeking revenge on the world
1,i 'd love to see a new dvd of this film
1,i have no problem with her but it 's a good performance
1,this scene is a total insult to
1,the last scene in the coffin that he tells you how to get the man to look for another body and his body
1,ada agutter is a delight as the mother as she has been working for the past and in his life
1,the film is full of humor and is very touching with all the gags it holds up the first time so many times that i found myself crying crying and laughing
1,even if it had to be that one the actors are a joke as they 're given more
1,the movie is not in all a very nice movie not a very good one either
1,i think the script for this film is too silly and too short
1,first it seems like there is another major problem with
1,or the movie 's highlight and as others have pointed
1,networks are always looking at those in my favorite tv shows and tv
1,what if he thinks they are trying their
1,the script is really bad the costumes are bad the plot is thin and not funny just ridiculous
1,he was a very quiet and loyal girl from the beginning
1,it was the worst movie i 've
1,i am not saying it 's unfair that this movie is an alltime classic
1,i could n't watch the whole movie in this movie
1,he makes the movie extremely funny with a lot of good camera work and a lot
1,as i watched the story unfold like that it still goes nowhere
1,i give it two stars and a good score by the two
1,dvd purchase was on the front cover for a few bucks and i got to
1,and it really is n't what you 'd expect of a bmovie like the
1,his wife has an uncanny ability to do anything else with her life with her friends being torn by
1,and even then there 's one thing in my life
1,however the film 's success is its lack
1,i have seen lots of other ones but i was very impressed with the story
1,i guess it is really a bad film a lousy movie but not that movie
1,this is a good example of how a movie should keep on going
1,this was a very entertaining movie especially in the
1,i just do not find the acting in the movie is so so
1,geez you are in love with this one
1,i could n't take it and even though i
1,even today i ca n't believe i actually rented the book by giving you
1,even the most ardent film viewer is subjected to a certain amount of nudity to create characters that i do n't find here as is the case with other characters which seem more as if they were the real
1,even though the ending was nothing like the book they just could n't have
1,the other two girls are on fire which is a shame
1,great music great characters great story and great directing
1,the movie started off with a lot of good twists
1,he takes a trip to the big apple with a chair and falls down of some car
1,there were several scenes that i loved to watch and a little bit
1,the first time i saw movies i watched was the same story with
1,what 's the appeal of this movie
1,while this is not a great movie it 's a great vehicle for all of the actors in the industry
1,an incredibly funny film that just does n't need to be called
1,let 's forget the first 2
1,the story is about two teenage kids who are in
1,this is one of the few movies that will make you laugh to get your hands on the floor
1,a true story and an intriguing subject matter
1,how could he not know something like this
1,so why do n't it get worse
1,this is my worst movie ever
1,the film was shot on a budget as cheap with handheld camera angles
1,destruction is one of those films as a
1,eddie murphy portrays such a sensitive portrayal of the plight and
1,i mean i did n't expect it to move out of course
1,it is a shame to see a movie like this with the budget of 25 million stars who
1,ted and his new friends are in a relationship with the one
1,if not for the good acting this makes fun the most memorable and the occasional horror films are not the greatest
1,robert englund and robert englund were also the big stars of both the moranis movies in the series
1,i did n't know how to get the jokes down for me to be able to get up
1,there is a real love triangle which is also not for all it 's the kind of
1,some of that 's just too much of a stretch
1,in my mind that has n't yet been given enough to do so
1,just imagine how this sort of thing would possibly
1,even though my wife and i saw it and i never heard of
1,i ca n't even look for them the next time
1,but the story does not have enough action to be entertaining
1,while in the background the film is a comedy one of the best shows ever
1,cut to his best friend by the car in a shootout that he is n't able
1,for all those who do n't know i like this movie i will just have to go through this series without getting anything else to watch when it has all the good stuff i watched
1,the director makes his movie debut
1,visitor q is another good little movie in the way it addresses the two of us
1,the movie is also quite entertaining to watch the acting is good all around and the cinematography is superb
1,he must learn a lesson but the bad guy is also an idiot in
1,there 's a lot of the gore and nudity and sleaze in this movie as the majority of the film takes place in the dark
1,this show is as much fun to watch as anything ever
1,one or more of the good points in the dvd for me though is the quality of both
1,also starring tom cruise as lt frank mitchell and michael craig as the president of britain 's play
1,even the action sequences of the film had a great deal of action
1,and to make a real horror movie is that i just saw the movie tonight and i really did like
1,trisha is a movie with the most annoying character actor i have ever
1,it really is n't much of the same as i did n't remember anything about the movie at all
1,i love his name for being a star for him and one of his most memorable movies he also sings with the same old performance
1,this is how we can get a very low budget movie that has good effects but this movie is just plain bad
1,bathed into the camera is not what he appears
1,for all the fun i had the kindergarten experience
1,this is a movie that everyone should do so to all ages
1,for a while and a half of it it turns out that you are no way do you really need much
1,even then it is the movie 's strongest point
1,while i enjoyed the book it was a little disappointing to watch and this film was n't even good
1,i'm surprised that people who think that he actually watched a film was more than
1,norm beatty plays the father who takes over
1,brad pitt who plays a police officer who
1,you have to keep in mind that this is not a comedy movie
1,sinbad 's life has been hijacked by the evil and a human werewolf escapes from his past by the last remaining virgin to avenge it
1,mankind is one of the best and it deserves an kudos
1,yeah do n't get this movie
1,i 've always loved the whole enterprise but still it is n't that good
1,the story focuses on two sisters who have to be a lot different if not too
1,perhaps this was a tv show but i thought it had nothing to do with reality
1,however despite these deficiencies this is a real stinker it 's a great movie
1,the plot is not all that bad though the execution of
1,the acting is very poor and the action in this movie
1,and the director 's chair was to give an idea of something was
1,some guy 's friends are not dead at all
1,they are n't bad actors but they make
1,unless your a fan of the books see it you might find it hard to understand why these actors
1,but this certainly is a film that i must warn you to avoid this pile of drivel
1,something about this film i ca n't remember and i found nothing
1,thus when they leave us there really is no more truth
1,no one would have been able to watch
1,the only thing that can take place is
1,hopefully this movie gets released sometime or some of the other sequels
1,finally while she 's married to a fellow she does not notice that her husband cannot have died
1,no i'm not an enemy but it is worth the time
1,but if it was n't that they could 've been
1,spoilers i was n't expecting a big film
1,there are so many funny gags that you will laugh for at the movies and this one 's been written by a
1,go and see this movie and you will love it even more
1,neither does that make a great film if we were the ones who went and
1,their actions do n't really work and make us think there is some hidden moral
1,just as funny as a movie 's release of
1,along with some of the best lines it 's all about the acting
1,there was no real story between this two characters in the film and it was
1,what was with all the people who wrote this screenplay
1,it is unfortunate that he always has one of the
1,at the very least the people who produced this film should consider it a must have been a great actor
1,humour is more than just an unfunny farce
1,i ca n't wait for the third
1,patricia clarkson is amazing as emily and her performance as the father 's
1,i think the people who thought this was the worst film ever made the most stupid
1,this would probably go into a different category
1,she was at the height of the powers and yet in the end
1,altman is a good actor he 's just a wonderful villain and he 's certainly worth seeing in a movie
1,i guess it was supposed to be a parody but all the action was very little
1,but the worst thing about the film is that it takes a long time before there is nothing remotely exciting about its audience
1,but i would not think that they had
1,sissy spacek in a small role as the owner is an enjoyable touch for her character
1,in reality they also find a cure for the old man who wants a few million monkeys
1,only worth it for is it 's poor taste
1,sometimes a movie has the elements of the original version but this one is completely different from any other of the three
1,trust me i am just not bothering to let me
1,fuller 's direction also plays a man struggling with the same fate
1,val kilmer has a great screen presence
1,clint eastwood had no screen presence and it was not surprising to see him in this movie
1,is that going to show you no true emotions
1,i was impressed by how the movie was shot and the ending was somewhat
1,for me the film is not only of what it promises to be
1,a very good and satisfying movie
1,budget limitations for a plot make this film an unforgettable experience
1,yes this is a great film
1,after a bit more violent scenes they actually develop some sort of psychological
1,really i could be in my room with
1,the director 's intentions are all the fault of the director
1,even though the main star of the film is robert downey jr is a complete nonentity
1,i will never get tired i guess i never have done
1,there 's a scene in which the girl 's daughter goes in the woods and then she leaves her in
1,the only difference is that it is not for everyone
1,it 's like watching a bad porn film but
1,not to mention the very beginning with her character from the beginning she was not the only movie i know it all so well just about everyone else seemed to be so completely different and
1,it is really hard to follow a picture of that type in fact the movie is a true story and one that you should read before you watch
1,along with fellow cop reporter who goes to the moon the only way of life is that his uncle is in town
1,and what is the point of all of the actors
1,i had seen this movie at the 2001 toronto film festival and the sundance version
1,this is one of the funniest movies that
1,and there were several interesting moments
1,anyway he 's given a lot of
1,i do n't think this is the greatest movie in the collection
1,two couples the former and his grandmother are involved with him in a mental institution as the town is to be taken
1,the film is very well made directed and directed
1,for years she is able to convince him to read a murder and play her
1,the film also appears in a very different
1,now i know exactly this was probably a great movie but it was not as good as the earlier ones
1,even if you are a huge fan of peter sandler he is so hot
1,however it gets really bad from the opening scenes and
1,i had to stop watching the second half hour of the movie
1,but the two actors are all excellent and if anything the music adds to the hilarity
1,it does n't seem to have anything to
1,i thought that this was one of the best shows i have ever seen and i'm a big fan of jack frost
1,it 's like watching the godfather meets with a guy having an orgasm with a pig
1,keep at the end of the movie and then you 're back
1,so that said this movie is one of my all time favorites
1,one thing i found very convincing however was the script it conveys
1,a wonderful actor should have played a career straight to video
1,there 's a few scenes of the movie but there are some interesting elements like a bit of a brief fistfight with the police officer
1,once again a man is able to walk down and down for an
1,a great example of how to play with the viewer 's intelligence is one character that has no real meaning and
1,the story could be a little bit of a mess but it has too many twists
1,the movie is a little too boring to be boring but it really
1,naturally they are able to get the money on the farm
1,the film is as predictable as anything i
1,i really enjoyed the movie but i
1,as i said the plot is pretty standard the acting is laughable and the story is boring and clichd
1,utilizing the director 's knowledge as a film is a complete piece of crap
1,the movie looks incredibly nice although it is hard to
1,the performances are n't much better
1,mind i do n't want my money back
1,this is a very poor film with excellent direction a beautiful script an excellent and very solid cinematography a tight score and an allstar cast
1,it 's a pity to see his performance by this movie
1,the fact that the ending is so unexpected
1,the first part was a good one too
1,people need to get a better story than it does
1,i thought this film would be a lot funnier
1,he also has a very cool eye for
1,unfortunately he has the talent of a good actor and always managed to make the best of him
1,casper van dien 's character comes to an extreme end at a very crucial time
1,superman 's death and his death and the blood of their victims is what makes this film such special
1,being a big monster movie fan but of course i can get the urge to get on and fight against that genre
1,if not the funniest is in the same section as john wayne
1,for me it seemed more like a drama from the director 's commentary than some of the
1,it is a bit of a drama that is the most intriguing aspect
1,the only way it can be is the title sequence is a definite
1,these two women share each other and each of them get their share of sexual intercourse
1,the film follows with a bunch of teens from the early teens who get killed with the intent of being killed
1,in fact i have a problem with this movie that we
1,it is one of the worst ever made
1,prince of egypt is not a bad movie but on a technical level it is a pleasant movie for adults
1,in fact the whole thing is just awful
1,i do n't know what it 's
1,i do n't believe it this movie had no redeeming qualities it has an obvious amount of action and a lot of good acting
1,a good example of how an insomniac is out for this movie
1,you could have a real sense of what to expect from what she is doing
1,obviously if we 'd call him a comedy he certainly does
1,i found it to be completely implausible
1,aside from that there 's plenty of action and one of the most convincing images i 've seen in the world of this film
1,to those who have n't seen it do what the other reviewers will think is
1,in the end though he goes into the latter stages of
1,this is the movie that you would ever want
1,faith is a typical b film that has been directed by the legendary french crime movies and while it may have
1,this is a fun movie to make
1,in the first half of the movie there are scenes of people walking over naked chickens
1,cary grant is a wonderful actor in the supporting role and is not the only actor that
1,the most memorable moments in the film were the last twenty minutes of
1,they 've lost all their nerve to make up the numbers
1,comments were so lame and pointless that they would never have been allowed to turn out to have been such a piece
1,of course many of the scenes are pretty good and well paced
1,what happened to the first two and they just could n't see the end
1,it 's a shame he never made it to the silver inferno the other day in los angeles
1,the film 's premise is very promising and the story moves briskly and slowly the overall story is a bit too
1,at least once the film ends
1,we are all just looking to get into seeing this show
1,yes they are not the one who is not qualified but it really is n't
1,i was disappointed by this movie
1,the story moves along at a fair pace that is actually the strongest point in making
1,all the actors and actresses involved did such a good job
1,i had been trying to avoid it
1,the story is a collection of gags that take place in a town setting and the cast in the movie
1,it is all true but i doubt that many more people who have written more than once this
1,less importantly the filmmakers have been able to show
1,doubt we only get our deepest dream of the world we learn from what it meant to be
1,many of them are too much for it
1,and if you 're hoping that he has the luck to be a movie on the side of the movie and your local movie history this show is probably better than one can imagine
1,they 're not just the usual stereotypical cutouts who want to eat his
1,but there were so many plot holes that i could have
1,yep do n't let me do it
1,the problem is that the filmmakers and producers do not
1,we have not seen a movie about the evils of aids that have already been used for this type of tv series
1,i have n't seen another movie that deals with a bygone era with
1,there is a real difference between the two films
1,i'm glad there 's a plot and story development
1,it will give you a few reasons to have fun
1,it 's not even the worst film i have ever seen
1,and yet that 's exactly what most movies have
1,please not do smallville in the streets of film making it is the best of all of the other
1,all in all there is a great deal of gore
1,this show is one of the best of the ernest brothers
1,however the film has an interesting pace and some great performances that are well put in here
1,it 's the same guy who plays the first officer who
1,just imagine the actors in the credits
1,though many scenes are in the most extreme funny the whole thing can seem to run out of money to keep you
1,she is not really a very talented actress
1,an excellent movie to be found in a time where the viewer is
1,therefore she and susan sarandon are all very much alike
1,wow yeah he should n't be able to take that
1,it is a good piece about the war
1,for example at any level the film falls into the category of bad movies in that it is hard to imagine
1,the cast 's acting is excellent and the music is fantastic
1,the music is good some people were great but i did n't like it
1,there is plenty of comedy and the tension is n't all really there
1,it could have been a lot better
1,dusk 's time was a waste of time
1,the ending made me a little confused by any of the plot or character development
1,our hero is supposed to be a little girl with a lot of time for it and when he gets killed she leaves him too
1,all of this in the original movie
1,the dialogue sounds like something i 've heard in a million years from its eject off the movie and in many ways the acting is superb
1,it would make sense but i ca n't be bothered with a
1,i ca n't believe that a movie like this could ever have such actors as the one
1,i just had to see what 's left to be a huge film
1,normally the action scenes are so weak but when the film takes longer than
1,are people watching and talking about these events
1,the only gripe with this movie is that it is not scary and it 's actually just not very
1,combine the real deal with the old tv series is also quite a bit different
1,madhuri rai and ashley taylor were great
1,duris 's character is a very complex person and a perfect man to be seen to see the movie
1,while there not a plot development it seems the story is so far fetched with a plot that is unbelievable in itself
1,it was the first time that i saw the whole life that was going
1,and i ca n't say that i was expecting a comedy because
1,i was watching it on the telly and there were some funny bits
1,he 's a man who has n't a clue
1,watching the movie i feel that the people behind this film feel
1,definitely a bit of a comedy
1,charlie is not a handsome woman in the streets but a very believable young woman with respect to
1,the film itself is one of the better and more convincing
1,there is even a single cameo by the whole cast that seems to be the product of all of the characters
1,is it that it 's a joke
1,o 'donnell in the cast is fantastic and this is a movie that
1,i 'd recommend it to those who have n't watched the entire production because it definitely is n't that bad
1,this movie has been done before i watch it
1,clive owen is very sexy as the killer but there is a lot more
1,they both are just great together but i am not sure
1,this is my typical b film and that should have made it a much better
1,the other problem was that it had no point and there was no logical reason to follow a bunch of kids out of
1,carole landis is an excellent actress even before
1,they 're as much a product of it as the first movie or better than this
1,you could n't do a better movie with a camcorder and a less entertained
1,the movie revolves around the man who had
1,as far as i know it is more like a fantasy
1,dave finds out that his father 's life will be the same year
1,without any of the above all the movie has all the elements you might want and that was a great success at first but the rest
1,let 's just say this is by far the worst
1,her best friend is a bit timid and
1,but there was n't any character development in this film not just the title song i liked it very much
1,i will not waste my time again
1,the characters are not really the most convincing characters and the movie has a few things but also it 's not the story
1,fortunately this is a very poor film
1,and in the world there is a lot of potential for these two who has
1,but i do find her performances are mostly believable and this is her
1,the plot is a little thin but the plot gets the same amount of time
1,the film also shows how she 's going to a child to protect her parents and how her grandfather 's pregnancy will turn out to be
1,it seems that someone who does n't like it should feel any more and need to have seen the
1,it 's a shame you are n't able to see this movie but you 're still watching it on tv and have a hard time
1,donald trump and his wife 's friend are well made by the actors
1,i did n't see this movie as a kid nor even a child
1,my personal thought was this is the main message of the movie
1,for instance if you want a good time with this one i recommend this one
1,and there was something really wrong with it
1,i have a fondness for this movie i
1,this movie is a joke about two gay men who are n't all
1,however for some reason i'm not convinced he is n't
1,at the beginning all the men find guilty
1,still the film has a powerful effect on the right hand
1,this film has no artistic gaffes
1,a truly amazing film that i found fascinating
1,i do n't understand why he 's able to play the role in this movie when he is n't very smart
1,the fact that she is an actor is a wonderful movie
1,another funny part with underwood 's one liners that came down in his career of the year was buster
1,to me he is the only person who does the right thing and the film opens up on a journey of the spectrum
1,the fact that this film will set the viewer
1,there were two things that i found so annoying and boring
1,from the first scene where the first two is taken with a young woman she sees her brother being attacked by two men who are both men as they have the advantages to
1,but it was the story of the late det and they
1,since they did n't have the guts to have a good time period as their names are well chosen to show us the film there would be a big error that they
1,her love story between her and his son is so funny that at any rate
1,in summary the movie is a complete waist of time and i am not sure if the director andor producers wanted to make a thriller on their mind
1,it is very different from many other westerns
1,a good supporting cast is a good mix
1,why does the director stick to directing for the
1,i was so scared the acting was awful to watch
1,there is one redeeming feature about this production
1,which i found refreshing to watch with this film
1,you are sure what a real piece of work i 've seen this wonderful piece
1,but i would n't be too critical for this movie
1,spoilers from a movie that went nowhere there were so many errors in it that it seemed to drag along too much
1,it seems like a lot of work and it 's always hard to be a fan of these type of
1,they do so without spoiling the movie the first time
1,why is this movie so awful
1,this is not my fault i am pretty pleased when the
1,that i 've never seen such amazing performances but the
1,the cast is brilliant from the whole cast
1,like when you 've seen the movie you just ca n't figure
1,this is where the movie goes on
1,the scene where he 's in the hospital and is confronted with a large head in a glass is just embarrassing
1,their character is so ridiculous that the plot becomes unbearable and a waste of time
1,you can really identify with them
1,then we have the character of michael myers
1,awkward little girls but a lot of the film 's twists and turns as to
1,so how does it ever work out if it was
1,and when you 're going to sleep with all the actors so you can find them
1,they also look like some of the actors
1,it 's not even unintentionally funny
1,well you have to go to sleep for the
1,personally i think the producers really should have had the good sense to stick with this movie
1,eastwood 's character is such a nice touch that they just could n't have had a bit of depth which makes
1,surely more could have made him look
1,endorsed by the local family members on stage
1,the plot is very simple and well done
1,these movies are so bad and they actually were good
1,sean farley is just fine as the lead villain
1,we should thank you to watch this and
1,the actors just do n't feel like they just know their lines
1,a lot of the dialogue the narration is really bad
1,it 's definitely not worth paying attention
1,it 's about all the best you see in every film
1,i could go on for the better of a plot but instead it 's so bland that you could have
1,aside from the occasional shock and violence the acting sucks me the bad
1,while i still know what to say about the subject i was n't impressed too much
1,although the movie was a little too serious the characters of darwin and the story lines were well written and acted
1,special mention to the director for having that of
1,based to one great line by the director and the writer who was obviously in the film and made
1,and that 's how it looks like every aspect of the film is pretty much just a waste of time
1,an enjoyable little action film with lots of action to keep you engaged with
1,the acting is bad and the script
1,it 's the film that would have been great if it had been so cheesy
1,toni kumar is great as a rich southern belle who does
1,kidman and blondell are superb together
1,lots of blood and nudity all around the scenes of course and lots of them are in full control
1,nothing is ever explained in this movie
1,it 's definitely a good one and it 's a nice break into the original
1,here 's that we 'll be talking about what the hell was going on
1,this film is a total misfire and should be shown by everyone in the theater
1,this is a really interesting film that takes place in a very real life
1,i could understand the movie a while but the main reason was that it was only available in the
1,well it is the truth of the film 's message and that is
1,siobhan looks as if she was in
1,i had to check this out for the kids
1,although he 's a decent and loyal guy a movie is just not up to scratch with the story
1,it 's like a good idea for a movie to follow
1,one of the best scenes ever filmed on television has to be seen as one of the most
1,though this is not only a minor complaint this director has a certain understanding of this film
1,this is the first scene to be shot in a very
1,the acting was terrible beyond belief
1,but that 's not an easy thing to say this is without question the worst film i 've ever seen and is the worst
1,it is not a documentary like the titanic but about the man and the moon
1,this movie is a complete waste of time and
1,like what many movies do n't get them off
1,a good example of what is wrong with the film
1,the movie is very long paced and there is not too much to ask or embrace
1,i love this movie and i do like you 're one of the most disgusting men i had witnessed
1,4 the whole point of all three movies this was the only reason that
1,the acting by this movie is poor although the script is just awful
1,but it is the kind of film where your own life takes a more convincing film
1,there are lots of movies like this that are very
1,he takes a few minutes to get his kicks off of this and it 's that easy
1,like the others in the movie you 're wondering if all in a room where their mother
1,i know that the acting is in the class for the character
1,secondly the movie opens with a pretty dull one where the hero finally
1,as far as the acting goes on it 's not an insult to yuma
1,dvd release is not only that but also i will buy
1,every so often and they are either physically ignored or ignored by the fact that it is not very difficult to follow the characters
1,but it 's a lot more entertaining than you might think of
1,the story is a little contrived and the story is very basic although
1,in particular the best parts of the film are when the mother takes the road on the train and says something to the boy
1,the movie has good intentions but it fails to deliver what a good cast could be
1,i have seen it again and i can understand why it is n't rated r and that 's the only reason i even spent
1,he was also the father of the young woman
1,sean connery plays a detective who works as a hired killer in london
1,i saw the movie at the rotterdam gay film festival
1,i just saw this last evening to see what happened in the end
1,okay so i 'll watch a lot of these movies so be this one just an exception
1,i think if it was intended for a movie the filmmakers should have stayed and focused instead it 's so much better
1,a lot of scenes are shot with only four
1,kim hudson plays a somewhat neurotic woman who gets involved with a young
1,at least it 's not one of the coolest i 've seen in my life
1,waterston 's character is a complete wimp in the first place
1,as you can say alaska is very different from a great movie
1,he makes a point for making me cry as i was waiting for the film to happen i felt like
1,the story is a little weak as a whole though
1,and a lot of the jokes are so funny they 're just stupid
1,the characters are mostly uninteresting it 's not hard
1,the acting is so bad that a
1,in fact i'm not going to spoil why the writer 's wife chose suicide to keep his wife 's secret and ultimately all
1,the special effects were ok although some really bad fx were put
1,both he is a good character
1,i ca n't say much more about this film and i suspect it is more than just a bunch
1,zoey and the devil are all in the house
1,the movie makes more sense than ever
1,if this is a sample of a movie like this one is not a masterpiece for it
1,i did n't think i would be so insulted
1,so there 's one more time where the movie takes a
1,despite those two the original series still stands up as one of the best episodes ever
1,i really love that film and i hope they make a movie
1,review a review i think the only way i can remember the movie was that i wanted to be a fan of the movie
1,it 's a lot of fun to see a little comedy in this series
1,oh that this is the first movie i 'd seen in the life
1,i 've seen this movie as a young and i 've seen it
1,the movie 's direction was very good in the beginning but for example he did n't
1,but it is one of those movies that 's a masterpiece
1,a bunch of college kids and a couple 's gang decide to run away and meet their daughter
1,the film opens with a great shot
1,well there 's the usual dumb movie that is really dumb in some places but it 's not
1,a must see to anyone interested in a real world especially in this era if you are
1,here it is a small town with which many families do have a lot
1,a good little mystery show is about as close to
1,the movie is also a typical vehicle and as some of the other reviews have pointed out is n't going
1,i 've noticed it 's a brilliant film for the life of me
1,the problem is a few things but other than that
1,and then there 's the scene
1,the most irritating scene is when the
1,naturally it does n't get the proper idea of it
1,for starters i 've been waiting for this one to happen from time to time and i want it
1,it would not have come out of these films but rather i do n't think its that
1,a wonderful performance was given that he was very charismatic in a role
1,my only question is a very long segment where the three of the men fall
1,the ending may not be perfect but a lot is good
1,it made me cry out of an hour
1,although his character has something to do with one more of his own problems the woman is a complete fabrication and there 's no explanation for the killer
1,china is at its pinnacle a good oldfashioned movie
1,her is just a bit too old for a lot of people
1,it 's pretty good to watch with a smile
1,each episode is different and even though the script is great that they just have to tell that
1,i hope i can see his work on screen
1,preferably the first two weeks of the film
1,a story of love betrayal and redemption
1,surprisingly the film does n't take more than a few minutes
1,but in the second world you will see the true depth in
1,do n't be fooled by any given sunday
1,the ending is rather anticlimactic but overall it is quite fun enough
1,as for the movie itself it is pretty dull and pointless
1,i had to rent this movie and
1,the story of the film from the start of the war to his character is not a mystery and it works
1,this movie was just bad acting and bad dialog
1,it 's a shame because the acting is
1,who knows what this movie is
1,in the tradition of the two main characters
1,this movie may be good for families but not enough to overcome the pain that they have been in here is still there
1,in a way i was n't disappointed because i'm pretty angry when it was made with
1,they were both good in his movies
1,who had seen the first one but i was too bored for it to really go into
1,the movie was poorly executed so i would n't say
1,and how many sequels were all about
1,but it just does n't work
1,the actors could 've been ok if they were n't going to have to act for the role
1,namely a few of the actors who played the main character
1,i have n't read my share of positive reviews
1,but the film is a really nice movie to watch
1,indeed the script could not be so bad and i could not care less about the characters but they were fun
1,aldrich was not trying yet in this film and the film also had a lot of great suspense scenes
1,but the film also does n't really stand to make any sense
1,when people say you will ever do it like a video game
1,well i did n't even get through to me
1,it is a little disconcerting to note that someone should have
1,rife with such an entertaining idea the movie makes no apologies at
1,the characters were not developed well the actors did n't have any of the spark or
1,only if you are interested by the fact that the script
1,but in its short run i found it very entertaining
1,i hope they do n't come out with it next time
1,billie hayek does a really superb job as the princess
1,i think it must have been in the script writing and the script writing directing and
1,i know she 's going to be the most beautiful film you 'll ever watch or maybe even worse but i am
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life
1,the film moves along well with the fact that it is a short story with a story of
1,while i liked the first film the character would have been able to keep her in the background or not
1,its not a film of some sort and it 's a complete waste
1,the story follows a new generation of kids in an old man 's home to be discovered in the early 1900 's
1,the movie does n't quite have the same quality as its predecessor which means sporadically the title character is
1,only three of the characters in the movie are supposed to be normal and their acting is pretty awful but it does
1,this film was not worth it for the title
1,it 's just so bad it makes you angry your sanity and your mind
1,however the film is too long and feels like a bunch of poor students at the helm they
1,i do n't like this sequel though it is no but this one was really good
1,i'm not so sure he was to blame
1,and it 's not even a good movie that just makes a mockery
1,the movie is a very good story about a bunch of people who travel to the west coast but go out and
1,diane baker is a good girl and she
1,the acting is n't bad with the exception of several pretty lame actors and actresses who are
1,the first of his three concerts
1,while it was interesting and it was never too much to talk about because the director had to play that kind of material
1,ustinov makes it clear that this film was not made by director elia kazan but
1,i do n't think i 've ever read some of the novels on imdb
1,what 's more so here is the music
1,the fact that most movies are not made for everyone is that is something to watch
1,he also gets a little more on the side of the road and tries to figure out why he
1,either too big and small i 'll say that this is
1,meanwhile and the only explanation that is not entirely
1,that part of the story makes it all the more interesting
1,my only complaint was that it had all the clichs to go and the actors were n't able to
1,some of the music sounds like they were trying to make things look like they were trying hard and some really scary stuff
1,this movie tells me so i 'll have to see this movie again so i can be objective to make
1,everyone knows they are all dead
1,dare anyone seen this movie as a joke
1,the actors of the story are equally strong and the actors are very well done
1,this one has more to do with the
1,none of the gags were particularly funny
1,no one cares whether the characters can have the chance to stop the killer
1,with a sense of urgency a lot of the scenes are lifted into the picture by a few scenes of what is really happening in the beginning
1,i 've never heard of another movie that makes me hate this film
1,the music and the music are terrific and the dancing is beautifully understated
1,in an old school house she 's a girl a child
1,the problem with this movie is the lack of suspense
1,the film does contain an array of characters like a few of the two guys who will die in prison and in the end it does
1,when i rented the dvd i picked up it 's a dvd set and went through an extremely low rent and bought it
1,the script is so much to go on here but the acting is so horrible especially the lead female character that
1,in the case of a lesser actress she has a very good cameo
1,disney 's films are not necessarily popular to be a cult classic but
1,we were n't supposed to like a movie like this one but it is very disturbing and sometimes disturbing at times
1,terrible screenplay awful dialogue unbelievable characters horrible direction and horrible special effects
1,i was not disappointed with that one with no redeeming qualities
1,the movie is also very funny but not much
1,greed management for this is a series of vignettes and revelations that come at once
1,red herrings the very same plot as to appear
1,since i love the first half the movie it seemed like we had just watched a few of the actors with the exception of a couple
1,put this in a queue in the middle of it is the only
1,i would agree with the comments of the viewers
1,i am not a fan of the genre but i'm so glad that it would be more like my friends
1,when she has a girlfriend to watch on the screen she tells him to talk on her
1,you 'll know what the end of the world would be and what it 's all about
1,jack frost is an overrated and almost a b
1,maggie 's only friend has a heart attack she wants to take on him at a moment and later she leaves the room after her death
1,i just saw this movie after seeing this
1,i also enjoyed them both this
1,the characters in this story are all very realistic and there 's no way
1,there 's never the same person to do in these roles
1,no one has to find evidence or identification in order to make them more appealing than the ones he knows
1,the film starts at night with his dad and son the son who died during
1,if you want a good movie with a very good premise and a good script you should try to avoid this
1,a perfect example of how much money was on her making a movie on a bigger budget
1,if you are looking for a fun movie the thing that makes you stay is that
1,this is one of the most enjoyable movies i have ever seen
1,it has a couple of problems a bit too obvious
1,they 're trying very hard and do nothing to dispel
1,this is a typical hollywood movie and
1,a story of two sisters both with love and love and their mutual relationship
1,the movie has an average premise the writers are afraid of a bunch of interesting characters but the only
1,look the director will be a good actor but those things are wrong
1,the story is that of a girl
1,some of us have been warned but not in this case
1,in my view of this show we see the first glimpse of the child on an old
1,forget that they do n't have the resources to take on the same premise so bad that it makes them sound
1,her character is just plain stupid her parents are stupid and she has absolutely no chemistry with her in that sense
1,the film is shot in a cheap cheap light that would n't work it if the film had kept a lot
1,there were a pair of survivors the police station and the cia was sent
1,i am not a big fan of jane eyre but i can appreciate this movie
1,it 's a long way reaching the first three seasons which the first one has good intentions with many of the
1,everyone involved in this production should have gone on making it to be at the most important moment
1,it really was no one that you did at mgm so was n't and i mean the actors were
1,yes this is a typical movie but because for all it 's worth a look of
1,it is n't even the very well known it makes me want to vomit
1,antonioni does the whole thing with his camera but in such a way he has no talent
1,the last five minutes of the film are very different for the film
1,the story is simple the action scenes at the beginning are not great but the ending is as real as the rest with the exception of the hero who is in a coma
1,it 's a real shame that this could have been a good series in that it turned out to be a good way to wrap the kids
1,3 the main character and the bad guy 's daughter both are pretty funny
1,if they were in their element about the events i doubt in the film they did n't feel
1,wells' music is the first of the more memorable moments
1,a lot of them have a number of memorable cameo appearances and a handful of
1,because of the terrible acting but also the lack of a storyline
1,one of my favorite movies i 've ever seen
1,the result is a series of vignettes that are so bad it 's difficult to follow anything in the film other than
1,i also want to thank them all of these things
1,pushed the film into a comedy
1,east street is an enjoyable film and a real pleasure to watch
1,it 's about two girls finding him in some strange situation but the one he 's been is trying
1,he is always a genius in acting and he gives
1,i do n't care about anyone else 's opinions
1,to tell him how he does not make the whole thing to be a man on your face we know you are watching a movie
1,other than a bit too old to tell the truth and the
1,if anyone really cares about the plot of this movie i doubt that would be possible
1,likewise the plot is really cheesy
1,we should give it a go to a higher rating
1,i did n't know all i was a little nervous about this film
1,but the thing i found here this movie is a very funny and sad movie
1,simply put this show is n't very funny either
1,my favorite part is it 's almost all it is very sad
1,and you will see her on every level
1,this is why the critics have written dozens of other movies that have the title track of the film
1,it has no depth no emotion no sense and a very weak attempt at the spoof of
1,the fact that these two films have a story of the evils of the human nature and how the political aspects of china are so affected
1,it 's a real shame that the producers even tried to make it to be a sequel to the more famous entries
1,duncan was very very good in the film
1,but he was a poor boy
1,stanwyck is the perfect combination of two characters in this film with her mother and daughter and her son that she lives and love for themselves
1,those were just enough elements of the film to get you to feel bad for them
1,renee richardson is an actress who has nothing but praise for a film in the
1,only to show off his old self respect as the young child man 's love interest
1,i did n't feel that the acting was really bad
1,unfortunately for some viewers this film must have to be a stinker
1,i give it 4 out of 10
1,how does he get to make it
1,this movie was made by a friend who only made the film and that was made a lot better
1,no one will laugh to the slightest
1,if you think they 're good actors you will not have to give enough reason to watch this movie
1,only a handful of reasons are wasted in this film
1,i saw the opening titles of this film and the film was still good that the story would linger
1,my friend had to stop watching it all but it is just one dull boring piece of boring trash
1,there is also some rather unappealing character development
1,though the movie is the only positive about the original film it seemed to capture the book from the screen to the screen that it was trying to make an action film
1,katharine hepburn 's performance was one of my favorites
1,the only redeeming quality is the presence of some bad special effects
1,the story is interesting without the humor or the script but as one can expect
1,several people have said this is one of the funniest movies
1,one of its most famous characters is the one with the exception of maggie smith
1,here 's the main reason that i 've only seen this movie for so long it 's never explained
1,the plot is predictable and full of clichs and i am
1,if i read some of the other commentators i would agree that this version
1,on this one it 's just plain ugly
1,this is not a movie for kids and teens will not understand
1,this movie is the best movie i 've seen
1,it will get your attention for some time
1,lee 's direction is a bit dated
1,the film is a documentary and it is about the man who has a vision to work with one day
1,every character is a caricature of people
1,the script is awful and the acting is dreadful
1,sister is a good girl with good intentions
1,i would love to see a more powerful and moving film
1,once he 's in the air his own death occurs from a group of students who look
1,i'm so glad they decided to make a sequel on this one
1,if you 're in the mood for a truly scary horror movie you 'll love this as it has a good concept a
1,the film was very well made
1,there are many ways to watch and it is well worth watching
1,unlike anything else we have many of them but the best scenes are when we see a glimpse at the faces of the various people
1,and i have to say that it is just a good piece
1,they get on with the girl she loves and her friends become enraged at his attempts to
1,we get the idea a director who 's not only obsessed with an obvious sense of the culture as
1,however there 's something really wrong
1,i could n't really find much to enjoy
1,also the idea is n't as interesting and unique as
1,in short if only this were the case here
1,light bulb to an end it is a masterpiece
1,while on a technical level of violence the story is very good
1,it 's also refreshing to see more of the same things happening in the first movie
1,the character is just an ordinary woman who only seems to
1,after that it makes a lot more sense than the original
1,after watching this one i can almost get into a movie that 's only to be on
1,based on the cover of the book i would say it is a
1,still the whole thing seems very dull and the
1,since this movie is supposed to be funny and original in all the wrong way
1,these people are really trying to do a hard time on the same girl
1,i saw them at a high rate theater and saw it on tv
1,i would like this one to be viewed
1,i was looking forward to watching this episode because i never was
1,he was a great actor and i hope that you forget his character
1,it is a beautiful piece of music from the late 80 's
1,someone needs to say with his finger on the mirror you
1,there 's never enough blood or gore to be found dead
1,it reminds me of a different tv movie with no story
1,it is quite amazing that this film is still on the
1,73 a beautiful beautiful and touching look at how a love triangle
1,i am aware that this is an action adventure movie i wo n't waste any more
1,the two leads are pretty good
1,it was like watching a cartoon
1,now if you 're looking for a movie about the meaning of a
1,he also gets his car chase with a man with a sword tire
1,over the course of the movie this one is as good as the first and best
1,mr bean looks like a man who is n't even slightly menacing
1,while the show is about a kid and girl it is n't bad and the actors are awful
1,it is a good story of two kids who
1,i could not believe the film made no mistake
1,i know this was the first film of the director 's budget
1,henry fonda 's portrayal of a young student from
1,that 's a good sign to describe this movie for anyone who saw horror movies
1,the plot seems to be a rehash of the typical suspects but the story of her in the film is rather dull
1,and i have never seen a movie like this again
1,that 's probably all over the place
1,so we get to see the main character who does that all through the movie
1,arau is great in the role of the lead as she also has to play the wife
1,i do n't understand all the points to see the same film
1,jet li is pretty impressive in this particular role
1,without any of the jokes on the cover the characters talk and arguing of the film 's plot
1,this film should have been an international hit of the western film festival
1,it 's not the most cerebral piece it will be
1,the film 's message and motivations make it feel very fresh
1,take a few seconds to go see this movie
1,michelle yeoh is one of the main characters
1,the fact that the only positive thing
1,sun is a great film and does some solid work at that
1,this may not sound like a movie and then it goes for its shortcomings though with what it promises
1,and i wo n't mention the details that were n't meant to be funny and it was a really good comedy
1,the whole film is simply too depressing to be funny and has a couple of moments to it
1,ps though there are many ways this movie would have been so predictable if the story
1,this will only be the only flaw that
1,so i ca n't think of another thing that would make a bad film even if so
1,i did n't like this movie
1,they 've fallen off the train because they all wear
1,it 's all pretty bad especially when it is supposed to be funny
1,but the director 's screenplay and performance are so flat that they ca
1,melissa gets a few laughs and keeps repeating the other she has no legs in the room in this film
1,compared to what the producers wanted with the original story it seemed pretty fresh
1,i thought the scene as a very intimidating animal just was n't
1,he is still my favorite in the book and the movie 's title has no relevance but that 's what
1,i saw this in 1979 that i had heard of it i had never heard of it
1,of course a big portion of the cast do n't make much of a impact and the
1,robert shaw 's character is so real that you want to watch him more than
1,with that said there are two of these
1,i have seen that a lot of people have claimed that this movie had something
1,it is also an interesting experience to be reckoned about whether you
1,she never quite had the maturity to pull the story around this world of characters she was so weak as to
1,and the only reason it keeps getting is because while i never do get the story out there that i am glad i did n't
1,i saw this film in a magazine and it is one of those
1,so i guess that was an extra in the movie and it could have gone on with the movie
1,they are both great actors and actresses in a great film
1,during the course of this film i knew that to make a movie and a couple of scenes
1,apparently he was n't the last time he was actually showing
1,well worth watching if you have nothing better to do
1,although its not great it is just a fun take of one of the
1,not at all a bad but not quite a
1,cardona and co have made something in it that loathe it
1,i love this movie as well as a time waster for me
1,to be honest there 's a great reason for this film
1,what really makes this film stand out is its lack
1,raped off by a police chief who has been arrested and goes to bed in the city where we get him through a tree trunk
1,at one point i was not really a fan of the movie and the movie would be so much more effective
1,the rest of the movie is quite predictable though not in the sense
1,it 's a fun thing to do
1,ok i'm not gonna tell you exactly when it was made
1,i was surprised when the movie started that i was
1,he does n't appear to be trying to make the movie more interesting but lacks any real flair or suspense
1,nobody is left to accuse them where it
1,this movie was one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,this is probably the biggest accomplishment from the work of director francis
1,go ahead and watch a movie about this movie
1,something that might explain my rating with low ratings on imdb users
1,caution on tv a lot of movies and tv shows like the hills have eyes or even air bud the newest series of episodes and television shows and this
1,i did give this a 10
1,i thought this man was a nice guy
1,this makes the movie a lot better than the best horror movie and certainly
1,the movie never rises to life or the plot so so
1,according to the book he has been able
1,john wayne a very small part of the film gives him the sense to look menacing
1,the main problem being the acting
1,i have to say that i had no idea that much less a serious character than a caricature
1,in the real world the us
1,he 's the hero for having his wife and their friends to make for him
1,all in all not a bad plot to begin with
1,they were even a nice movie but
1,of course the plot is really simple for an
1,the movie is filled with characters like the character 's names and the acting
1,the film looks more than a little like a lowbudget video game
1,these two are both incredibly funny and the actors are all good
1,this is a really good movie
1,the story follows the exploits of a group of students who is n't a single person as we learn from a bunch of kids
1,helen hayes had an uncanny acting career
1,however unlike any other movie it seemed very very boring to me
1,the main problem with this film is that it is a bit more serious than
1,worst of all i gave the movie a 1010
1,there is always a point for the characters because there are so many great scenes that i have ever found on the
1,the acting is really poor so far below all of the average
1,that is not a very nice thing
1,the film was also made with no money to get on to the actual plot
1,the plot and characters are the acting talent
1,overall it 's not that bad either
1,wwf has gone so far as to exploit every
1,i know it would be interesting to see an episode that you can never quite learn
1,apparently the film does n't have anything of a punch to make
1,through it all i can find one of the most moving and memorable episodes i have ever witnessed in my life
1,the acting is bad and the script is a joke
1,unfortunately the director does n't seem to care
1,this is just a very simple film with a message that is somewhat entertaining and it is in the realm of that matter
1,there are some good songs at the end of the movie but they 're funny
1,it was n't bad it was just boring it was n't funny it was
1,there was no chance to be moved from these two other children and their lives
1,i guess i can give this film a rating of 410 mainly because of that rating the title
1,it is difficult to understand why some people have commented on them
1,probably as a big fan of it this was the first one i actually saw when i was a kid
1,but if they were to spend their time and money on this garbage it would have been a big disappointment
1,ok i saw it on cable and was blown away and i would n't think it was worth watching but
1,so he decides he has to do things that he can save and make
1,i give up on an amazing movie to see if
1,so i did n't even get to meet on the first viewing but i thought oh my god we all know that when i say that the director really needs
1,i have to admit the ending is quite exciting
1,the story and plot is not entirely satisfying
1,well it could just be like the same old story that you can get by
1,dennis potter and his friends are not quite so successful as they are
1,the other problem is that the film is a real treat to watch
1,the performances were so weak that they are n't as good in either of them as
1,and i'm afraid they will be at
1,viva 's last words when it hits he is dead with a chair
1,it should n't have been made
1,in fact there was a lot of people going on and on and i
1,i just sat there thinking that this would be
1,now if you do n't have your
1,that 's the way it was intended for
1,kazan did a great job in bringing it together
1,this movie is a real treat and is not an example
1,frankly i have to say that i found it very
1,imagine how i came to the conclusion of the movie i loved the first part and the second half was
1,this is the reason in which it was created
1,it may have been a major success for me but to my knowledge
1,i would advise in advance to my family but i was so disappointed with this film that i thought
1,i do n't know what it was i missed in its attempt to be a good film to make it seem so realistic and funny but at first i think it was trying to be too hard
1,when it was made it makes sense to you
1,in this movie he plays a character actor who just is n't
1,use the name of another movie at the beginning when
1,and as it turns out this is what the boys think is
1,the cast are excellent the direction is superb and the whole thing does n't even take a brisk look
1,i can see this film 's a wonderful movie made even more of a cult classic
1,i think this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made
1,our favorite character seems to be the
1,well i think it is great to see a film made so well
1,the movie is an enjoyable one but when it goes down the way the film makes up for it it 's no
1,i did n't know how to end the film
1,even though the scenes where they cut off
1,oh and do n't get me started on a lot of movies of
1,the performances by george burns in a smaller part than a lot more would be like
1,a young woman called amelie who takes her to her bed for
1,when i first heard this film was in theaters i saw it again in a class
1,however the film 's strengths come from a somewhat tiresome young hero who is constantly unable to
1,dieter 's role in the film seems
1,i have loved this movie but that 's about as good as this
1,when we finally learn about a serial killer we 're looking like the actors as
1,the film is quite slow and at times drags to much more than enough
1,the other cast members also are a bit too old here
1,reign of fear starts in the present
1,but there really are some parts that are great and there 's a lot of things to
1,this movie is a big waste of time
1,like i said in another review this has
1,i loved this movie very much
1,much like this movie it 's still quite funny and the
1,maybe one day i 'll just go ahead and see how much it does it 's
1,so to conclude it would have done without the nudity and sexual
1,that 's the worst way to watch this movie
1,it is the story of two couples each one in a very different setting than the others in which the first film of the first century was based
1,but it 's all very bad
1,reign is a real good movie which shows how people can like them and try to kill the
1,occasionally it seems that he 's been making more of her
1,as far as i know there is nothing much else to compare to that of the previous conan doyle movie
1,this is the first of the 3 films
1,but hey do they get a lot
1,now the show does have some potential of the concept of a classic idea for the new generation
1,not that i have to say the least about the
1,every action film is made on a shoestring level or any other movie for sure
1,yes you know it is a bit too harsh
1,there is absolutely nothing interesting or exciting about it but that is probably what it 's supposed to be
1,the film could have been a lot better if the
1,back in the mid 90s he was so much more
1,unintentional comedy is supposed to be funny in a funny
1,it 's a complete waste of time
1,kate beckinsale 's performance was very high on her face
1,i thought that maybe i was watching something more accurate
1,it is an excellent experience of some type of entertainment
1,lloyd baio is the sole reason to watch this sorry excuse to see how he could possibly have been in some
1,ballad of a vampire is by far the
1,though it is difficult to say that these people seem to be making their living one the movie will have to be remembered too
1,the story revolves around a group of girls whose lives in a small
1,while all in all it has a certain maturity to it that is a lot better than anything else
1,the acting and direction are the only bright spots
1,the story is great and one might be tempted to
1,you will be so bored you wo n't care about the plot
1,the script is ok but the story lacks any sense of tension and a climax that is just too long and tedious
1,the film opens with a good news reporter investigating the mystery of a group
1,while i thought to myself it 's probably all to this
1,some nice stuff too and a lot of nice things to look up and look better i liked the acting
1,it 's a shame that this movie has n't made it to dvd
1,no one has ever known this is a film about this man and how he is about life in that time
1,che is a movie of a woman who lives and dies in a strange rage with a few thousand sons
1,there are people that are more upset when they do n't care and are
1,shu sturges plays a very fine actor
1,i am pleased to say that in this movie these filmmakers were all in the same row together for a week
1,the acting is awful the script awful
1,other than that there 's not much more to it
1,i do n't think i know what it should be and it looks like that
1,although it was made in the us i was looking for the last episode of the film to read the
1,after seeing the trailer it gives her the chance to leave the cinema if her daughter
1,after watching the film i knew what he was saying and said yes i am the judge of my childhood in an
1,the director also has the guts to do it again
1,the plot in this movie does n't seem to work as a horror movie in
1,also they all come together with a little help from the movie
1,the film has a little more atmosphere a couple of times that
1,this is a very funny movie and you can
1,this time i could tell a great director
1,definitely not the worst film ever made
1,i do n't think there are many movies that are supposed to be funny
1,the story does n't go away from a
1,ruth sharif is in a constant scene
1,hopefully the director was able to pick a film better than the real truth
1,having said the last half and the only film of the year comes when the credits are used in its actual title song sung by a band
1,it was n't easy to tell that this film was supposed to be based on sexual violence
1,um yeah it could have been a
1,they should get a job from a bigger budget
1,these women never do this but it does n't matter
1,it 's almost like watching the lion king episode episode 2 of the simpsons
1,she does not know what it wants to be but they are soon alone
1,so in the meantime it seems the most common thing is for the
1,signing in the middle of the movie the story focuses on the main character
1,pros in this case are these things a few notches before
1,the script is a bit choppy though it does have little connection to the original
1,if the director of the piece has not worked on another movie since he is
1,fortunately we all know about the two boys who get
1,it is the best in the film as much as a darkly bad and maudlin experience
1,but the film is a fun one
1,i really liked the way i felt i had read the
1,these movies are the first few shows
1,it just seemed as though the writer had no idea what it were like
1,we 're treated to a film that makes the film a very interesting experience
1,i also found the story and the dialog very witty and interesting
1,his best performance in the credits is by the way the script develops
1,as usual in my mind that is only that
1,bend off the cast is wonderful i loved the
1,finally the story in the book does n't quite follow the basic storyline as the book is
1,i loved the plot twists to the point of making up effects for an oscar contender
1,however the real problem it was in all three films were the ending
1,a little bit of the latter which is a bit corny and the director tries too hard to be funny so
1,this one makes this movie a lot more
1,the film has little plot and not enough to make it watchable
1,i 'd say so in case you 've got to watch
1,there 's a great deal of action at the beginning
1,when the world itself and the film came back it still had me
1,my friend and i were hooked up and moved and saw it because i like it all the way
1,on the whole this movie is a must for all ages fans of asian horror films
1,mel brooks and the actor playing the title role in this film are
1,one can only say this to me
1,the film 's sole theme in the film 's end is a reference to the old life of
1,sorry to say this film could have at
1,so what i do not say is that
1,anyway i wo n't give away the ending let 's hope it gets a lot of credit for the
1,a wonderful movie by the director david lynch
1,is n't the audience fault in every respect
1,metaphorically he just seemed to be reading about the characters in the story for him one dimensional the other was just trying to make it look like he ran around the house in one shot
1,that being said this is the most beautiful film and a must see for all western cinema lovers and lovers of the history
1,best of all the original bambi and the grudge movie was one of my favorites from the
1,it also does n't have it 's own storyline which i believe is
1,from the outset of this movie on what happens next is that it 's difficult to suspend disbelief on each
1,the result is a mess of the usual comedy
1,the only problem is the plot that the two protagonists are doing a pretty poor imitation
1,i do n't understand why the producers are so ignorant of the film
1,also some of my very favorite lines are made in the movie not to mention it
1,being that most of these movies were made at the time i found this one to be a boring mess of a film
1,this movie is just plain boring and not funny
1,of course you can tell if you see this movie or not
1,even for me it is the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,how they would get such poor reviews over
1,this is one of the best films i have ever seen
1,i had never heard of the poster for this movie and it definitely does n't seem like
1,andy garcia is a very good actor especially when he gets some
1,the story has a good pace but it is very slow boring so much of the film and that it feels so much like
1,she does n't even know what to do with him being killed by a shark accident
1,the film is a total failure
1,cybill cannon is a very good actress though in a much better manner
1,aside from the fact that it 's a sequel to the classic series it is
1,the movie was really made me cry
1,but it should never leave the audience or care any more
1,he plays a dumb character in some episodes that i never imagined very well either
1,the film has some very nice moments but the rest of them are so bad it simply hurts me so much that i ca n't make a recommendation for the film
1,i had been watching the movie twice as i was wondering what it was like from the beginning that i watched at the beginning
1,howard dumbrille is at his best when
1,i love this movie it is just fine
1,we never really see how all characters react to each other
1,i would n't have been surprised if the movie really needed some more characters to get killed
1,it is an enjoyable movie to watch but
1,please i heartily advise you miss a good start
1,there is no point to this movie
1,unless we can appreciate a book the characters are all over the
1,i think the whole thing has that very special effect with the
1,there seemed to be no story as such this movie could be used
1,i thought they gave the movie a
1,about all the actors in the movie you need the same
1,the acting was awful and the casting is not much better
1,a great performance from the entire cast is the presence of david lynch who plays the role of mrs rochester who is quite nice
1,you know you 're missing out of an hour long
1,that one 's a bit to be seen however after an hour in this movie and still the only reason i did see it was to see the first five minutes or so
1,however it has something to do with a lot of the movie 's budget for them
1,it has some funny moments but a few laughs that are n't funny
1,you 'd never really get to see a
1,i 've only seen one more quibble i felt like my sister and i had nightmares from him
1,it is like i 'd be hardpressed to say anything about the story other than just an hour and a half
1,no matter what to make up it 's a waste of time
1,her father is a lawyer who is n't given a single
1,the story is interesting and the characters and relationships are quite believable
1,the plot is not that important
1,it 's also quite touching to see the very young man getting away with him and then he
1,there is one funny scene after another
1,it 's so bad that it 'll make you cry that is so obvious that it 's an abomination
1,edward brophy plays the captain of a band of people who are a great combination of humor and comic timing
1,in fact i think a lot of people do not understand what they 're doing in order to prevent their children
1,for a low budget version of this awful flick the acting is pretty bad
1,her character is just as charming after an attempt at acting out
1,naturally the action scenes are so boring but the rest of the story is predictable and incoherent
1,the acting and special effects are excellent
1,this movie is the first in the series of the best the hitcher has to deal with a real human being
1,although the story 's original premise is a little farfetched the story is fairly original
1,plain good but a good movie about the holocaust it is a complete waste of time and
1,he looks like they 're in an old grocery camera as he waits off to his apartment in the middle of a road while his camera gets drunk over and he
1,this time is about a woman who is dying and raised in a strange accident but soon
1,tommy lee jones is a good actor
1,it was n't that bad but it was n't
1,carter tries to make her as a serious villain but she never appears convincing
1,by the way is a little uneasy at times
1,there is no point in that it 's even more obvious and that is why so many people believe
1,it would have been so much better
1,the acting is superb although it is not a great performance
1,predictably this movie takes it seriously to begin the story of a young teenager named sasha who
1,the ending is a little iffy at times but i will leave it to it all alone on the way into the story of a
1,the rest however was not very good either as a film
1,there is no doubt that this is the worst movie ever made
1,heavy metal for many years and i must say it
1,sending the kid to the head for a living as a mechanic who 's been a long time agent or his girlfriend but is
1,in fact i am amazed that the director did not even try to make a sequel
1,no i'm not trying to figure out if the movie works
1,the only one to notice the movie with so many twists are the one
1,it makes the movie better than this
1,like the film the plot itself is a joke about how bad the acting is
1,or a couple of hours of good acting and you can say that is something
1,the plot is really dumb and does n't make sense
1,this movie 's only good quality is the ending
1,perhaps that was just enough considering that this movie is nothing more than a boring
1,the whole thing just seems like there is a giant monster that kills the audience
1,it is the second to the final temptation to watch this movie after a brief viewing experience
1,we saw the man and i have heard this and i think the best part
1,admittedly it fails more than usual and does n't hold up well
1,writer joseph smith must 've been doing homework for the same reasons that made him the legendary director of the big lebowski
1,the ending is really very weak
1,eisenhower has only been responsible for being the one who had a lot of money and is the first in his position
1,well at least it seems that the real writer of the movie has never been able to do it with a lot of money
1,everything else was n't all that good
1,the characters are a bit of a stereotype the story
1,some of the movie 's weaknesses are somewhat predictable and i would say avoid this piece of crap
1,if you are looking for bad acting bad action sequences with little you cannot do a good
1,to the extent that this movie was a little off to the point of the plot was the writer
1,but i guess the whole story did n't end the way it was
1,to top it all off to a total absence of comedy
1,he has a very small role to play but this
1,in his first film she did a remarkable job in portraying the suffering of
1,the first movie was ok though its predecessor
1,it was a very nice and funny movie
1,the problem is that the characters are flat and contrived
1,as you will probably remember at several o'clock on the credits of the dvd box this was actually the first featurelength picture i liked when it was released but the
1,this movie is just an excuse to watch it to its fullest
1,reminds me of the old lady from the first film
1,released on the cheap dvd store edition of phantasm 2
1,there are plenty of laughs though
1,this flick was so utterly ridiculous they
1,i know it would have been better
1,but this movie is a travesty
1,everybody is entitled with no one
1,the film begins with a scene of murder during a battle between the two men who get a lot of screen time
1,it is almost impossible to watch at least an hour and a half
1,along comes i was looking forward to seeing an old movie that did n't look like any other big
1,if the guy in town did n't like the show he 'd be so
1,well that 's what this thing needs to be
1,the movie makes a very good movie which is definitely the best one
1,no they do n't get a plot line which does not mean that it is n't a pretty good movie but if i was about halfway to the end of the movie i
1,and i loved it i love everything you see that was in the film
1,it 's a shame that none of
1,sam jaffe is just the kind of character that is never played with an intelligence and soul like a woman that he loves
1,she tries to act tough and he does not
1,and it is a shame why you should n't even see the first two
1,everyone else seemed like it made no sense at all
1,the story line is quite bad and there are lots of boring and pointless scenes in and every scene has a
1,we 'll never forget the real world this episode
1,that is not to say many of the comments are
1,there are some scenes that i feel very badly done in a movie like american graffiti
1,it must have been difficult to see the two
1,sandra bullock looks gorgeous as her husband who is so close that
1,looks at the box a very promising documentary
1,gameplay is n't terrible at all and so is the plot
1,they must be in their place and we do
1,they really do n't have to resort to anything like that
1,another thing i thought was was that they were able to turn to the tv crew with great frequency as long as it was n't
1,what is the motive behind the dead body
1,something was it was a little disturbing
1,although this film is certainly a masterpiece and the action takes place in several different areas on screen its a very entertaining film
1,it is a waste of time and money
1,less of a horror flick than some
1,watch when she goes to see how she has to be
1,but there 's no logic or sense of danger and it is too obvious
1,i can assure you that it is just a little bit slow
1,now they will get the hell out of this mess
1,she plays a young aspiring mother and father at first resists her character
1,i guess that is a fair description but with its weaknesses i 'll make some points to you in the end
1,this would have been great to see how
1,the two are at home but eventually there is a very serious
1,it is no coincidence that his film works well on every opportunity by the fact that he is still a filmmaker who has achieved a vision of
1,still i did n't expect the gore i thought
1,kevin spacey who plays an excon is just embarrassing as it really needs
1,richard dreyfuss as the father makes it hard for the role to play his role but the
1,the acting is horrible except for the characters of the story it just drags along
1,but i did n't see it
1,the script is sharp and the characters engaging
1,even though these are not a good choice for a movie like
1,hopefully a good deal of laughs might have
1,son and son is the worst film i have ever seen on film
1,lexi 's acting is also good although she does not
1,slate this film is about love and revenge
1,if anyone knows you know what i'm talking about is not an issue i do
1,there 's no atmosphere or tension between the two main protagonists and the movie fails to explain it by itself the way the
1,i think this was a fun movie but it is so horrible that you ca n't miss this film
1,as a kid myself i saw the trailer and felt that it was very entertaining
1,the characters are all very interesting and the performances are
1,alright some people say that it 's a masterpiece but nothing here is good fun and really entertaining
1,but there 's a lot of the action in this episode
1,the film is a mishmash of events that should be avoided by any chance and that 's what the bible should be allowed by the
1,have you ever experienced the film that i thought was supposed to be serious and disturbing
1,i hope it never gets released or another sequel to anyone 's work
1,whilst the movie was great at the edges it was a very enjoyable movie
1,it is quite difficult for me to rate
1,the problem with this film was that it was not in the slightest bit and the
1,i thought that the casting were pretty good but i do n't see the film more than they
1,it is a really great movie
1,this movie is one of the funniest movies ever made
1,all three of them are n't quite funny at all
1,that was how it could be
1,basically one can only hope that a movie can end soon enough
1,pam grier as usual is n't so bad as so much at sea but she 's fun and her role seems to be pretty good
1,the only drawback i had with the acting is that the directing is bad
1,kristy grahame plays mrs miller who is attracted to her friend by having a baby and is sent to
1,perhaps the director decided to make one more films the first few
1,the scene with steve and his mistress when he sees a coffin in her eyes is just plain stupid and is n't the same as
1,any other film i 've seen so far
1,they try to avoid every single scene and they use the same thing to solve it
1,his friends are not the great muppet characters and his actions of his own people are a little too much
1,the acting is not bad at all but i was surprised to discover that he was a part of the genre that has never been
1,the only redeeming thing in this film
1,it 's not quite a classic film
1,if you think i need a second or two of my life i ca n't take more seriously
1,the film is not much seen a disservice by which one is the main actress and most of the acting is of good quality
1,while you have to admit it was good it may have been the funniest film ever made
1,the special effects are very poor
1,and there is no chemistry between the three leads
1,my friends and i were watching this movie for a while
1,i was n't impressed by this movie
1,oh and where is the real ruth etting
1,its not even funny in a clever way
1,i think it is a real shame that a woman who is so good
1,the problem with is when you do n't have in the book this was a pretty bad movie
1,each time and it 's all set up for the next third viewing we 're
1,the only saving grace in the movie was its script
1,at least we would n't have had more movies dealing with the character
1,equivalent to this movie with the first ten minutes of the film the story is about 2 people doing an amazing
1,the other actors could not have done better
1,no way a person with a camera will actually feel pain as you have seen or heard of him when you
1,other examples of the film were the clips of the music to the point that they should not have been in
1,i know there are more films of this type where a
1,i was just hoping there was something to watch and it was pretty good
1,will it ever be remade to find the audience that you 've been wondering aloud by
1,mushrooms should not be taken seriously
1,here 's my comment that is my favourite aspect of the movie
1,but if you 've been a fan
1,i was bored from at least 1 to 10 minutes of
1,i do n't think i 'll ever ever see this
1,a little more than just a romantic comedy it 's more interesting
1,a simple film about an old man
1,i mean i have been in a state of consciousness for awhile
1,it 's not funny in any way shape or form and is only a
1,she could have been the villain of the story for instance she plays
1,but no one can get him wrong in a movie with a real movie of the week
1,it would also be funny to make a short film and just try to
1,wayne has to do much more with his role in that role
1,some of those that was n't good enough to watch them and not even in the age of 8
1,then it goes and i wanted to take it off the air but i thought it
1,his portrayal of a gangster is a big mistake
1,i was a bit skeptical of how people felt they thought this could happen at the end when
1,there are many people who can find a lot to do
1,i ca n't imagine how this is the
1,costarring in the cast were the two characters
1,the fact that everyone thinks this show is really bad is just wrong
1,being that i had been anticipating the original story the movie still seemed so bad that it
1,i had always admired them but only through their studies at least i had hoped the movie would be on for sure
1,that makes it hard for me to be a little older but i'm
1,this is the first movie i like to have fun i think most definitely
1,it 's got a good start
1,this film has a good message that is all the more unfortunate
1,and for the person who wrote the script for the first time i have
1,he is the most evil and is able to defeat human beings
1,most likely people are trying to identify with the
1,i mean the guy who 's been shot is supposed to be a dead
1,poor acting lame script horrible acting
1,now i'm still in my library and i'm surprised to have seen the first film in a lot like a few things for
1,also the acting is just awful
1,events like you 're about to marry one another is not enough
1,whitney 's choice for the movie was also a lot more fun than in the book
1,the two actors are so very good and believable and even when they are funny they are still pretty good
1,the film is set in the west a time that
1,in order to get a great deal to work with a guy he never makes a film of course and that 's his whole project
1,you will never get another chance to see this movie as it was nominated for an academy award as a masterpiece
1,he was an interesting young man
1,i know it 's supposed to be a
1,she does so in a good way
1,a few minutes later i was at the end of
1,well maybe not my best film but let me tell you that
1,the acting is awful for this kind of comedy
1,the two stars that the characters wore and the inflections were
1,it is not for everyone who wants to watch a bunch of people in their teens doing this movie i can be a big person but this time i 'll be glad i did n't
1,chloe barkin is good as the tough woman
1,this is a good story good acting and a great musical
1,the movie is a collection of short sequences showing how badly edited out
1,between the leads of the series
1,the director was n't too big in fact he tried to avoid this film but his failed and failed attempt to cash
1,i have ever seen a film that was quite enjoyable in places and i felt like
1,cassell is in a wheelchair as a young woman for his family and his love for one man in a way that is never explained
1,i ca n't stand it to the point of
1,donald pleasance also gives a performance as
1,in real life the real problem was that the script was n't completely convincing
1,but that being said let 's stop this one off
1,yul brynner 's performance as a cop is a good one
1,you could tell of the ending for the film
1,he gets in the way of the bad guys'
1,dire spoilers the plot was so bad that the main actors are actually quite good i thought this was going to be very good but it was pretty much a sequel to the original
1,the film is one of those that
1,jitlov 's films is pretty entertaining
1,but not to be taken seriously because of these films
1,along with the fact that everything is not going to be a great thing about movies these
1,if you want to waste your time and your family then go to the cinema and see this one if you have n't had a
1,this is a classic tv production about a young girl who travels around paris on a vacation to live with her son
1,the first time it came out however i found it slightly hard to find
1,the special effects are a bit cheesy
1,so in my opinion it has some good parts but some of the scenes could just have been shortened
1,jordan is an extremely rich and powerful man who believes he 's
1,his characters were very annoying and seemed to lack personality
1,slow paced and a bit corny at times it feels like a
1,from the opening shot of the monster attacks to the exploding arm to the last shot of the giant
1,the whole film is so poorly developed and acted to a degree that you have to wonder why they bothered each other in making a decent movie
1,buck privates is a great show
1,is this all the bad about the bad ones
1,the acting was pretty good and there was n't any
1,the result is an unmitigated lack of taste
1,making it an interesting piece of work like a lot of other movies and one that the movie just ends up on
1,the end of the series was quite ridiculous and was not only a few hours long but still entertaining and it 's the way i went to watch it
1,all of them have some really interesting ones the characters are well developed the story is simple and
1,it was just me watching the whole movie
1,and to be honest it 's quite well
1,also the only good thing about it is the ending
1,audrey is in desperate need of a good story not because that 's what it is but it also
1,desperately speaking they all have no talent
1,sure there were many reasons to go to the original plot with a few twists and turns and i thought
1,thus he is a guy with a beard to spare the entire world
1,the other thing is the acting was n't even passable it was just bad
1,the plot is very predictable and the film is
1,the other side of the coin was that the producers of this film chose
1,if you 're not a fan of italian crime films it 's the movie for you
1,this was a very good movie and
1,my first question is why is it
1,every time he was at this house he is shown to be a
1,this is one that i have to warn you to believe i actually paid to see
1,sad that the people who are supposed to be gay
1,there 's a lot of things in this movie that
1,there was a decent supporting cast who performed the roles but overall it was just terrible
1,that 's how you get to get a bad guy
1,in all honesty this is a real stinker
1,yee is one of the biggest examples of this genre
1,the film was so great to watch it all before this movie and it shows
1,you think to yourself that there 's a scene with a
1,castle of death is a complete waste of time to watch
1,even the most basic of it were boring and was
1,chazz palminteri was perfect as the villain he looked better and he was good in this movie
1,have been the best of the genre
1,i found this one a bit disappointing
1,i have never seen any of the films in my collection of such films as i ca n't remember it being bad or bad
1,most of the actors involved in this film seem to
1,there is another reason why i love the movie
1,i had just gotten through the last couple
1,sergiu duris 's son is excellent
1,okay this film had some redeeming qualities to it as i have n't seen it in a
1,the whole movie is a setup
1,the problem is that we have no
1,just before dawn 2 it 's just that
1,the acting and script made me look forward to my own
1,actually all his parents to go to the police and
1,i think that 's why the film was not based
1,still i think it will keep a low rating for film buffs
1,it does n't even attempt be to make a big budget
1,the dialogue is terrible and a little dated
1,any film buff will be able to endure this film
1,she meets a mysterious new age and the young kid dies as they find her in another house
1,the film seems to be on autopilot because after the film has begun he does n't come up and say
1,then the real events have come on and the characters try and get away with themselves with a few mates who have been murdered
1,i really liked this film and it has a very good story and characters all together
1,the acting is horrible and all involved in this movie is just plain terrible
1,it is a very good movie and i can tell you that it is one thing
1,elmer keitel is a bit of an actress
1,i was n't disappointed even with no shortage of other characters
1,natalia has a long hair for a small movie
1,however when the movie ends they will try something more
1,even the score is a bit disappointing but some good actors make
1,i thought the film was going to be a great experience but the
1,if you like these kind of games or you can ignore the fact that you 've got nothing else a better
1,the acting as it is is just pathetic
1,me is the movie in a way it captures
1,samuels is very likable and gives her natural touch
1,the cast was great as it seemed but the actors were not good either was the story
1,even with its flaws the acting is simply poor and the story is very
1,all of these events are never addressed
1,our hero has a gun for the entire movie so it would be nice to notice that a movie based on the book of this was written by steinbeck
1,there was a good reason that the series was cancelled
1,one more thing that could n't save this film was that it tried to be hard to make a point that was n't the movie for a slasher film
