0,a cool film that has a punch at the box office regardless of the stellar madonna as thomas storm although the lack of sparkle in the allies magazine provides more praise than to have 25 cent under the opinion that the creators should know from the other viewers who needed to add boredom to her film debut,a real shame that branagh can possibly put some effort into this film so he decided to give him a minor chance dealing with the conventions masquerading as another film where aaron spelling does discover himself somewhere in the film as the accidental visitor horse that he opens with the angry dapper builders square against them

0,the very end he slipped back after trying so hard and yet trying to predict for himself when driving around it to find out what he was able to do with all of its hitherto unlikable characters,the abundance of people deeply accepting issues of death and hatred and how it can be used against manned associations that keep hoping that knowledge are taken in in the younger non music scene is beyond me

0,it was so long ago that it sure felt to lead to,it should be required viewing to all your collection of this
0,in every words the film tries to tell the story of what happens when combining protagonists story less than in climax schemes and on repeated outcomes,in addition disgraceful donna and her family running towards as irritating and paraded out as a gemser sports outing with a promiscuous adolescent mouthed reverend wife lures

0,i do see robin hood cop one touch,i recommend everyone to see black hop
0,nevertheless despite excellent performances by jim scott and nia yen this movie just did n't work at all it was rather direct to video production that only made it available to modern standards,nevertheless the film does not let the end finished its plot line just the dinosaurs will reappear coen murphy has a warm command that drives it so i had deep disbelief throughout the film
0,from up to impressionable villa boy dr joe dawson for a small grand kicker with mayor hauser don hunter to top the team orange a nuclear peddler on the powell county and end,from reactions is it 's creator to decided to tell us about how badly submachine you can of showing a mistake for either drool or running that country shill 's work forever

0,however there is only one problem,however it definitely feels out of place
0,but is the real tiny crew that,but there is not saying enough
0,stewart is at his absolute best most traits in the 1970s often he depicted a weary flustered mob,stewart looked strangely handsome and married to brett she 's uncomfortable in giving a strong innocent performance

0,not particularly crappy as in some of the other comments i,not the ps3 at all but i would remain here
0,onj 's attempt by appearing to be such a chomp is,onj runs through the film with a younger decent atmosphere
0,the movie also goes into the mill of sheer perfection since david lynch has,the atmosphere is used as paul karlson 's the framing of the penguins

0,great movie i 've seen and awesome summer kids,great cast great plot script and a 3 track movie
0,cary grant is in a league of comedies most notably for looking forward to vis a handful of memorable films that for the most part did,cary grant plays robin hood a deliberate handsome devious john stewart who joins bombing heights and sings one of cesar sanders 's and kurt cobain

0,on the other hand this gives the film an edgy blend of color and atmosphere,on the other side of my comments the screenplay does even seem rushed with lame performances
0,the biting tone used throughout the decades was considered instrumental by not following a film seamlessly or by presenting painful,the innocence level is reminiscent of what is a study of what ally persons 's appetites could have been

0,the secret service one of the most controversial families in,the relative man 's emotions were apparently dead inside
0,the overt lack of budgets tells us nothing about our glimpses by serbs and the robotics that make the us networks in media sales shop were distributed in media imagination,the fx by playboy playmate jack seem prevalent in this show near the end of the wolf outdoor sonic impersonate topless women are a couple of in all shape ever in

0,it puts people accustomed to planner 's amoral ways of his own dinosaur but finds the money and many volatile and deadly treating which is essential,it was an excellent film its 1950 capture to the screen crew to deserve credit for its fine class and by the inclusion of special ops characters
0,the rest of the cast particularly cho really served the bill the voice of,the fights seem like they are filmed but either sometimes affectionate and halfbaked
0,ok so if he had that including him smile on and his fingerprints i wo n't be surprised by some claim,ok it 's too bad the end of the film is a times hinting at stuff that 's no point
0,there are a couple of pretty funny moments played these characters often with a bit of romance romance and horror,there is also one scene where the day of the 19th century yanks open doors on by the men from time
0,if you do n't permeate the movie by hard to figure out which hard thing can send you apart where the truth is you take out the movie you get a cohesive experience,if 94 you wish to cost money with the definitely minutes of the movie bullets i would advise you if you 're interested in snakes they should be defeated by his parents by taking

0,the lone stuff is also hampered if you want to talk about how greg goes through the cafe,the guy who owns the soundtrack creates the crew of children does n't even care about them
0,maybe some serious genre and slight cameos make this a director no legs to emerge from american soldiers in a regard but nevertheless,maybe it was deliberate to let these sailors realize that they were eavesdropping on the truth to celebrate the petition for them
0,nice story and plenty of true,nice and funny very enjoyable
0,the crazed critics vote on this picture for the longest 5 of the year,the death of actor offers random ticks and the cgi dye scenes easily lighting lit
0,the film has n't been set for thanksgiving dinner,the production design by walter blair should have been great
0,billed as a prequel to the western classic from the first three wo n't ever be,billed by the filmmakers here firstly for one scene rudolf is planning a marriage party
0,do yourself a favor watch counselor which is how horror movies look take them out,do we really get sucked into the tragedy that passes at a downward speed

0,the rest of its kids are great and make a serious difference,the movie was enjoyable enough and it was really nice to see morris
0,i ca n't imagine how sure this screenwriter actually seals his work and never directed it in his life,i would recommend it to everyone kids or men families or children with some scantily clad bodies who have no
0,because she is actually finding a real flop in her boyfriend 's life but manages to live up to her addiction and fulfilment and do not escape emotionally through where the teacher is on her,because we do n't likes it just because it seems allot of extreme significance in which it feels like we 're thrust into a film 's world where some pain is put in jeopardy

0,we were n't so expecting johnathan to make it like that,we never see the land seeing norma and hardly together on the
0,he plays far more refined and devious the compelling kindness than his character him and the dialog is acceptable but the storyline requires nothing to do,he is fascinated by jason 's trials and this textured guilt between soon we are in the same joker that happens in the first film
0,the two actors though not trip above caricature,the personalities themselves are faded and making the actors
0,but much of the blame lies from time,but the plot is the most interesting
0,this is a way to learn a good lesson of buying this movie since signing every corp mistake but with the plucky i,this is what we mean abstract events like raymond one pity british neighborhood a kid church and a student around the pyramid
0,it 's impossible to say but the lovely assassin was very,it is a beautiful experience that stars in the limbo
0,very bouncy and smart this imaginative and experimental melancholic ode to preteens such as,very good acting by a cast that falls completely flat at its core

0,that begs the question what message can you do,that 's a bad thing i suppose might be the
0,the plot was so utterly unbelievable that it was unbelievable,the music is good and the performances by the actors are
0,it 's only about halfway through the dance distribute,it 's been n't the fans used to compensate for
0,the soundtrack was so well chosen it makes for an excellent first class and unexpected medical drama and a undiscovered,the old jones is pretty cool and the cast of stalwart actors and actress carrre is truly a treat
0,it seemed dumb throughout and format of this movie was pathetic because of that character,it 's only experimental handheld origins do n't make you stronger to find it being there
0,it 's all so painful to watch,it is in fact and distancing private that
0,wow that 's about it,wow i'm not a latino scifi
0,murdered was what penny 's snake needed,murdered lovers of pay with randomly the snakes
0,the plot is nothing to write home about though another sad role,the poster looked pretty good and it has really good artwork
0,phillip 's got to go kill and everyone 's bali is immediately silenced by the bunch of yakuza regulations,phillip edwards appears to have been doing only a few good films he called his works but slightly better
0,this movie does n't stand out and leaves us squirm,this is a film for streep who worked perfectly by her
0,but man 's opinion it 's a scifi film the dear remains a fair thing and i'm am being,but later here it was elizabeth taylor who applies for dramatic acting and gorgeous rod steiger as angel
0,i ca n't see any criticism until a bravura jury contains this movie,i do n't know what the people who claim to demonstrate but of course
0,lumumba is a great film,lumumba is charming or provocative but
0,i will only list a few things that did n't require that would help,i must admit that the dictator or iii based solely on her movies pretty much
0,yet coyote sends his heart and tries what has to be the worst thing about,yet the worldweary thriller remains one of the few oldtime dramas i 've seen
0,despite great cinematic experience the aspect was quite weak and took my helsing to move my index finger further,despite the tantrums and a few scenes that seems to me the essence of this is intentional badly scripted and
0,then when all men put their differences on the old man 's brain the rex blows them up,then we are led to believe that peter brown is his brother and he spends a few years back
0,apparently he loves crawford and when she is his own and you will just read you could forget,apparently this film was the result of someone knowing that known this movie is simply pure garbage
0,since the shift is depressing or not why the hell did n't they just drag back together in one shot,since 911 is mainly about rookie attitude by films of our lead i courtmartial if unhappy to distribute expeditions
0,okada you 're supposed to look like you know what you 're dealing with,okada is still one of uttering the monster movies that arise to deliver
0,classic acting and directing all across this flick what 's up with the crappy 80s locations and cursing down the toilet with breakfast,classic level of irreplaceable logical stress turns into a thoroughly compelling and provocative portrait of love on any day of the night
0,the script is perhaps for a rarity and as you watch the action unfold in suspense it becomes painfully annoying but it really ca n't be that far as we are,the film starts off as a somewhat sloppy bore with robert englund overacting and a dry biting display of jack lemmon via his camera movements and james bond 's scope
0,all i can say is that nobody has any,all icing returns to riches equal time style
0,without sure the implication could have given him a little reference to previous films in cinema as he pursues the rest of the,without words because of the beautiful cars by the major players of the hundreds they referred to brando as our main character
0,there really was n't a lot of interesting information here a plot and turned out to be a true love to stunts from the first movie,there is a breast fire and several explosives exploding a crisp malls yet it looks as if they hear what looking for joe 's nite distaste anyway
0,michael niven is quite brilliant as what the lone ranger has to do if you can complete the brooklyn skyline,michael rooker 's early movies with bogart he did so many of his factory roles frequently made his performances both potentially
0,half of the movie is spent any real reason it does n't satisfy the need audience,half the movie is yes of a job just watching an episode closely unrealistic if you understand
0,the rest of the movie is a mishmash of boring jokes one leads up against others for a return to the film and the final sequence reveals that in the middle of the movie the ugliness of the conflict between the two men simply did n't make much sense of going behind a visible shootout as a psycho a student some black guys that kill a dozen weeks later,the idea of a divorce being turned into a performer of the annual wb era institutions and we have a character that receives hold of the same hardnosed pageant and questionable yet does provide one race against our society and starting in on a smaller try by waking up thousands of rwandan peasants this film ai n't 'another science or kurt russell but only a year before the great opening
0,from the start this film finally made me lose a dime in the 80 's but that 's all,from these faults cheesy disappointment is n't worthwhile and it is no surprise that it always does n't come right
0,having to choose the blind situation between alan and hank the girl is enough to,having read oscar wilde the reviews and romances of foreign cinema were beautifully constructed
0,lets start with the series resemblances to other animated episode and the slightly unexpected appearance of jon pertwee as diahann 's reallife officer,lets live without violence angry with wife even in the pants of a medical organization which would literally include a term hint of the
0,this fine movie bears unique excitement without resorting to much of coarse brutality and the one portrayed by several giant detectives is putting a remarkably devastating interviews between them,this film seemed to miss luna even mentioned samantha mitchell on early the sunday season cinemax rejected the fat children who were first timers with their eyesight and dishonesty they
0,in fact porky is his supposed muscle friend and a friend of remorse with the ignorant maria,in lisa 's room he feels like a leggy lady if you ask me tell spongebob

0,rather than profit she has to cope with data ends and costumed family situation,rather than a movie intentionally by it 's soundtrack the plot is n't nearly as
0,i did n't like the comprising some trying to get so a message that will and bore but we get to believe that in the end this is a great film and is n't serving very well either,i was totally enthralled this was one of diane keaton 's most recent film in the charlie chaplin collection and with queen rex i had not yet had an argument with the film due to lack of motivation for
0,because almost none of the singers are timeless and musicians spoke french accents,because i believe this he breaks in deep and becomes erect enough to release
0,amenbar is presented as a menacing nonentity who is also effectively human but never he enjoys her,amenbar would stop it most other captured critics must confront our fears our intelligence our sympathy for ourselves
0,but the acting is great films',but it 's to be on the
0,if any one person were impressed by this travesty and not just hated the first one it,if they could have been created by simon this film could have been a nifty franchise

0,i deeply enjoyed that god help the adopted nurse and they are lovers coming,i remember seeing films like scooby doo and 'the trash of zodiac colon this corpse
0,now off to the con man of all trades if she is away from something,now you can play the more russian version of amelie playing chimps like that
0,i kept watching this film from the director and that only left me dumber to the picture that was happening idiots working,i love mind that all movies are sinister to despise since they abandon pierce brosnan or something missed in his films
0,her longing for a stuff though never works,her performance and camera work in fleischer as the
0,perhaps without other ww2 bias this human led a lot of the killer rules and tries to protect the folks that it was based on,perhaps not all but admire most people who make you want to see a movie that will do you love you killed and appreciated thx
0,i learned scorsese 's class in tomorrow and learned about a tribeca musical instruments because the scriptwriters knew more much for giving us had to,i could not believe how crap this flick was but it was one of the worst films i 've ever seen in my life

0,you tell me when you are screaming which those you hate,you know through a window of yahoo that you feel some empathy
0,the rest of the movie contains gory images from the rock witch up until find the vampire house,the film is shot to a young named newland who is now involved in some with disdain
0,for those who think that los angeles 's real cool side of the stone is made a little more noble i ca n't really say much so i cannot say that this is a big flop and they seem one of the worst acting i have ever 're watching,for all the endless age of the bargain bin the film presents carrie a creepy thriller performer who served minor purpose such as male life and physically aborted masculinity annoyed parties envelop a young starving woman on this planet wasp etc although this is much superior to the equally simple
0,this time around to the surface is like one dreary rogue in the other makes the villain more palatable,this also leads to a somewhat schmaltzy final showdown involving robin using one of the dullest suspects to convince us
0,seriously the movie is a path that is authentically wasted with such rubbish but that cynicism cannot in fact bring more emotional emotion to theater seat,seriously enough this is zoey 's early model that she soon develops us often treated and the cast quote is huge and little soliloquies to them
0,being a mustsee but the main subject of the film not the others are forty miles away,being in the crusades preserve the surrounding religious regime behind morbid america of the victimization of mr black
0,classy experiences remain boring moody incestuous sad unsettling yet an unexpectedly unoriginal intellectually stunning film with very good costumes and a plot that might have,classy contact with the irs 's charles durning has given a walk to frank to performing a prison present as a live homicide agent

1,i'm not a big fan of the genre but this movie does n't have that same appeal to it,i'm a fan of movies that are made by people who have not had a chance to see this movie
1,he 's not just a normal man he 's still a good guy but,he has a lot more to say about this film than he should
1,the story line is a little too convoluted but the script,the only thing missing was the use of the soundtrack
1,this movie is just a bad movie,this movie is not worth renting on my
1,it has a good story line and some wonderful characters,it was just the worst movie i have ever seen
1,most of these people have been so disgusted by it and i do not know how much they do n't have a good time making it,most of these were n't the ones who were trying to do a little research to be funny but it was not the way to make it
1,it 's a very nice movie,it is a great movie and one
1,i 've heard that the movie is not going to be a success,i was hoping for some sort of closure to the film but i was
1,cut off to a few seconds before the end of the,cut to the dvd extras and extras of this movie
1,finally a man has a gun and he,finally the movie ends with a twist
1,mighty 'donnell was a great actor,mighty peking man was a really cool
1,normally i think they are a bit of a stretch for the eyes of this movie but it does n't,normally the acting was n't as bad as in the first part but it was a very good movie
1,i would love to know more about the characters but if i have the option they are still trying to make the,i 've heard that this was a movie that had to be made by amateurs but that did n't make sense
1,when it came to the first one it was a good idea but that 's just a few of the reasons why,when i saw the movie the first time i had heard about it and found my own copy of the movie
1,just because the film is a good movie,just like in my case of that
1,implausible to say the least the ending is predictable and the film,implausible and predictable with a bit of the same old stuff
1,after the movie 's opening shot the film shifts gears into a series of events and a couple of,after a few episodes of that season of season one i thought that was one of the best
1,the story line is so bad that even a movie like that should have been,the story is very simple and i was expecting something more from a movie
1,much of this is due to the lack of imagination,much of his movies have n't been done before
1,really the best of the movie however is that it was made in 1995,really it is not as bad as the first movie but the one with a
1,if you are a fan of the first movie you should check this one out because there are so many good movies out there,if you like watching a movie about a bunch of friends who are trapped in a world where people do n't know what they 're
1,i saw the first episode on pbs and this movie was very funny,i am not sure if it was made by a junior or b school
1,the acting was n't very bad,the film is not as good as
1,as for the movie i was very impressed by the,as i said before the plot is very predictable
1,the only good thing about the film is the acting and,the acting ranges from good to mediocre to downright awful
1,absolutely the best movie i have ever seen,absolutely one of the greatest horror films ever
1,but the movie is just a waste of money and money,but if you are into the whole movie you 'll have a
1,great film with a great cast a solid performance by john cassavetes and,great movie for everyone who has ever been in a military school
1,so the movie is about a family and their,so what is the meaning for this movie
1,all the actors in this movie were very good,all of the actors were very good but the script
1,it 's a shame that it was made in the first place,it 's all a matter of the word for a movie
1,i do n't think the movie would have,i was very excited about the movie
1,i was expecting more than this,i have to say i was impressed
1,spoilers this is a great film with a few laughs and some funny,spoilers ahead there 's a few things to say about this movie
1,so what we have here is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen,so many of them have been given a chance to be the next film they were going
1,this is one of the better films,this movie is just plain awful
1,i 've never read any of the reviews but i have no clue what,i have to admit that i did not have the pleasure of watching this film
1,on the other hand it is not a very good film,on the one hand it 's an enjoyable little movie with a
1,i'm sorry if you do n't know how to get to the point of being a little bit of a letdown but i have to,i'm not a fan of this type of genre but i can forgive it as a whole not for the good of the masses
1,i saw this movie at the sundance film festival,i 've been watching it countless times since i was
1,historically the movie is a bit of an insult to the intelligence of,historically the movie is not so well done as a tv show
1,overall it was a good movie that had it,overall it 's an excellent and entertaining experience
1,like the first reviewer said that the movie is a great piece of work that 's the reason i give it a 2 out of 10,like in all of the movies he has done it 's time to make it easier to make the mistake of being a great filmmaker
1,the acting is n't bad but the story was terrible and i could n't get the fact that this,the movie does n't even try to go with the book but it is n't the worst either
1,spoiler the only reason i gave it a 1 was because it was a complete waste of time,spoiler alert spoilers the first movie was a bit confusing but the plot was so predictable and so lame
1,so it goes to an old school and a,so what 's the point of this movie
1,the story is about a group of men who decide to go to italy,the acting is good and there are some funny scenes in the movie
1,you do n't have to go to this film to understand how it is going to be so boring,you have the ingredients that were so good that they did n't have to be done with the movie
1,there 's no denying that this is not only a film that the director and cast should have had,there is an interesting reason to give the movie the benefit of the doubt but there was a very good
1,i have a soft spot for this series of movies,i do n't think i 've ever heard anything about it
1,it is a good example of the type of film i have ever seen and i,it 's a shame because there were a few moments that could easily be shortened
1,i have to say that i had to see this film,i was so excited to see this movie on a whim of
1,thanks to the great performance of the young woman the,thanks to the fine supporting cast of supporting actors
1,that said the movie has a great deal of humor and a sense of mystery,that 's what i would have done a great time to do something else
1,in the end the movie is very well written and well acted,in the end i was left wondering where the real sympathies were going
1,here the story unfolds and it does n't matter,here the cast is great and it is difficult to
1,in this episode the film becomes a little bit too,in the first film the character was a stereotype
1,i saw it again recently and it never gets tired of a tv show or tv show,i was n't expecting too much of this movie to be made in that it was a complete
1,one of the funniest scenes ever,one of them is the one who
1,with a great deal of money and good actors and a few decent special effects i was expecting a good movie with great,with a supposed budget of about a dozen times it was so bad it 's actually good and it 's pretty good
1,panels and geeks and the people who are n't,panels and the pendulum of a good script and good
1,samantha morton plays the young girl who is n't the same actress as the first time she plays,samantha foch as the woman is very beautiful as the young woman whose life is too much
1,upon arrival he decides he has to leave a job in the city,upon arriving at the local mall of the city they find out that they
1,on the contrary they are very entertaining and i thought that the acting was good,on the other hand the film is a very interesting portrayal of what the average family
1,i was surprised when i saw a film of this calibre that had me laughing,i saw this film when i had a friend who was in the mood for a
1,a great movie for all ages,a good movie to be seen and
1,i do n't think i can even think of it again,i saw this movie on tv when i was about 6 years
1,i have to wonder why this film was such a flop,i would n't be surprised if i had a good movie
1,the movie was n't really a comedy and the plot was so stupid that,the acting and direction are so bad and the acting is so bad
1,anyone who has seen this movie will probably agree that this movie is a waste of time,anyone who does n't like it will find an extremely annoying and unnecessary story about the war between
1,or the other way the movie is supposed to be,or maybe the film is a little too short
1,please note that the acting is bad,please please let me give it a 10
1,for the rest of us you 'll be bored to death and not just the one you get to like,for example the scene with the giant critter and a little girl getting shot is a little overdone and the movie
1,it 's a very interesting film about a woman who is sent to prison to,it is n't that great at all and the movie is just plain bad
1,while the movie has a few faults it is n't as funny as it sounds and is just a fun movie that is worth seeing,while the film itself does n't make much of an attempt to make it into a movie it 's not a complete waste of time
1,bizarre and sad to see him die at one point he,bizarre is the only thing that is n't quite funny
1,and the whole film is a total downer,and the film is not as good as some
1,a film about the power of forgiveness and the consequences of the human,a movie that i would recommend watching it with the right people
1,the movie has a very strong plot and i do recommend it to those who love a good story,the movie does a pretty good job of showing a little romance between the characters and the actors who were
1,as the film goes on its entirety becomes tedious,as a matter of fact i was n't really expecting
1,the film is a very entertaining and exciting experience,the story itself is about a woman who is engaged
1,the movie is a little long and is not worth seeing and i think the only reason why it is so awesome is the acting,the plot of the story is simple the characters are n't developed enough to develop a relationship between two men but the film is very entertaining
1,on the surface the story of a boy who gets involved in a murder mystery involving an,on this level there is some great action sequences and the action sequences were quite good
1,all of the other members of the group who are n't the same are all over the place,all the characters in the movie are very interesting and there is a lot of action and action that
1,in fact it was n't that good,in a scene where they find an attractive
1,also a good cast and a very good plot,also the scene in the middle where the father was
1,then it 's revealed that he was not only a child of the murdered but the,then the movie is over and they 're all about to be taken with them
1,let 's just say the ending was a bit abrupt but the,let 's not forget the last scene with the main character
1,you can see this coming from a very very young director,you have to be a woman to watch it and you 'll
1,he is a man who loves to love himself,he is also an alcoholic in the film industry
1,however i do have a problem that i would have to disagree with this is a movie that,however i found the acting pretty good and the script was a very entertaining and interesting story
1,why is it the best movie ever made,why did they need to do that
1,routine is one of the best and most memorable scenes that i,routine is a very good movie with a very nice cast
1,as an example of why they would like to think that this was,as a fan of the original i was impressed with the story
1,yet the film is n't as funny as a few others and i think its the worst of it 's kind,yet it was a little too short and for me it was a good idea that it could be made in the
1,sidekicks are the real people who have been the most important,sidekicks have to have a good time to do so
1,i do n't know how to describe the film,i do n't know how to make movies
1,boris karloff and his gang of friends are the ones who have n't,boris karloff is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,the acting was ok and there were some good performances in this movie and it was n't bad but that 's about it,the film also shows the difference between two people in the film and that it is not only a very important thing that they
1,that 's all i can say about this movie,that was not what i expected but it was n't
1,i 've never had a movie about such a terrible and amateurish film as it was with the first,i do n't know why the movie was released on dvd but it is not a complete copy
1,the only reason that i watched it was the score and i was so disappointed,the only good thing i can say about this movie is that the actors were so
1,i'm a teenager i love this movie because it,i'm not sure why it is so bad
1,trying to convince her that she 's a bad boy who has n't been,trying to find it is not the worst movie i have ever seen

1,the film is a little slow and not very interesting to follow,the film was directed by the legendary director costagavras but the acting in
1,i'm not even going to give away the plot of this film as the,i'm afraid that it was just the same movie and was n't funny
1,it 's a shame the actors are not given enough screen time and,it 's not a movie that 's supposed to appeal to you
1,well i have to say i am not a big fan of movies and,well i have to admit i was n't a fan of a film
1,but the movie is a complete mess,but i would n't have given this movie
1,it has the same plot and the,it 's a very good film
1,action and action scenes are the main reason why this film does n't work in any way,action is a good thing that is so good in this movie as you can see it for
1,preminger 's film is not as good as a similar adaptation of the scarlet pimpernel but with a lot more depth in each character,preminger 's character is a bit of a caricature as his character was so much better with the character he was supposed to play and
1,being the first of the three to die i thought it was the worst movie i have ever seen,being a fan of the original phantasm i have seen a lot of horror films but this one did n't

1,fortunately the film is not a good movie,fortunately i found it to be a rather dull
1,remember that when a film is supposed to be a spoof of what,remember this movie is a remake of the first and the second
1,the first is that the characters themselves are so boring that i ca n't really think of any reason to care less about the characters,the acting is terrible the directing is awful and the special effects are so fake and laughable that it actually makes the film a bit campy

1,try to avoid it like the plague,try to find something better on screen with

1,i was surprised how many movies i saw,i was n't disappointed to say so
1,ummm a movie about how the movie 's creators could be and it,ummm the story is just a bit too thin for the viewer

1,just to show you the truth of the film and the,just as they should have been the one i did
1,that 's all i can say,that is a shame that this show

1,there was n't a single moment when the main character 's,there 's a very good reason for watching this film
1,good job but it was just a waste of,good movie for everyone involved in making this
1,as a result the film is quite enjoyable as a horror,as for the acting i would n't call it bad
1,if you have n't seen the original you 're going to get it,if i had to give the movie a chance i 'd have been better
1,the film is not even close to a sequel,the story is about the adventures of the two friends
1,all of the actors were very good at the time and the,all the elements are so bad the movie is just boring
1,the film 's only purpose is the fact that there are no real plot holes but the film does not,the film 's plot is simple the characters are likable and the script has a strong and believable ending
1,you have to see the movie to find out what 's wrong with this movie,you have an eightyearold woman in love with a woman who lives in a village and
1,all the characters are believable the situations are engaging,all the other elements are not very interesting
1,some of the actors have a good time but their performances are n't bad the movie looks cheap and the editing is horrible,some parts were so much that you 'd want it in the beginning with a few twists and turns that you can relate to
1,listen to the title song and the song,listen to his music and dance in a very
1,vera and ashley are the same two women who are the only ones who have seen this before and they 're not in the movie,vera morton is excellent as the mother who 's been a little over the top for some time but she 's also not too young
1,the story is not as simple or complex but the story is,the film has a very good plot and very believable characters
1,the first thing they did is the acting,the film is a very good film
1,the film is also notable and a little over the top in its presentation of the first crusade and how,the movie is just so poorly done i ca n't even begin to describe how bad a movie is
1,this is a movie that will make you laugh and will be a lot better than you,this has to be the best and funniest film i have seen in a long time
1,the movie is very good but the acting is bad,the script of the movie is quite interesting the story has
1,the movie has a lot of plot holes,the movie does n't make any sense
1,he is a man living on a farm and he is a,he 's just too much for the role to be believable
1,this movie was n't even funny,this movie is so bad it 's
1,that 's what i thought i saw was the funniest thing,that is why this film is so great to watch
1,the acting and acting of the leads,the first part of the film deals with
1,anyone who has seen it or have had an interest in the history of cinema should have seen it and,anyone who is interested in watching this movie should be aware of it 's a complete waste of time
1,i 've never heard of this movie before,i am surprised that such a talented cast and
1,make it your best film for a long time,make a few changes about the story it is an
1,later the movie is so boring that its actually,later i saw a trailer of this movie
1,he 's a good man but he is very funny as the villain,he has a knack for making the movie a little bit more than just
1,if you want to see a movie about a young woman you will be disappointed,if you want to watch the movie and watch it for what it is a great
1,he is a very funny guy and i think he is a good director,he was also a very good actor who was not in the same league and
1,bad acting bad script and bad dialog,bad acting bad directing bad editing bad music
1,the script is also the same,the only thing to have in the
1,dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon,dr the dragon is an odd and creepy film
1,i would like to think that the director would 've been at the helm of the director 's career and had the film industry removed,i 've read the other comments here but i think it 's a good one to watch as if it were not for the fainthearted
1,it 's just a shame that the movie does,it was n't so bad it was n't
1,in one scene the camera pans off to another dimension in a scene where a character is shot,in the first scene the girl is kidnapped in a hospital and the scene is a little long
1,think the show would be much better,think of a few good ones
1,even though this movie does n't have that many elements it has a plot that could be used to a more straightforward and coherent experience,even the soundtrack was awful the music was annoying the acting was horrible the music was bad the acting was worse than the script and the
1,he has a small role in this movie,he plays the role he is the perfect choice
1,it 's a good thing that the movie did n't end up being a sequel for a movie or even the last movie,it 's not even a movie for everyone and i do n't think the movie is a masterpiece it 's a total waste of
1,and if you want to see something that has some very cool and humorous moments,and it 's so obvious that you 're watching a movie that is actually quite entertaining
1,essentially the film itself is a bit slow,essentially there is a lot of action
1,i was surprised to find that the film is n't a,i would have liked to see a more convincing film
1,unfortunately he 's never been a good director,unfortunately the movie is n't worth the trouble
1,the script was very funny and the acting was great,the acting is good and the plot line is good and
1,i would have thought it would be a good idea to make a,i would n't say that there is no point to these characters
1,he has a great sense of humor and he is a very funny comedian,he has been the smartest person for a long time so this is a very
1,the film is a little dated with the,the film is a very entertaining movie
1,the plot of the movie is that of a serial killer who has no idea what is happening to,the plot twists were so predictable and predictable that it could easily be avoided by any selfrespecting viewer
1,he also does n't know how to get out of his car,he is n't in any way provoke the ability to convey a sense
1,there is no story no point to that,there is a scene of some kind of sexual
1,and the scene when i was supposed to believe that the man would be in,and the scene where the killer was shot is a bit of a joke
1,colbert 's character is a real woman,colbert is not as good as the first
1,scriptwise this movie is a must,scriptwise i do n't think i could
1,some of the jokes that were in the first movie were,some of this movie 's humor is n't that funny
1,this movie could have been a good movie if they had it,this film is a very bad and boring mess and i have nothing
1,the film has a lot more to offer but that does n't matter,the story is not bad and the actors are not bad but not that
1,it is a shame it is never seen,it has a nice touch to it but i
1,will the viewer please tell me the story of an imaginary man,will they survive or die for the rest of the movie
1,in the end the whole thing is a joke,in a way he was n't the first person he
1,in this film it makes a mockery that 's the best part of this movie,in a movie that has a great cast and the actors in the movie are great
1,3 i think the only reason i gave it the score of 1,3 it 's a movie about a young girl from her home
1,if you have n't already seen this movie and have nothing else to do,if i had the opportunity to see it again i would probably be in for
1,and that 's a little too long for me,and i am sure that this movie is not a
1,there is a lot of good acting and the story was great and i did not like the acting but the,there are a few good scenes in this movie and i 'll tell you that the movie is very bad
1,i was really disappointed in the film,i am a bit of a fan and
1,as the movie opens it 's all so boring it 's not worth it,as a movie this is a good example of the genre and it 's not
1,the film is a great piece of work,the only good thing i got out of this
1,this is one of several movies that i 've been able to watch with a handful,this is a film which i highly encourage you to watch over and over again
1,best thing is the soundtrack of the soundtrack and the music which makes it a very memorable film,best of all i have to say that this was one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,in the end he does n't even care if he can do anything,in fact the whole movie is so stupid that it is impossible to get
1,but then again this movie does not have any,but the film is n't a complete success
1,nearly all films are a bunch of,nearly every scene is a joke
1,but the movie has no redeeming qualities,but this is what it means
1,and the film 's climax with the killer is quite funny,and i do not think that this film has any redeeming qualities
1,do n't waste your money on it,do we really need to be able to
1,i would have liked it but it 's not,i saw a sneak preview of the first film and
1,it is a very funny episode that,it 's not that great either
1,well i do n't know what you were,well the movie was n't so bad
1,makes me think that this movie was made in the early 1990s of its genre,makes you want to know more about your own life and what you can do
1,but i ca n't remember any one that 's a bad idea,but it is still a very entertaining film that will appeal to those
1,i was so disappointed with the story,i have no idea who is doing that
1,this movie is a must see for everyone who likes movies like,this was a very good movie with a very good story
1,first of all this is a very boring movie,first let 's talk about the movie it 's not
1,and i do n't think that 's true for anyone,and it is a shame it is n't a sequel as
1,you know you 're watching a movie with all,you 'll see the ending of this movie
1,first let me start off by saying that i love it when a guy is talking about a,first there are several of them in the film that are so much better than the movie
1,this is a very well made movie,this film is not a complete mess
1,the movie was a complete waste by,the story is a simple one
1,but the film is just plain boring,but the fact that i was n't really
1,but the story line is a little thin and it 's a bit,but then again i 've seen all of the other comments here
1,he is an amazing and very talented filmmaker,he 's an actor who does n't seem to
1,taye diggs is the perfect choice for a film which is,taye diggs is a good actor as the lead character
1,jay chou is an interesting choice for this character to play the lead and he,jay leno does a good job but he was n't really in the movie
1,but the film is n't a total failure,but it was still a little disappointing to see
1,really this is not an awful movie at all,really it 's a good movie but it 's very
1,the movie was n't really that bad,the film was shot in the late seventies
1,or why did the filmmakers not make this a movie or to try to make a point that they are n't going to do a movie,or even in one of the other reviews of the film and the fact that the director is n't really the director of the story
1,of course i am not a horror movie buff but i'm afraid that i was n't a,of course i am sure the writers and directors did n't get much of the film
1,the story was very simple and very touching for the whole family,the film was n't as good as a lot of the other films
1,it is one of those movies that you can tell you of that it was n't made in the first place,it is the story of a man who lives in a small apartment in his life his family and friends
1,the first one is a great piece of work with some very memorable moments involving two friends and the one that is a good movie,the only thing i did n't like about this was the fact that it was made in the early 80s in the late seventies
1,wow the movie is so bad,wow it 's not as bad as
1,sharmila tagore gives us the best role of this film and he,sharmila tagore was a bit of a jerk in this movie
1,i do n't know what the people behind the film are trying to tell them about the movie and they do n't have that much of a story and it just is n't,i saw this movie on the sundance channel and it sounded like it was going to be something that i had imagined and i had no idea where i was watching the whole thing
1,while i was a fan of his work he still has been a success and he,while i do not agree with the reviewer it 's not a very good movie
1,while the film was not a masterpiece of its own it still manages to make me laugh,while the plot is a bit farfetched it 's not too bad for the most part
1,logic and acting make this movie a must see film for any person who,logic is a little off the beaten path to be a horror film
1,yeah so what if that 's all that just happened in,yeah i know there is something wrong with that one
1,the film is not very much of a comedy but a few of us can see it,the story is not very well told and it 's just not enough to save it
1,lincoln does the best to give the viewer a chance to see the world 's finest but ultimately it is very close,lincoln has a very small screen presence and is a very convincing character that will never have a chance to become an actress
1,no one else has any redeeming qualities,no i think the director did a great
1,the acting was horrible but i was n't sure where was the plot,the only thing that makes this movie worthwhile is when it comes out on
1,he 's an excellent actor who 's the best actor ever to grace the,he 's not only an action hero but it is an action movie
1,it 's a shame to see this in theaters and in the,it 's like watching a movie that is just too slow
1,synopsis for this movie was the biggest mistake,synopsis of the movie was the same
1,very few films have made the rounds to the,very disappointing and a very very good movie
1,i saw the first episode in the theater and was n't surprised,i would have given the movie the benefit of the doubt
1,you do n't need to be a kid to understand this movie,you have to be a little hard to get through this
1,technically a very enjoyable movie which is n't a good one,technically the film has some redeeming features and i would recommend this
1,find a copy of it and enjoy it,find a copy of the movie and watch that
1,the acting in the film is a little uneven,the film has some interesting moments and is a good
1,okay i do n't think that the director should 've,okay i know this is a low budget film
1,any other movie is a masterpiece,any movie about the holocaust or even
1,dwight yoakam is the real star of this movie and he does well here,dwight frye was a good actor and i have seen him in a movie that
1,he 's just a bit too old to be too young and too old for this,he 's the only one who knows what he does and he 's really funny
1,film is a very good film,film is a very bad film
1,the movie is a bit slow,the film is a real bore
1,all in all if you 're looking,all in all an excellent movie
1,it is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen,it is a shame that the writers of the movie have made
1,the plot is simple the acting is awful and the script is,the script is full of clichs and the acting is awful
1,i'm sorry but i have n't heard a lot of people complain about this show,i'm surprised that the director and writer did n't get the rights to a higher profile
1,although it 's the same movie with some of the same actors in it,although the script was n't very bad it was a little too long
1,now it does n't matter that the movie,now i 've seen a lot worse
1,i think this movie is a masterpiece,i have never seen such a bad film
1,is he a murderer or a liar,is this film supposed to be based on
1,there is an obvious amount of action in the whole movie but the acting is just plain,there is a lot of the usual action scenes and the characters are all very real
1,i think the movie has a great deal of humor and is just a good,i 've always been fascinated by the fact that this is an excellent film
1,do yourself a favor and rent this,do n't worry about this movie
1,cheadle is excellent as a young man trying to find the,cheadle is also great and he 's great in it
1,the acting is so bad it makes it hard to believe,the story is very interesting and has some great twists and turns
1,so i think it 's a great movie,so the story is not as complicated as in
1,the acting is good but not for the whole family,the film is about a young couple who get caught up
1,whoever thought of the original movie as the first movie in,whoever made this movie should n't be ashamed of themselves
1,and i do n't care for anybody,and then there was the ending
1,one of the most enjoyable moments of the movie is when the guy is on the run,one scene where he says he is a woman with the words is one of the best in
1,but the movie was a little too long for,but it does n't even matter to me
1,okay so this movie is n't bad,okay i do n't have the words for
1,spoilers the plot has been told and the acting is a bit weak,spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers this movie is about as much fun to watch
1,a lot of the acting in the film is very good but the rest of the cast just seemed to be,a very enjoyable and interesting account of the life of one of the finest people in the history of cinema
1,but the movie is a lot of fun,but i did n't have to pay for it
1,how about the fact that the movie,how many times can you say
1,the plot is pretty good and the acting was,the movie also had a very nice soundtrack
1,if i had to see this for the second time in my life i would n't be,if the producers had to choose between them i would n't have given it a chance
1,this is a very good movie for the most diehard,this film has nothing to do with the book
1,when the movie is finished i feel that the film could have been a decent film but the execution of the film is just,when the first film ended was one of the most controversial of the 90 's i had to see what i 'd heard
1,randolph scott plays the part of a good guy who gets caught by an evil murderer and the guy who is trying to solve his crime,randolph scott 's character is a bit dim and it is not difficult for him to make a movie that is not only the funniest movie he
1,daylewis is a very talented director and a great,daylewis was the best part of the movie
1,next up i 'd say that the director should have been shot on a more or less film in the early 90 's and then it 's too hard,next time we see the movie we see the same old man who is the only one in the film who is the father of the young man
1,those who are looking for some good horror and horror,those who enjoy this show will probably enjoy it
1,you can only imagine the whole movie,you will see him as well as his
1,rush is one of those films that you will see once you will not,rush away from the film and then get it out of the way
1,despite the fact that the movie has a lot of plot holes the film is n't a good one to say,despite the fact that this movie was made by the critics and the other critics in the cast list i must say
1,the acting is superb but the script is awful,the only way the audience can see is the scene
1,i do n't know if i was a child or something but this movie was so much fun watching this one i was so scared,i have been in high school since childhood and i have seen it over and over again and again and still remember the titans
1,the script is so poor that it is hard to follow,the first time i saw this film i was not impressed
1,the only redeeming feature of this movie is the cinematography but it does not,the movie is very slow paced and is a complete waste of time
1,gilbert roshan plays the part of the main,gilbert roshan is also a good actor
1,the acting the script the editing and the directing all contribute to the fun and i think i,the story is n't too bad but there is nothing new and it 's not that bad
1,during a nightly chase sequence the film is about as bad as it gets,during the first half of this film the viewer does n't care for any of
1,more of a psychological experience is a very good film,more importantly i could see what the director was trying to
1,i have n't read the manga but i do n't think that is what,i was surprised to find such a bad movie i was n't disappointed
1,frankly i do n't think that the movie is so funny because,frankly i do n't think i 've ever seen the movie
1,rudy vallee and david morse are both good in their roles but i was impressed with their performances,rudy vallee plays a very convincing character who is always the only one that can make up a fight
1,a very interesting and interesting film,a lot of the dialogue is just
1,pooja plays the mother 's mother and,pooja has no problems with her
1,martin sheen is a wonderful actor but he was the only character who could possibly make,martin sheen is excellent as the villain and he plays a nice guy in this
1,thank goodness they had a chance to cancel out the,thank god that the last one was so disappointing
1,even though this is not a movie i can see a movie that has been,even though the acting was n't all that great it 's not really bad
1,a lot of people have already seen a good movie,a very good example of what happens when the film goes
1,i do n't know how many times we are talking about a movie that has n't already been done,i think it 's one of the best movies i 've ever seen it was a great film
1,accidentally the movie was made and the ending was,accidentally the two are reunited with each other
1,the film is a great example of what it means,the plot of the movie is just plain stupid
1,with the exception of the title role this film does n't,with that said i did n't know what to expect
1,patton has a few scenes with a guy and the,patton is the only one who can do that
1,the film 's plot is about an aging woman trying to cope with a wealthy woman who 's dying with the death of her mother and his mother 's death,the plot is pretty much all of a sudden rip offs of a mad mad mad scientist and the beast and it is a little slow paced and a little slow
1,the story is about two young adults who live in a small apartment building where the world has become a place where a group of young men are in the city of arkansas and the city is ruled by a mysterious and powerful group,the movie was shot in new zealand but it was a very good movie for its day in which i have been a little jaded and i can see it in my head and that the people in it are very well done
1,harry potter is a genius who is not just a little stiff,harry potter and matt clark were very good in this movie
1,films like this are n't bad but it 's a lot,films like this are not the case in this one
1,while a few scenes are a little slow at times there is a scene where the two characters have the audacity that the movie was going to be in the final reel,while a good movie is not about the effects i would have expected that a lot of them were not just the same actors who had to play in this movie
1,i have seen some great movies and this is one of them,i am sure there are more reasons for why the two main characters
1,i think it would be a shame that this is n't a comedy,i think this film is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,highly recommended for those who enjoy movies that,highly recommended for lovers of italian literature
1,i 've been a fan of this series but i can honestly say that it 's a little too far,i think that the film was shot in a very small budget and a lot of it would have been so
1,now i am a big fan of the series but this one is not one of those movies,now this is not one of the best films ever it 's a movie that should have been made
1,shia labeouf 's performance is a bit subdued but the rest of,shia labeouf is the perfect choice for her part in this
1,whether the movie was good or not it just made it look like citizen kane,whether or not you can watch it you will probably be bored out of their mind
1,although a few people are killed i still ca n't understand what 's going on,although the characters are not developed in the film the plot is very contrived
1,erm this is the best of the four shorts,erm the movie was n't that horrible but it was
1,it does n't take the spectator for a lot of the film to be interesting,it 's the story of three brothers who live together in a small farmhouse and are
1,this is a good family film about a dysfunctional family of the younger brother who gets the job to go on a,this is a must see for anyone interested in film history or for the sheer enjoyment in the art of acting
1,could they be a bit more entertaining,could n't they just have had some sort
1,from the beginning i was convinced that the movie,from the beginning this film is just awful
1,many of us will have some doubts of seeing this,many people think that this is a good movie and should
1,just because i was a kid this was not an exaggeration,just because they were all of a more interesting or more important
1,the movie also features a very attractive young,the story is very basic and predictable
1,the acting was good and the story line is very solid and i liked the,the only saving grace to it is that it was shot in new york
1,starring the late great peter ustinov and the inimitable,starring the great christopher plummer as the lead
1,penelope kapoor is excellent as she is given the thankless role of the film but she,penelope raines as the heroine of the film is wonderful and i really liked that
1,ronnie is a real jerk and a great one to watch,ronnie and his friends are also the main characters that the film
1,i saw it in a sneak preview of the movie theater at a theater,i saw a screener screening of this movie in the theater and i did n't
1,if the story is to be remade and the script is a little over the top,if you 're a fan of the original then you 're going to love it
1,i was very pleased with the movie and i was very surprised how much,i have been a big fan of the movies since the first movie
1,also the acting was good enough,also i have a soft problem that
1,fairly good acting from all involved,fairly entertaining to watch but this one
1,come on guys that 's not going to do anything like this,come on this movie is not a total waste of time it 's
1,lets face it you will get a lot of good laughs,lets not forget that this is the worst movie ever
1,she does n't have to pay to be killed in a car accident,she does n't seem to be much like the girl in a rubber suit
1,actorsactresses have done a great job,actorsactresses have no chemistry whatsoever and it
1,ca n't you have this movie on your,ca n't wait for the dvd release
1,another reviewer who has seen this movie has said that the movie is about the subject of the story and the characters and the story is very well developed,another example is the scene where he tells the story of an older man who had been in the business of his wife 's death in the middle of his
1,for example the whole scene of the film is just so boring that i,for a movie like this one that 's pretty cool in its entirety
1,i'm a fan of this series,i'm sorry but i have to give
1,movies are often a bad thing that,movies like this are the best
1,just to see the film is not as good as it should have been,just like the other comments i did n't get the point it 's not a
1,gidget is a beautiful actress and she 's perfect as the woman,gidget 's character is not believable and she is not believable
1,benjamin is a good actor with a lot of screen time,benjamin 's father who was the son of a son and a
1,in the end he was the most powerful of the three and the,in fact the movie is not about as bad as it is
1,meanwhile there is a little bit of a story,meanwhile the young man is a bit dim and the
1,it was an interesting experience to watch and i still enjoyed the movie,it seems that all of these were the actors who made up their lines
1,but the movie is a lot of fun,but i do n't know what to think
1,the story was a bit contrived but the actors are n't bad either,the film was shot in a very grainy and cheap way and it looks
1,but it 's still a good movie,but there 's no denying that a story
1,the script by eric wood is a joke that is not to be missed,the acting is good but it is not really the case that most of the
1,it 's an insult to those who are n't interested in the story,it 's just a movie made by a bunch of people to make a
1,natty mukherjee plays her character perfectly with an interesting performance,natty mukherjee is one of the most underrated actress of the
1,intriguing and intriguing the film is a little hard to watch and,intriguing to the bone and is a great piece of work
1,throughout the whole film he is shown with his wife and her daughter,throughout the film he has a tendency to play the character and does n't
1,who is n't the only thing that could n't possibly be done in,who cares when he has to be a man with a beard
1,they were n't all so much more,they are all so good in the movie
1,in short i think the film is a,in fact it was a bit long
1,but i guess the filmmakers were trying to make a point of making the film,but it was a nice touch to watch and it was n't too bad
1,the film 's plot is a mess from the beginning to,the film is n't a very funny one at all
1,to the extent i would have to say this movie,to me it 's an absolute waste of time
1,his mother who is the one with him is the one who gets him into the heart of his life in,his character is a caricature and it 's difficult to believe him to be able to get a good performance
1,vlad and hare have to be seen as the first one,vlad is in love with a married man and her lover has
1,but the real problem is that it 's not very well made,but the film itself is so bad that it 's almost unbearable
1,akshaye khanna plays the part of a man,akshaye khanna is a delight to watch
1,shanghai fried is n't a movie,shanghai triad is an excellent and very
1,this is a movie that i could,this movie is a complete mess
1,just as a person who does n't like it and,just a few months later she 's a woman
1,the story is a little farfetched,the movie is not very well written
1,here 's a list of events that should have been included,here the acting is superb and so is the plot
1,i was n't expecting a lot and was pleasantly surprised by,i think this movie is a complete waste of time
1,i would like this film for the first 10 minutes or so,i saw this movie at the 2005 festival in the us and i
1,while the film 's technical aspects are rather similar to the first film it does n't even look good to me that,while the movie is a bit dated it does n't have a great deal of suspense and a very predictable plot
1,his role in this movie was a bit,his role is so strong and funny
1,this is a film that will not disappoint and you will be rewarded to tears,this is n't the case with harry 's family but it 's a good thing because
1,she 's a good girl who is a bit too old to be a good actress and a good actress,she is a woman of the age and is now living in a world where she does n't want her daughter
1,a film that should never have been made and the,a very enjoyable and entertaining movie with a message
1,whether the director 's intention is to make a film or two or a b,whether it 's the film 's trailer it 's not a very interesting movie
1,a lot of people have claimed that the,a great movie for the whole family
1,this film is a total failure,this film is a complete waste of
1,only the movie could 've been a little better,only in this case the movie fails to deliver the
1,when i first saw it i thought the acting was pretty good but i was really bored by the,when the movie ends we are left wondering why the film is going to be such a success
1,what a wonderful cast of characters,what a waste of the talents of
1,this is the best film of the last decade,this is the most boring movie you 'll ever see
1,i 've seen this movie many times but it 's just not,i think they are trying to make this show more realistic
1,and then there was the fact that there,and that 's a little too much
1,even the acting is n't good enough with all the actresses involved,even if they 're not a complete waste of time it 's not
1,but then we 're left with the feeling that it would be a great idea for a story,but the rest of the movie is just so bad and the story lines are so bad that the
1,6 the plot was n't that bad and was the biggest selling on the whole movie,6 the movie 's main theme is that of a woman who is a very nice woman
1,this film has no story no real story line no real story,this is the best film i have seen in a long time
1,but the rest was n't so bad it 's,but i guess i was n't so sure
1,ray is the only person who has been a successful actor,ray milland and james coburn are the best actors in this bunch
1,this was n't the best of the two,this one is so awful it makes it unwatchable
1,this movie is a complete waste of time,this movie is one of those movies i have
1,what a waste of time and talent,what the hell is going on
1,but i think they 're not that bad,but it 's a good movie to watch because
1,it 's not a bad film as well,it is a very good film and i recommend
1,i think they did an awesome job,i was so surprised at how bad it
1,this film was a great success of the classic british movie,this movie was one that i have seen for years
1,the plot is very thin and it 's hard to understand why the movie is n't a total failure,the acting is horrible and the plot is so stupid and so unbelievable that it makes this movie unbearable
1,this is a pretty funny movie but in the end the whole thing is so predictable and,this film is not a comedy or a drama but rather a film for a film
1,in fact if you are a fan of the book this is a very enjoyable movie,in this film we 're shown a movie about a woman who is pregnant and has been
1,the plot line is very thin and the story is very contrived and boring,the film is set in the present day and it takes a bit too long
1,i think that 's a problem since i do n't think,i do not think that this film is a masterpiece
1,so i can understand the movie for a few reasons but i think the filmmakers are not going to get a lot of screen time in,so much of his work was in the public domain in this movie as the first film and that was the first to the point
1,it 's not a bad movie at all but a good time capsule of,it is a shame the rest of the film is a total bore
1,followed the plot for some parts in a very simple manner,followed by the fact that the movie was a long time the
1,they should not be the smartest film to come from the studio,they are all a couple of years from a time of great tribulation
1,they should 've spent all day on this movie and it would have been a better movie,they have a few lines to say the least about the story it was so funny
1,i do n't understand that the film is a complete mess of a film with the right mix of the characters,i was so excited when i first saw a preview of this film in the theater and thought i would have it
1,lorne greene as the leader of a group of other british,lorne greene was in the movie for a long day
1,bill paxton is a good actor in the title role as a man,bill pullman 's portrayal of the president of the united states is a very
1,cooley high was a very good movie but the acting and script were horrible,cooley high was a very good movie with great acting from the leads
1,the story is not really as good as this one,the film 's only saving grace is that he was so
1,i think the reason this movie is so underrated,i am amazed that this is not available
1,all i got was a film that has been released in a very long time and it 's a great movie,all i saw on this movie was that the movie is about a guy trying to get to know her
1,there 's no way to do that to make a movie,there was also the fact that this is one of the worst
1,this film was just plain bad,this is a film that is so
1,with a cast of young actors and crew that could not have done the best,with a supposed budget of about 1000000 it 's a little bit more enjoyable
1,first of all the plot is so bad that it 's hard to understand,first of all the acting is n't bad but the script is bad
1,just as a kid is not as good as his other two companions,just like that 's why you 'd want to watch this movie
1,the first film is not that great but it 's a fun film,the film is not very good it is about a group of teens who
1,it is a very good film but i think it 's a very good movie and it deserves a,it 's all pretty much the same as the first two but it 's just a good game
1,my friend said it was great,my favorite scene was when she 's
1,after a couple of hours i was n't sure where it would,after the film 's release this is a truly awful movie
1,i do n't know if the director was supposed to look,i was surprised at how well done this film was
1,this show is so much better than the simpsons which is the first,this film has a lot of flaws and it has many twists in it
1,as a result it was the first time i saw this movie i thought the acting and directing was superb,as a matter of fact the story is not a complete mess and it 's a little too slow
1,this was the biggest problem i have with the movie,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,he does n't seem to know what,he is a very good director
1,again there was a lot of the film,again this is a film that has to be
1,although the movie has a few flaws in it it 's a very fun,although it was a very enjoyable film and a good one at that
1,those are the only ones i can find most enjoyable in this,those who love this film are not happy with the movie
1,head was the best part of this,head of a doubt is what it 's
1,you 'll get a few laughs out of it,you can get the chance to see this film and
1,was n't this a good idea,was he trying to convince his mother
1,omar sharif plays the character in this movie and i do n't,omar sharif and john malkovich are perfect as the main characters
1,very good movie for those who love to see a,very few of us have seen this movie since
1,anybody who is not a fan of the original should be ashamed,anybody who has ever seen it and wants to laugh at how funny
1,make me feel like i was watching,make the film even more ridiculous
1,seriously if you 're looking for a scary movie i,seriously i would have given this movie a zero
1,the movie is a complete mess but it does make,the first half of the movie is really bad
1,it 's a shame that such a movie,it is n't that good at all
1,i would like to see a lot of movies that i like and love,i have to disagree with the comments that this film was very poor
1,the plot is about a man who gets a job and is taken from a mental hospital to protect his,the acting and script is awful at worst and worst of all there are no special effects or thrills
1,my advice is to avoid this,my favorite is the scene of the
1,he is a man that can control his life in a way that he is,he was the only one who did his best to be a very talented man
1,i 've seen better acting in movies than that,i do think this is one of the best movies
1,she also has a very nice relationship between them,she was in the same class of being a young
1,the plot is simple and the movie has no point of interest at all,the story of the movie revolves around a young woman who lives in a city
1,i have seen many movies that are not even that good,i was expecting a lot more from my favorite movie the first
1,lately he is a great man and his wife has been a great singer for many years,lately the film is about a family who 's being stalked by a group of students in order
1,much of the film involves a couple of people who were murdered by,much of this is how the film goes from being a comedy
1,strangely he is not the least likable character in,strangely the film is not a bad one
1,so the movie is a little long but you ca n't get the impression that it 's,so i was a teenager and the guy who made this movie was just soooo bad
1,oh and i 've read the book a little over the years i 've heard this film has been called a movie for a long time,oh well i ca n't believe the same thing that happened in my mind but this movie is a total waste of time and money
1,why would you like to see this film,why is n't it a bad film or a
1,what is a great thing to say about this film is that it 's a film about a,what a great show and i have to say that i have to admit i loved it
1,a good example is that the characters are n't so bad,a film about a woman named seita is played by a young
1,the movie has a few moments but it 's not enough to,the movie is n't bad but it 's not that good
1,to begin with a good plot line is a bit of a stretch for me and i would recommend it to anyone,to make it even more interesting the film is very funny in a way that makes you think that you have to see
1,even though it was filmed at the end of the first era it was,even though it 's a little slow the story is a little confusing
1,recently we are shown on the screen,recently he was in the film and we
1,the movie is n't bad but the,the script is not very clever
1,i was a bit puzzled to see how much i hated it but i did,i was surprised to see that this film is in a top 100 of all time
1,nearly every single member of the cast deserves to die,nearly every character has a motive for hisher own lives and
1,this movie was made with a budget of about,this movie was made in the first place
1,i have seen better films in my lifetime and this one ranks among the,i have seen this film several times and never really tire of it
1,but it does make you feel like you are not the ones that are watching a movie,but it just seems like a bunch of friends with the same problem as a porn movie
1,but it was not that funny to watch,but the fact that this film was made is
1,tubbs is a very good film about a man,tubbs 's father is a very young girl
1,maybe they should 've done a few more,maybe the best of all the movies of the
1,but the film is very entertaining and it 's still a fun movie with lots of action,but this was the first film i 've ever seen and i do n't really see the point
1,christopher walken plays a young boy who is sent to an asylum where he 's not a teenager and his son is a teenager who has a daughter and,christopher lee has done this godawful attempt to act a little bit of the requisite but the film is just a little too much to be taken seriously
1,need to see it for free,need to see this film again
1,lex luthor is a very talented director who can make a movie,lex luthor is a good director he has done some excellent work with
1,but it is not the worst movie i,but it is a little too slow
1,overall the film is very entertaining with,overall this is a great film
1,i was very pleasantly surprised by this film,i would have liked to have seen it more
1,i have to admit to the obvious lack of a good cast in the movie that was the only,i have no idea if it was the fact that he was the first film to be made
1,contrast to the old fashioned old man in the hat and the other one that is a very interesting one,contrast to the story of a young man who is in prison to celebrate his life with a little girl
1,it is the kind of film that should be made available to us,it 's just a shame because the acting is horrible and the acting is
1,familiar faces of the genre are present,familiar faces like robert altman and james cameron
1,the only good thing about this movie is the ending the ending was very predictable,the film is not as good as some of the others that are good and i
1,leigh 's performance is not the most important thing,leigh 's direction of the movie is the same and
1,a very interesting film with great performances of all,a movie that should have a lot of potential if
1,only a couple of weeks ago the film is not as bad as the first film,only to be able to make the point of view and the audience in a sense that
1,but the story line is not that great,but the film does a lot more with it
1,the only redeeming factor to this film is how the filmmakers are able to pull out all the good stuff that the first movie did,the plot is so convoluted and so ridiculous it makes it difficult to watch the whole thing but it has to make you laugh
1,this is an extremely well done drama,this is a really really good movie
1,and the film is so bad that it is almost unwatchable,and it 's a shame they do n't make any more of
1,one of the best things about this film are the,one of the best films i 've ever seen
1,i do n't know whether to call it a comedy but i would say that the,i was very impressed by the ending and that 's why i liked the movie
1,all of the acting is superb and the,all in all a pretty good film
1,the first film was a little slow moving but the film itself was so good,the film is an attempt by the viewer to get a glimpse of a woman
1,a lot of the movie 's plot is not so good,a few years ago it has been a cult film
1,jack lemmon 's portrayal of a father 's life as an assassin,jack 's character and the other characters are also very good
1,primarily the script by robert walker is the,primarily the script is a complete mess
1,clouse 's film is one of the best of the genre in my opinion it is not as funny as in the first,clouse and his cohorts make it a lot more interesting and it makes you want to throw a knife at the screen and then
1,i think he was the worst person in the world,i 've been watching this film over the years and have
1,like in all of his other movies he is an expert who has,like the previous poster said it 's the worst kind of movie
1,first of all i 'd rather see,first off the acting is terrible
1,the film has been done in several ways but it is n't,the film is set on the same day that the first movie was
1,i have never seen a movie like this,i would recommend it to any fan of a
1,i do n't think the actors were trying to be a real actor,i 've heard that this film is a remake of the book
1,after that the movie has a very good cast and it really makes you wish it could have,after a few minutes of watching this movie you can only get to know what is happening
1,this movie has the best of the best,this is a film for everyone who wants to
1,the only thing that made me laugh,the film is a total bore
1,and then the film starts with the main hero being killed by a woman who,and the ending does n't make a lick of sense and is quite unsatisfying
1,it was a waste of time for,it 's not the same thing
1,the story line is a simple mix of drama,the film is n't even a good movie
1,in the first film they are a very good and very good movie,in fact they did a better job of making the film better
1,german cinema is an example of why a movie that is so good,german director michael dudikoff does n't have a problem with the original
1,sadly the film is n't that bad,sadly this is n't what the film was
1,and it 's the story of a guy who gets the girl of an old flame to get a little girl,and i was n't even a big fan of his character so i was n't looking forward to seeing him in the
1,i have seen all of the episodes of the sopranos and it is the most entertaining episode,i 've seen the first few films which are so bad that this one has to be one
1,i do n't know if it is a film or a horror or movie but it is,i do n't remember seeing the first film in this film but that was n't enough
1,this is a really well directed and acted,this is a movie of all things
1,the plot is so thin that you can actually tell the difference between the two,the story is a bit of a drama but i think it was a lot of
1,but i was really surprised to see the movie that i did n't really understand the movie and i,but the movie is not for people that want more of it than to make a good film
1,this is one of the most boring,this film is a must see
1,overall the movie is very good and it works,overall if you are looking for something different then i
1,they all have some good lines that is the first of many,they do n't even try the same but the rest of the movie
1,with the exception of the two main actors they are also very good at playing,with a better cast in the movie this is a fine movie to show
1,i saw this movie at the san diego international film festival,i saw this movie at the sundance film festival on the big
1,so many of us will never get a grip on what they are doing,so if you do n't get the message you should have to be a little
1,with the addition of a couple of good actors the movie is pretty much a,with no hesitation at all this movie will leave you feeling uneasy at times
1,for the first few minutes i had to turn the,for those who want to make movies like this
1,it was a very nice film,it 's a great show that i
1,a very good movie with great characters,a good example of how the movie is
1,in one scene a man in a car,in fact the movie has its flaws
1,while the film was a little choppy the story was very interesting and it was n't really a comedy,while i was in the mood for some sort of catharsis it was very well crafted and well executed
1,i have to mention to the people of the above that this movie was a great idea,i was a little confused when it was over my own eyes in the end that the film
1,if you 've seen a few episodes of the original the story of a serial killer then you might enjoy the first half,if you can stand to watch this show to see if you can locate your dvd copy of the film it should be as
1,the acting is horrible and the direction is terrible,the film does n't even come close to being one
1,to me this was one of the worst movies i have,to say more would spoil my enjoyment with this one
1,all of them in this film and the,all in all a pretty good movie
1,i have n't laughed once and while i do,i do n't know how to describe it
1,other than that you could do that to yourself,other than that i was a little hesitant about this
1,clerks is not the greatest comedy ever,clerks is one of my favourite films
1,steven spielberg has done a wonderful job,steven spielberg is also the director 's best
1,not that i have a fondness for the film but i,not to mention that the plot was a bit thin
1,a very interesting and very funny film,a good premise to begin with
1,they should have given the film a little more credit,they all seem to be having a blast and they have
1,this film is a masterpiece of sorts and one of my favorites,this is one of several movies where you are a young person and
1,it has the same sort of humor and charm to the whole movie,it was a very good movie but i do have to admit that i
1,yes the ending is very satisfying and the end result is a,yes there is a good plot but i was pleasantly surprised
1,it 's a shame that such a poor quality of film has,it seems that the director wanted to make a good film
1,a great performance by the cast that i loved about,a few of the scenes were cut off but the actors
1,and i do n't want to give away a spoiler,and that is why the movie does not work
1,i 've seen this movie countless times and i have to say it is one of the most memorable,i was n't expecting a lot of movies but i do n't think the film really should be
1,perhaps that 's what the producers of,perhaps the film 's best asset
1,sadly there is a scene where the two protagonists get their head blown out of their necks and then they,sadly i found the film 's focus of this movie to be as good and memorable as it was
1,they all have a great story line and a good,they 're not even close to their normal counterparts
1,so i have to say i am very impressed,so i have to admit that it was a bit
1,here it 's a bit too long,here 's the real problem here
1,vhs is the most entertaining film of all time,vhs copy i saw the movie and i was very
1,i saw this movie at the waterfront film festival,i 've seen the first two and is quite a
1,of course they are in a different way,of course the only thing that is good about
1,as a result the script is very very weak and there are some really good scenes of events thrown together and the final scene is so powerful,as for the plot well the movie is not a great one either but i have to say that it really was a great film to watch
1,the acting is terrible and i ca n't imagine anyone else who was in the film at all and i thought it was,the script has been written by a bunch of actors that are in the same league as the director or the director
1,the acting is so stiff and so stupid that it makes you think,the movie starts with a bang and then a woman named alice who goes
1,angels have to do the right thing,angels are not all that impressed by the
1,i have to admit i had never thought of that as a whole,i have no idea how a film of this kind can be made but
1,overall the movie is pretty good,overall this movie is a good movie
1,anita is an aspiring actress who has a,anita winger is a delight to watch
1,in fact the whole cast is good the story is pretty basic,in the beginning of the movie the audience sees a very beautiful and
1,dil is the most intelligent person to come,dil de vaca is an excellent film
1,now this is a pretty bad movie,now i'm sure you will not be disappointed
1,probably a good idea to make a movie,probably the biggest problem is the lack of any
1,ok i 'll be a fan of,ok i know what 's wrong
1,the story is about two friends who have to deal with their jobs and the two,the acting was good but i was n't sure what this movie was really about
1,in this one he 's not just a bad,in fact this film is not for me
1,by the time it comes out the viewer is forced to feel sorry for his brother,by the time the end credits rolled you were wondering if there were no other alternatives to
1,anyway i have seen some of the,anyway the film is very funny
1,a great cast of characters from the past,a few years later they were both in their
1,rain has been a great movie since a movie that is so great it,rain has a great deal of humor and the acting is very good
1,it is n't so long ago as it 's been in a long time,it 's a very sad and touching story and it is the story of a
1,along the way a few young adults are invited to find themselves at their local,along with his other films i 've seen that one of the better ones
1,there is n't a single scene where the film has a purpose and i was n't impressed to find any of the film 's redeeming qualities,there is one good scene in particular that i remember when i saw the movie i thought it was the worst movie i have ever seen
1,it also had the look of a movie about people getting,it 's a shame because the movie is pretty entertaining
1,a few things are the best,a great cast of characters who are
1,but there was nothing to be said about this film,but it 's a bit of an action film
1,a few of the characters are just a bit bit shallow and,a great movie that will not be forgotten by everyone involved
1,it does n't take much of a budget to produce a film,it 's just that the director and the screenwriter and director should have
1,if you want to watch a movie about a bunch of teens in a small,if you like it and you like it watch it and then do n't
1,being there 's an explanation for the film 's audience not to mention the fact that it had,being a huge fan of the original series i must admit i did n't enjoy the series
1,do n't expect to miss this gem,do n't worry about this movie and the
1,it was n't a great movie and it had to do with,it seems so long that it is not even a comedy
1,although there were some great things about the original,although he does the best he can do
1,apparently it was just a film about one 's inability to cope with the other problems of the story,apparently the director was a writer with a lot of problems that were n't so much of an issue and
1,icet is a good actor as he 's the only actor that,icet was the only actor i liked him as a character
1,the first movie was a bit of a letdown,the story is simple and the characters are very likable
1,corporation was a great show to watch,corporation 's greatest film star and it 's
1,for example the two main characters and the main characters,for those who have a taste of humor and love this
1,the movie is very good and is,the story line was very simple
1,i'm glad i did not have to go to watch this movie,i'm a huge fan of movies and i have a lot of time
1,everyone in this movie is either mentally retarded or a,everyone is either a good or even bad guy
1,well i do n't think so i have,well this movie is one big joke
1,any movie that can compare this to the original is just awful,any of this could have been done without a good script
1,then again i do n't know if i was in the theater or did n't know that the whole movie was about a guy trying to be a,then there was the fact that the characters were not so much as they were the real ones and that the movie was not a good idea
1,i have to give it a 7 but it is one,i do n't know if i was watching a documentary but i
1,also the ending was a bit abrupt but hey it 's a little more than a movie,also in a movie with a plot and characters who are not developed well at all
1,the movie was shot in a time where the film is made to work with,the film is a complete mess of a movie that was n't even funny
1,a few minutes later the girl decides to take a shower to get a beer to his head while driving the car,a few people have commented about this movie that i think they should n't have made any other films like this
1,the only reason i gave this film a 2 instead of a 0,the plot of a man who is a little bit of an idiot is
1,but i do n't think that is the point to the plot,but it 's still a pretty decent horror film and a good one
1,climbing with the wind is a wonderful and very wellacted film,climbing to the top of a mountain of water is the only
1,i would not recommend this movie for anybody,i saw the trailer on the film and the
1,ching dillman and john carradine are very believable in the,ching capote 's score is a very mixed bag
1,the first time i saw the movie i was n't disappointed,the only way you could have a great film is when the
1,this has all of this is the most amazing film ever done,this is one of the most beautiful movie i 've ever seen and
1,yet the whole thing is just an excuse to get into the game,yet it was a nice surprise that you had to endure the film as
1,selfrespecting actors were a great surprise but not as,selfrespecting horror film buffs will probably enjoy it
1,i am amazed that the makers had to have a lot to do with the,i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a very very good movie
1,save your own money do n't waste your money on,save your money and do not watch this film
1,i do n't know if they were trying to make a movie based on a true story or a character study but they could,i do n't care how many times they 're in this movie but the actors did n't even look like a real person
1,with this being a great horror film i 've seen a lot of other horror gems and i have to admit that i do n't know what it was like,with a lot of action sequences and a couple of scenes in the movie where a little girl is killed with a machete that is n't even close to the truth
1,i have seen this series twice and will have to wait,i 've been waiting for this movie to get better
1,the story is n't bad the characters,the story is a bit confusing
1,i was expecting something more like this one because of the great performances by a few,i saw this movie and the previews were not as good as the first film
1,but the movie has a very interesting premise and a very good script,but this movie just did not have the good elements of the first one
1,this movie is so bad that it 's a waste of a good cast,this is one of those films that is a complete waste of time
1,i was a little disappointed at the end,i was n't disappointed by this movie
1,i do n't want to go to the cinema that i have,i have no idea who 's who i think it 's
1,the acting is terrible and the writing just plain,the acting in the movie was so bad
1,although this show is n't as stupid as it is the series is more entertaining,although the story was n't as good as it could have been and the characters were
1,however in fact it 's a good,however this is not a movie
1,the film was a total mess,the plot is about a young man
1,well the film is pretty much the same,well the acting is good but i think that
1,stardust has a few interesting moments and it has to be very very difficult to make a movie that makes the movie so much more fun,stardust is a film where the story of a group of friends of mine and the hardships of the community are so different in the world that
1,as a result of the movie the plot is very simple and there are a lot of problems,as the movie continues the two begin to lose their grip on the film by the end
1,people who think he 's a good guy but do n't know that it 's not the same,people in this film are either very bad and just plain stupid but this one is just so bad
1,it seems that the director and writers were trying to get the audience into the,it 's a real shame because the movie is so bad it 's good
1,it seems the producers had to be trying to put it mildly realistic but it,it 's a pity as the best part of the movie was the song
1,it is a very moving film which is,it was a complete disaster for me
1,the story is a little bit predictable but it is n't too much a good idea,the movie does n't get the same level of the story and the ending is a bit
1,they have a very funny and funny scene,they should be able to get a little more
1,the movie was a lot better than what you would call from it,the story is about a group of people who are trying to steal their
1,the plot was weak and the acting was just poor,the plot line of the film is a bit weak but
1,noticing the plot is n't a good one at all,noticing the plot is that there are two main characters in
1,since there is a lot of nudity the movie,since then i have a fondness for movies
1,a good movie to have seen,a few years after i watched this
1,this is the type of movie that you 'd want to,this is not a good movie but it was n't
1,and what do they really think of them when they are not going to go anywhere,and it 's not the kind of movie that is so bad it 's good
1,widmark plays a woman who is trying to find the girl in her apartment while she 's trying to find a job to,widmark has a small role as one of the great beauties that has a thankless role as the villain of the movie
1,buy a car and you 'll be rewarded,buy the book and you 'll see what 's
1,that 's why he was n't a star and a great actor and a good actor,that 's all it has going for it but this film does n't do it for me
1,i think this movie has been a great success,i think it is a very good film
1,i would love to hear a song sung by the song,i think it 's an interesting story but it is still a
1,there are some good moments but not all of them are good,there is also a lot of the characters and the characters
1,so the movie has to get a little better,so i do not know where to begin
1,innocently this movie is so bad it makes you want to vomit,innocently the movie is a little too melodramatic and too boring to be
1,taking the first time i was able to see it,taking the same plot with the help of a young girl
1,for me it 's the same kind of humor that we are given to a movie where the hero,for me i could n't stand the entire thing and the movie was a total waste of time
1,does it take the viewer for a,does this show have been made
1,i 've seen some other movies from my life but this is not one of them,i saw the film at the toronto international film festival and found it thoroughly entertaining
1,the movie is about a young couple of friends,the script by robert sherwood was pretty funny
1,you can watch it on one night when you get a chance to find a good movie,you know it is in trouble when a movie with a man named a girl with a different
1,do n't be afraid to have the movie,do yourself a favour and do n't watch it
1,i think the best part of the movie is the fact that it takes place,i have seen a lot of movies that are so bad they 're good
1,or even a good one but it is not as bad as you could expect,or maybe it 's not just for those who want to know what happens to them
1,the film is very well made,the movie has a very good pace
1,having read the book the book and read the book the book was,having seen this movie several times it still is a great movie
1,that 's not to say that it,that was a lot of fun
1,all the characters are just so real and lovable that they,all in all the film is n't even remotely funny
1,probably a lot of people think it 's a bad movie,probably the most memorable thing about this movie is the fact that
1,she is a very good actress,she 's the main reason to make
1,i was surprised with the ending as a little bit of the ending,i was very disappointed when it was shown on tv in the early 80
1,to my amazement he is so much more of an important character than his usual role in the book,to say that this movie was n't made by the same people as i would be a good deal is
1,i have seen this film a long time ago,i 've seen the original movie and the film is
1,with the exception of the first half of this movie i was hoping that the sequel would,with all the shortcomings it could have been that i have a fondness for the movie
1,everything about this movie is just plain awful,everything is so bad that it makes you wish
1,as far as i can tell the story is about a man who has a son in,as for the story i could n't believe that this was going to be a film
1,the film is a little more than a horror thriller,the story is a little weak and the plot is n't
1,folding at the top of the stairs the only two,folding on to a good degree of the movie
1,or maybe the film is too long,or even the slightest bit of the plot
1,we get to see some pretty ugly actors like a group of thugs who are in a wheelchair and have a,we get to see him in a movie and this one is a perfect example of how he can be
1,this is n't an excellent movie it 's not a total failure of,this is just a fun movie that i would like to know
1,this was n't really the worst movie i 've seen,this is n't a bad movie as a whole
1,supporting cast are n't bad either so why not,supporting character development in a way is a little too
1,the acting is pretty good but the story itself is a little weak,the first time i watched this i had to laugh when i had heard
1,then the film switches back into the story of what a real world of people is in reality and,then the story starts to go horribly wrong and the ending seems like they 're going to die
1,the only redeeming feature of this film is the fact that this was made in the us and in the early 90 's the film was released on video and,the only thing that kept me watching was the fact that i was not impressed by the film because i was bored at how it was going to end
1,it is n't that it 's not a total washout,it 's a great movie to see and it 's very
1,the movie is just a waste of time,the plot is so predictable it becomes laughable
1,in the book the director writer writer john,in the film he meets his father
1,this movie has been said in the,this is a very funny film
1,a great deal of laughs and a very enjoyable one at that,a few years ago a friend in a mental hospital who was a
1,there were a few scenes i could 've done have been left at the beginning of the movie,there are some good things in the movie but it 's not the best movie i 've seen but
1,then we 're introduced to the characters that are supposed to be people with no real,then i went to the theater expecting that to be the worst film ever made
1,carpenter 's movie is so bad that it actually makes it to the top of the list,carpenter 's the film has some of the best scenes of film making of the genre and also
1,at least he has a chance to make a good film,at first i thought the film was a good idea
1,useful to the movie is that it is very funny and i liked this movie,useful to say it 's a good movie for those who have nothing against action films
1,based on a real event i have to give credit to this movie that much more than the imdb user rating it is an excellent and informative film,based on the popular legend of the same name as the original the film was shot in the same location as the first film the story is a bit
1,the movie was n't bad but i thought the acting was pretty decent,the acting was horrible as far as acting was concerned with bad acting
1,i would like to see more episodes of this series and this one has a chance that it can never be aired again,i 've read the comments of a couple of people that have to say the truth is that i ca n't even think of
1,this movie is not worth watching,this is one movie i would recommend
1,of course he is in a different place,of course the film is about a group of
1,i was n't expecting much from this movie,i have n't even mentioned the movie as a
1,it 's an insult to the intelligence of the director,it does n't make the slightest bit of sense
1,that is why i do n't see the end of this film,that 's not saying that there is not a lot of gore in
1,much of the story line is very predictable,much more than the original and the original was
1,so it 's not the best of the series,so why does he have to kill people
1,perhaps this is the best film about the world of mankind and how,perhaps the film makers were making the right choice for the film
1,but if you like to see a good film with a good plot,but if the show was not as bad as the first two seasons it
1,the story line has a very good plot and the story is so full of holes it is a good movie to watch,the film is about a woman who is sent to a house with the family in a small town in the middle of nowhere
1,i'm glad they did it in the first place,i'm not a big fan of bad bmovies but this
1,somewhere along the way we see a man dressed in a black cloak who,somewhere else you can get the feeling you need something to laugh about
1,no one would ever be allowed to watch this movie,no doubt it is one of the funniest movies ever
1,to say more than one line i 'd have seen,to sum it up this movie is just boring
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the acting was so horrible that i could only
1,the acting is very poor and the story is very thin,the only thing this movie did is the poster for this and
1,the acting was so bad that it seemed like a bad acid loaf,the film is a good example of how a movie is supposed to have
1,it was a very nice surprise but in the end it was very disappointing,it was a bit like a remake of romeo and juliet but it 's still
1,this is a great film and the best one is the one that is in my opinion as one of the,this movie had nothing to do with the story and i found it hard to believe it to be funny
1,it is not a movie to be a movie for people,it is a film where the story is very good
1,both men are n't in the movie,both actors are very talented and i can
1,needless to say this has to be one of the worst movies,needless to say this is the worst horror movie ever made
1,one of them is a man who,one of her best movies ever
1,in the end i found myself thinking of something to do with it,in this one he is given a few moments of comic relief
1,the film is also a complete mess,the movie has an amazing cast
1,then the film cuts to the main characters,then the plot of this film is just a
1,for those who do not know about the film the plot is just plain bad,for instance in the film we see an attractive black woman dressed in black robes
1,the acting is n't as bad as i 've seen in a long while i 've seen worse than the poor ones,the only reason i give this film a 7 is because of the fact that the film has a lot of potential
1,spoilers the movie is a little over the top in parts,spoilers ahead the main character is killed and killed by a woman
1,and that 's the problem with the film,and i do not understand what is the point
1,this is the worst movie i 've seen since gigli,this movie is a complete disgrace to all of us
1,the film has a great soundtrack and a very good,the story and the script are very very good
1,and what 's worse dawson and dave are the same guys,and the movie is a total waste for the movie
1,aherne has the best role in this movie,aherne 's character is so convincing that we are
1,if you do n't know that you 're watching this movie do n't worry,if you have n't seen a movie i recommend it to anyone who likes horror
1,for the first time he does have the nerve to,for me this movie was made in the us
1,i am a big fan of the original series,i 've seen it over and over again
1,a very good idea for the film,a good cast of characters are introduced
1,it is also a bit of a shame that this film has,it is an interesting film with lots of great acting talent
1,a film that could have been better and tighter but it just does n't work for,a lot of it was the best and most entertaining part of the entire movie
1,not much of a story or a character study,not the greatest film to be made in the past
1,the story of a young man who is a young,the movie is a little bit of a stretch
1,if you do n't want to see it go see it again,if there 's a flaw that 's not the way this film was
1,eastwood gives an incredible performance as the young christy,eastwood 's character is the only one who 's willing
1,complain is that the movie is n't a horror,complain on it but it was so bad
1,does anyone know who the hell is this,does anyone know who the murderer is
1,and that 's not saying much,and i was a little disappointed when
1,most of it has been done by the director and the director,most of the scenes where the hero is in the middle
1,you 'll have a hard time believing what the movie is,you could n't tell the difference between the two films
1,this is the first movie i 've ever seen,this is one of those movies i 've seen in
1,no wonder that the film is not a,no doubt it 's a bad movie
1,anyway it is a very entertaining movie,anyway i think this is the best of
1,in fact the movie is not a comedy that does not make any sense to the viewer,in the meantime he was n't in it and i do n't want to talk about how bad
1,i saw this in the theater and i loved the movie and i was amazed to learn that a film with no budget was wasted in the first,i would n't have seen this film in my lifetime as one of those movies that has the same kind of quality that i do n't know
1,a great example of what happens when someone,a film that is n't only bad
1,suddenly a movie is a waste of time and money,suddenly the movie is set to make sure that a lot
1,dead man is a good movie that is worth watching for the acting and,dead poets society was a pretty funny film that i thought of it
1,so much of the plot and the plot is ridiculous,so what if the movie 's story could have been done
1,hey the film does a good job of showing what happened,hey this has to be the worst film ever made i do
1,but this is a great example of how to make a movie,but it is not so easy and so well made for that it
1,shepherd is an old actress but i was,shepherd was n't the least bit convincing
1,in this case the director 's intention was to make,in fact i was not impressed with the film
1,if you like the movie that is the case with you,if you have n't seen the original and read the books you
1,as for a lot of it it was pretty much an attempt to cash in on the craze,as for the acting the movie is a bit too slow and too slow to be funny
1,but the film is a bit of,but this movie really does suck
1,mary 's character is a caricature of the young woman of the,mary 's character is so unlikable that she 's almost unrecognizable
1,ps this is a bad film,ps i have n't seen the original
1,the movie starts with a woman who is an actress and a young man in a suit who wants,the only reason this got any lower than the movie was because the movie was a complete mess
1,a lot of the film 's humor is derived from one of those old fashioned movies that,a film of note is that it has a good plot to make a great story
1,he was so stupid i could n't stand the whole thing,he 's just so damn funny and it 's easy to make
1,references to the original film were not even the first one,references to other comments on other reviews on here have said that
1,it was n't funny and i could n't believe it i would actually be laughing,it 's an excellent piece of acting and a wonderful performance by the leads
1,it is also a movie that makes you think about life in an,it 's a good thing because this film is just so good
1,every single scene with the actors and actresses is just awful,every time i see this i 'll have to wait
1,weaving out a couple of things is a great idea but not a good one,weaving the story of the characters from the film the story takes place in a time
1,holden is also a nice person but i think that it could have had some good actors,holden has the best role as the lead but the rest is a bit dull and a little
1,as far as the plot goes i was not a teenager,as for the acting this movie had a lot of potential
1,there is a little to explore in the film which makes you wonder how the people,there is a lot of action but the story has a few holes in logic
1,the film is about the same thing and that 's the problem,the plot is simple yet it 's very difficult to tell who is
1,mel brooks is the only good actor in this film,mel gibson is the most talented actor on his screen
1,ps the only reason i watched this movie was because,ps this is a movie that should be avoided
1,if you want to watch the movie you should see a movie,if you have never been on the fence before this is the film
1,i would have given the show a ten out of 10 if it had stayed as,i was really impressed by this film but in fact it was a bit disappointing
1,frankly i think this is a really good movie,frankly it 's just a waste of money
1,she 's not in this movie,she is also very good as a
1,the film is about an elderly boy who goes to a school and his girlfriend who has the job of being an artist,the movie 's main weakness is that it 's not a comedy it 's not very funny and the characters are shallow
1,the story itself is so simple that it seems to take itself too far too seriously,the acting and direction were terrible and there was no reason for the plot to get resolved
1,unfortunately the movie never fails in any department,unfortunately i 've seen better acting in better movies
1,he also is the perfect guy,he is a real person with no
1,and the movie has a very good story,and there is n't any real plot
1,there are many scenes where the camera pans off the screen with,there were so many of the things i did n't notice
1,having read all of the reviews i 've noticed that this one is a very bad movie,having seen it several times and still have a soft spot in the world of the late '60s
1,here is where the film fails,here we have an endless and implausible
1,they all had a good cast and a good script but they were n't very good either,they have been trying to find a way to kill the president and be a good friend
1,after a brief shootout with the police and the girl he decides to go on and on,after all the film has its moments it 's just the same old stuff with a bit different
1,known as the first movie i was impressed at the fact that i was a fan of,known for the same reason the film has a lot to do with its subject matter
1,however the story and the characters are all excellent and it,however this is just a movie for a little more
1,however if you 've never seen it,however it was not that funny
1,the film does n't have a lot of sex scenes but it 's a very,the movie is a complete mess of a movie that was n't worth it
1,the film is n't bad at all and that is the best thing i can say about the movie,the first time i saw it was i was in a theater of high school and the movie was very
1,a great movie to see if you can see a film,a film that should have been released on dvd for the first
1,i was n't really expecting anything else to be said but the movie itself was good enough,i 've seen this movie many times and i still remember that i saw it on tv
1,continuing to say the truth i think,continuing with a bit of the first one
1,pip is one of the most important characters ever to grace a screen,pip and his friends and the boys are both good and their lives as
1,the story is very simple and the movie has a lot of action and,the acting is very good with some good performances and a good story
1,a good movie about an aging hitman who,a great movie that 's really funny
1,but it really did n't have the same impact and this one was n't very,but it 's not that i have seen this film on tv or dvd
1,the story is a little weak,the acting is pretty good and there
1,with the exception of a good cast of young performers who were in this movie it 's a pity that the director decided that the story was not,with the help of the old man 's mother she has no qualms about how she feels she is being transported to a house by the lake
1,look at me i was a little hesitant to get my hands on a copy of the film but i still,look like this movie was shot in video and in fact there is no excuse for the lack of imagination
1,the only way to describe the movie is to have a good story and,the film opens with a scene of one of the men of mumbai
1,whilst the film is a little bit short it does n't,whilst this was n't a film it 's not bad
1,the only real gripe that i have with this movie is that it was made in 1980 and i did not like it,the only reason i even rented this film was because i had read a book about the movie and did n't have a clue
1,the first half of the film is a tad slow and it 's not as bad as the previous film,the only reason i watched this movie was because i had not been able to find out about a movie that
1,shortly afterward he gets a little girl in the first place of the film,shortly before they are introduced the police is assigned to get back on him and
1,however the movie has to go downhill from there,however i think it is a great performance for the
1,naturally they are not as convincing in the film as they,naturally i was looking forward to seeing the first film
1,a few of the actors involved in the making of this movie is a real pleasure to,a lot of things seem to go from there as much as the film is shot
1,as for me i have seen the first movie,as i mentioned before this was a good movie and
1,seeking to see him in the big sleep,seeking to see a movie like these in a
1,his father is an alcoholic and a womanizer,his father has to deal with him with a
1,also i think it has a lot of,also starring the very young robert ryan
1,whenever the two are reunited the two become friends,whenever the movie was released in the us i was
1,i am a huge fan of the original,i was very excited to see this one on
1,fairly soon i was able to watch this movie,fairly the movie also has a great deal of atmosphere
1,do n't waste your time on this one,do n't get me wrong i'm a sucker for
1,tom is an actor and he plays the perfect role for this film to work,tom savini is a great actor and his character is perfect in this film
1,but that is all that matters,but this one is not the worst
1,i do n't know if this movie is bad but the acting was good but the plot just seemed like,i have never heard of this one and i ca n't wait till the movie comes out on dvd
1,with the exception of the film it 's also very very funny and it,with the exception of the great cast the movie is a complete failure
1,i do n't understand why the director decided to make such a good movie,i saw this movie when i was in a class and it was a great
1,i do n't know what to say when i say this,i am a huge fan of the tv show but this is
1,but the movie is just as bad,but the story is a joke and the
1,there is n't one single thing in it that,there are many scenes that are n't funny
1,watching this movie is like a good example of how a movie should be a good movie,watching a film that is a little too long for its subject matter is not a good idea
1,in fact i have to say though that the plot is somewhat unbelievable,in the end this is one of the finest movies i 've ever seen
1,i have been in love and i 've been in love,i 've read a lot about the movie and i know that
1,please avoid the movie like this and if you are n't paying attention,please i say this movie is just so bad that you just have to
1,while this was a very good film it was a little bit of a letdown but not the best,while it is not an easy and interesting movie it is still one of the most memorable movies
1,first i think the director was trying to tell the truth,first there is a lot of action in the movie
1,that 's how you can get to the film to watch it and you wo n't be disappointed because it is so bad its bad it does n't even come close to being a,that was a bit of a shame since this was n't a movie that was released on video so you could see that the film is a little more than a little misleading
1,it 's not a bad movie but,it does n't make much sense
1,you know you are watching a documentary,you do not have to pay attention to
1,i have to admit that i have to admit i was impressed and i was impressed with the lack of realism,i saw this movie when i was 13 years old and i loved it so i do not like this film
1,this one is not for everyone but i recommend it to anyone with,this film is the best i have seen for a long time
1,the story itself is not bad the plot is contrived and predictable and the story just plain stupid,the only thing this film did n't commit about its release was that the film was released in the
1,but the film is also the one that i 've seen,but i guess the only reason i went to see it
1,i saw the movie on the sundance film festival and i loved it,i have to admit that i was n't a fan of this movie
1,upon hearing the title of this movie i have a feeling of deja vu,upon the film 's end he realizes that his son was killed by one of
1,i am not sure what that is,i would have liked to hear more about
1,most of the cast are all very good,most of the film is about the relationship that
1,at the same time i thought that the movie might be a bit too long,at least in one scene he is a bit frightened but that does n't mean that
1,even with a bit of a budget a good script and an excellent cast this is one of the best,even the actors who seem to work on a script like the one with the exception of a good old fashioned
1,congrats to the actors and the script,congrats for a few scenes of the film
1,the plot is very basic and the ending is predictable,the only thing that really got me was how this was
1,to sum this up this is a pretty bad movie,to sum it up it just is n't very funny
1,imho this movie is a waste of time,imho i have to say that i was disappointed
1,however the story is not as good,however the story was very good
1,my only complaint is that the characters in the story,my only problem in this movie is the ending
1,i do n't know how much money was spent with this movie,i think this is one of the best movies ever made and a
1,knowing that she has an eye of a,knowing how to do so much better
1,yep i know what the director and writer,yep that 's not a bad thing
1,yes the story line is a little convoluted and there are plenty of other scenes where the characters have to fight the other two,yes it is a bit of a parody of the original but it is also a very entertaining film that is quite enjoyable
1,this is one of the very very few movies that i have watched over,this one is a great movie for anyone who loves a good thriller
1,i think the reason i gave this movie 1 star was because i,i do not know why this film did n't even get released
1,i have seen this film a dozen times,i am a fan of the book
1,the movie is a good watch,the movie is a total bore that
1,she is the only character that is believable,she is the best thing to come out of
1,does he want revenge for her,does this have a point of view
1,of course the story is not that great,of course i have n't seen any of the
1,it seems to be the director 's fault to create some sort of tension in the film but the story,it seems that the movie has been shot in english so it is n't the story or the acting
1,this movie does nothing to distinguish the viewer 's intelligence and is n't just a good example,this is one of those movies that you would n't even have a chance on watching
1,the film was shot in a very tight way and the actors,the acting was horrible and i could barely help but laugh
1,to make matters worse this film is a must see,to be fair it 's not that the movie is n't
1,a good cast and a very nice story line make this a movie,a good example of the classic of the original and that was the result
1,the only reason i watched it till my friends is because i am a fan of the book and the movie was so good,the movie has a few funny moments in the end which are very funny and it 's a joy to see the rest of the
1,i am not going to go into the plot but i 'll never get a chance to watch this movie again,i would like to think it 's a good movie to make up for it and then i have a lot to
1,spoilers the ending and the ending was very abrupt,spoilers below the first two minutes of the movie are
1,he was also a great man,he 's the most annoying character in
1,this film has been released by several other great movies and i,this is one that is not only a vehicle to behold
1,he is a very nice guy but he does n't do that,he plays a tough role as the head of the group
1,it was n't the most memorable movie i have ever seen,it 's the only thing you have about it for me
1,many people who are familiar with this film should be ashamed for the fact that this movie has,many of us are familiar with the original the movie 's success as well as the book
1,as a matter of fact the acting is so bad i almost felt embarrassed for the actors and actresses involved to,as a matter of fact the movie was a complete disappointment as it turned out a bit slow at times
1,putting a lot of effort into the film that is,putting in a great performance by the lead actor
1,a lot of people do n't get it in the first place or so,a few weeks later i got to see this film as a child and i
1,simon and the gang are a little stiff but that does not,simon was a great character for the role of the father
1,but it is n't as bad as a lot of movies,but the fact that the film is a complete mess and the
1,the only redeeming feature is the fact that the,the story and story lines are very believable
1,i have been waiting for this one since i saw,i am not a fan of movies like this
1,all in all this is one of the best animated movies that i have ever seen,all in all it 's a pretty good film and it 's worth renting for its excellent
1,pitt does a fine job as the lead character of the film and his role in the film is quite nice,pitt is very good but he 's not even as good as he is and the other actors are very good
1,aileen has some nice moments but it does n't matter to her that she 's going to marry her and she is n't happy,aileen and her friends have to go back and try to make up their own mind but when they have to deal with the problem
1,the story of an ordinary man is very,the film has a lot of potential
1,of course it 's a film of the sort of thing where you can see the movie in a good light,of course the only reason to see this movie is because the director 's wife is in the film so it is
1,the story is a little thin,the plot is a little confusing to
1,john woo 's first film was a very good one,john wayne plays a tough guy but is not a bad
1,she has to be the most irritating character ever,she was a good actress but she was very good
1,then he meets a bunch of people,then you 're in for a ride in
1,all i can say is that the acting was good but i,all in all a very enjoyable film with lots of laughs
1,i do n't know if it should be that i have n't seen it in a theatre for several weeks,i was hoping that it would have some redeeming qualities but they 're so bad i do n't think the actors
1,i saw it when it first aired on television when it was released on dvd,i saw this movie at the sundance film festival in london and thought that it was
1,im not sure whether i should not have watched it,im a fan of this film and i think it 's
1,starring in the cast was also the only one,starring john huston and a wonderful supporting cast
1,norma shearer is perfect but she plays a very likable character who does n't seem to know what,norma was a great actress but the film 's only redeeming feature is the presence she had
1,now the only thing that is good about this movie is that the,now i do n't think that it has a lot to offer
1,she was the first victim to a female who was in prison and she is a little,she 's a bit too sweet and too bright to be too sweet in this movie
1,without any doubt the best of the series i have seen the sopranos is a wonderful film to play and it is definitely one of,without much thought about the movie there was a good deal of suspense and the movie could have done without a lot of nudity
1,anyway if you 're going to give it the benefit,anyway this is an example of a great idea
1,for example when he 's being shot by a woman who was obviously shot in his face he was shot,for a start i could n't help but feel the urge to go to the bathroom in my seat
1,this one is not worth the time,this is just a great movie
1,in short i think that 's why it is n't that,in short it is an amazing film for all ages
1,the film is n't even worth watching,the plot line was a joke
1,i would not go into the theater and it is n't a good sign to watch,i am still waiting for something a little more dramatic but i think that this movie is
1,now it is a good idea that a good idea for a film is not to be taken into consideration,now that we see this movie i am a sucker for a great horror film with lots of good acting bad
1,the acting and acting are terrible,the film is a bit of a
1,that the plot of the show has no meaning,that is why he 's so stupid and that 's
1,he does n't have the charisma or the skill of a,he also wrote the screenplay and directed by robert ryan
1,if this movie were made to have been a cult movie it might have been,if you are looking for a good action thriller this one is for you
1,yet the film was a waste of time,yet they 're all in love with each other
1,according to imdb users that this is a movie that,according to the film the movie is very funny
1,however the story is so predictable that i do n't know how i missed the end,however the story is about a man who is trying to save his family and life
1,from start to finish and in the film,from the very beginning i felt cheated
1,take this movie out of your own,take the time to do this
1,we get the impression of how a film can be done in a very,we all know that this is an important film for a long time
1,panned by an american film goer who was a big fan of the original,panned the ending and it 's just as good as the last episode
1,although it was a great movie that i 'd never seen it in the theater it was just as bad,although it is very dated and a bit dated and the characters are not as good and interesting as the original
1,it 's a real shame that the director never got the chance to direct the entire thing in this one,it is not as bad as the first two installments it shows the great acting abilities of the characters
1,he is not the only one to get a glimpse of,he is a good man who has a heart attack
1,pierce brosnan is a great actor but the,pierce reynolds and robert duvall are excellent
1,its a movie that you could not watch because you have,its not a bad idea to do the same thing
1,when i first saw it i did n't know what to expect,when i was in the theater i saw it a few years ago
1,it 's a shame that they did n't have a lot,it 's not a bad movie but it 's not
1,what we get is a very boring movie with some pretty lame scenes,what makes it even more funny is that it was so stupid
1,this is a very good film and the performances,this is a great movie for the family
1,i would like this one if there were one thing that i do n't like is how much the film 's story has to do with the characters,i 've never read a book so well that there are many more things in this film that are so stupid that i actually thought this movie was a
1,i do n't care if he does n't want to be the,i was surprised how much this film did n't really do
1,strangely enough the movie is not a comedy or even a comedy,strangely enough the movie is n't so bad that it 's hard to
1,with his trusty hair he is a bit of a jerk,with the exception of the two leading characters and the story is
1,can they make a movie about how to make a movie,can it be that it is a little slow and slow paced
1,i have n't seen the original movie but i 've read this film,i was so impressed by that and i thought i was watching a lot
1,not even the acting could not save this stinker,not a great film but it 's a good film
1,i would have loved to watch this series again on a sunday night,i think you 'll find a movie about a man who has his own
1,we are shown that the movie is a real stinker and that 's why,we are left wondering how they could have been in a better movie
1,which is not a bad word to,which makes it a good show
1,i was very impressed with the acting and acting,i have a hard time believing that it 's not
1,it was a very good movie,it is a good story for those
1,its a movie you do n't want to miss,its a very interesting film with some good laughs in
1,the film has a few interesting scenes but the film 's story,the movie is a bit of an insult to the intelligence
1,from what they 've said i was surprised to find out,from that point on the action is just plain awful
1,sure it was a good movie but that was just me,sure it 's not a bad film but there is also a
1,also i think the movie is a very accurate and very,also the film is not as good as its predecessor
1,penelope ricci was a great choice for her and her acting is great,penelope cruz is a great actor and i hope they do n't take her
1,it 's an enjoyable movie that you should watch and,it 's a pretty bad movie but not bad

1,i think i could n't find a good movie to play,i 've seen this film twice in the past 10 years and
1,my friend and i rented this movie and it 's so bad that it actually looks like the,my advice to those who have not seen it and who is a fan of the genre
1,we see it on a train station,we know we 're not supposed to be
1,they were the best in all this,they all get the best in the movie
1,but it 's still a nice film to see it has a lot of great action,but the movie has the same kind of humor that it 's a real stinker
1,while i think a lot of people think it was great and the acting was good,while i was in a small town in new york in the late 30s and early 30s
1,painfully stupid and utterly unnecessary the only redeeming feature,painfully bad movie and a waste of time
1,i was a little skeptical about the plot and the characters in the movie,i think this is one of the most underrated movies in the series
1,cut to the scene where the two main characters are the most beautiful of the entire film and they,cut to a few scenes of the movie are not really as memorable as in the first movie
1,certainly not as much to the story as this movie but if you,certainly one of those movies you would have to watch and enjoy
1,kevin spacey plays a great actor in this film who gives the,kevin smith is a good actor but this is no exception
1,she was n't so funny in this film,she does n't want to be a big star
1,it is a good movie and a very good one,it 's a shame to see a movie that can be
1,if you 're looking for a movie that does n't have a single redeeming features in,if you can watch a movie that 's a waste of your time and effort
1,it was a good idea but it is n't a good way to spend a saturday night with,it 's a real shame because this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,cbs should not make a movie that 's a waste of a time to watch,cbs has n't yet been released in the us so that the only good guys who
1,it is also a great film,it is one of those movies that
1,too bad i did n't pay attention to the story the acting was n't that terrible,too bad i did n't give it a 1 because i do not have a problem with
1,i think that this was one of his better films,i 've read some of the others that say they 're
1,why did the writers and producers have decided not to make a movie that is so bad that it actually,why does this have to be one of the best movies ever made in the history of the genre
1,as for me i 've got my doubts and i 'll never get my hands on the dvd for anyone,as for the other actors in the cast it 's all pretty good and it 's not a bad film
1,woolsey is a very funny film and i think it 's a shame that the film has been a success in,woolsey does his best as the evil but the rest of the cast is a fine choice for a movie
1,i do n't know what to say i do admire but i 've seen it a dozen times already,i do n't know if i was watching a movie but it was just too damn stupid and i really
1,rob schneider is one of my favorites,rob lowe was in this movie
1,but i think that is a shame,but it 's not the same
1,in the first half of the movie we 're supposed to feel sorry for the,in the end it was a very good movie that i would recommend it
1,william wyler is one of those people who,william wyler is a genius to play
1,it is not the most difficult to understand it 's a great example of what it is,it would n't be much like this but the film also is quite well done in that the
1,weight is a real classic for me,weight is one of his best and most
1,as it turns out they are in a coma and,as a result this is a very bad movie
1,let me say that this movie is not for me,let 's not forget to give you a clue why you
1,this is a film that should n't,this movie is not for everyone
1,being a huge fan of movies like this i have n't seen any of these movies,being a fan of horror movies i have never seen a movie like this before
1,as a result of the film 's plot the viewer is left wondering,as for me it was the best movie i have ever seen
1,was he a coward or was he a coward,was he supposed to be a funny guy
1,i think the movie 's biggest problem in the film is that the main character is so much as to be a caricature of himself and he does n't have to be one of,i was hoping that the filmmakers would n't have a lot of money for that but it was n't really a movie to me that i would rate a movie like this one
1,there 's a lot of the movie,there 's a lot of violence and the
1,normally the film is so bad it 's laughable,normally it is not funny it 's not funny
1,funnily enough the plot is a bunch of kids who go out to,funnily enough this is not the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,sorry but i have to say that it is an absolute failure to watch a good comedy,sorry folks but i think it 's a great movie to watch if you want to be entertained
1,i 've read a few comments from this website that the film has been,i do n't know about this one but i did n't like it
1,i was hoping it would be another great movie,i have seen some pretty good films and have seen
1,seriously i thought the movie was great,seriously i do n't think that it 's
1,in the end it 's not a great movie as it is a very good film but the acting is superb,in one scene he 's a man and he has to be a person with his fists and the other
1,for example the entire film looks cheap,for some strange reason he has been on
1,the only reason i gave this movie a 3 was,the only problem with this film is the acting
1,unfortunately there have to be a few,unfortunately it 's not a comedy
1,do n't waste your time on this crap,do n't get me wrong this film was very
1,throw in some decent acting and a good plot and,throw the film in a window of your own
1,she was not a good actress but,she is also a beautiful woman
1,melanie griffith was one of the best actresses ever to grace her and,melanie griffith is a great director and this is a good example
1,and it is not a comedy but it 's a very entertaining film in its own right,and if it was n't for the fact that i was a little bit disturbed and had a
1,anyway i have n't seen anything in a long,anyway the acting and acting is top notch
1,marlon brando is great as a detective who,marlon brando is excellent in his role
1,you 're not really sure what 's going on,you 'll be able to predict what is going on
1,the first thing that struck me was the fact that this,the acting is very good especially in the second part
1,this was a movie made for tv and it 's not the best of the series,this film is the best of it 's kind and the movie is a complete waste of
1,and i was a big fan of the first one,and the movie is just a little too boring for my
1,not to mention that i think it 's not worth mentioning,not that i 'd be able to see what the movie is
1,after all that he was n't even in a good place,after the success of the original bambi and the omen the movie
1,also the music was very very good,also if there is a story about the
1,still i ca n't imagine how anyone can compare this one to the original,still i would not recommend this film to all fans of the genre and it
1,drivel is the worst movie i 've seen in my life,drivel is not a problem and it has to be made up
1,it 's all very well done and,it is a very good film
1,indeed it 's not that bad,indeed there is a bit of violence
1,the plot was pretty weak and i was hoping that a lot more of them,the movie was shot in a time of the past but that was it
1,the plot is about a group of kids who go in search of,the only thing this movie has going for it is the soundtrack
1,this is the best movie i 've seen,this was a very low budget film
1,he is the first person in his,he 's also the real murderer
1,while it 's not the best movie ever made it is a good example for a movie to be a comedy,while the first half of the film is a little bit of a comedy it also is n't the most exciting
1,it has a great cast and a fantastic cast,it 's a great movie and i recommend it to
1,who could have done better with this,who can make fun of it
1,frankly the movie was made up in a small,frankly i was very impressed with the acting
1,the film is a bit of an action thriller,the acting is very good and the plot is very
1,what i got was a good movie with an excellent story that is so much better than this,what makes it so funny is how you know the story is going to be a bit more interesting
1,i think that this movie is a must see for anyone interested in seeing a movie in their lives and not,i do not understand that the film was n't released at the time of the release of 2005 's release
1,the story is simple the characters are interesting and you know the characters are all very important to the plot to make a story but it 's just,the film is about a young man named krishna and his younger son who are invited to spend a weekend together on a deserted road in italy
1,the only way to get a decent job is the fact that the movie,the story is a bit confusing and the acting is not the best
1,basically the movie is about a man who goes into the past and tries to be a little too hard to get his hands on it,basically the story is about an evil man who tries to kill a girl and the daughter he has to protect him from being kidnapped by a
1,director michael curtiz had made the most of the film the fact that it had the same cast as,director james toback is the only film that i can honestly say this is one of his finest
1,but this movie is a total waste of time,but the fact that the director does have a good
1,you 'll see it all the way and not even the most hilarious of them will come together,you know the story is set in a prison cell where the characters are so onedimensional that they do
1,the plot and acting are good but this was not a great movie,the only redeeming quality i can find is that they made this turkey
1,i have never forgotten the last one of it,i have been a huge fan of his films
1,mistake is one of the greatest and most underrated movies of all time,mistake to go and see this movie it is a waste for the movie
1,there 's a lot of action but nothing else is really explained or explained,there are two of the three leads in the film and the film is a
1,i 've seen the first film that is n't so bad that,i do n't know why it was such a great movie
1,this is the most powerful thing that is going on in the movie,this movie was one of those movies where you can only laugh at it
1,the only redeeming quality of this movie is the cinematography and editing,the story is a bit of a mess but the acting was n't
1,the story is about a group of people who,the script is very good for this movie
1,i think that is the best way to describe this movie,i have never been a big fan of either of these movies
1,a very bad movie and it is not the worst of the worst but it 's one that i 've ever seen on the big screen with,a few things in the film you 'll love the film though is the fact that the film is set in a city of new york
1,the movie starts with a bang and ends with a bang,the film is a bit too long and is n't even worth
1,honestly it was n't a good movie and the ending,honestly it was an awful and very bad movie
1,and i did n't know why he,and what 's up with that
1,he is the most annoying actor of the film,he is also a good actor he was a great
1,but it is n't a bad thing,but the movie does n't work
1,as a fan of musicals i was impressed and the film was very well made and well acted,as the movie progresses and the film starts to go downhill we get to see how much more of
1,now if the movie was not so great that they could n't take a movie that seriously could have made it interesting and then they would be a little better,now the movie is about a woman who is not a virgin or a woman and the mother who is n't the person she wants to do and that 's about
1,the film 's plot is pretty standard and the acting in particular is very wooden,the plot is simple but you can tell it is a good family movie
1,if there 's one thing that i have to say about this film that i would n't give this movie,if you are a diehard fan of the series you will probably not find it very funny at all
1,fortunately the only one i have ever seen is the most ardent of the characters are not the,fortunately the rest of the film is about the only thing that keeps going to the end
1,the script is full of clichs,the film is a real treat for
1,these guys are not so stupid that they ca n't even get the girl to wear the same,these people are so much different in the future so much more interesting to me than that
1,rather than the usual hollywood fluff we can see the world trade center of the world and the people who are responsible for the murders the war and the,rather than just be a movie about a killer it 's not as bad as it was and the characters were not likable the story was pretty good
1,i would recommend this movie to anyone,i saw it on the shelves
1,only a handful of scenes were filmed in the background and the film was shot,only to get that money back to the film 's title of the film
1,a few people will be disappointed in the film,a good cast and a very interesting script
1,when the film is finally finished there 's a very slow pace that is not worth sitting through,when the movie was over you would n't have to have been a fan of the movie
1,it 's a good thing to see that the actors are in the background and they 're all so great and,it 's an insult to the filmmakers of the film that this film is a complete mess of any film
1,not a good thing for a film,not only does she try to get out
1,tellingly is the only thing that really makes it worthwhile,tellingly this is one of those films that i 've seen
1,seeing a woman who has an eye in her,seeing the first film is a good idea
1,the movie was a bit too long but in a good way,the film is very good but it 's not a good movie
1,after a while we are not sure why we 're going to see it,after watching the film i realized that it was the most boring movie i have
1,have n't they been the same,have n't we heard about it before
1,as for the film i have to admit that i enjoyed the movie,as a film it is a complete waste of time and time
1,sophia myles is also excellent as an actress in the,sophia myles is also very good in her role
1,i 've seen a lot of films and i have seen better movies,i saw it in a sneak preview and have been waiting for it to
1,get rid of the film as a film and then you,get back to your local library for the last time
1,we are also led to believe that the,we all have that the same thing
1,and the fact that this film is a remake of the first film in the past is a,and if it is the case of this one i 'd advise you to go see it
1,every time i watch this i will give it,every scene was shot in a time warp
1,a lot of people seem to know the story of the,a movie that i could barely sit back and enjoy
1,the only thing the movie had going,the movie was a little slow
1,i'm not sure why the movie was so bad i thought they could,i'm sorry but i do n't think that it is the same
1,for example the scene where the killer is killed is the,for a movie of this type i was very impressed
1,however this is just a fun film,however i was a bit surprised with this
1,but then again there were some funny scenes,but if you 've read some comments on here
1,one of the best things about the movie was the acting by,one of the best things about this film was the ending
1,the film is a total disaster and it is a pity as it is a very poor film,the script is full of holes and the plot is a mess but there 's a great deal of
1,and i do n't like movies that have the same theme,and i do think that the director has a lot of fun
1,now it seems that there are many different types of,now the plot of the movie was that bad
1,but i think it 's a very good movie,but the fact that this film has a good cast
1,as a result the film does seem to be an attempt to be an homage to the classic films,as for the rest of the cast i think that was the only reason i liked this film
1,the movie is a bit of a mess of a film,the acting is horrible and the script is a joke
1,it 's not just that it 's a comedy,it 's not even a movie that 's about how
1,wife was a man of the gods and that,wife is the best thing about the movie
1,itv has made a film with the,itv was a very good movie
1,in short this movie is very good,in fact this has to be the worst
1,i 've seen it a million times and will never ever watch it again,i 've seen a few films that have been made to look so good
1,it 's also a very good performance and the story is quite believable,it was just that the movie was shot on a cheap camera and the
1,it 's a shame that the film does n't come close to any other,it 's an example of the kind of film that makes you laugh and you
1,this is a movie that has a,this movie is a complete mess
1,2 the scene when the police officer is,2 the plot was a bit confusing
1,especially the scenes where the girl and the kids are walking around on stage and,especially the scene where he was a member of his family is very annoying
1,but the film is so poorly acted it is impossible to believe that anyone would actually have to sit through this mess,but that 's about it so there 's a lot more to it than that and that is a great deal of the
1,overall this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i,overall the acting is great especially the young victoria and the story line
1,yes there are some really funny scenes in this film,yes there was an occasional lack of a lot of violence
1,it is very funny how they make it through the entire movie,it is a great movie that will not leave you feeling comfortable or
1,it is a movie that will be remembered by everyone in it 's purest tastes,it 's a great story that will make the whole experience easier for a family to
1,so the audience is treated to an extremely boring and incoherent film with the usual clich plot holes and a few scenes which,so it seems that the filmmakers have decided to try to create something more serious and it 's not the best one
1,note the fact that this movie was released in 2001 i do n't want to ruin the movie with it,note to me that a film that is so much more than a drama and the actors are very well done
1,instead it 's a movie with no real substance whatsoever but it 's just not very good to,instead of trying to make us think it is a bad movie it is a complete failure
1,richard burton is the only good thing about this film,richard widmark is a genius as the lead character but the
1,i do n't remember it being so much of a surprise since it was a little slow,i was so impressed by the story and the performances that it became so difficult to follow and
1,it is a film that should go on and on,it has a good cast of characters that make you laugh
1,stomach candy is another movie for all ages,stomach is a good story and it is the
1,for a start of the movie the viewer is left with an impression of what the future was,for example i do n't think he has any redeeming qualities or a good sense of humor
1,the film 's climax is the first scene in the movie where the two main characters have been killed off and the two survivors,the plot is a little too simple and the story is very simple and there is very little to recommend in a movie
1,most of these are the only ones who are n't good in these roles,most of the characters were so stupid and the movie was so predictable that i
1,many of his friends are not very good but they are still very well,many people are not interested in movies but this is one of them
1,diane varsi plays a young actress who is trying to get the money to the top of things she has,diane varsi has a lot in common with her but she has done much much better in this role
1,i would like to think that this is a movie,i have to say it 's a good movie
1,in the end it is all very good,in fact he 's not so funny in his
1,it is a story about an american,it is a very bad movie
1,as with all movies this movie 's plot is very simple as we know that this,as a matter of fact there 's a lot to be said for the movie
1,he is the only one who is a good actor,he 's an expert who is a loner with an agenda
1,only in that respect for the fact that the story is set in a world where the movie is set up and is a bit too simple and boring,only to see if you are the kind of person who can do what life is like and what it is all about and it 's so funny
1,its not bad and i have to say it was,its a good movie if you like the genre
1,apart from that the acting is terrible the script worse and the acting is horrible,apart from the fact that i have seen it all the way through it is n't
1,the plot is pretty good but the acting is,the acting is terrible with only one character
1,essentially the script is a little stilted,essentially that 's what i call a movie
1,i have to admit that i have never seen a movie like this before that even the most recent movie is,i have n't seen a movie that has so many good moments i have to say i thought that i would watch
1,it 's a very good thing,it is very hard to tell how
1,however the story itself was so bad it could have been better,however i have to admit that i found it very entertaining
1,you do n't have to pay attention to how,you will have your own conclusions on it
1,maxx is a good horror movie that is very well done,maxx is one of the worst movies i 've seen in a
1,amitabh bachchan as the chief is an interesting character,amitabh bachchan 's character is a bit too young in
1,what 's with the way of making it,what makes this so great is how it was
1,gregory peck and his friends are the best in their respective roles,gregory peck was one of the greatest actors in the world
1,also there were several scenes which made me think of the,also i found myself wanting to laugh at the jokes
1,if you want to see a movie with bad acting and an even greater viewpoint you might,if you are going to watch this movie you can be quite surprised by the acting
1,my favorite scene is when a girl is raped a woman stabs in the head,my wife was in a mental institution when the first movie to be on the tv
1,and it has nothing to do with the story of the characters in the film,and if you do n't get a chance to see it you will have to watch
1,the story line is so weak,the story is not as good as
1,screamers was one of the most original films in my collection and,screamers was one of the best films of the 90 's
1,the plot is very simple and there are so many twists the story is so weak,the film also has a very interesting story about the human spirit that is presented
1,or is it a bad movie for anyone who is n't,or maybe that 's what the movie is going on
1,there is a lot of nudity and some of,there were many things wrong with this movie
1,i would recommend this film to anyone who has to see the movie as a child,i think this movie should have been banned as an adult film and should probably be watched
1,that 's how you can get a,that 's all i can say
1,it 's a shame that the film never got any better,it is n't the worst movie i 've ever seen but it
1,to begin with a very very bad movie,to make matters worse the acting was awful the
1,if the viewer is supposed to care less about the movie and the story of the characters and the plot and acting it does n't work,if you 're not a teenager and want to see a good movie with some mates and a few laughs watch something that is n't for you
1,it was just a waste of time and money,it is one of those movies so that it is
1,you do not need to see any of the actors in this movie to make,you 'll find yourself laughing at the stupidity of the film in this film
1,as i mentioned earlier it is an excellent story,as the movie progresses we 're left wondering how he
1,if you 're a fan of the genre or you like action movies you should be able to enjoy this one,if you are looking for a scary movie that is fun to watch and you can get into the plot this is
1,yeah there 's some nice scenery in the first half but this one is really not,yeah i do n't think i have ever seen a movie that was made with such a
1,check it out if you can get past the,check it out in the first 10 seconds
1,as a fan of movies this is not an exception to the rule of the film,as for all of the actors in the movie there 's a lot of action in this
1,i saw this movie on a friday night in london in 1979 and i was really surprised by it,i am not saying that this movie is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life
1,that being said the story is so simple that even a little of the story is a little confusing,that 's what you would call a movie with an interesting story a good cast a decent script good music
1,a young boy and two young girls go on a trip,a great movie and i hope it gets more attention
1,knightley 's character was a bit too long,knightley and her husband have a good time in
1,i was surprised that it was n't a remake,i saw the movie at the amsterdam film festival
1,we know that the director is n't going to have a chance to redeem himself as the story progresses,we get the impression that it 's just a bad movie but it 's still very good for all the
1,however the script is pretty good and the story is very intriguing and it keeps you guessing throughout,however as for the rest of the story it seems like it would take a lot to take on
1,the acting is superb the characters are likable the story is well written and well done,the plot is simple the characters are stupid and the story is a complete waste of money
1,the only thing that could possibly be saved by the movie was the fact that i had,the film was shot at the time and it was very grainy for a few seconds
1,i would like to say that the only good part of this episode is the scene where she 's trying to save it from the shark that is n't as bad as the rest of,i think the film would n't have been made by the makers of the earlier film the film 's creators were more interested in keeping a straight face and the director could be forgiven
1,sinuhe also appears to be a very,sinuhe 's performance is quite convincing
1,well if the movie does have a few moments i would not have missed this but it 's worth a watch,well i did n't know what to expect from a friend of the dead and the movie had a little more going
1,a lot of the movie is about the characters,a good story and a very good movie
1,the film is a bit slow moving but it is n't too long and the story is very thin,the acting is good but the script is so poor that even the actors seem embarrassed and confused
1,i 've seen the movie a million times and i 've never seen any of those other,i have to say it is a great show that will make you laugh out loud
1,emotions of course are not that easy for us and our lives,emotions abound in a very different form as the plot unfolds
1,my only criticism is that the story line was a little confusing and i found myself wanting a good ending,my friends and i are both in love with the movie so it can get me to feel like i was
1,in fact the movie 's biggest flaw is to get the audience to,in fact the film was a complete waste of time and money
1,one of the greatest films i 've ever seen,one can only hope they do not make the movie
1,10 out of 10 for the fact that there was no plot,10 stars i am not a huge fan of the show
1,just do n't expect much and you,just as bad as the original
1,these characters are a real treat to behold,these days i have a fondness for the movie
1,three years later a film called the man and the lion,three of the finest things that happened is the movie is not
1,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen the cast is so,this movie should be required by anyone looking for a good laugh
1,the acting in the film is so good that you ca n't help it,the film has a very interesting plot but it just does n't work at all
1,he has been trying to do something that is n't funny and has n't been done,he is an excellent actor who plays a character who has to be the most likable person
1,my friends and i were all laughing at the jokes and the music and the story,my only criticism of the movie is the acting of the actors in the movie
1,charles bronson has an interesting cameo as the police detective of the town that has been sent,charles napier 's character is so stupid that the character 's motivations are not fleshed out
1,the movie was just boring and i think this is supposed to be a film for the whole family,the story is a little slow and it does n't make much sense but it still is good enough to
1,bouncing the camera to the camera and the lighting and camera work,bouncing with the wind 's face and the sound of music and you
1,most of the film is shot in a studio style style and the actors try to act like a bunch of,most of the time i was laughing so hard that i could not even get it out of my head
1,anyway the film is a very interesting and very moving look at life in the modern world in which,anyway i 've always liked the way the actors were able to portray them to be very good
1,the plot is a little thin but it is interesting,the film also features the same character as the original the
1,i do n't know about you,i am still waiting for the end
1,all in all it 's a pretty good film,all of the characters are so likable and the story
1,vodka was not the only good movie to come out of the gate,vodka is a great movie with a very good ending and great acting
1,existenz 's is an excellent film,existenz is a very good film
1,old fashioned horror movie with lots of fun in it the story itself is,old enough for a couple of hours in the end of the movie
1,ever since i 've seen this film i 've been looking through a lot of the comments and comments about this show so i'm not going to spoil it,ever since he has been killed by an unknown woman he begins to get a job of a man who he thinks of him and his son who is also
1,you will find yourself wishing that a little bit of,you have the ingredients of a good horror film
1,claim the film has a very bad,claim they are all the same
1,the film is a bit slow at times but it,the movie is a bit like the first one
1,if you want to see this film it is a great idea to get into a lot of things,if you want to see a good movie about a young man 's life this film is for you
1,so what 's the deal in the movie,so i did n't get to read any reviews
1,as for it it is very funny to hear how the grinch has a crush on him,as a matter of fact the film is not even worth the time it takes to watch it
1,and it 's also a nice movie that you should definitely enjoy,and it was the best thing i have seen from any of the
1,the acting is pretty poor the directing is terrible,the only thing that kept me watching was the scene
1,but the story has a lot of twists and turns,but that is not the case with the film 's plot
1,you have to watch it to understand the plot and what it is is a simple and thoughtprovoking experience,you have seen some of her films that do not make much sense and are not only a little bit
1,the movie is not even a comedy but a fun and entertaining movie with,the first half has a great cast and it 's a great movie
1,but i would have been so glad i watched that film,but i was n't impressed in the story of the movie
1,which i thought was pretty good and the actors were good,which was a shame because i did n't have the time to
1,the only good thing i can say about this movie is that,the acting and directing is flawless and the acting is great
1,the film is a real treat to the entire movie but it is also a good,the plot is a simple one of the most intriguing stories ever created on film
1,instead it was an entertaining movie,instead it 's not just a film
1,minghella 's character is very believable with his character and his facial expressions and mannerisms are impeccable,minghella is n't the only actor he has in his career that makes it a little easier to
1,there is a lot more in the,there is a lot of action
1,slight spoilers ahead there was a lot of potential,slight spoilers i thought the movie was great because it
1,so much so that i could n't get into the story,so if you have seen the original version i would say this
1,go see it and see how much you,go ahead and watch the movie instead
1,every character seems to be having a great time with their roles,every single character is played by a man that is a little bit
1,the only reason i wanted to see the movie was because my roommate said it was a great film,the story is very weak and the characters all speak to each other like they were in the book but
1,it is an excellent movie and a good film,it is a story about a girl that is in
1,there 's a bit of nudity and nudity,there are also some nice touches of the movie
1,following a series of events in an abandoned building the audience sees the film of this type of film and that it,following the movie with the main character 's wife is a bit more than an excuse for a very good movie
1,i do n't think the film is a perfect example of what it was like,i have never heard of this movie before and it 's not even that funny
1,this was a really good movie,this is a great film that i
1,it 's a movie of a kind of old black and white tv,it 's a shame that the film is not available on dvd
1,this was the first movie in which i have seen that 's been filmed in a week in the past,this time the movie is not as much fun as the book the movie was based on and it was n't
1,this is the only movie i can recall about a,this was the worst film i have ever seen
1,it was n't a very good film and there are no good actors at all,it 's a shame that the movie has been so badly remastered and edited with such
1,but this was a really good movie,but then again i 'll say you 're
1,back then there was a little too much going on,back then i had to watch the whole movie
1,tommy lee jones has an excellent role as a,tommy lee jones plays the character 's father
1,wilson is a good actor and i,wilson 's character is very good
1,they are all very good and very good but the film is not so terrible,they do n't seem to care about what to do and what happened in the last
1,the story is so weak that it 's actually,the story and the dialogue is very good
1,mainly this movie was shot in a small town,mainly due to his talent and a lack of talent
1,if you have n't seen this film and if you do n't have the patience to watch the movie for the first time you wo,if you 're looking for a great horror film go out and rent it if you love the original it 's a great movie
1,that 's what the producers were aiming,that was not the case here
1,it 's a shame that the filmmakers,it 's not a bad movie
1,now this is the best movie,now i do n't know how to
1,despite a few flaws it is not a good film to watch,despite the fact that the movie was based on a true story i
1,the story line was a mess in itself,the movie has a few funny moments but overall
1,this movie is a waste of money,this is what makes it so great
1,i'm not a prude but i'm not sure what i do n't think,i'm sorry but it does n't make sense to the plot or character development
1,super mario 's character is a real person in every way and i think the movie was a bit,super hero is not the only film that has to be the worst movie in my entire life
1,the plot is so ridiculous and so predictable it 's untrue,the film is a little too short on its own and it
1,the film is a complete failure,the first movie was about the power
1,for the time of this film i would give an oscar for it,for a long time he was a big star and he did not seem
1,i have to admit it was a little overdone,i think it would have been much better to have
1,i was so impressed in the story and so many questions,i 've read all the comments here about this movie
1,so the film was made with a lot of potential,so i am a sucker for a bad movie
1,i do n't know whether to say the same thing about it i would have to say,i was very disappointed when i watched the film for the first time in the theater
1,it 's not as great or as bad as the others but the story is good,it 's not a movie that is so bad it 's funny it 's just awful
1,even the music is n't bad but that 's the only thing that is,even though it is an excellent film it is not a good movie
1,they are all good and are n't very good or good,they 're not so bad they are good in their movies
1,in a movie like this you get to understand why they had,in fact he is the best character in the whole film
1,the movie is a complete mess,the only real gripe that this film
1,the only reason it was being released theatrically was because it was a remake for,the story is a bit slow but the film has the most basic plot
1,dakota fanning plays the role of a woman who has to,dakota fanning is one of the most underrated actors ever
1,apart from that it is one of the most boring films i 've ever seen,apart from the fact that they are trying to make it all seem very realistic and
1,the film opens with an old man getting a tip to his head,the film 's title sequence is an insult to both the director and the
1,yeah there were a lot of bad things about this film,yeah i know that i can only say a few of my
1,but it does n't have to go to the lowest common denominator and you should n't see it in,but this was a great movie and a great movie with some nice twists and good special effects
1,in fact the film is a mess,in fact it was so stupid
1,cramer is not a good actress but he is a great actor who is in it so many of his films,cramer is a young woman who is a struggling man to take her out to a small village in france where she
1,like the other reviewer said it was a bad movie,like i said before i have seen it a few times
1,i do n't know why people would like this movie so much,i think i should 've been a big fan of this film as
1,but if you 're an avid fan of the genre,but the story is a mess of a film
1,especially the scene where the hero is walking through a table while he is talking about it and then,especially the scene with her friend and the woman who is supposed to play basketball is pretty funny
1,there are so few things that i do n't know about,there were some good performances and it was a shame i was
1,i do n't think it is that the best part of the movie is the fact that the story is a complete waste of,i have never been a big fan of the comics but the movie is a great example of what the movie is about
1,i have never seen a good asian film before,i saw a few films with a few people that
1,after watching this movie the only reason i can see is,after all this film was made for tv i think
1,it is one of those movies you can find in the video stores and,it 's not that bad and i think that the actors are good
1,if you like movies about dinosaurs and animals i 'd recommend it if you like it,if you want to see a good film in a long time watch a movie
1,van helsing is the best actor ever but he 's,van dyke is one of the finest actors ever
1,too bad he 's not as good as it would be if he was on his way to fame,too many people who have n't seen this film are the ones who have to be so hard to read
1,justice of the story of his character is the,justice is the most difficult film to follow
1,it was an interesting film that i could,it was a nice film to watch
1,there is some good acting from him and the supporting cast are very good,there 's no doubt that this is a very very good movie but that 's
1,the unguarded and the dead poets was an incredible experience,the unguarded world' is the best of the bunch
1,i would have been so much more upset if the,i saw this film yesterday and i must say
1,i was really looking forward to seeing this movie,i 've heard that this was a huge success
1,who is the guy who killed a woman,who 's that knocking off a gun
1,and the scene with the giant critter is a little too much,and that 's the reason why you watch a movie of the same
1,there 's no plot to speak of either,there are many other movies out there that are
1,even though she is supposed to be a bit less serious in her part she is still a bit naive,even the most ardent fan of me is not a fan of movies or films like this one that have no
1,a good cast of characters is wasted here but that is n't all it is n't,a lot of things seem to be very common to the story and not to mention a
1,way too much of this film is n't that great either,way too much for it 's own good and it 's not
1,some of the jokes were funny and the jokes,some have complained about the movie as well
1,this is a very funny movie and i think that is a shame,this movie is an excellent film about the holocaust and it does not take
1,this is one that is really a bad bad bad movie,this was a great movie for those who liked those
1,the acting was horrible the plot was horrible and the ending was so,the plot is a joke and a little too convoluted at times
1,one thing that i really liked about this film was that it was a very low budget movie,one of the best i 've seen is in the film and a good movie that has some of
1,this was one of those movies that was so,this film is the worst movie ever made
1,far far too late for the rest of the movie to be a total,far too many things do not make the movie relevant for the plot
1,although i can only assume that it is a good film for a rainy day it is a great movie,although the movie is not as good as it would have been in this movie they are not the best ones
1,to me i do know the story was n't the same as the original,to me this film is not only a bad film but the fact that it
1,i was surprised at the amount of people involved in this film but the,i saw this movie yesterday and i have to say i'm pretty disappointed
1,the movie is a bit of a disappointment but that 's the only thing i can think of,the film 's plot is so predictable that we can see the director suspending disbelief at the audience and
1,please stop this movie from its own good,please i do n't have any complaints on my
1,although the movie is not as bad as some of the others it 's,although the plot is somewhat original it is very interesting and very entertaining
1,as for the film itself it was not a movie,as for the other characters it has no real connection to
1,besides this is an interesting film,besides this was one great movie
1,she also meets her daughter and is now a child who is n't quite as strong as she,she is a very strong woman and is not only a woman who also has an affair
1,my friend and i had to laugh at this film,my favorite scene is when a man kills a child of
1,this is the only movie i can remember where the director 's cut was in the film,this film is about a group of teens who get into trouble with a young girl named alice
1,in my eyes a film about a group of people from,in fact this has a good story a good cast
1,milestone also gives us an excellent cast that includes a very talented lionel atwill as a man who has no problems with his,milestone is one of those movies that i 've never seen before which could n't have come up with something so good
1,you do not want to watch this movie,you have to see the film to get it
1,the story is not bad the acting is,the film is a very entertaining one
1,duane and his men are in the right place,duane is a great actor but he is n't in
1,after watching a few episodes i was amazed to see this movie,after the film i found myself thinking wow this was supposed to have
1,they are a bunch of people who have a hard time with each,they 're the most pathetic and stupid things i have ever seen
1,this is a really good film,this is a very bad film
1,yank is an example of what the movie should do,yank is not a great show but there is a lot
1,we know that he is a little too ungrateful but that 's what makes it interesting,we 're told that the movie is n't just a spoof but a horror film and a
1,i do n't think they 're the only good thing to say,i do n't think the movie was meant to be funny or original
1,thank god i have a refund for this movie,thank you for giving this film a look
1,if you can find this film you can find some good things about your brain,if you want to see something interesting in this case you 'll love this movie
1,this film has nothing to recommend it except the fact that it 's a film about a bunch of young men who are trapped in a deserted island in a forest,this was n't the case with the movie because the director wanted to give a good idea that he wanted to make a good movie but failed miserably and it failed miserably
1,and if the film was n't a little,and it did n't make any sense
1,boogie nights is an excellent movie that has many,boogie nights is not a film to watch
1,i would have liked to see more of this type of thing,i 've seen this movie several times already and i can appreciate it
1,do yourself a favor and go and rent this one,do n't be fooled by the fact that you will never
1,i am glad i did but i really liked the movie as it,i have no idea how this movie got a rating of 3
1,i do recommend the whole film as a comedy,i would have given this movie a rating higher than
1,after watching it i felt i could have been better off watching it with the,after all this is a great show that i would love to see again
1,my favorite part of the movie is when the girl is trying to,my advice is that this is a movie of a good movie
1,o'toole 's character is a stereotype and he becomes the prime suspect for his daughter,o'toole and his men have to deal with a married couple who go on to find
1,nothing more than a series of flashbacks,nothing is explained that the film is a
1,he is the only one who can get out of his,he does n't seem to care about any of them
1,my wife and i were watching this movie for the first time,my rating for this film 210 i give it a 10
1,everybody should watch this movie if you 're a fan of the original,everybody is entitled to the level of a great actress who 's acting is
1,her character is so believable and the characters are so likable that you ca,her character is a real bitch and it 's easy to understand why
1,i have no idea how it would have been a good movie and had it in theaters as,i saw this movie and i thought hey the best part of this movie was the ending
1,it is a good idea to make a good movie with a decent cast of actors,it was so bad it was funny but the whole thing did not seem realistic
1,if the viewer is supposed to accept the fact that he 's a little too preoccupied with the film he might,if you like to see a movie that has the potential to be a good movie that is n't good
1,its a movie about a group of men who live together,its a great film and you have to love it
1,going to the cinema is a very entertaining one and the ending is a bit of a surprise,going to the movies to be a bit of a cult classic it is a good one to watch
1,simple and very simple about the story of a woman,simple to be a little bit of a joke
1,but this is one of those shows that i think was supposed to be about a,but the film has a few good moments and they are n't all that good
1,i 've seen this movie in many times and it 's still great,i do n't remember that much of the film but i was hoping it
1,the only good thing about me is that it was made with a lot of,the plot is not really bad it 's the same as the first movie
1,the movie is a little bit too short but for me it 's a fun movie,the plot is a bunch of random characters who have nothing to do with the story
1,the script is a joke from beginning to end,the film 's climax is a tad slow but it
1,410 the best of the worst movies ever,410 i love the movie and i like the
1,however i found myself enjoying the film so much i wanted,however as for the plot the acting is pretty weak
1,it 's the same type of movie as the other movies,it 's a good thing but it 's a bit too slow
1,our heroes would be more interested in the plight of,our hero does n't even know who he is
1,the movie has a good cast,the plot of this movie was a
1,and the ending is a very good surprise but the film,and then you get that you are not gonna care
1,allen also had a lot of good things going for it and he has some great lines,allen 's character is just as good as the one who 's in the movie and i really
1,i am a sucker for films that are so bad it 's good,i do n't want to be racist and say so but i think i
1,sex is the only way to make the point of the movie,sex scenes are pretty much all that 's done with the same style
1,i do n't know whether i am trying to explain what to expect,i am glad to say i have n't watched it since i was so
1,the story line is not bad and the actors do n't make the story believable,the story is very simple the acting and cinematography of the film and the actors is
1,and what is that all about,and what do they have for the
1,i 've heard some reviews from a good director,i do n't know whether or not to stop watching
1,there 's a scene with the woman walking around with her husband and his wife,there are a few funny moments but the movie is not so bad it 's funny
1,for a movie that was supposed to be funny and the story is not funny,for those who have never seen such an intelligent and thoughtprovoking story i 'd say this
1,the acting was bad the directing was terrible and,the film also has an excellent supporting cast
1,watch the film for its own merit,watch it and laugh at it
1,not the first of all the other great movies,not only do they have to deal with some of
1,her acting career in this movie is a real,her character is just a little too old
1,god bless him from this one and it 's a,god 's movie is a great film to watch
1,he has to be the most talented performer i 've ever,he was just as funny as the rest of us
1,and the ending was just plain bad,and that 's where the comparison ends
1,my favorite parts include some guy getting killed and his girlfriend goes to see it,my favorite parts are when the guy gets killed by the police squad with some of
1,the film does contain a lot of good acting and a solid script and some excellent special effects and a good script,the film is about the life of a man who is not a woman who is cheating on the death of a man
1,the film is a very interesting one and the director is n't afraid to get away with it,the movie starts out with a very good premise but is n't enough to get a coherent script
1,basically this movie is a mess,basically it is a movie about the
1,bottom line this is a very good show,bottom line it is a good movie
1,it 's like watching a documentary on a train and that is a rare thing,it is a film that is so funny that it is almost unbearable to watch
1,this movie is a complete failure from beginning to end,this film was a big disappointment in the first place
1,particularly the scenes where she is in the hospital room and the car chases the scene in the bar with the two girls walking around in a car,particularly in the second half of the movie it 's not even a complete loss of the original or as it is a very long way of life
1,too bad i did n't get it,too often the film takes itself too seriously
1,it is an absolute mustsee for fans of the classic,it 's just a little bit of a shame
1,this show is so awful it 's hard to believe that this is a,this movie is so much more than just plain bad it is not
1,she 's the kind of person that makes her character,she 's the most beautiful and talented and most of the
1,surprisingly enough the film was a waste of time for me and i would n't even watch it,surprisingly enough the movie has some of the most memorable moments i 've seen in any film
1,from a story standpoint to the final outcome the ending,from the beginning the director was a bit confused
1,for some reason i found the movie to be boring but,for me this movie is a complete waste of time
1,if you do n't want to see the first one then you are not going to be disappointed,if they do n't get a chance to kill people in a way i would not want to kill
1,well if you want to see the movie i strongly,well this is the only time i watched it
1,this is one of those films i,this is a pretty lousy movie
1,now i'm just thinking of a great deal of fun in my opinion,now i do n't think that anyone who is so impressed with the plot
1,most of the actors were just plain awful except for the fact that the plot is n't a good one,most of the movie consists of a bunch of characters who are not even likable enough to save a bunch of
1,end spoilers spoilers it 's a little slow but there is so much to keep things interesting,end of the world where it all works out as a good film to watch it 's a
1,i do n't think this film was a total waste of time,i think this film should be a lot more fun to watch in
1,the film is not very good either,the only problem was the director 's decision
1,it 's all about a bunch of teenagers and the girl who is kidnapped but they,it 's a shame that the director decided that he would have had an oscar
1,the movie is a great deal of fun and i recommend that everyone,the story is a little weak but it 's a great movie
1,let me preface that this is one of my alltime favorite movies,let 's make it clear that the film is a bit too long
1,these two are n't very funny at all,these are the kind of people we usually associate
1,instead i got that awful combination of two characters a very boring plot,instead i was n't sure who it was supposed to be and i was
1,unfortunately for those who have not seen it,unfortunately the movie is a total mess
1,damn it 's just another movie that is not worth watching and it 's,damn i think it is a shame that this show was released theatrically
1,the only thing that was interesting was the scene where the,the first half hour of the picture is quite exciting
1,it seems like the director was making fun,it is also a very interesting film
1,this was n't a good film by any means but rather a waste of time,this is the story of a young man trying to cope with her own past and
1,i saw this on tv and was amazed by it,i would have loved to see more of the actors who
1,hurry up in a world where it takes a turn or two or two and you will be rewarded,hurry up the next day i 've watched this movie and it 's a total waste of time
1,but the plot is a joke,but that makes me think so
1,in the movie there really is n't much else to recommend about the movie,in a world where the hero was not only a human but also the fact
1,it is an interesting story but it is a movie of sorts of all,it 's a shame that a film is not made available on dvd or dvd
1,sam raimi is not even funny,sam is an excellent character and his
1,the film is a complete disaster,the acting is good enough but i
1,i do n't think i could have made a movie like this,i 've been trying to figure out the real killer for years and
1,albeit the movie 's ending is a bit too long,albeit as a thriller about a bunch of people the only
1,jane wyman and the two sisters in the series are the stars of the film and i think that they will,jane and beth have a relationship with each other and they 're not happy about how they can go together
1,what is that so much about it,what makes this film so unique is that
1,he is a very beautiful woman and the two main characters,he 's just not the right guy to get the girl to
1,special mention must be to make up for,special guest actors have a great voice
1,there are also some great moments of,there is some really good acting
1,now it 's a movie about a group of people trying to survive a deadly virus and,now i have to admit that it is one of the best of the ernest adaptations
1,when i was watching this film i was a bit skeptical of the movie and i do n't really see it coming to,when he 's in bed with his girlfriend he goes off with the woman and he kills the girl who killed her
1,proves to be the most important movie ever made,proves the movie 's only redeeming quality to the script
1,if the film had a good plot it could have been a,if you have n't watched this film i highly recommend it
1,the first part of the story concerns the young man who is trying to find,the film has some interesting points that make the film a little too slow
1,during the first hour of the movie the audience realizes how to get to the point,during the opening credits we see how they came back to the states and the scene in
1,sure i do understand the point but it 's not enough to make a good movie,sure it was not the worst film i 've ever seen but the worst of the three
1,after all these years the film is a bit long,after a few minutes i was n't sure what to expect
1,ann sheridan and john mctiernan are the best of this kind of movie the two stooges are excellent as the characters,ann sheridan is a very underrated actress who is in the movie for the rest of the movie but she does n't
1,whether the director was the writer or the director 's the director should have been shot in the head in,whether the us government is responsible for their or even better the president 's son and the government agent
1,though the film 's premise is not entirely believable it is a very good film,though there 's a lot of violence and violence the film is pretty entertaining but it
1,3 the movie does n't have any of,3 the main character is a stereotype
1,it is n't even as a movie or a comedy or a serious,it 's a good film and it is a great family film
1,my favorite character was the father,my favorite scene in the movie comes
1,i 've seen a lot of other films and i do have a few friends,i have seen a few episodes of the original series that are so bad that they
1,i have not seen the movie but it is a,i would have liked to see this film again
1,well it 's the worst movie ever,well the film was a bit of a
1,as a result of the incident the characters and story line and the characters come to life to be a complete and utter embarrassment,as far as i have seen the original is not a bad idea of the original it 's just a poor excuse to make something
1,this is an amazing documentary on the nature of the human spirit,this is a movie that you can watch over and over and over
1,this is a movie that is very entertaining and a must see movie for anyone who is,this was a really good movie and i think that it was a very enjoyable movie
1,i 've never read a book that is so bad,i have never seen such a beautiful and wonderful film in
1,this film was a waste of my time,this is one of those movies that i can
1,the story was so simple that i had to see it because it was n't funny,the movie also has a lot of plot holes and some really good actors but it does
1,certain people have commented on this film and the director,certain scenes in the movie were so incredibly funny
1,geraldine mcewan is a woman with a strong sense of humour and,geraldine mcewan is perfect as the woman with the right guidance
1,a lot of people are saying that this is a bad movie,a movie that should be seen and appreciated by the younger generation
1,whoopi goldberg plays the mother in a very bad movie,whoopi goldberg as a drunken girl who is n't the least
1,the film has some interesting elements of humour,the only real problem i have with this movie
1,but it is still an excellent film for its time,but the real thing was that i was n't impressed at
1,i think the movie is a bit slow and not very good,i would have liked to have seen this movie on the big screen
1,i have never seen such a terrible movie,i have n't laughed so hard since i 've
1,will smith and his two friends get,will smith is a real actor
1,i'm not sure why this is a film for a rainy afternoon,i'm a fan of movies and tv shows that i like but not
1,it is also the same story of the same name,it 's a real shame that they did n't get this
1,the story is so simple that i found it difficult to believe this was ever made,the story is about the adventures of a young girl who 's a child who is married
1,i do n't think this movie was intended to be a success,i think it 's just that the movie does n't do much for
1,while a lot of the other reviewers have commented on it i thought it was very very good,while the movie is very slow paced and the story is not very interesting the viewer is left wondering
1,the movie has a lot of good action scenes with the actors,the plot revolves around a widowed couple of kids who go to the
1,star trek v is a very entertaining film,star wars was also a major problem with me
1,while i was watching the movie with a bunch of people and i thought it was very well made i could n't help but love,while a few years later this film is not about as much fun as it was in the first one but it was not
1,i am a fan of the first two films and it 's the,i do n't understand why people are comparing this to the original
1,please stop it and watch it again,please avoid the film at all costs
1,i do n't know what it was but,i was hoping for a good laugh
1,my wife and i saw this film last weekend,my friends and i are all very interested in making
1,the film 's plot is a bit of a joke but it was,the plot is not bad and there are holes in the plot
1,however i have to say that it was very well done and had good actors but it seemed like a,however in fact he has a very good sense of humor and the movie 's ability is too dark
1,in this movie the movie is a complete waste of time and money,in the movie we learn that the world is not a great place to
1,high school is not the only one,high hopes of a better film than most
1,on the plus side it is a very well made movie which is n't a good one,on the other hand this show is an embarrassment to anyone who wants to be in the middle
1,some of it is a little bit too slow and,some of the characters are n't really that interesting
1,while watching it for the first time i did n't get the impression that it is not,while i have to admit i did n't like it the first time i did not have a
1,how can i say it is a comedy,how did i get into this movie
1,i do n't know if this film was supposed to be a comedy but it is still very,i do not think i can even get into this movie but it 's not that bad
1,the movie is about as entertaining as a,the film was shot in the seventies
1,the film is a complete disaster of a film,the first thing that i liked is that the acting
1,really it seems to be on the same,really it is a very funny film
1,i 've read the book the first time,i 've seen many of these films in my
1,the acting the plot the music and everything about this movie is so bad it 's almost bad,the film has an odd and somewhat hopeful look and feel as if there are no other movies that
1,every time i think of it i will be looking forward to this movie and i am,every time i watch it i can say that i love the movies that were made
1,sees the movie for the first time,sees a film in my life
1,the only saving grace is the fact that this one has no real life,the acting is so bad that there seems to be little of the commend
1,it has a good script but i do n't think it could make,it 's like a student 's movie but it really is n't
1,this film is an insult to the intelligence of all involved,this film could have been a better place if it was n't
1,alicia kudrow is excellent as the young and loving daughter,alicia silverstone is the best actress ever and she was a
1,there are some interesting things in the film,there were some good points in the film
1,there are also some great scenes of the movie,there is an extended amount of nudity and nudity that
1,of course the movie is not about a woman but it is very different,of course i do n't think i 've been able to find anything to be
1,the script is a lot more interesting to watch,the story is very simple but there are so few
1,her performance was pretty good and the movie was pretty,her mother is also the daughter of the family
1,following the plot is n't the same but the acting is great and the characters really do a great job,following her and her son 's life and their relationship with them and their relationships and their love for each other
1,the acting was ok the directing was horrible the direction was awful the costumes were cheap and even the,the film is also about how the two men were treated as the first two in the movie
1,carpenter 's first film was a masterpiece of the genre but the rest of the cast did a very good job of giving this film a boost,carpenter was a filmmaker with the gift to make a movie about two guys who were in the process of being killed by a serial killer
1,better to make it more easier to follow,better still the film is still watchable
1,but i was surprised to see that the movie has some good points,but the movie also has an interesting message about the way it deals with
1,enchanting and powerful film of a woman whose love and love is a love story and a very good one,enchanting to watch and even if it 's not that much of a stretch the film is a total bore
1,while it 's not as memorable as the original it certainly does n't work,while this is a good movie it is not as good as the book
1,the story is about a guy who,the plot is a little farfetched
1,a young and beautiful young boy is visited by a woman,a movie that i would like to have my hands
1,and then it 's all about the guy who has no problem with,and that is the only positive thing i can say about it
1,she 's the only one who knows that she is not as attractive as,she 's a woman in the film industry and she is a woman
1,it is the story of a man who loves himself,it was so bad and it made me laugh
1,i do n't know why it 's called it the only reason i have,i would n't have been surprised if i saw it in the theater
1,in the end i thought i had to go through the whole film,in the meantime he is given an assignment to take care of him and
1,my wife and i were in a movie theater with my friends in the middle of high school who were in love with their parents,my favorite character was a woman who was a bit too stupid to be the most likable character i 've seen in a while
1,she is so beautiful she is perfect,she is not a good character
1,anne heche and michael gambon give an excellent performance as the lovers of the film,anne hathaway does a very funny but understated performance as the woman who is n't quite
1,the movie was very good but that 's about it,the only thing i can say about this film is its
1,the acting is n't great but the story is solid,the script is a little too much to bear
1,the film was made in 1993 with its limited budget and the fact that it,the plot is pretty good but the movie does n't make sense at all
1,as far as the movie goes i think that it was,as far as i'm concerned this is a great movie
1,if you have never heard of it before then you should n't be surprised,if you are a fan of this sort of thing this is a must see
1,sure it 's not all that bad there 's nothing here that you ca,sure it was the most beautiful movie in the entire history of history
1,chapa 's portrayal of the film was also a bit too long,chapa is a great character actor who is not in it
1,christian slater 's character was the best one,christian bale and his two coworkers were all pretty
1,you will get to see the film in the theatre in the last 5 seconds,you can feel the pain and frustration of love with all of his friends
1,later the film begins in an entirely predictable,later i had to watch the film
1,otherwise this movie was just terrible,otherwise i have to admit i did
1,she is a young girl and she is very well suited for the murder of her husband,she is a woman who is the daughter in a world where people are in the world of
1,o 'donnell plays a character who does n't even have much personality,o 'donnell is an excellent actor but his portrayal of a hardened criminal
1,this was n't a good movie,this movie is a must for people
1,the film is a complete waste of time and money,the movie is about a bunch of young girls who get
1,like the rest of the movie there is little more than the typical clichs of all the characters and situations of the film are,like i said before i am sure the director and writer have done a good job of making the movie a little better
1,other than the fact that the movie was shot in the same way i was in the mood,other than that it 's a fun little movie that i will watch over and over again
1,presenting the real problems with the characters and their relationship,presenting a new york city with an old flame
1,and if you 're not a fan of the genre you 'll love this film,and there was a lot of people in here who are n't familiar to him
1,i 've always loved him but i really do not know why,i have to say that it was a complete waste of time
1,jan 's direction and acting as the villain is,jan 's mother is the only real person
1,now i do n't know why,now that i have seen this i
1,joe pesci is the perfect man to make this work,joe don 's character has a good time and it 's
1,after the first 15 minutes or so of the movie i was wondering why i did,after a few seconds you realize that the film might have been a good idea
1,this movie is a great example of what is wrong with the film,this movie has a lot of action and some scenes that were funny but
1,what was the point of making this film,what makes this movie a great movie is the
1,the story is about a group of young,the movie has no redeeming values whatsoever
1,but the film is also quite entertaining in places and i think,but that 's not all that is good in the movie
1,my advice skip this unless you are into the sort of thing that 's so bad you 'll,my wife was the first to see this movie at age 6 when i was a teenager
1,no one has a clue about it,no doubt that the director should 've had
1,see if there was ever a case,see this movie at least once
1,she 's also a pretty girl and a woman with a different attitude who is so bad as,she is the perfect choice to watch the movie and she makes it a bit more interesting
1,revenge of the sith is a film that i think is one of,revenge is one of those rare times and is very well done
1,the movie is a complete mess,the plot has potential but it 's
1,some of the other characters appear to be,some people do not think about it
1,now i know that 's my opinion,now that is what 's funny about it
1,old days of being a big fan of the genre i was surprised at the sheer lack of a,old west 's new age is a very interesting movie that does n't try to be too much
1,all of the actors are very convincing especially the one who is the most decorated,all in all i think it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,but the real problem with this movie is the acting,but that 's not enough to save the movie
1,little of the acting was good but the script was so bad it could n't even make sense in a theater,little britain has the same problems to do in the book which is a bit too long but in fact it is
1,the plot is a little too complicated and it 's hard for a child to get a grip on,the film has a great cast and it 's a great story of a group of young men
1,from the start to the end this movie is not worth renting,from there the movie goes to a completely different place where the film
1,what i found most intriguing is the ending,what is the purpose of having a child in
1,for those of you out there that love this movie,for me the movie has a lot to offer
1,the story is n't really that good,the film was very funny and had a
1,william shatner was also in it,william powell is one of my favourite
1,the acting and the script is terrible,the first is the music by george gershwin
1,i think it is a shame that this movie is n't available on dvd,i saw it on tv at a local theater and thought it was a great
1,it is a great movie but not the best,it 's the kind of film that makes you laugh
1,jake gyllenhaal does a great job in directing and his performance as the father 's brother is very good but he is very good,jake 's direction is not very high but the acting and the plot is excellent and the characters all do a very good job
1,the acting is very good and the direction is superb,the plot is so stupid that i was left wanting more
1,there 's a great deal of humor to this film as it tries to be humorous and ends up being a comedy,there 's no doubt the writer has to make a film that is n't so bad as to be an excuse to be
1,my wife and i were laughing at how bad it was,my favorite parts of this movie are the ones with the mother
1,everyone who has seen them in this movie will be very disappointed,everyone is entitled to a happy ending which i believe in the whole
1,i 've seen a few of the bad comments about this movie and it is probably the worst film i have ever seen in my life,i would like to see more films like this one but i can only hope i will find out that the movie was n't so much as
1,really it 's an awful movie i have,really it was n't a good film
1,then the next day i saw i had,then he meets and falls for him
1,i think that is the problem with this movie,i saw this at least a couple times and had
1,i was n't really expecting a lot of the plot but the movie is so good that it 's difficult to suspend disbelief at the sight of it,i 've seen this movie many times and i have to say i did n't like this movie because it seemed like a really good idea to be a
1,but it 's so much better and it 's still very entertaining at times,but the real story is about a young woman who is a child and her
1,with a cast of unknowns it 's a shame that the story is so predictable that they do,with a bit more work and a better script this film could have been a better movie
1,the first time i watched the movie was in a theater with the director,the only redeeming feature to this movie is the cinematography and the cinematography
1,later the film is a little too long and the story is a mess,later when i saw the movie the last mimzy came back and i knew i
1,and that is why the show is so great,and that 's all it 's good about
1,i have n't heard of this movie since i first saw it,i think this film is the best movie of all time
1,i do n't care about the people that do n't like this but they 're just plain stupid,i do n't think i have ever seen a movie that was worse than this but this one is
1,and the scene where a young man is trying to get the,and the whole cast of characters were so stupid and uninteresting
1,other than the fact that it 's not even a movie it is just bad,other times he has a great cast with this movie but he is a good actor
1,so it 's not a great movie and it 's not,so many people have been there to see that the show 's
1,has to be a little generous,has n't seen the original movie and
1,the film is n't about as bad,the film is a total failure
1,it 's a shame that the filmmakers decided to make a movie that the audience,it has to be one of the most underrated movie i have ever seen
1,and it does n't take long to make,and the ending is a bit abrupt
1,i saw the first episode and i thought it was great,i do agree with the other reviewer who said that the film
1,this was the first time we have seen that movie,this film is so awful that it 's actually funny
1,as a result the film is so bad it 's embarrassing,as for the plot i could have cared less about the characters
1,epitaph for the movie and i will definitely say the whole movie does a great job of explaining the problems between the actors the,epitaph to the film 's title is the fact that you 'll probably be bored by what you 're doing in this movie
1,this show was so funny and i,this film has a good cast
1,and i have to say the whole movie was shot in new zealand,and if you have never seen the film then this film is worth your
1,trying to get to the bottom line of the movie is that a bunch of,trying to save the life of a friend of the marquis and her boyfriend
1,it does not have the usual clichs of the genre,it is a very good film but not very well executed
1,this movie is just awful it does n't even make,this is not the case with the other films
1,question why did n't they make the point,question that i would n't have to watch this
1,maybe the film was made by a,maybe he 's just too old
1,and there was a scene in which the two guys have sex in the movie,and there is the fact that the plot is n't a good one because it has
1,i do not recommend that you watch this film,i do n't know why it 's so bad i
1,the acting is superb and there 's plenty of suspense,the story is very interesting and the acting and directing are
1,all that 's said is that you can tell what a great director he really is,all the actors and actresses involved are very good but they do n't have much
1,i 've never seen such crap like this ever,i have n't read the book i think
1,there are no more than zero characters who do n't really care,there 's also a bit of nudity in this movie too
1,however there were a lot of problems,however i was surprised that i had not
1,beautiful cinematography from the original film,beautiful to see him get a role
1,no matter how many times you 're going,no one should have had this movie
1,so the film starts off with a lot of promise but it 's so much fun,so many times you get to know the characters in the movie and you can actually see
1,i think that it 's the most overrated and,i have no idea what 's going on
1,the acting is terrible the story is bad,the movie has a lot of problems and i
1,i 've seen a lot of movies that,i saw it when it came out
1,i think that if you 're a fan of the original and enjoy seeing it you 'll like,i do n't remember the last time i saw the movie on television in the first place
1,ditto to her husband and the other tenants who have been killed by the devil 's advocate and a little bit of blood and the beast 's death,ditto for the fact that she is so good as an actor and it has been in her own career that she 's the perfect actress to play and
1,perhaps the movie is supposed to be a little more realistic,perhaps the director did n't want to go on for a long
1,the acting in the film is so bad it 's embarrassing,the first thing i thought i was watching was a little girl
1,if the viewer is not going to get to see the movie i,if you are into bad movies this is the one for you
1,while the story is not the best it 's the only time it is set in motion and it has a good cast,while the film is very well shot the acting is good especially considering the talent of the actors involved in this production
1,the only thing i liked about this movie is that the acting in this movie,the script is n't as bad as i expected and the acting was horrible
1,the only thing that really bothered me was the lack of any of,the only problem in the script was the script and the direction
1,the acting was good enough the acting is superb the directing is great and it is,the only thing that was funny to me was the way that this was done
1,and it 's all very real,and the acting is pretty good
1,and it is the worst movie i have,and that was when the movie ended
1,i'm a big fan of a good story line that has so many good twists and turns,i'm sure the director and director have done a great job but this film is so poorly made
1,in the case of the movie the movie is,in the end he does n't get it
1,finally it 's a good film to watch,finally there 's the fact that the director has
1,2 out of 10 stars for being the worst movie ever,2 the plot of two main character 's girlfriends are not really
1,he has done a lot of movies that have no redeeming quality but it 's hard to say,he has a great voice and he has a voice and voice that fits the role perfectly
1,the plot is so simple and so full of holes that it 's impossible to make a movie about,the first film is about a woman who is sent from prison to a mental institution to her mother
1,on the positive side the cinematography is excellent the music is beautiful,on the plus side there are some good points in the story and
1,i saw this in a theatre in the early 80 's,i do n't think i could write a review about it if
1,i would recommend seeing this movie for the good of it,i 've seen the first three episodes of the series and it
1,it 's not the worst movie i have ever seen but it is certainly worth the watch,it does however have a bit of a cult following and the characters are very well developed
1,alice is the only survivor who gets,alice is a very good movie
1,eventually we get the usual hollywood treatment,eventually the film is set up
1,she does n't even have a clue to him,she was also the only survivor of the film and
1,he 's a great actor and is a joy to watch,he was the real star of the show as well
1,the movie has no plot and no plot and it 's a pity the rest of the cast does n't seem like the script writer and crew of the original film,the first time the movie aired was released i could n't imagine how it was going to make a difference and to see what was being shown to be the last mimzy
1,i think the film is a good example of the sort and,i was hoping that the movie would be released on dvd
1,the plot is a bit confusing but,the plot is pretty much nonexistent
1,then the plot develops a little too thin for the audience and it becomes a bit too long,then it 's a bit of a spoof of the classic columbo movie but it 's still an enjoyable
1,this is the type of film that is so bad it 's funny,this is not only a film it is a very good film
1,alas i do n't remember the name of the title of this film as,alas the movie 's success was not as good as the other two
1,the film is very good in a way that is the first to be appreciated by many,the story was a bit confusing and the story line had some holes in it but it seemed
1,lucky man is a movie that is not,lucky man is a very good film
1,having a conversation with a man who has been a man to his son 's life is not even close,having seen it on a tv screen i could not help but laugh at the jokes of the movie
1,but the best thing about this film is the music which was so much more than,but i think the director was a bit prejudiced when they were not making it
1,walker does n't want to be a,walker is not a bad guy
1,they 're all so bad that they could n't even make a better,they have no choice but to show their talents of this show
1,more of an ensemble film with the usual exception of a,more than that i think it 's a good movie
1,young men are not the same but still they,young people with a brain in their head
1,however it is n't a great movie to me,however the movie does n't make much sense
1,there is n't a single person 's performance in this movie,there is some good stuff in this movie and it 's not
1,burns and matthau 's characters are very believable and there are many other memorable characters,burns is a good actress and this has to be the worst movie ever
1,there 's a few interesting scenes of the periphery of the story of the two,there are many good moments of humor and the acting by the entire cast
1,there was nothing else to watch and this is the most important aspect of the movie,there 's a lot of violence to be found in the film that is the reason why
1,ball has the most annoying character in this movie but he 's a great actor and a good actor in my,ball 's is the best way to describe this one as it has a great plot and a great plot
1,for those who are not familiar with the genre,for me it 's a pretty good story
1,in a nutshell the film is a little slow and boring for,in fact it 's the only thing that makes it watchable
1,even the soundtrack sounds more like a high score,even with all the faults of the story it is
1,it 's a shame that the movie was n't even nominated for the award nominated,it 's a very interesting idea but not enough for you to get involved
1,still it seems that the movie is about to be so good that the movie is not as bad as the rest,still i do n't want to go on the other that the unguarded hour of the film was not a total waste of
1,guests who are in the film are either very good or,guests who have to deal with the loss of war
1,hope lange 's character was more developed than the one that had been done before,hope davis is a fine actress as a woman who loves her life as a woman
1,the film is a complete failure,the only good point of this film
1,its so bad it 's almost like a parody on tv,its a very funny movie with all sorts of laughs
1,i was a fan of the original and i have seen this movie several times and have always regretted it,i do n't know if it would have been a good film to make but it did have a lot of
1,i think they were all good actors and a lot of them,i think you can get a kick out of this movie
1,now i'm just a sucker of the movie,now i know i was so stupid
1,unfortunately this is the most pointless scene i 've,unfortunately this is n't really a good idea
1,gets it right now if you are a fan of the genre and are a,gets a job in the movie that it would n't be a great thing
1,the movie has some funny moments though it is just a bit cheesy,the plot has no depth whatsoever or anything but it does have a bit
1,movies like that are not even the ones that come in the house of the dead,movies are not as good and this one is n't as good as the first
1,he does it in the first half and it 's the same old,he had the ability to make a film that was good enough
1,the movie is a total failure as to how it is in its entirety but the film itself is very good,the first half of the film focuses on the story of the lives of a young man who is a loner in
1,new york city was a great movie with great songs and songs and great choreography,new york is a film about a group of people who are trying to get married
1,it 's a shame that the only movie that i would recommend this movie is that it is not,it was the first of the three films in which the two leading actors were in the movie
1,technically i would like to say that this show is not the worst show ever,technically the story of the movie is very weak and the plot is weak the acting
1,there are two reasons why i love this movie,there is also a bit of suspense and gore and
1,in fact if you do n't have a clue that it 's not,in fact the film 's title was n't really a complete copout
1,filmed in a very tight manner the acting is pretty good but,filmed entirely on location in a remote landscape in los angeles
1,the script is so weak that you wonder why they bothered to do this,the film was made up of a typical story of an older woman who was
1,we all know it 's not the same,we are supposed to sympathize with them
1,and then they go to the party,and the fact that it was a big
1,it 's a shame he did n't have a bigger budget but i hope he will soon find the,it does n't really matter because they were n't going to be too hard to be a movie
1,it 's like they were trying desperately to make a film that they were trying to make fun,it is a film about the evils that the people who have lived in the united states
1,that 's how i got to know this was,that was the only reason for this film
1,that 's why i have n't watched the first one,that 's why this film was n't so popular in the
1,even if it 's not enough to make a good movie it 's definitely not a movie to watch,even when the movie is about a man who is in prison he is trying to solve what happened to
1,how did i have to watch this,how about a woman that is the killer
1,bert is a good actor but his character is too bland for the material,bert 's wife is a man in love with his wife and son of the
1,he is a very nice guy who does a lot of good things for the kids,he had a great deal of time in the movie and he was a very talented actor
1,if you have n't seen it then do not,if you are a fan of the series you 'll
1,the first is the fact that it seems to me to,the only redeeming feature of this movie was the acting
1,melanie griffith 's performance was also pretty good and she was pretty good in this and the,melanie shue was a wonderful woman and her performance was so bad she was almost perfect
1,however it seems that the writers decided they had done something more interesting with a budget,however it was a great movie if it was so great and i do n't know where
1,the movie is not very bad but it 's not the worst,the only thing that was missing was the music score the film was
1,i think that this film had some,i was n't expecting anything more
1,it was so bad you could almost hear,it 's an excellent piece of work
1,i have never heard of this film,i do n't want to spoil the ending
1,the film is an interesting story and one that should have been,the script is a very interesting one and is well acted
1,the movie is a mess of a series of scenes,the story line was a little weak but it was the
1,i saw a couple of movies about them on a friday night,i was expecting a good thriller and i really enjoyed this movie too
1,osama 's direction is superb but the story,osama is not one of my favorites
1,he is a very talented director,he has a lot of fun in
1,the acting is very bad and there are some really,the film starts off with a very nice twist
1,but it 's a bit of a shame that the rest of the film is n't as dull,but this show does n't have enough of the same problems to make it even remotely enjoyable
1,if it had been made by an outsider it would have worked better if there was a better script,if you like the original series you might want some enjoyment of this movie but you ca n't help but
1,in the end it is a very moving film,in fact i think the only reason i gave this
1,the only thing that makes the movie is the acting and,the first part of this film is just plain stupid
1,the film was n't bad at all and it is n't the least bit interesting,the movie is not as good as its predecessor but that is a shame i never
1,during a nightly scene the film abandons the audience to see the light as the story unfolds,during that time i felt the need to go see this film in my lifetime as a child
1,let 's get into it the story is a bit thin,let me tell you that i am a big fan of the
1,these are the only things i can think of in my childhood,these are the two things i did n't like as it is just
1,the movie is so bad it 's funny,the plot is a bit confusing and there 's
1,they do n't have enough money to get to the bank,they do n't get to the end of the movie but it
1,if you have not seen this movie do so,if you are a fan of the book and you
1,this is the first film i have ever seen,this one really is n't worth the price of admission
1,we have to be careful of the movie and not only the film but also the fact,we see the same old old man walking around in the snow talking on his own
1,one wonders what the filmmakers wanted to say,one thing i did n't like was the fact
1,a very interesting movie with a nice twist ending,a few of his films are pretty good but it
1,and it 's a shame that i never,and i think they 're all good
1,there is an odd twist where the,there is no reason for that
1,i think this movie is one of the worst of the year and a very good one for the entire,i saw it when i was 12 and it is still an excellent movie and one i love it
1,but it was the first movie that i could n't remember when i,but it is the only time that i will see it again
1,the acting and the script was awful,the film has the same basic premise and
1,from the very beginning i was convinced that the actors were actually making the film,from the very beginning i thought that it would be a little slow but it was
1,there was a scene that was a joke,there are many good things about this movie
1,would the writers and producers have a more interesting view of,would this been the only redeeming feature in the movie
1,and it 's the story of the man who 's been kidnapped and abused,and the acting is n't that bad but that 's not all that makes the
1,chris sarandon is the most convincing actor,chris farley is the only one who can
1,the film was so boring and the ending made my jaw bleed,the only reason i watched this is because they made an awful choice
1,if it were n't for the fact that the story was n't a bit predictable the acting was very good,if you 're looking for a movie that does n't need to be good enough to watch you do n't' know
1,the film opens with the two young women who get married to the men and the woman who has been married to her daughter in an earlier age in,the movie 's biggest problem is that it is not a good movie to me at the time and the end result is just a waste of time
1,1 it is so bad that it is actually,1 out of 10 stars for the movie
1,the script is a mess but the film has a lot of fun,the movie is n't bad the acting is horrible the story is bad the
1,god 's the girl who plays jesus 's friend,god bless me if there is any chance
1,songs are not the only one to listen to the music is not the worst i can ever hear,songs are a little repetitive but the music adds to the mood the film makes the overall feel so good
1,the first time i saw this movie,the acting was horrible as well
1,the film 's plot is a mishmash of characters who are not even likable,the script by david o 'donnell is very funny and the characters are very well
1,new york city is a perfect place to start and end,new york city is the perfect show and the show is just
1,it 's a very simple story about two people who are,it 's a pity that this movie was released theatrically
1,at one point the camera shakes a few seconds into the film,at a certain point in the film the story is just told from
1,the story is so stupid and full of holes that it 's unbelievable,the film is about a young woman named anna who gets married to her
1,i think that the acting is good and the actors are excellent,i saw that this film is a remake of the original classic
1,however the acting is horrible and the script,however it 's a very poor movie
1,from a purely routine script by the director and the direction of the first film it is a great story,from the very beginning of the movie the story is not as good as it was and it seemed the movie
1,a few of the scenes were just a,a great cast and a great script
1,the film is a complete mess,the movie is n't a good movie
1,some of the scenes in the film are very funny as well,some of the jokes are so lame it hurts me as to how
1,frankly i'm not sure if the movie is worth watching the first half,frankly it 's a shame because the whole movie is so bad that it
1,i was surprised to see it,i do n't know who wrote the
1,at first i was n't sure why this was n't a complete waste of time,at first you ca n't help but root for the characters to watch this show
1,there is no point that the movie has to,there were some great moments in the movie
1,stokes 's movie has a very interesting story and a good plot with the requisite amount,stokes has the ability to make it clear that the movie is set in ireland
1,only the last half is n't so good,only the movie is a complete failure
1,2 out of 10 because it 's,2 the ending is a joke
1,jack black is a genius but he 's a good comedic actor and he 's just a,jack lemmon as a police officer who is a cop with an interest in a crime
1,i am sure it was made for tv,i do not believe that any other actress could
1,i think i would like to see a more talented actress in the film,i do n't know what the director was thinking when he wrote this
1,it was an insult to the intelligence of cinema and this is one of,it 's a shame that they did n't make any sense at all
1,now that 's about the only thing that 's good about this movie the acting was good but the,now i know i have been a fan of a horror movie since it was made in 1988
1,man was it really a good movie,man the man is a good one and
1,disappointed i was not sure who would like this movie,disappointed with it it 's a little bit too predictable too
1,on the whole it was pretty well done,on the way out of the car they run
1,two of the most talented films of the last century are the best,two of the men and the female prisoners are in a motel with the
1,well worth the wait and the movie is,well this is a pretty good film
1,the first half is pretty good and it 's a great movie,the only thing that kept me watching was how they were able to
1,a great film with a great deal of humor,a good movie to me and you are the ones
1,mickey rourke and the rest of the cast are,mickey rourke plays the lead in the movie
1,i was expecting a movie that had a plot and a good cast,i am not a huge fan of the movie as well but the plot
1,you can do better than this,you 'll know what to expect
1,it 's not even that great,it was n't really a movie that
1,in the end this could n't even make a sequel,in the end it 's not the best thing about it
1,the plot is very good and i think that the actors are pretty good and the,the acting is terrible but the story is n't as bad as it should be
1,the film is set in a time where the characters are all the same characters in the movie,the only reason that the movie was so good was because the director wanted to make this film
1,i have n't seen this movie yet and,i was so disappointed by the movie
1,i 've never seen such a beautiful movie,i 've heard a lot about this movie and
1,back then the story is about the same old man and the girl and the girl,back on that day we are treated to a new world war ii film where it 's
1,the acting the script and the music was very good,the acting is very good especially the lead actor who plays
1,i saw this film in the theatre,i was n't expecting anything from the film
1,bad acting bad script and even worse acting,bad acting bad script bad direction bad music a
1,i was hoping for more and more of the plot line of the story and the story,i think the movie 's plot is a little thin and the story line is pretty lame
1,the story of the movie is a bit too predictable and it,the first time i saw it i was in the audience
1,unless you do n't think that this will be a good film to you and a lot of your friends you 're not a prude,unless you have seen this movie and you know i will be a bit more interested in the plot i 'd rather see the film in
1,all in all this movie is n't as bad as i expected,all in all a great show and a good family movie
1,it does n't even come close to being funny,it 's a real shame because i 've seen better
1,unlike this one the film is not a comedy it is a drama about,unlike the previous film he 's an american who is not a hero
1,this was the best of the three serials,this movie could not have been better
1,he does his best to make sure to,he is the one who loves him
1,while the acting is good i have seen better acting,while the movie is a masterpiece it was also a great
1,i 've seen a couple of movies but this one is the worst,i have n't been a fan since i saw the movie but was not
1,and the ending is a joke,and the story line is so weak
1,it 's a very good movie and it 's one of those rare works that will always be remembered for its rightful moments,it is one of those rare films which has its moments and is a bit over the top but it 's a good movie
1,set in a small town in england where the world is divided into a beautiful world of war that is n't necessarily an ordinary,set in the future and the new orleans city is a beautiful film and the film is a bit of fun to watch
1,being a fan of movies such as this one i,being the biggest star ever i have to say
1,i 've seen a number of films that are far superior to the ones that have come to mind and that,i think the film is not a comedy but a great movie for people who love a good horror flick
1,if the movie had n't made it to the big screen it would have been,if you like a good movie you can find some good acting in it
1,what i do know is that it,what was the purpose of this
1,that 's a little too much,that 's how you 're supposed to
1,i am not sure if they were trying to make a movie out of it but i just found it boring,i would say it is a good film with great production values but also good enough to give it a 2 out
1,the film is a real treat in every way possible,the only good part of this film is that it is
1,however this film is very entertaining and very funny,however i do n't want to spoil any of what
1,spoilers ahead of the film is about a woman who 's been married for her life and,spoilers for that scene i did n't really know what this was supposed to be about
1,the first time i saw him is when i was a little bit scared,the film 's plot has been told and done in a straightforward manner
1,it is the best show i have,it has some good action sequences
1,this movie is a must see,this movie has the best actors you
1,matthew lillard is a great actor and i have seen some of,matthew lillard plays an excellent character actor in the lead character
1,we get to see the first one and the second is one of the,we see a man walking on a train in the middle of nowhere
1,they have been living a life of the lives of the people who are living in their lives,they are so funny that you have to wonder whether it should take any more serious or serious
1,the first movie was a complete mess with the exception of,the movie is a complete mess from start to finish
1,technically this movie does have many problems but,technically the story is a little convoluted
1,solondz 's direction is not too bad the acting is terrible,solondz was a master of the art of art in this film
1,but the movie is a good one for the whole family,but i was n't too fond of seeing this movie as it
1,all the while they are all good,all in all this is a great film
1,although the story is not very good the acting was terrible the plot is stupid and the acting just,although this movie is not perfect and not at all funny it was not a very good one
1,best of all the movie is about the man who has an affair with,best of all is the fact that it 's a very bad movie
1,the acting is pretty bad and the script is not even bad,the story is not that bad and the plot is n't very good
1,i do n't see how many people who have reviewed this,i do not remember much of what this movie was
1,burt lancaster is the perfect choice for this role,burt reynolds plays a good cop with a very bad
1,we 're all so happy that we can see the whole film and feel like that is a joke,we are not told that it is n't a good one and that it 's a bit too long
1,alain tucci is a fine actor and his acting is superb,alain delon plays a man who works on a mission for his
1,all in all an excellent movie,all that happens to them is how
1,some of the scenes where they are talking,some of us have commented on that
1,i think this movie is one of the best and,i was really looking forward to seeing this movie
1,a good idea for this movie,a good film is a very entertaining
1,it 's not as good as the first,it was a bit like a tv movie and
1,but it 's a good idea that,but i was n't really disappointed
1,all the characters are likable and the story is a real treat,all of these actors are a real plus for the film
1,i saw this movie in my childhood and i loved it,i think i would rather like it than the other two
1,but the movie is just plain boring,but the movie just does n't have any
1,so the movie gets a little more interesting with its characters in the plot and,so if you are looking for some good action movie this is for you
1,tight to the core and the story and the actors are all good,tight and the only way to make a good horror movie is to get
1,overall this is a very bad movie,overall it 's a great movie that is
1,i think the reason it made the point to be the first episode in season,i am amazed how many of the people on here have mentioned this film
1,and the fact that she 's a lesbian,and the ending was a little confusing
1,ok so i guess you 're going to like,ok so i was really shocked by it
1,benson is the only actor in the cast which is so impressive that i could n't help but,benson plays the role of a rich and troubled husband and is very likable to the viewer
1,the plot is so predictable and predictable that i ca n't believe that it was actually made,the acting is so good it hurts to see how much of the dialog is delivered by the
1,please do not waste your time on this garbage,please note the film 's lack of budget
1,worst of all it does not even try to be,worst of all it is the worst movie ever
1,i have n't been in a very high school for a long time,i do n't know if the movie is going to be good because it
1,some of the scenes are just plain bad,some of the other comments here seem to disagree
1,ryan gosling is good but is the only one who,ryan 's character was a bit of a stretch
1,the acting is very good but i really liked this movie,the story revolves around one of his friends who is a bit
1,i would have given this a zero star,i was a little confused when this show aired
1,i was hoping this film would have,i have not seen this one
1,gone to heaven and you have the ingredients of this film,gone is the film that is not the most important film ever
1,the acting is horrible the plot is bad and the direction is poor,the acting was horrible and it seemed a little bit like a play in
1,i think this is a good movie for anyone who has a heart or,i have n't seen the original so i wo n't go into it
1,as a fan of a classic film fan this film has to be one,as an added bonus for this film the film was a total failure
1,when i saw the trailer it was the same,when the film finally gets to the finish of the
1,or maybe i should have listened to the dvd cover,or maybe they should have gotten the right idea
1,scream is a movie that 's a good thing,scream is n't funny and not a great action movie
1,but if you like this movie you 'll like this movie,but that 's all i do n't know because i am not
1,another thing this movie is a very boring and predictable movie that is not worth your time,another thing i did n't like was the fact that they did not have a chance to make
1,they should have made a better movie but they do n't do,they are not afraid to show us a single person in the movie
1,this film has the best of it,this is a very good film
1,the plot is a bit thin but it is also a movie about two,the plot is so convoluted that you 'll find yourself rooting for it
1,acting was horrible the acting was n't bad the acting was terrible the directing was,acting is ok but this is one that i do n't really care about
1,they are the most beautiful of all time,they are just not funny at all
1,this film is a must to watch,this movie does have its faults
1,the plot is n't very bad either,the plot is simple but not a good
1,the story is so simple that i,the story itself is pretty basic
1,the acting was pretty wooden and the story is pretty bad,the first film was pretty cool but the rest of the film
1,you will have to wait till a few of your buddies to watch this film and you wo n't regret it,you 'll get some enjoyment from the film and the movie is just about as bad as you have ever heard
1,this is one of the best movies,this movie is a real stinker
1,besides a few moments of violence in the first half of the film the two,besides a few moments in the movie it was still a very nice movie
1,we do n't see him as the first person in the film and he 's a,we do n't get the feeling that the characters are too real for the movie
1,often the plot is so contrived and so lame it 's almost embarrassing to,often it has an impact but it 's just not very good either
1,another reason is that the movie is so bad that the only,another thing i can say about this film is the cinematography
1,also there are a couple of funny scenes,also the scene in the bar where they 're
1,everything about this movie is perfect,everything that was so good was that
1,perhaps i am just not sure what it was all,perhaps a bit too slow for its own good
1,grand canyon is one of the best movies that i have ever seen the actors are superb,grand hotel is one of those films that i have to watch over and over again
1,this movie has been made in my memory,this film is about the only thing you will
1,joseph cotten plays a tough guy who does n't want to leave his home to get,joseph cotten as the villain has to be one of the best in his role
1,i was a fan of the show,i have seen it several times
1,there is nothing here that 's a bad thing,there was nothing in the movie that made any difference
1,we 're not sure what it is all about and it 's all the,we know it 's going to end but that is n't the point
1,sinatra is also in love with his wife who has become the most decorated of her life,sinatra as the main character who has to deal with is not a good character he 's a
1,this movie is a complete waste of time,this movie is the best of the series and
1,this movie is the first of three,this movie is a must see
1,in fact there were two things that could have used the movie,in this episode the two main characters are the most important and most
1,this is one of those films which will never be repeated in the,this movie has the look and feel of a high school play
1,the acting was ok and it 's a good job for a low budget movie,the movie 's plot is pretty simple but it 's a little bit too long
1,i 've heard the title song sung by a friend of a,i think it is one of the best i 've seen
1,not that it does not make sense,not to mention the acting in the film
1,either you need to get to see this,either way it was a fun ride
1,the first one was very well written and directed by steven jarmusch who,the movie is a mess of a movie with a capital d
1,there 's an element to the movie,there 's a scene where a young man
1,not much of a good story either,not that i do n't get any spoilers
1,another reviewer commented that this is not a movie about a man who is a woman,another example of this is that the director was trying to make a statement about the world
1,one of the best movies i have ever seen i was,one thing i liked most the other was the acting
1,the story is simple and is not a comedy it is about a man who lives with his wife and is trying to live the dream life of him,the movie is about the same guy as the old guy but it 's also the only reason for him to be a great actor but he 's still the
1,the first half of this movie is so bad it 's good,the acting is n't too bad but the story was very good and
1,do n't get me wrong i'm a huge football,do not waste your time with this one
1,perhaps the movie could have been much better if this movie had been made,perhaps he should n't be fooled to the point of the movie that he has
1,the story is so bad that it 's difficult to understand it 's a very bad film,the movie 's premise is that the director 's daughter had a mental disorder that he was not
1,there were some scenes that were just plain dumb,there are some good moments in this episode but this
1,this was a really great movie,this is a movie about the evils
1,however i did not see a whole lot of action at first sight,however i was impressed by the fact that the director did n't even bother
1,but that 's a minor problem,but this one is not for everyone
1,this is an excellent film that is not only about the,this is one of the worst movies i 've seen
1,the only reason i wanted to watch this show is because it 's a very bad movie,the film was a lot of fun and had some great scenes that make it even more enjoyable
1,what i saw was that a lot of movies were made with an r rating,what makes this show great is the way in which the characters show up
1,yes the film was shot in the seventies,yes the ending is n't as good but the
1,the acting is horrible the characters are ridiculous and the story just is n't there,the only reason this has been a success is due to the fact that the script
1,this was the only movie of this caliber of my,this film is the worst movie ive ever seen
1,well that 's what i thought,well i was n't expecting to see
1,it has the usual clichs and a few moments in the middle,it 's a shame that the film is n't in the same category
1,it would have been a lot better if there,it 's just so bad it 's funny
1,have they ever been in town for,have they ever seen such films
1,i was so disgusted by the end of the movie and the end of it,i 've never had a better film with such a bad review than i thought this
1,people in the cast were all pretty good with the script in the background,people of the age are not corrupted by the fact that they can only act
1,the acting is superb the cinematography is,the movie is a little slow
1,in a nutshell this would have been a little better,in the meantime i was looking forward to seeing this movie
1,i think that 's a good thing because the film does n't have anything to say,i have to say i love the film and think i will be a sucker for that
1,they were not so great in a film they were n't funny,they all get the same clothes and clothes of the same guys
1,famed and a lot more than i can do in the film,famed producer george ford does a masterful job of bringing it into a
1,you know you are in for a rough treat when a man with a brain and a,you can see the similarities between the two main characters as well as the other ones
1,i have n't seen anything that is so bad that i ca n't believe the good reviews,i saw this movie yesterday and i must say it has a certain amount of potential
1,actually this is the first time i have seen a movie i saw that had,actually it 's a very good movie and the story line is very solid
1,the film has a very very long cast and the story is a bit confusing and the plot is just plain,the story is a little slow but i liked the characters so much that it became interesting to watch them
1,i 've seen worse acting in elementary school plays with the camera in a lot,i think that the movie is a masterpiece for the eyes of its stars
1,but i ca n't remember the name of the whole movie,but the movie is just a bunch of boring boring boring boring
1,it 's like the movie makers were trying to,it 's a good thing to see it
1,i have never seen such a great film in my life,i 've seen this movie countless times and i think it is
1,they are a little more interesting than the,they were so much more than this
1,the film is a good movie for a rainy day and,the movie also had some very funny moments in it
1,totally unrealistic and a waste of time and money,totally devoid of any kind of substance it is n't
1,mostly the movie was made in color so i could n't believe it and even that is all,mostly it takes itself too seriously with no plot and the acting is n't that bad either
1,satyricon is a very entertaining film,satyricon was n't the worst movie i
1,this is not to say it was bad but it was just horrible,this is a great movie and should have been nominated for best picture and
1,a film that is n't even funny and not very good,a movie about a man who is not in control of the
1,how does he get his car,how the hell could a man like
1,some scenes where the film is filmed in the middle of a crowded street and the camera linger on the,some of the dialogue is just a bit contrived but the story line does n't make a coherent plot
1,after watching this i felt the film is a bit more,after seeing this movie i thought i 'd say wow
1,first off i must confess i had to watch it because it looked like the actors were going to be,first off the acting is n't bad at all and i ca n't say anything good about this movie
1,the only problem with this film is that it is a bit of an embarrassment to a story and the,the story is a little confusing at best and at some points it is n't funny or even amusing
1,breast and a couple of others have a lot of,breast is the worst film i 've ever seen
1,try and make this movie seem to be like,try to make it a little more serious
1,using this as a backdrop for the film is not the same as the first one,using it 's a great deal of talent in the first half hour of the film it
1,most of the actors have done the job,most people have n't seen the movie
1,as a matter of fact i ca n't say enough about it but,as a longtime warrior fan i have a problem with the film
1,one of the worst movies ever made,one of the most interesting films in the
1,even the soundtrack and the score are very good in the title,even the title sequence was very misleading and the ending was too abrupt
1,not only did we not see the world but we also,not only that but it 's also pretty damn bad
1,the plot is a little weak but the characters are likable,the story is so predictable and so stupid that it 's hard
1,i was hoping this would have been a good film if,i saw this as a child and i loved it
1,he has a knack for physical humor but this,he 's a real star of the show
1,i do n't understand why people would rate this movie as one that is only the best part of,i do n't know what it is about and it 's a little jarring but it does n't
1,spoiler ahead it was n't a good movie,spoiler ahead the film is a bit long
1,as a result the film is quite good but not as bad as,as a result of that it is not the greatest movie ever
1,they 're the same people who have no idea,they do not make it like this movie
1,the acting is good the cinematography is good the,the movie is n't even a good movie
1,if you 're looking for a good horror movie watch a few good movies like that,if the story had a bit of the same thing you 'd find the movie a little
1,the movie was shot with a handheld camera which was so grainy and so distracting,the story is so predictable and full of coincidences i wonder where all the good things
1,the first thing that struck me was that i could n't believe that there was a character in this movie,the film also has some very funny moments but the overall tone of the show is very funny too
1,it 's a very funny movie and the characters are likable but the story line and,it has been said for years that he had a good time in this movie
1,the movie is not for everyone,the movie starts as an excuse to
1,the movie also has the same plot a few times a week and a couple of the characters are,the story is a bit too long and too much melodrama too much time wasted on the ending
1,other than that the movie is a complete mess,other than the obvious fact that this is a good
1,recognizing the film 's success and the most important,recognizing it is a film of a movie
1,all in all this film is very good,all of these actors have been on their own
1,why do i give it a 7,why did n't he kill his girlfriend
1,some of the scenes were very funny but the movie is not as funny as the first one,some have complained that this movie is a little slow but the film is not a bad film at
1,the story of the film is very simple and very very interesting,the movie is about two people trying to be the same person but
1,long time dead is one of my favorites,long enough to get a little over the top
1,this movie is just so awful,this is the only movie i saw
1,he does not have to take the time to get into,he is an excellent actor who is a fine actor
1,i think this movie is one of the best,i was expecting a lot from the movie
1,chiba plays the character of a hitman who is determined to kill himself and his family,chiba gives an excellent performance as the young man who befriends the beautiful barbara hershey who plays
1,the movie was so horrible that they could not have had it been a lot better,the plot is very simple and it is a story that is so realistic that you ca
1,blaine is a fine actor but his performance is so good that,blaine is an excellent actor and the supporting cast are great
1,as i said before the film is a bit slow and drags in a bit too long to,as far as the film goes there is still some very good stuff in the entire movie
1,it is a pity that they did n't give up the chance to develop their character,it is the worst of it 's low budget but that is not what this movie is
1,i have never seen such bad actors in their life as,i have no clue what this film was all about
1,all the other movies are great,all these people seem to have a
1,for all of the above the film is just as bad and worse as the book which is not,for the first half hour it is a very slow paced story that is not really worth seeing
1,i have seen the film dozens of times and i have never been tired of watching it,i have never seen the film version of a classic film nor the fact that this film is
1,if you have to watch the dvd version of the story to understand the story of,if you want to watch a film that is n't so much fun to watch
1,a few years ago it was made for the big,a very enjoyable movie but not a good thing
1,also the acting was good and i was surprised that the director had never,also it does n't make the slightest bit believable for me to watch
1,it is not only a movie of the week but also a lot of the film 's themes of love and love,it is a very good movie and i hope that the director will get a chance to release it on dvd
1,i 've seen this movie twice and i have to say i loved it,i saw a few movies about the movie and i was impressed and disappointed i
1,look like it was shot in the middle of an abandoned building and the whole thing looks like,look at the scene where the woman is talking about the death and the woman she loves
1,instead it is a movie that is not even close to being the best of the series,instead of a bad guy we are given one of the most horrible examples of his career
1,so the movie is just as bad,so many of them are very bad but
1,but then again it 's all pretty funny but that 's about it,but the story is about a group of kids who are sent to prison
1,i was a bit surprised to find a few good actors here but i really liked the movie,i was surprised to learn that the film was shot in color and it looks like a bunch of
1,nanon is a beautiful woman who is a very strong character,nanon and the stranger are the best in this movie
1,sissy 's performance does the job and the,sissy spacek is excellent as the woman
1,oshii is a genius to behold and is a fine filmmaker in this field,oshii is a genius but this film is a total waste of time
1,i have to say it was a great idea,i have seen it several times since and i still
1,a great movie and a mustsee for all,a good example is how the film is shot
1,babbage was the one that made it,babbage is the leader for the cia to
1,you know it 's about time you,you know what 's going on
1,the only real flaw is the fact that there is no suspense whatsoever,the movie is n't as bad as some of the others but the story
1,but if you like the first film you will love this,but this is a movie that will make you wish you had
1,so much of the action is spent,so the film is a total waste of
1,he is not as good as in,he has the right to die
1,veiled to the point of being a complete waste of time,veiled to the point of exhaustion that is n't necessarily the case
1,later on we get to see a woman who looks like she 's just wandered around in a forest,later the film is full of bad acting and the only good part of this movie is that it is
1,this is not a good film but it has a few good,this movie should have been a little too far too long
1,she is an actress who is always in love,she is also one of my favorite actresses
1,launched from the same year for eight years i have to say that i was a little skeptical to see it,launched this movie by a friend of mine a fan of the original and i have to say the title song is
1,sorry i am so bored with my assessment of what i 've seen in,sorry i ca n't even remember that one thing is missing the point
1,phantasm iv is another great film that,phantasm is a very entertaining film
1,while a lot of the scenes involve a few characters the movie is not as funny as it is in the original,while a little slow paced and very violent at times the pacing is slow and the film suffers from a few moments of
1,a very interesting and interesting story of a man who is born in a,a few things are done differently here and the film becomes increasingly predictable
1,its not as good as the first film but it 's,its a film of a certain kind of it is
1,the acting is superb and the story is good,the story is not a typical movie like that one
1,for the first time in the series there is an explanation to the whole,for the most part the acting is terrible and the script is horrible
1,there is nothing that makes a good movie and,there were several great parts in this film
1,her character is n't even likable and i did n't think she was a good actress,her performance is a bit stilted but it 's hard for me to imagine her acting skills
1,i have never seen the movie but it has to be said that this show is one of,i was very impressed with the movie but in the end the movie was just too boring
1,funny moments are when you see this movie you can really tell that,funny how the story develops a little bit more to its predecessor
1,compare it to any other movie,compare this to the other films
1,the film starts out with a man trying to save his life but the way he gets back is the story of two men who fall in love,the only good thing about this film was the scenery and costumes that were so well made they were n't just used to convey the film 's quality
1,if you are a fan of the series watch this episode and you will be hooked,if you 're a diehard fan of the genre of horror movies then you might be right
1,what is more a great piece of art,what a waste of time and time
1,but the film is a great example of how a movie can go wrong,but the real star of the film is that it is a complete departure from
1,if you are looking for a fun horror movie do n't bother with this,if you want a movie like the first one you 'll be disappointed
1,there 's no plot to this film either,there is no real reason to see this movie
1,i do n't think that this film is anything but a masterpiece,i saw the film on the cover but was n't prepared to let
1,the story is about a young man who is visited with his mother and two daughters who are searching for their son,the film does boast a few good moments in which the viewer is privy to the scene where the three main characters are
1,it 's a very good movie but the movie just does n't have enough good things,it 's not the first movie to be good but it is definitely worth watching
1,a few things happened to me that i would never watch again,a good deal of fun but it 's just so funny
1,the film is not a total waste of time,the plot of the film is n't a mystery but
1,they do n't have enough money to get to know that,they have the most important of all the characters in it
1,is there any point to this movie or just to make a movie,is this a movie or something because i have n't read the novel
1,however it does n't seem as if the director and writer had any,however the film has a very long and boring feel to it
1,i saw it in an old theater theater in the middle of nowhere,i think this is what i saw and not because i liked that movie
1,a lot of people have said that they are not a movie,a good cast of good actors and the cast of this film are
1,it does n't have much of an explanation for,it 's a very funny and sad film
1,but the film is not about a man who can be,but it is also a very interesting story to watch
1,i saw this movie at a theater in washington dc,i have to say this is a great movie for the
1,as it is this movie is a total waste of time,as a child of his parents his son was not quite a
1,a lot like this film is the most boring movie i have seen in a long time,a very simple and touching story and an excellent cast that includes a very strong performance by david
1,with this movie it was just as funny as anything i have ever seen,with a supposed budget of about 5000000 for this film it 's not even that
1,orson welles 's character is a very complex character,orson grant is great as a villain who has a
1,but this one just has n't gotten a good rap score,but i think that it has to do with the fact that
1,so much for it 's good and it 's really good,so what do you expect from a movie that is so bad
1,in the end it is a film that is n't worth watching,in the end it is the same kind of film you 've read
1,it was just as bad as the other bad,it is n't the greatest movie that i have ever
1,it is an interesting film to watch with the hope that the film would,it is also an interesting film to watch for the love of god
1,but it is n't a good movie and the acting is so bad that it,but then the show started to drag downhill when the first season was aired
1,shahid has a good time playing a character he plays and he has great charisma and a lot of his voice,shahid is an excellent film and i hope it will be a success for anyone who enjoys to watch films
1,she has a very beautiful voice,she also had a very strong supporting
1,we see the two brothers and the other people who are in love with a girl named carolyn,we do n't really care about the characters in this movie because they are too stupid to play characters
1,tim robbins is excellent as the conflicted wife who has the heart of,tim conway 's performance here has nothing to do with the film
1,the movie also features some very beautiful sequences and the best part of this movie,the film was shot in an old studio style and was very cheaply executed
1,chose to be a good movie,chose to be the best movie ever
1,of course the main character is a young woman who is a struggling and very rich man with a lot,of course there are a few moments that are very effective but the rest of us are not afraid
1,seen in a movie that was so bad that,seen on the dvd cover is the same
1,i would recommend this movie for anyone who likes action and comedy movies,i have no clue that he 's in his place and the film is
1,you do n't even have to be one of those who can find a better person who can,you have to watch the movie and you wo n't care much for the characters or story
1,we see that the man is a woman but he is not the least bit of that it is about,we are also shown as the main character in the family who has a lot of sex for him
1,from a technical standpoint this one is a stinker,from the opening sequence we see a group of teens
1,while i ca n't help but wonder why this film has been made,while the film was shot in the same way it was shot in black
1,it was a nice show for those involved in it 's own way,it is an excellent film and one that has been overlooked by many of
1,the movie starts out with a couple of kids trying to get the kids,the story is a little convoluted but it 's also a great movie
1,i do n't think anyone will ever see any of the,i have never seen such a terrible film as this
1,chabrol has created a film that has a profound message about the nature of,chabrol 's film is the perfect example of how a film could be
1,oh well the first thing that struck me in,oh i 've never heard of this movie
1,mishima was a good film to watch,mishima was one of the most influential movies
1,even though the movie is n't as good as the other two,even the most ardent fans of the genre will be disappointed
1,yet the story was so predictable,yet the movie is so much more
1,i am a huge fan of this series and i have never seen such a good movie as it did,i do believe that they did n't have the best lines in the entire movie and it was n't funny
1,this movie is a complete waste of time and money,this movie is just plain stupid and i did n't have
1,i would recommend seeing this movie at least to see a different film,i do n't know whether it 's all the way it was supposed to
1,and i have to say that i was a little,and that was the last line of the movie
1,yet the film has a lot to recommend it,yet this is one of my favourite horror movies
1,the movie is just plain awful,the film was so poorly done that
1,oh and a few scenes that seem to be the only one who has the ability to notice the scene,oh well this is n't a movie that is meant to be a drama about an alien who has a heart
1,it 's a very nice film with some of the best performances in the movie and,it has the same kind of humour and a little bit more of the same
1,in the first movie he was a good guy who could have,in this one there is the odd thing about the movie
1,i think the reason this movie is so amazing is because of the way they act and how they do it,i was n't sure who the real culprit was or what happened to him when she was the first to die for
1,along with a few minor problems the film has its flaws the viewer is led to,along with the great cast and a good script there is a lot of action
1,a very interesting premise but that is not what it is,a lot of the film has been cut out from the original
1,well i 've been in a few of my friends in the movie and i think i have seen it in a dozen different ways,well i did n't really get the idea that the movie was going to have been made by a bunch of people who have n't seen
1,the story is a mess that has been told and so much more than it can,the film opens with a group of friends who are trapped in a small apartment in their
1,the movie was n't so great but it still was a good movie,the first time i saw it was in the theater i was in tears
1,the plot is very interesting but it 's just plain,the film is about the power of the characters
1,in this movie we know that the director is trying to,in fact there 's no character development no character development
1,2 i have n't heard that much about it is that the movie has,2 the main plot is pretty lame and the movie is so stupid
1,oh and the final verdict to the original film is that the,oh yes it 's the best movie i have ever seen
1,it was not the best film in the world but it was a very nice experience,it was a very funny scene but i ca n't really say that this was a bad
1,we are also introduced to some pretty good acting,we have a couple of scenes with the actors and
1,however i did n't care for the,however this is an excellent movie
1,almost every episode is full of suspense the story is so predictable it 's unbelievable,almost every time he gets on the train the only person is allowed to kill him
1,it is a story of love and passion in which,it is a film that is not for everyone
1,the plot was so thin i could have done without any of the other characters and the acting was horrible,the movie is about a bunch of men who want a good guy in the form of a man who is
1,i am so excited to see it again i do n't know why,i have not seen it in a while but i have seen it
1,great acting great script great acting great music and a very good soundtrack,great movie about a guy who wants to get to his house where he
1,the script is a little weak and the story itself,the film opens with a bang on an elevator
1,one thing that i found interesting was the way that they were,one of the most underrated films that i have ever seen
1,the only good scene was that when a guy in the car crash asks her friends to see the woman and they are shooting each other to a chair on a wall,the story of the story is simple in the way it deals with a young and naive man who 's trying to find his father but who is unwilling to accept his life
1,no wonder it 's the best movie in the world,no it 's all for a couple of chuckles a lot
1,this is one of the best movies,this show is a real shame
1,ivanhoe and a lot of other films are the most controversial ones i 've seen,ivanhoe is a wonderful film about a man 's life and his love for his son
1,mystery is a little bit more interesting than that of the other two movies,mystery science theater 3000 and i was n't a bit surprised at all the plot
1,to begin with a few of the scenes in the film are the best,to make a movie with a little bit of nudity i could n't really sit
1,i 've seen a few of these movies with a bit of humor but i do,i would love to see another movie that is as funny as a good one
1,everything else is just so good and that 's the reason why,everything about this film is great and the acting is superb
1,i'm not sure why i did n't like the story and the way it was filmed,i'm not sure if the movie was intentional in parts or the acting was a little too
1,the movie has no sense of suspense,the film is a very good film
1,the story is n't all that bad though it does n't make sense at all,the story of a woman who works as a stripper in the west and has her
1,this film is not for everyone,this is the best of all of
1,asia had to be a bit of a threat,asia is a great example of how the film can
1,some of them are not funny,some of these scenes are very well
1,but this is the first of the series that,but it is the best of the three
1,i saw the film at the amsterdam film festival and was very impressed with the story and the acting,i 've always thought that it would 've been a little better but it is still a pretty good film
1,it 's not even bad for a couple of hours,it 's a very simple movie with some of the best
1,ms smith is a young lady with,ms smith has no talent whatsoever
1,these are some of my favorites and i think they should have done the same things that were,these guys are in their mid 20s and are so obviously not that the audience is treated
1,i am glad to have a copy of a movie that i would have to be seen as i am the,i saw this film when it was broadcast in 1995 it was a great movie with a very good soundtrack
1,i am sure there is some good reason for,i was n't even sure what to do
1,just like most movies i have seen i do n't want to be so harsh and i just did not like the ending,just because the movie 's title does not work as a means of being a movie is a testament to the original and i
1,the film 's plot follows a woman who 's trying to solve an accident and then she goes to a small,the acting is terrible with the main exception of the bad acting and the script and i mean the acting
1,both films do not make much sense as to what the director 's vision means to be a film about a dysfunctional family,both films are the first of the same ilk to the point that it 's a bit hard to find anything more to say
1,i do n't know how the story of these characters would make a movie that they could not have had,i was surprised that they made a name to play this movie as a horror movie in that it 's a
1,the acting is terrible but it is a little too bad for me,the plot is pretty simple and the ending is a little unsatisfying
1,just to get you to think that the actors were n't going to die,just to show the real story of the young and beautiful and talented young woman
1,the movie starts with an old man,the plot is n't that bad
1,the plot and characters are just so weak and the ending is just,the story has its own merits and the acting is very good
1,i do n't think that anyone could ever be subjected to the same thing but the fact that,i am not the biggest fan of the book but i was a fan of his work
1,he 's not a typical villain and the two are all the better for this one,he was also the real hero in this one and he did n't even have to do
1,as with many more films i have seen a lot of them but i,as the film goes on it 's a pretty sight of the two
1,she 's so much of a jerk and so much of the acting is,she is the only one who has any real interest in his role
1,but this one is n't even close to the,but this is a movie you should see
1,i think that this film was a great deal of fun in my opinion,i 've been a fan of the original for over 30 years and i think
1,it was like a bad dream movie,it 's not as good as it gets
1,camerawork is ok but it is n't that bad,camerawork wise this is a film which is a bit
1,disney 's the first batman film the awakening that eats the hearts and lows of the genre is,disney is the one and only liberals who will not like the show as well as others
1,we get a glimpse at what a man is and how he could do it,we have the exact same feeling that the director is so confused that i can see
1,he 's got the best line and the most hilarious of all,he 's an old man who has been living in a town for
1,there 's a lot of action in the movie and it 's very,there is a good amount of suspense and some really good moments
1,i do n't think that this was the only good acting in the,i have seen it countless times and it was a great success
1,do n't get me wrong i liked the film and was very excited when i found out that,do n't worry to the movie it 's the worst movie it has ever had ever produced
1,the movie is not as simple as the one,the story itself has a lot of potential
1,tarantino has the ability to make us believe he 's responsible for his actions but they have the right to be his,tarantino has done a good job of making the story a great one and is still an excellent piece of work
1,i am glad i did but i was not impressed with the movie and did,i would love to see a film that deals with the subject of war
1,i would n't even say that the story line is very poor,i 've watched the original series and i have seen it all
1,good luck on the way they are portrayed as a couple of friends but they ca n't get into a,good luck for those who have read the books for the movie and have not seen them in years
1,one of the most interesting and intriguing scenes is when the young lady 's mother is kidnapped and raped by a man with the same hand,one of those movies that you will see is not only a great movie but a pleasant film and it certainly deserves to be seen
1,much of the film involves a man who 's a child and a little,much of the film involves the main character played by robert de niro
1,i have to admit that i had n't seen this movie since,i was surprised at how much the acting sucked from there
1,like most of us i can only say that the film is,like all movies i 've seen in my life the best
1,she is the perfect person to play the role of a man who has a love of her life,she 's not the best actress but she is a very good actress and is n't given a chance to
1,what is the matter in the plot,what is the deal with the other characters
1,aside from a few faults the film is a mess,aside from the fact that the story is so weak it
1,many have commented on this show but that 's just a little bit of the way,many people have said that this is a great story and a very funny one
1,well i do n't have a problem with this,well you ca n't help but wonder if there is
1,all of the characters are very interesting and the actors are all,all the women in this movie are either ugly or stupid
1,i saw the movie in the theater on tcm and thought it was great but this was just one thing that could not possibly,i 've seen this movie twice on tv and it 's still one of the great things i 've seen in the cinema
1,whatever the reason why the film is not so much more than it is,whatever it was a good movie i was not sure what to expect
1,imagine what the director was trying to do but he was n't,imagine if you have an iq of a story about it and you
1,realizing i have no idea about the characters or characters that the writers did for me this could,realizing that the only way it 's ever made are you are not going to be disappointed
1,watch the film and you will see how much of a great,watch it if you have the choice of a good director
1,most of the film is about the people that are trying to figure out who killed the killer and the,most of the film 's dialogue and dialogue was dubbed out of nowhere and they were both poorly written
1,it is one of those movies that 's so bad that it 's almost embarrassing,it is a great film to watch and it 's a joy to behold
1,does it take a little bit to get used,does she get a divorce from his father
1,i saw this movie on the big screen,i have to give you one word
1,he has a knack for a man to kill the president of the united states but,he plays the part of two very cool people who are trying at a party
1,james stewart is the only actor that has a very good part as,james cagney was in this movie the same actor as the cop
1,in this film the director of course was the one,in a scene he uses a pair of scissors
1,neither of them ever ever ever did,neither the plot nor the plot is so
1,i saw the movie for the first time and it still is the funniest movie i 've seen,i have seen the first two seasons of this series and it 's not just a series of episodes
1,forgive me for having the best movie ever and this is the only one i can think of that is worse,forgive me for the bad acting and the fact that the movie is n't about the evils of the holocaust
1,continuously it 's not the same,continuously enough i have no clue why
1,his mother and father are not in love or even care about their,his wife was a little more of a recluse than his dad
1,director david cronenberg 's vision of this film was a great idea but it was so poorly executed,director and producer john ford 's film noir film set in the early 1900 's and early 80 's
1,this was the first time i saw it,this is a good movie but it is n't
1,that 's what i got in the first place,that was the worst movie ever made but the movie
1,when i saw a film i was shocked and excited,when i saw the movie i could n't wait for the
1,the plot has been told in a way that it is a complete failure to sit,the story is a bit predictable and i did n't care for the main characters
1,the acting and writing is terrible and the story is a little confusing,the film is an insult to the book but it also shows a lot
1,in my opinion there is an element here that is not only a few people in their life,in the first movie i was really excited to have a copy of this on the shelf
1,this is a very good film and it certainly is worth it,this is one of those movies that will never seem to be the
1,the film is a bit slow and the,the only redeeming quality was the music
1,2 it 's not for everyone but i guess you do,2 the story and the characters are all pretty good
1,as a result the movie is a waste of time,as i mentioned earlier that the director was a bit of
1,another thing is i have to say it was a little too slow and boring but there were enough plot holes to make for a good movie,another thing that i found funny was the scene where he says something about the film as the first film in a row and the last 15 minutes
1,richard chamberlain has a small role as the president,richard widmark was the best of the two
1,i 've heard that he has the ability to,i would like to thank you for trying
1,crossing the border for the big break is a movie of the sort i 've seen in a few minutes and,crossing the border is an interesting story and a very good film that should have been shown in the theater
1,one day a woman comes out of her car,one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen
1,and that 's not to say this movie was a flop,and if you are a fan of the series watch this film
1,as for the rest of the cast it 's not that bad,as for the movie it is the story of a young woman in
1,he does n't really know how to get it,he does not have to be a big guy
1,fred gwynne as a tough guy and a great actor,fred olen ray 's first directorial effort was the last straw
1,the movie itself was a lot better,the film opens with a young man trying
1,the script and acting was horrible,the acting and directing are top notch
1,powell and his cohorts are the only one who has the ability to be,powell is a fine actor and is the real star of the film
1,nicely acted and acted this is one of those movies that,nicely done with a very good story and great actors
1,the only thing this could 've made about this movie was the way the,the story is a bit confusing and the characters are just plain dull
1,i have n't been impressed with the movie as a whole,i would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of
1,there is a very good scene in the,there are a few moments of hilarity
1,he 's also a very talented man and i do remember how he 's got a,he does not even seem a little interested to be the villain in the movie
1,the script and script is so awful that i actually thought the movie was funny,the movie was shot during a time and it was the first feature film in the
1,wayne and his friend and father of one of them are a young couple,wayne and lombard are great together and the film is well worth seeing
1,it 's just a bad movie,it 's a good film and a
1,as an example of what a film should be about a young woman 's,as i watched the whole movie it was a waste of my time
1,that 's why i have no respect,that was the only way i could have
1,jason is the one who 's the son of an old man and is a woman who is a child in a world of the past,jason biggs is in a film that 's a bit over the top but his work is just as bad as his acting in the film
1,a few things are n't bad at all,a few weeks ago i was expecting something more
1,then he decides to go to the local town to investigate his own life,then the movie started to drag and the film is n't going to be so
1,so i guess it 's just that the movie has a few,so i did n't see any of these characters or anything
1,too bad that i have n't seen it in years,too bad they did n't have the talent to make this
1,it 's not even that bad,it is an interesting movie and a
1,we have a lot to like about the film and its a,we see that the movie is not a typical slasher film
1,this is a very good and entertaining,this is the best film ever
1,i do n't know how i could get a refund to watch this film,i think i could write a script about this film but instead we get that
1,another problem was that he never had to rely on it,another thing that i have never heard of is that this is
1,she is not the same actress that she,she was also very very very funny
1,how the hell did they get out of the building,how did we get the idea that this was a movie
1,bixby 's character is so believable that even the supporting cast,bixby and the rest were all very good as well
1,they are all good in their own way but they are n't,they 're not just the ones you would want to see
1,i have n't read the book but that was a very positive thing,i have seen all the bad movies and this one is one of the
1,i have not seen a movie that i have seen where this film was filmed on dv,i 've been a bit of a fan of the genre for years and i am a big
1,when the movie is over and foremost it becomes obvious why they were n't making the,when they 're on the island they get a chance to kill the bad guys
1,while i am not a fan of movies that are not as good as they are i would have liked this one,while i 've read the comments and i have a soft idea for what they have done it makes me want to be
1,i would recommend this film highly recommended and it would be a waste of time to watch it on tv,i am not a movie snob i am just so ignorant that my mother is so obsessed with it
1,one of my favorites is to see a movie that has been made and i can understand this,one of my favorites is the one that has all the elements of a typical hollywood movie
1,all in all not worth watching,all in all this is a great
1,subsequent scenes were filmed with the same music as the rest of the film which was also the most interesting thing to be seen in the film,subsequent spoiler for the end you 're left wondering how many people are willing to kill people and kill them and then they will be dead
1,the movie itself was n't even as bad as,the film is also a very funny one
1,also the film was filmed by the very beautiful jan andrews who was in fact,also the fact that it has a very long running time is really funny
1,my favorite scene is where she 's wearing an orange and bikini,my wife told me about it and i have to say that i
1,great acting excellent acting and a great story to keep your,great movie from the director and a very strong director
1,one of the most underrated movies ever,one thing that 's good is that it
1,the only thing i liked about this movie is that it is a very good movie,the story of the girl who has a boyfriend who is a little more than a teenager
1,nimoy plays the part of a man whose mother who works for her family is a very good man with a heart of gold,nimoy as the cop is also very good with her and his performance as the lead character is very believable and the supporting role in
1,the story is so bad that i actually thought that i was,the script is a lot less interesting than a real story
1,only a few weeks ago this is a very enjoyable show and it 's a real treat to,only a few years later he has a girlfriend on the train with a shotgun on him
1,actors are n't really a bunch of actors who do,actors do an excellent job and the supporting cast
1,no other actor is a caricature of a good person but the film itself,no one can ever say that i do n't care about the characters
1,in the end there was a great deal of action and suspense but nothing really special,in this movie they 're in the movie that they are the most important to the movies
1,i have n't seen a movie that has been made in my entire life,i 've seen the movie twice on tv and i am still wondering what the
1,sure i was looking for a bit of a film and a little bit of a good job but i could n't,sure the film has a few moments which may be a little slow but the story is too thin and predictable
1,i do n't know who wrote the script for the film but i do,i was very impressed by the way i was drawn to this film
1,our 'hero' of the film is a man who can do anything to protect his family,our hero is an old man who is not only his wife but also is a man
1,this film is not a good example,this is a film that has a lot
1,the only good thing about this movie,the acting was horrible as well
1,reap a few minutes of footage from a movie like a few seconds later the film goes on and on and on and on with nothing,reap a venezia from his own mother the daughter is also a very wealthy man in a way he believes is a little too much for him
1,a very enjoyable and very enjoyable film,a lot of the film has been done
1,it is a film about a boy,it 's not a good film
1,but there are a few scenes that make you,but the story has a very simple plot
1,i 've heard that this was a great film for the family and,i am still in a mood to be entertained by the film
1,james cagney is a very talented singer,james stewart is also good and the movie
1,not a good movie for those who do not have to watch it,not to mention the fact that this was n't a movie in the first
1,the first is the one of the best movies of the 90 's,the movie starts out with a very young boy and his son who is
1,the first time i saw this movie i was in a small town at my school,the first time i saw this was i was in the theater at a local drivein and
1,it 's a shame that this movie has n't been,it has all the elements of a good western
1,all this is the movie is an excellent film,all in all a great film that deserves a wider
1,it is n't even a movie,it 's not a bad movie
1,plus the fact that the main character was a little bit of an idiot was so bad it,plus i have seen that many movies in which they have made it into the movie industry
1,i do n't want to spoil the ending,i was n't really impressed by this movie but
1,i was very disappointed to see this movie,i was so disgusted by this movie but i
1,if you 're going to see it then do something else,if you 're looking for a movie that 's worth watching for
1,first of all the film is a total mess of the first,first of all there 's some nice music and dance numbers
1,and i do n't want to go away but it 's so bad it 's good,and the scene at the end when the woman is lying and the camera shakes up is
1,his wife is the son of a wealthy man who is,his character is a likable actor who has no personality
1,hong kong action films with some of the most memorable action sequences ever put to film,hong kong films of the 1950s and 40s are all in a very good sense of humor
1,this is a very good movie,this movie was not only bad in
1,i 've been looking for a film that has a great cast but,i would recommend this to any fan of any of the others
1,when it 's finally shown on a cable tv station and the next morning i was watching it i thought oh yeah it was great,when she 's on screen you 're left wondering why she 's still alive and when she 's supposed to be the one who 's got
1,the film is a total mess,the acting is very good the acting
1,unlike any of us we were never allowed to believe,unlike the original the series is a great deal of fun
1,goes ahead to the old folks of all the movies that,goes to the video store and rent it on tv
1,the film is set during the early,the plot is a bit confusing
1,not to mention this movie was a big disappointment to me,not only did he do a good job and i think that
1,there was no real reason for it to be released,there is also some nice cinematography and the movie is very
1,all i can say is that this,all in all a great movie
1,same for the rest of the movie but not enough,same thing to say that this is just a film that
1,no doubt the only thing good to me was the movie 's,no one can replace that with any of his other work
1,but the movie is not a movie that is n't a good one,but the story is a little too complicated to be good enough
1,that would have been much more interesting,that 's a shame because i am not
1,i think i was the only reason the show was going to be released in dvd,i 've never seen a movie that could have been more entertaining and interesting and had it
1,for those of you unfamiliar with you may have a problem with it 's a bit confusing,for a movie that 's a little slow at times it makes me wonder why there were so
1,when i saw it on the shelf it was the first movie i have ever seen before and i have seen some of the original movies of the same name,when the film is over and the director makes you feel the pain you 're watching it the acting is pretty decent but that is n't saying much for me
1,rain was not a good movie to begin with,rain 's father is a very powerful and very funny
1,if you 've seen the trailer i 'd say that i would have given the movie a 10,if you 're looking for a funny film to watch and watch again then you 'll love it
1,with the exception of the movie 's title song the film was a total flop,with all the hype on the subject of this film the director and his wife were
1,like the previous reviewer said it 's a great movie to watch,like i said the film is very entertaining and i think the actors
1,i am a sucker for the fact that a man who loves a good horror movie can actually appreciate the fact that,i was a little surprised at the onset and the way the movie is shot at the beginning of the movie
1,but there 's no denying that the film,but this is a really bad movie
1,they all know it is a big joke,they are the real people of this planet
1,could i not get a grip on the film,could have done without it the least bit
1,the movie is about a group of people that are attacked by one,the story is n't bad enough but the characters are n't likable
1,true this was n't the movie that got my goat but i thought the story was,true the movie has a bit of an interesting concept but it is so boring
1,i do n't remember much about the characters in the story but this,i do n't think anyone has ever seen it in a theater
1,someones mother 's son and mother are the son and they are in the same house,someones friend has an alibi with an old flame named the head of the family
1,i would have liked the movie to have had been so much more,i saw it when it aired in theatres and it scared me
1,in this movie we are shown to be a little harsh and a lot of the movie is just a dream to the audience to understand what 's going on but i was not thrilled to,in the beginning of the movie the characters were introduced to the audience as though they had the same idea and it is obvious that there was more to this story than it would be
1,if you have a craving for a bad movie you should definitely check out the first 10 minutes of the movie,if i had n't been a fan of the first three movies i might have had a bit more attention to the
1,it was so bad that it made no sense,it is not the most original or the most interesting
1,however the film is just a little too,however the film is just plain awful
1,or maybe i was in my late teens,or perhaps it 's all a little too old
1,and if that 's not what we are supposed to,and the story is a bit thin and predictable
1,i am a fan of the book and i have always loved,i do n't know who it is that they are talking
1,in a movie of that type you get the,in the end i was a bit confused
1,it 's a shame that the director and the producers decided that this was an awful waste of film,it 's a shame that this film is n't available on dvd in english and released in dvd
1,instead it 's not even close to the truth,instead it was made into a feature length movie
1,i would recommend it to anyone who likes a good thriller,i have n't seen this film but i 've seen it many
1,i would have given the movie zero if i had been there so,i 've seen better acting in porn movies and movies like this
1,napoleon dynamite the best known actress in hollywood,napoleon duck has a very funny cameo
1,while the film does have its moments and is n't particularly interesting it 's a very moving story,while i do n't think that 's fair enough to be entertaining i would have to say that the
1,so many of these things have to do with the movie,so why does this movie have a lot of action
1,yen and the others are good enough,yen to wed is a good film for
1,the acting is horrible and the story is so boring it becomes a joke to sit through,the story is about a young woman searching for her missing sister 's mother who lives in a
1,but it is n't as much as an early film,but the film 's story is just too much too late
1,and it does n't even have the decency to be funny to me,and the acting is so horrible that you 'll be amazed at the ineptitude
1,but if you do n't want to be a fan of the genre you should see this movie,but it 's also a little bit of a stretch for the audience to get involved with the characters
1,a few people have said that this film is not a masterpiece,a few scenes of this film are quite amusing and i liked it
1,the film opens with the man being murdered by a woman,the film also has the feel of a good movie
1,the film has a very good story,the film does n't make a lick of
1,bell is one of my favorite actors,bell was a great character in a film
1,now i'm just thinking of being as bad as this,now i'm not sure what to say about this movie except
1,intermittently the movie is a little slow to start,intermittently the film is not a total disaster
1,the film has a lot of action and a bit of romance and a couple of good scenes that i,the acting was pretty bad with the lead actress who could have done a better job with her character
1,you do n't have to be a fan to appreciate the film but you 'll be able to appreciate the film 's faults as well,you will find yourself wishing it was n't that good at least not as bad as the first one but the movie was n't
1,they are all the same characters in the movie that they do,they did n't have a movie in the past that they could have
1,and it 's not even the same as i do,and i think that 's how they are all that 's
1,this is one of my top five favorite films of all,this is a very good film for a rainy afternoon
1,they should be proud for the fact that the movie,they should have made it a bit more entertaining
1,there are some great sequences and a few moments that are so funny that you 'll laugh once,there should have been a sequel for the sequel and the result is a pretty faithful entry
1,when i watched this i could have done it for the rest of my,when a group of people get together they are sent into a car
1,besides the film 's premise the film was a total waste of time,besides the acting the story line is very weak and the characters seem forced
1,to be honest i had no idea what,to me it is an excellent film
1,some of us will recognize the fact that the movie,some of the jokes are not funny or witty
1,i do n't think anyone can relate to that in,i was surprised at how good this movie is
1,it 's a shame because it is so bad that it 's funny,it is a very good story with an intriguing storyline and a great cast
1,the first time i saw the movie in this movie was the fact that i was n't,the only good things about this movie were the performances of the characters and the actors
1,sadly it is the fact that this film is n't even remotely scary and has been made to be shown,sadly the film is a bit over the top and it is not as bad as it should be
1,but the story is not so bad it,but then again what do we know
1,without question the movie does n't seem to have the potential to have a decent script,without any hesitation to speak of this it has to be the worst of the year
1,i have to say that the acting in this movie,i think i have seen a lot of movies
1,the movie was so bad i wanted to vomit,the only way i could nitpick with this movie is
1,besides the acting is n't bad enough to,besides that the movie is very good
1,cloris leachman as the love interest is the most beautiful character,cloris leachman 's performance in this film is the best thing i
1,paul giamatti as a former police officer is a bit too tough to be taken seriously in this role,paul newman and william powell are a fine team and the supporting cast has a nice cameo as the lead
1,you know that you have a lot of fun to watch,you have a movie you 've seen so many times so often
1,riding lessons to the end the story was so stupid that the whole film is n't just about the way things are about the plot,riding lessons and other factors is that we can only hear about what happened to the main characters and it 's just that they 're not
1,fortunately he did n't have to pay a loan and a few days back in the,fortunately the movie 's success comes from the fact that this is not a film
1,this movie does not seem to have the right idea to be,this film should never have made it to video box office
1,loy does a great job as the young christy brown,loy is a fine actor but she plays a very strong
1,they 're the ones who have never heard of the first film and it 's a,they should have done a sequel instead and let this show have to be canceled
1,this is a movie you can watch over and,this is one of my favorite horror films
1,keep this one from the shelf,keep the film on the shelf
1,it has all sorts of clichs,it 's an insult to the intelligence
1,that 's a little too much for me,that 's why they should have made this film
1,however there was an opportunity to be made to be a,however the movie was not a complete waste of time
1,and i do n't know the reason why the people who put it in the movie should be,and i do n't think the director 's intended for the movie is a bit more realistic
1,the story line was very good and so was the acting and the script was n't bad,the acting is horrible and there is a few other minor scenes which have nothing to do with
1,think of it as an old fashioned show,think of it as a movie it was a
1,as for the story i thought this movie was pretty good,as an avid moviegoer who was in the army at the time
1,if they are n't a little smarter you can find a better film better,if you want to see a film that you can see that you 're going
1,i do not remember the name that was written to be an actor,i was surprised by the fact that the film had so many twists and
1,overall this is a very funny cartoon with,overall it just is n't worth watching
1,if you want to see a really bad movie this is a must see,if you can find a copy of this movie you will find it hard to
1,the acting is superb especially from robert young,the script for the movie is not even that
1,this is one of the very worst movies ever made,this movie is about a bunch of people who live their
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i 've seen better acting,this film is a great film that is so rare to see the first time and
1,for a while i was able to sit through a movie with a bunch of friends in it,for a moment the director of photography is not as good at the film as the other movies that
1,the acting was terrible all around the movie was terrible,the film is a very long and boring film
1,the story is so simple and the ending and so it,the film is very slow and the acting is terrible
1,has the film been a good idea,has it not been a hundred
1,i 've been waiting for a movie to come out and i was so excited to watch it,i think the film would have been better if the director had had a bigger name for his work
1,this movie is a total bore,this film is a must see
1,it was n't funny it was bad it was n't very good,it 's a pity it never made it to video stores
1,he was the only one that was able to make the movie,he is the first and only person who has to deal with the
1,instead we are treated to a bland mishmash of scenes that are,instead i found myself asking myself why i had to choose
1,the only thing that made this movie worth seeing was the acting of michael madsen,the movie is not about the war but it is a very good movie with a
1,the only reason i gave this movie a 2 is because the story,the first half of this movie was a complete waste of time
1,those who have read the book will read about this movie in terms of the plot and characters of the original,those of us who know nothing more of the film 's style should be ashamed of themselves in the world of the
1,the only redeeming feature of the movie is the presence of a very good,the plot and story line were pretty good and the acting was good
1,my advice is to watch it for the next quid,my advice is to stay away and see the movie
1,so i do not want to spoil,so i can forgive this one
1,they did n't even get the money to use it to play the roles in this film,they are not the same actors that do in the original movie but the movie has no story
1,much to the disgust of the audience 's,much to the point of the story
1,i think that 's the problem of the film,i would like to see this movie again
1,and the ending with his dad 's death in the beginning is,and it is not that the movie does n't make sense
1,the movie is not a comedy but it 's not very funny,the script is a little slow but the characters are well developed
1,make a mistake of making a movie,make the film a little more fun to
1,the film has a few funny moments but is n't really funny,the only thing i liked was that the characters were n't fleshed at
1,rob reiner 's direction and cinematography are superb and he does a very good job as a,rob roy had a very funny cameo but it 's not as bad as i expected
1,did they just need to get it out,did it have any other movie stars
1,and that 's about all it is,and if you 're looking for a great
1,as a result it 's not very good,as a child i think it was a great
1,i have a problem with a few films and the ones with the exception of the movie is not so good as the first,i am not saying this is a good movie but it is a very entertaining and enjoyable film that should appeal to all ages as
1,my favourite scene is the one where the woman goes to sleep,my only question is that the film is set in new zealand and
1,its so obvious that the whole thing is a total mess,its the same kind of film as the original it 's not
1,no it was n't so much,no matter how far they could you
1,as for the acting i would recommend watching this movie,as the film goes on it does n't matter that the
1,all in all it is a pretty good film but it was n't enough,all the characters do is evolve to a level where each character is the same
1,i was expecting something that i would have been a fan of but it did n't work,i do agree with some of them that this is n't bad but it 's not
1,this is a must see for all film fans,this movie is just another bad movie in the style
1,fulci 's direction is very good as the camera moves around with a,fulci 's character has a motive for the death of a child
1,it would be easy to see this film on tv in the near future and if you 're looking for a film with some mates you 'll be,it is a shame that the film is so much more than a waste of time and money but not for anyone with a modicum of talent
1,fantastic movie about the power of mankind that,fantastic music score by george c mcginley
1,if it 's the best it is n't so far from the book it 's a lot better,if you can find a better way to spend 90 minutes or less then just watch this movie and
1,the film 's plot is a little thin,the film opens with a young woman named anna
1,the film is a complete mess of the first movie,the acting is horrible and the script is bad
1,remember how many times the camera was shot out and i was wondering what was happening in the scene at the end of the,remember that it was a good movie for those who like to be entertained at the art of the film making the film
1,still the movie is a little too slow and,still there is no reason to watch it
1,definitely the worst movie i have ever seen,definitely the most interesting character in the movie was
1,i was expecting something like this to be a waste of time,i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good romance with
1,during the time he spent on his life he had a chance to go ahead and retrieve him,during that scene they 're the same two guys that are being chased by the car and then they
1,once you see the movie you 'll get an idea of what the movie is about,once you 're watching it i feel that the film will never be the same again as
1,most people have seen this movie on the imdb site and the user comments on imdb seem,most of the time the movie was a bit slow but the characters were very good
1,sex in a way that 's a bit too far fetched,sex and violence is the kind of movie that you can watch
1,kudos to the director who had directed some pretty good,kudos to the director for creating a good film
1,while i 've always loved the story i was not surprised by the fact that it was filmed in the early 90 's,while i have a few problems with that it 's a bit hard to believe that the director could write a better script than
1,however the film is not so bad it 's just bad,however as a result this is still one of the better films
1,by the end we get a movie where a couple of the characters are killed at one point and another in which he is supposed to be a character,by the time the credits roll you are not sure if you are a fan of the movie or what it really takes to make a horror film
1,i 've seen it twice and i can only conclude that it 's the best i 've ever,i do n't know what to expect from such a bad film but this is just one
1,in the meantime of a film he is able to do anything,in fact i do n't understand why the director should n't be making
1,hilary kikuchi was a great actress but she did not do a good job,hilary swank is good as the mother who does the same thing as the one
1,ram gopal varma 's direction is superb and the script is very sharp,ram gopal varma 's direction for this film is pretty good and the cinematography
1,the acting was so bad i was embarrassed to see that it was a complete failure,the first is the story of a young man who is a loner in the hospital with
1,if you can make a movie with an actor who is n't good enough with,if you are looking for something more entertaining and fun then watch this movie
1,watch for the performances of all the actors,watch it if you 're in a mood to
1,visual effects have a great plot line and the performances are good,visual style is also very effective but it is very well executed
1,maybe they should just say it 's not a bad,maybe that 's what makes it a bad movie
1,she 's a good actress as her character is so likable that you ca n't,she 's a woman who has been married to the daughter of an aunt
1,he is not so much as one of his colleagues who have been in love but still in the,he also has to go to the bar and see a girl that she has done so well
1,fatty is a very nice movie,fatty 's character is a caricature and
1,james stewart was the best in the movie and he had a great supporting role,james caan is a good actor who can play an actor who is a good actor
1,i do n't know why people would not have the same thing but the people in it are not bad,i think it is a very enjoyable film that should also make you wonder what 's the purpose of making this
1,but there are a few good things in this movie,but if you want to see an excellent movie with an
1,i saw the movie yesterday and it was great,i do n't care if it 's the fault of
1,then it turns out that a man and his dog is abducted by some mysterious beast in the,then i realized the whole movie was shot on a low budget and was n't very convincing
1,the only redeeming factor to this film is the,the film is a bit of a letdown
1,and what 's that all about in the end,and if you are a fan of the show then
1,my favorite part when i watched the first episode was a bunch of friends walking around the house,my favorite part of the film is the one where the mother of the boy and her mother are
1,this is not one of them,this film is one of the best
1,if you do like that i do n't think it is,if you 've seen them you 'll know how the show was
1,the first half of the film consists of a few scenes of events that seem to drag on and on and on,the story is simple and the actors who have been in great performances are not good at least they are good
1,that said i was n't impressed by the whole thing,that 's a big problem since the director has done a
1,now if you 're looking for a scary movie i can guarantee you will have a good time watching it,now i have read some other reviews posted here and the fact that the story is a bit more realistic and
1,these two films offer that it is not the best movie ever made,these are the things he 's trying to get from this project
1,any of the other reviewers of this film have said,any movie that is a complete waste of time
1,hard boiled has a good deal of the plot and the characters are likable,hard hitting is another of those movies that you can watch over and over and
1,a lot of the acting in this film is terrible as well,a lot of these people were not even in the movie but this
1,so if you have a chance to see it do yourself a favor and watch it,so many people have been in this movie for no apparent reason and i am sure it
1,and i think the film has the potential to have a nice time in the,and there 's the scene when we see the first half of the movie
1,kudos to the director for putting his,kudos to director michael j fox
1,those who love a great story that are well done are not too easy for,those who are into the story are not a priority to watch this movie
1,despite all the problems the film has its moments with the plot of the movie the acting is terrible as it goes along,despite its weaknesses i was n't sure whether to be engaged to this film or the film i had hoped the film would be
1,as far as i know it 's a pretty good film and i hope it,as with the earlier movies this one does n't have to be the worst
1,i was hoping the movie was a bit better,i have been looking for my dvd copy
1,yep i have seen this on a shelf,yep that would be a great idea
1,the film was also filmed in color and it 's almost like that in the first scene with the camera lens and the lighting,the film 's premise is to be honest and the story itself is n't that good and i do agree that it is not
1,the movie is a complete disaster,the acting is terrible the plot is
1,neither of the two movies ever made a movie that they could,neither do i really care much for anything about this movie
1,spoiler ahead i 've heard a few comments about this movie and i do not recommend this,spoiler alert spoilers the first one was a complete surprise and i was expecting the worst
1,the only good thing about this film is the music,the script is a bit weak the story and the dialogue
1,i have never seen a film where i felt this,i was n't expecting too much from this film
1,no one is going to be there,no doubt it is an attempt to capitalize
1,brooke 's role is so bad that,brooke is a beautiful young woman
1,when a movie is made of a bunch of people who have been in the business,when the first half of the picture arrives the movie slows down to a conclusion
1,a few years ago i had to watch this,a few years later he was in a coma
1,this is the first time i have seen it and that 's how i,this movie is one that i think i would enjoy watching this movie
1,lack of coherence to the film and the characters that are supposed,lack of funds or anything else is done with this movie
1,i would love to see this movie remade in the near,i do n't think this movie is a total bore
1,how do we get the message on our own mind to be so,how the hell can anyone have such a bad name like this
1,which means that a film of the kind is not only a comedy,which means that he is not only the best of the bunch
1,the movie is about a family that is in their own right to be killed by the evil killer and they try to,the movie also features some very interesting themes such as the relationship between the two brothers and the girl and the son
1,schlesinger is one of those movies that can be enjoyed by all audiences,schlesinger 's character is so much more than it is the story is so
1,for example i was in love with the movie 's end and i do n't think that the characters have a purpose to the story,for the first time in time i found myself wondering if this was a bad attempt or a really good movie but it did n't
1,bert is an intelligent young woman who is a very good actor,bert jacobi as an actor who is n't as good as a character
1,i think that this was a good movie for a good film,i would have liked to have seen more of her in the role
1,helen mirren is a very strong actor but this film lacks the depth to make this film,helen hayes as the mother of the mother is so beautiful and so convincing to watch so many
1,this movie is a waste of time and money,this movie is just bad not good for people who
1,it 's a movie that is so bad that you ca n't make it through,it is the most beautiful film of the year and a very beautiful story of a
1,as the first half of the movie i thought it was a very good movie,as for the acting of daniel daylewis as a very imposing villain he 's a little
1,her mother and mother were also quite attractive and their parents were so well acted,her mother is a beautiful woman who is a woman who 's been married in a
1,a few scenes of the film include the two,a very enjoyable scene and a great ending
1,in short there is also a bit of violence and gore but not in this,in the end it becomes a little bit too abrupt to be taken seriously
1,we are told about the story and we are all told that the film,we know that the movie 's title is the same as the first
1,sir john gielgud and john payne give the best performances in,sir rukh has done some excellent job in this film
1,it 's like a tv series with a little kid running on,it is a shame that the film does n't get a wider audience
1,the first half was a little too slow,the script is also full of twists and turns
1,holden and dunne are the only ones who can be blamed for this film,holden is a good actor but his performance is the worst in the entire movie
1,the film was shot at the very least,the film is about the same as a group
1,of course i was n't too impressed by this movie,of course this film is the first to be remade as
1,i do n't know why it was so bad but it 's a,i think that the director 's commentary is not only for him
1,a great film that will make you,a very enjoyable movie to watch
1,seriously if you 're looking for a fun movie about two girls try to solve their crimes and,seriously i think that i was a little disappointed with the acting because i was n't disappointed
1,so much for the film and for the characters the film is,so much better than the one that 's the first one
1,this is a movie about a group of,this movie had no redeeming qualities whatsoever
1,vh1 's film version of 'the twilight zone' has its own unique elements of,vh1 and her fans will always remember that it is a great show
1,akshay kumar is the most underrated actor of all time,akshay kumar and the rest of the supporting cast are excellent
1,the movie is about the same kind of character who is trying too hard to be funny but is not funny at,the only reason this movie was so great was the fact that it was a complete ripoff of the first film
1,it is a good movie to see if you can find it,it does have its moments but i did like that the ending was
1,even a little bit of a problem is the lack,even the actors in this film are very bad
1,this was a great show for kids,this is a pretty lame film
1,the first one has a good story line and some great acting,the movie has a great supporting cast and a very good supporting cast
1,it 's the story of a man who is in prison for a long time,it 's the same kind of role and that 's all i can say
1,2006 's a movie with no budget and the result is a film about,2006 a space station is located on earth in the middle of nowhere
1,something like the real life and this was all there was to it,something to do with this movie but you ca n't go wrong
1,he was so funny he made a lot of bad movies,he 's a bit of a loser who has the same sense
1,so what 's worse vernon has been a huge problem,so much for the fact that the characters are not developed
1,there are so many other great actors out there,there is a lot to say about this movie but
1,some of the scenes were so bad they actually had a good laugh,some of the actors are so bad and it 's laughable that they are
1,terrible script terrible acting terrible dialogue and bad music,terrible acting and a ridiculous script that just did n't
1,if you have not seen it i highly recommend it,if you want to watch a movie with lots of sex
1,but that 's a good thing,but the fact that the characters are
1,okay that 's not all bad but it is a great movie for those who do n't like the original,okay i know that 's what this film would have had been if it had been more entertaining if it were
1,after seeing this film i was a little sceptical of the first two thirds of the plot but this one was n't so great,after seeing the movie for free i decided to go out and buy a dvd copy of a dvd and a vhs copy for a
1,i'm still a fan of the original but the first half of the film has a very bad ending,i'm surprised that this movie was released theatrically in the us but i do have to agree one of the
1,but the movie is so awful that i ca n't even believe it was made,but then again i do agree with the comment that this is a great piece of
1,the film was a total disaster,the film is very much the most
1,both movies are a little better than the ones that are in the works of the,both of these films are so bad it 's good but that they 're not
1,first it 's a film that is n't so bad it is good to watch,first of all i do n't mind that i do n't get the point it is
1,he 's got to be one of,he 's in love with her
1,she is a little more convincing than a young woman,she has a few scenes that i did n't really understand
1,in one scene she 's wearing a bra,in the end the film is really bad
1,being one of my favorite movies of all time i was a little confused when they came in this movie,being a huge fan of the first two thirds of the series i was hoping that something would be better
1,the plot is pretty basic and not even the action,the movie is n't really a good movie either
1,this movie could have been so bad,this was a really awful film
1,is the story so stupid and unbelievable,is it possible to be the one to
1,this film is a waste of money and time,this film was a big disappointment to watch
1,like most movies i have seen this is the one that has the best actors,like the other comments said about his films this is one that you will enjoy
1,guys who are not afraid to make a documentary about the real world is not a,guys who are so bad that you have to sit around and watch the movie
1,the movie was just plain stupid,the script is pretty good and the
1,chaplin 's film is a very good documentary that should,chaplin is the best and the actors are great
1,the film is also a very moving and moving portrait of the lives of a bunch of people who go,the plot is a joke from beginning to end and the ending is just as stupid as i did
1,the movie has a good story and it moves along well,the movie was not a very good one but the acting was
1,and what is most memorable is that she has a,and what was this film supposed to be about
1,also a lot of the characters were killed in a gruesome,also it 's not funny it 's not even funny
1,this movie is the perfect example of a movie noir movie that should have been called,this movie has a certain amount of potential that makes it even cooler for me
1,abiding love story is a film about a group of four women in love,abiding in the first place we are left with a feeling of a sense of
1,if you are looking for a great movie to be entertained by a great story you should go and see,if i were to make a choice with the film i would have been more interested in a movie
1,in fact the only good thing is the soundtrack,in fact it was just a bit too bad to
1,the film opens with a couple of nice shots but not as good,the story is not about a group of people who are living in a
1,which is a shame because it 's a,which is why i was so impressed
1,read the book and do so,read the book and you have two
1,particularly when you 're watching the movie,particularly when you consider the truth with the
1,i have to say this film is one of the worst i have ever seen,i have to say i was really surprised at what the film 's budget looked like
1,the film is not only about a group of teens and their own lives as a child,the plot is n't a bit original the acting is pretty bad and the acting is n't bad
1,the only thing to do was to make it into one of the first movies that it has ever made for,the acting is horrible from beginning to end the whole movie is a mess of any kind of movie or a comedy
1,this movie was so bad i had,this is a very good film
1,i would recommend this to anyone,i have seen some other movies with
1,the film is a very interesting one,the film has a certain charm
1,i was expecting something like this to be a great movie,i was very surprised at how stupid this film is
1,this is the kind of film that is a waste of time money and money,this film is one of the best ever to be made to have been a success
1,the story of the mother 's quest to find her father is a bit more interesting,the story was very well done and was not a complete waste of the talents
1,i do n't think the producers of this show thought it was,i think that is the most important element in the movie
1,well i think the movie is so good and it,well i think that this is a must see
1,he plays a character who has a crush on the world,he 's a little bit too much and too many
1,this is n't the worst film ever,this is a very good show
1,of course he 's the kind of hero who wants,of course the only problem is the story itself
1,he had no idea that his wife would ever be in this film,he was the first to die and he is also a very nice guy
1,she was the first of the two and i think that 's why i love her,she was n't so much a part of a story and was the only reason i watched
1,penn plays a very likable man in a movie about a boy and his daughter as well as the other,penn was so much better in the first film that i thought he is the best actor in the movie
1,the story was pretty good and the story line was interesting,the plot is so simple and ridiculous that it does n't make
1,let me tell you that i am a fan of this,let me say that this movie was a huge mistake
1,here we are shown the film 's story the characters,here is a film that will not be remembered
1,cassie and her brother have no qualms of how they are to live,cassie 's character is just so stupid that you can feel sorry for her
1,also the film is full of tension and mystery in the end,also i do n't think it was meant to be the same way
1,you will be glad that i did,you do n't even get to see a
1,wow it 's the most boring,wow it is n't a good movie
1,it 's not just a movie it 's an insult to the viewer,it 's a shame that the director never managed to capture a very good
1,i am a fan of the first one and i,i have no idea why this show was canceled
1,but it is a very bad movie to watch,but the film is so full of clichs that they
1,it 's a pretty bad movie with some good performances and the story is really good,it 's not that the movie is funny and is the only one who is really funny
1,it is a film with a lot of potential but,it is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,i do n't know how to explain the fact that they were,i am glad i did n't pay attention to my friends
1,why would the people who participated in the,why does she have to do this
1,except that the film was shot entirely on a stage camera that looked like it was filmed on,except that there was a little more to work at it could be a very good film
1,the only good thing in it is that the story has the,the acting is pretty good with the exception of the cast
1,seriously i think that was a great idea,seriously i would give this movie a zero but
1,the first half was pretty boring,the film is very well directed by
1,emma is the best of the bunch and i 've seen the,emma roberts is a good actress who is always very good
1,a good premise and one of the best in the movie to be made,a lot of the scenes seem to have been edited in the editing room for
1,it does n't take long for a lot of the movie to be edited and the characters are very annoying,it 's like he has been drugged off by a car and is blown out of nowhere in a room and
1,i would like to have seen more of the series but it is just a bit too long,i would like to give credit where credit must go to the director 's direction which is why his
1,the movie is a complete mess,the only thing that was n't bad
1,excellent performances by everyone involved in this movie and i would n't say it was,excellent performances and a story that has all the elements of a good movie
1,an insult for me to watch for the rest of my life,an excellent performance by robert duvall as a ruthless and vindictive father whose
1,in a nutshell i have no clue what to make with the film,in a movie like this i do n't care how many times the characters
1,the story and the performances are all solid,the first half has been a long and forgotten
1,for a movie like this you should never get to know the characters,for instance there 's no doubt a movie that should be seen as if
1,i think this movie was a waste of time,i think the main reason why the film is so
1,this is one of the best shows on television i 've seen,this movie had the same feel that it was made with
1,there are two things that have been missing,there is a reason why it would have made
1,not even the great minnie driver,not only that it is very hard
1,i was n't expecting it to end,i was really disappointed with the plot of
1,not so much about it in fact the film is a complete bore that is n't,not only the film itself is a bit too much of a problem with it
1,they are n't all the other characters but the film is a great piece,they are so cute and they 're so good they are just good
1,when the movie finally starts to take place in a few years it 's all very interesting and very well done,when he is asked by the police officer and he says he 's the one to be sent to the next room
1,was this really the only movie ever created by the director and editor of,was that just a matter of what the film was trying to do
1,while the plot line is n't a good one the film is a complete mess,while i do n't think that 's the point i think the film is a bit
1,too bad the only reason i did n't have to give it a 10,too bad he did n't get to the point of making his character
1,j carrol naish has always been in the,j powell is excellent as the villain
1,each scene is an excellent one,each character has a unique personality and
1,mostly due to the presence of the director he is not,mostly this was one of the worst of the lot
1,most importantly this movie has an interesting story line and the story is pretty much a carbon copy and,most of the scenes are very long and they seem to be just as filler to the plot
1,watch this film if you want to,watch it with the lights on
1,there is a lot of the film that is so bad its hard to watch and even though the,there 's nothing inherently wrong with the fact that it is not a comedy or a horror film
1,or maybe that 's why i hate movies that i 've seen,or maybe that 's why it is the worst movie ever made
1,she was n't so much a singer as she 's in this,she 's just not a good actress and she 's a bit of
1,ps i 've never heard of the original movie or even read the book,ps a very good film that has been done by some of the other students
1,thus it was n't so bad i would like to see a good movie with the same title,thus there is a very bad scene involving the killer that the killer is trying to find his mother
1,a film that i did n't know would,a great show for the whole family
1,lucky to find this show in the library on,lucky enough to have a copy of this
1,these characters are all the same,these two characters are not the best
1,the movie is not a complete mess,the movie is a bit boring
1,will smith and the rest of his career come across as an old,will you have to be a kid to enjoy watching this movie
1,you can tell the truth is n't that great,you know what to expect from the film because it
1,i was n't even born in my youth,i saw this film at a theater and it
1,during this time there was a scene in which a young woman has an accident with a woman,during the course of his career in the early 90 's he was an excellent actor but it did
1,sustaining a lot of great action sequences in the film and it does n't matter,sustaining an excellent soundtrack that is not as much as it does in this movie and
1,it was a great movie in which,it is very funny and funny
1,i have seen the movie and i can honestly say it,i do n't care about the characters in this case
1,under the guise of a very good director who does n't have to go overboard with the,under all these things and that 's a bit of a shame to say the least
1,i do n't know how i missed it but it had a very good plot and good performances especially considering the,i have n't seen the series yet and never will but as a whole the film has some great moments
1,it was a little confusing and i found it hard to relate to any,it 's just that you ca n't see the end of it all
1,that 's the whole point of the film,that 's what the film does to those who
1,summing it up in your local video store it is available on video rental,summing up on it and let the movie down is a waste of time
1,kate winslet plays the main character in the film,kate capshaw is great as a woman who has a
1,it 's the only thing that made me laugh out loud,it 's a great movie and it is very good
1,not a bad movie but that 's all,not so much as a film that i would
1,ramsey 's performance is a perfect fit and is a joy to watch,ramsey 's performance is a little overdone and it 's hard to believe that
1,joe is the only character in the film that could not have been a little longer,joe don baker has an incredible role as one of his students who are in a car
1,it was not a great film but it still made me angry,it is one of those movies that i think that should be seen
1,the only thing that kept me interested in,the story is not that great either
1,there is a reason why the film is a total waste of time,there 's a lot of good stuff in the script but not as well
1,when i saw this film i was n't expecting much,when i saw it in the theater the theater was a
1,guiness is a great character and he,guiness also appears in the film
1,it 's a pretty good movie,it 's a very simple story that
1,lorenzo lamas plays the character 's friend but i think he 's the worst character in,lorenzo mencia was the best and it was the only way to put on tv
1,it 's a shame the film is still a very enjoyable movie,it is a very moving film and is not only a movie about
1,i think this is one of the best comedies ever made,i would like to see that the director did n't get it
1,these guys have their own way of getting married and have no reason,these guys are a little more interesting than they were used to
1,this is not a movie to be missed by a wider audience,this film was not a total disaster but it was a good film
1,with a supposed budget of about 5000000 it looks like a bad project,with a cast of characters in one movie and a few minor characters the
1,it 's the same thing that made me mad,it also has many of the same themes of the
1,throwing in some of the best oneliners and the most hilarious moments you could ever have heard of,throwing the crap on the back of your head and then go back and see a movie that 's
1,serial killers are usually portrayed as a little bit more than the,serial killers are the most popular things in the entire flick
1,within the same time the movie takes you through the whole journey to see how a film,within the first ten minutes of this film we are introduced to an entirely different film
1,it is not a film about the consequences of the holocaust,it 's not a good movie but a bit slow
1,a lot of the movie is shot at,a good idea for a good film
1,i think he is a good director but i just do n't care for his work,i am amazed at how much i hated the film because it was a very funny experience
1,no doubt i could have had a little more money,no one is going for a moment or so
1,bennie is a very nice person who 's,bennie 's performance was a bit stilted
1,even the music is n't too good and the story is a bit contrived and it 's too,even the most ardent of characters are the same things with the exception of the first one
1,all in all a fun movie with great actors and great music,all in all this was a pretty good movie and it was a
1,but the movie is just too bad,but this is the first time i saw
1,worth watching for a good looking and very entertaining performance by a young caan,worth mentioning that the movie does n't make any sense at all it 's just
1,classe tous risques is a movie for its technical merit but the acting is terrible the direction is terrible the plot is worse,classe tous risques is a film that is n't only a film but a documentary of what happens in the last century
1,the story is about a girl who is trying to kill her sister,the plot is pretty much a rehash of the book which i thought was
1,it 's not a comedy to me but it does entertain me,it 's like a bunch of kids who are looking at the stars
1,of course it 's all about sex it is,of course they did n't have to use cgi effects
1,above average acting performances in this film is n't really all that good but it 's,above all it 's a good movie to show in a theater of a week
1,this movie has nothing going for it,this movie was not even that well made
1,mr hyde is a good character and he has a great deal of humor but he has,mr hyde is a man who has lost his wife 's life in an automobile accident
1,as for the acting and direction of the actors they were all very good,as for the movie itself it 's a great story and an enjoyable experience
1,now i know that it was filmed by the same person,now the plot is a little convoluted but it is n't
1,though the movie itself is not as good as other works it is a very good movie,though this movie is not about football it 's not a very bad film it does n't have
1,of course he 's not a bad guy or an antihero or the,of course there are a few scenes which are quite well done
1,all in all a fun movie and a great movie,all this has got for the good of the movie
1,as a fan of the original film i had to go see it to find out who was the good guy,as a child it was a little too much for me to enjoy a movie which was not so awful
1,the acting and acting are horrible,the film opens with an extended flashback
1,other characters are n't developed well,other than the fact that this movie
1,add to that a great deal of suspense and a great cast that 's worth mentioning that it does,add the worst acting ever and the movie goes down hill and is a complete waste of time
1,there is a scene where she goes on to the party with a woman to the woman who is,there is an underlying theme in this film that is the only reason i can watch it for
1,the film was made for video and i am glad i did,the plot was very interesting the actors were very good the story was
1,nobody seems to notice the plot and characters who have a very,nobody else has a great deal of time to do so
1,the movie has a very very very good cast,the film is a total waste of time
1,part of the reason i found this film to be one of the worst is the acting,part of the reason for this movie is that they are so funny they are funny
1,sadly the plot is a little weak,sadly it is n't that the movie is
1,he is n't as bad as the first one but not as bad but it is,he does not seem to be able to speak in any way shape or form
1,sadly the movie is a failure in itself,sadly i did n't know what to expect but
1,it is a very interesting experience to,it 's not that great either
1,the film is about a bunch of kids who are trying to steal a car in the middle of a lake and then find,the only thing that could save this mess from being a total disaster is that it 's not the worst of the bunch
1,you know what the director was thinking,you 're in my right mind
1,the only reason i gave this a,the story was very well done
1,a lot of the actors and actresses did not really work at all,a good story of a woman who is married to a woman in the
1,the acting is good with this movie and i think the script was written by someone who has not read,the film is a bit long and boring but it does a nice job of keeping the viewer engaged
1,full of clichs and a lot of things that are so bad they just,full of surprises and some of the funniest acting i 've ever seen
1,she is a great actress and is the best actress in,she is a good actor with a very different attitude
1,omar sharif is one of the most underrated actors ever in his career,omar epps is a great comedic director and it is n't easy to see
1,because i think that is the best way to describe this film,because of this movie i do n't know what the hell is going
1,what was the point of this film,what i got was a very dull movie
1,sure the movie 's plot is a little thin but it 's a good movie and the,sure i have seen all of the films that have been released in the united states
1,also the ending was pretty good though,also it 's not a bad movie but
1,it 's a shame to see a movie that is n't good,it is also a bit more realistic and the story of a boy
1,dear readers of all ages are not,dear god is i really wrong
1,the first thing that i noticed was the ending,the plot is very predictable but the acting is so
1,it is a story about the struggles,it is n't even the best
1,the story of a woman who is a woman and has a daughter who has to be one of her best,the movie 's plot is about a man who 's been kidnapped in a mental hospital in the middle of a war
1,they have a few scenes that are,they were not even so funny
1,i have not been so disappointed in the film since this is the only film i 've ever watched that is so incredibly boring,i was n't sure whether the film was a comedy but a lot of other movies i 've seen that are n't as bad
1,the movie has a very bad story and is n't really good enough,the only good thing that i can say about this movie is that it
1,he does n't have to make a movie of this sort,he also has a good friend to be a good actor and
1,but i have to agree with the reviewer who commented on the script and the direction,but the fact that it is a movie about a serial killer is not funny
1,stephen rea plays the character of a rich man and he 's a loner,stephen rea 's performance is so overthetop and the plot is so contrived it 's
1,tod browning 's direction is excellent,tod browning 's first starring feature director
1,i was a little shocked that i was n't watching it because i did n't care for the characters,i have no idea why the film has been made but it 's a movie i can watch
1,but i guess that 's a lot,but then there 's the story
1,totally devoid of originality or originality in any sense,totally lacking in this film the acting is superb
1,the script by eric roberts is a very bad one,the acting is good with some good acting and a few
1,the film does n't seem to get much better,the plot was so bad the acting worse the dialogue
1,powell is the only character who does n't speak,powell and pressburger are a very talented pair
1,the only way to describe this is that you can see the,the acting is so poor you ca n't help but laugh
1,i would n't have to be able to watch it for the first time but i have a feeling,i would like to see more of him but i would n't have seen him in anything else
1,the acting and acting are all very good,the plot is so bad that i could have
1,tommy swayze was a very bad actor as,tommy lee jones is in good form
1,so much of the time it was n't really a,so i guess i'm glad i saw this film
1,he is an actor who is a very talented actor and is one hell of an actor,he had the ability to make a movie of this type of guy that was in this movie
1,they have no idea how to use their own imagination,they were both funny and i liked how it was done
1,and what 's with the ending,and the film is a bit long
1,he has an incredible sense to play and the story does a good job,he is the only person in the cast that is a caricature of the entire
1,say it does n't take a lot more than it has,say the title and you will see it for yourself
1,this movie is just as funny and a bit cheesy,this movie does n't have to be a sequel to all
1,as the movie progresses i was very pleased,as a film it 's not the least bit
1,this is a movie about love and sacrifice,this movie had me on the edge of my
1,they do n't know how to fight the,they were just not the same actors
1,sometimes you do n't have a good story line,sometimes they get some of the worst dialogue i have
1,especially when the director is trying to get the message across and he 's really the man,especially for the first half hour and then we 're introduced to the main characters in the movie
1,that 's a little unfair to say i did n't like it but i liked the film very very,that 's why the movie 's plot is so predictable it 's just too stupid to be true
1,he was also a man who was able to do something,he does n't want to be so much of an idiot to
1,also the ending is a little abrupt,also the fact that the film is shot
1,the story is so thin that it 's difficult to understand how this could ever be seen as a comedy or a drama,the film is n't so bad as to be like a movie about a killer snowman who kills a girl on the street and
1,this movie is one of my favorites,this movie is a waste of my time
1,why is that the only reason why this,why does n't he kill the girl
1,the plot is a bit weak but there are some really nice twists in it,the only thing that was interesting in the first film was the way the characters interact
1,the movie is also the best in the history of cinema,the movie is not about a single mother and her daughter who
1,so the movie is set in the future and is,so the film is very much a horror film
1,when he arrives on his own he finds out that they do n't know what is going on,when i saw it i was really shocked at the amount of it and i really did n't expect
1,it would be a shame that such a movie,it 's a pretty good idea of the plot
1,i do n't think that anyone else can,i have never watched a film infuriated
1,this movie was one of the first,this is n't a good movie
1,bonnie hunt is a good movie and it 's not a bad movie but it 's good,bonnie hunt was the best i 've ever seen but not as bad as the other two thirds
1,it was a good idea to make a film about a family that has to be the one who,it 's not a film that you can see on the screen but it is not a movie
1,some of the scenes are so bad,some parts that do not seem to have
1,the film opens with some good shots,the plot was interesting and the characters in
1,produced and directed by george romero the director of,produced for television movie and the next film
1,and the ending which makes the whole thing so ridiculous that you can see the ending coming,and that is where a film that is going to end with a few good moments
1,spoiler spoilers ahead i saw this movie as a child,spoiler alert the plot has a bit of a mystery that
1,the story has a lot of twists and turns and,the first half of the story is quite interesting
1,they should n't have been there,they were not so lucky to be
1,the film does n't really have any real plot twists either,the only thing good about it is the fact that it was
1,if that was n't all that would have been the point,if you can get a few more laughs from the audience then
1,also in the cast are the great barbara,also there 's a lot of gore
1,unfortunately this is the only movie that has it 's own good points,unfortunately the film 's plot has the potential to be the worst movie ever
1,the film was shot on the cheap and the sets were very cheap in the editing department,the film is about four women in a small rural village and the first thing that has been
1,by the end i was thinking of the film as a whole i had the opportunity to watch this film,by that i was n't a fan of the first two but still i think it 's an absolute pleasure to
1,now i have to give the two lead actors a credit for trying to emulate the fact that this show has a lot of potential,now i'm glad i did n't pay the bills to see it on my local cable station or maybe it would have been a little too
1,do n't waste time with this,do n't expect anything resembling the same
1,while the film is a little too slow paced i found that it was not the first movie i,while it is the most obvious example of this genre i have to admit i was not disappointed
1,the film does have an interesting ending but,the acting in the lead was superb
1,but it just makes me cry for a long time,but the movie 's plot is a little too simple to
1,i am glad i saw this movie,i saw it on the sundance channel when
1,in this case i was n't expecting a great movie to be a good movie,in the end i felt that the film could have been a bit better but the
1,but this movie is a complete waste of time,but i ca n't help but wonder how he got
1,see how the movie is shot in the future with the camera,see how the producers should be allowed to show up on their cv
1,so it 's a movie that you can find funny,so what do we get when we are talking about that
1,seemed to have been thrown in by the director 's intent of making a,seemed to me a bit more like a movie than a horror movie
1,somebody in the movie was either mentally retarded or,somebody is entitled the best in the film
1,for the first time in time i still think this movie is the best,for instance when a woman has her hair stashed in her chest the film is
1,dirk bogarde 's performance as john is superb,dirk bogarde and his wife are two of the
1,notable performances and a few moments of hilarity make this a very enjoyable,notable actors like john carradine john goodman william sadler and ray milland
1,this is a film about the holocaust 's struggle to,this movie is just a bad waste of time
1,the movie has no plot or character development whatsoever just a little underdeveloped,the film also features a few scenes that are so powerful and touching that
1,each of the actors are a bunch of amateurs who ca n't act,each of these people is the one who has a good relationship with him
1,seems like a bunch of amateurs from the same time,seems to have been made on a cheap budget but the
1,that 's why i gave it a 10 instead of a 3,that 's the only reason why this movie is a classic
1,that 's all there is to this,that 's not saying a lot
1,it 's a very good and entertaining film and it 's not,it 's a great film to watch on a rainy afternoon
1,omg i do n't know where to begin,omg i do n't know what to say about
1,i think it is the funniest show i have ever seen,i was really shocked at how well this is a great action
1,the film is about three men who go to war in order to,the film also features an interesting premise and the cast and crew
1,she plays the mother of a rich woman who is a little over her head and has her love for,she has to make sure that she 's a little too much but she 's still the smartest thing
1,another reason the film is so bad is when you 're not in trouble with the movie,another one of those films about the evils of war and how they are made to be one
1,the story is about a man who 's going into possession and is,the only thing that kept me watching was the acting and directing
1,but it 's just as entertaining as it,but it was so funny to me
1,diahann page has a nice cameo here,diahann 's character is a bit too shallow
1,it is also about how difficult it is to make a movie and how the,it 's an interesting idea to have a good story and a great cast
1,this is n't a movie to see if you 're a fan,this is a film that you can watch with your friends
1,well the first time i saw him in this,well this show is not a bad idea
1,there are a few funny moments but overall it is a very boring and boring movie,there was a scene where the main character is talking about being dead and he was supposed
1,luckily i am a fan of movies such as the exorcist which i saw so,luckily i found the whole idea of the movie was a joke to me
1,none of the films have a great sense,none of the actors are very good
1,i think that the movie is a masterpiece to,i have n't laughed in a single scene
1,destroying the first film the other actors are very good,destroying the movie for a few minutes it was made for
1,the movie is about the power that was the main character,the story is about two young men who have to cope with
1,yeah i know i 've seen a lot worse than it actually was,yeah that 's right the story is so bad it 's almost funny
1,treacly and the acting is great,treacly and the movie is a great
1,the movie has the most obvious and unbelievable story lines ever put into film,the first thing i noticed about this film is that it is not only the
1,just do n't expect it to be the first movie,just a lot of action and a lot of action
1,things go sour with no apparent explanation to his own actions,things are going on like the frogs who are n't really the
1,nevertheless i think it was a mistake to see this film and i must say that,nevertheless there 's a lot of the usual stuff and the movie does not work
1,and then there is the fact that the story is about the,and i 've always found the movie to be very entertaining
1,so if you want to see a truly funny film that i would recommend to those who want to see a great,so the movie has an almost comical premise and does a pretty good job at making it a bit too slow
1,maintaining the sense of humor and humour that makes a film such an interesting premise and a,maintaining an interesting message the film 's only saving grace is the presence of the characters
1,the story is so predictable and predictable,the movie starts out with a group of
1,and that is what the film is like,and it seems that they were n't going to
1,in this film we see that he has a lot of problems with his life and his actions,in the first movie the characters are a bit twodimensional but the characters are likable and believable
1,they were both the main character and the two main actors who were in their early,they 're all so stupid and have been so hard to find anything to do
1,the only thing that made me laugh was the fact that the movie had so many clichs in it that it was,the first half of the movie shows what a good job it is that he is in love with his wife
1,things begin to get complicated and when the killer comes up a little to kill the girl he 's just a,things do n't get much more interesting when they 're in the dark and the movie starts to fall apart
1,this has to be the funniest movie i 've ever seen,this show is the most interesting thing in the movie
1,you do have that honor and you 'll,you know what 's going to happen
1,i am a huge fan of the original,i think the best part of this movie is
1,throw the cast in a film that makes you want to throw a few bucks out your throat,throw in some random sex scenes a few scenes in which the killer tries hard and the movie ends
1,so the movie goes on to a different extent,so what if the director had n't made a movie
1,the movie does have one of the strangest endings ever captured but it does n't,the script is very good and the performances are all pretty good although i have seen
1,she 's a great actress in the movie,she was also the only one who had to
1,allred 's films are a real pleasure,allred 's films are so bad they are
1,it 's a shame that this film did n't win a razzie award for best picture,it 's a pretty good movie and a great film to watch in a hurry
1,but this film is n't as much as the first one,but there is a lot of action in this film and a
1,sometimes they just seem to be a bit too old to,sometimes you just want to laugh at the tv show
1,the movie is n't even about a man who is so obsessed with his life as a man and a woman,the acting is n't as bad as it should be but the actors are very good especially the lead actress who is
1,when i saw the movie i thought it would make an interesting statement,when the movie was released it was a complete disaster of the first film
1,matthau is the real reason to watch this and while the first time around was n't,matthau and his friends have a great deal of fun with each other 's characters
1,he has to be the most intelligent,he is a very talented actor
1,my wife who was also in the movie theater and,my favorite is that they have the same actors
1,publicity to the us government in the united states to,publicity of the title is a very good movie
1,this has to be one of the best films i have ever seen,this movie makes one think that a bunch of friends would be a little
1,the movie also features some very good actors but i think the actors should not be,the movie is not for everyone who loves the genre and you will love it
1,ca n't wait for this movie to come out,ca n't even get out of the way
1,every time he appears at one time or another they are just as stupid to watch as they did in their movies and they,every time he gets his hands on the head of his own family it becomes a bit of a distraction to the audience
1,guys in the theater are not the most interesting people that i have ever seen,guys do n't even try to talk about the real world and this is the worst
1,portraying the young girl who 's supposed to be his sister and the girl who 's been married to his son and his mother in a way that is,portraying this film and the two other people who are in the theater is very different and very different from today other films about the evils of war
1,read the book the plot is a,read my comment on this site
1,in the end it 's all a matter of what the movie 's character is and what it 's trying to do,in a scene he 's just trying to make an appearance out of his character and is not a real person
1,finally the two of them were in the first one,finally this film does have the best parts of the whole
1,you do n't know that you 're in for a,you 'll have to see it to believe it
1,better luck to the other two,better still the film is quite well
1,garner is a great actor and i hope he can bring it in more,garner is not the only one in the movie so he 's a little more
1,the acting is pretty good and the story line is great,the film 's story is based on a true story
1,i am a fan of the show,i was n't surprised that i did n't
1,no other film has a similar plot and the two,no matter how hard it gets you to think
1,driven by the fact that this was not the case,driven by the presence of his mother he is unable to
1,max steiner is excellent as the conflicted detective who 's always been married to her,max steiner 's character in this film has an affinity for what he says about his
1,can you tell me how to do the film,can anyone tell me why i was so impressed
1,despite the fact that i do have some of the other comments i 've been,despite being made in the first place i think this was a great effort
1,some of these actors are a bit too stiff,some of the actors seem pretty bad in their own
1,however the movie is not a comedy at all,however it is a movie that has no redeeming value
1,it 's a shame to hear more about the story,it was so bad you could n't tell how the movie
1,those who have seen the film know that this film is based on true events which is,those that are familiar with the story will probably not appreciate the story of the film
1,the film is also a bit more enjoyable than the usual suspects that are being made,the only reason i did n't give this movie a 1 was that for the opening sequence
1,i have seen it many times in my lifetime and it 's a great movie to see,i was a huge fan of the movie in a way i was a fan of the first
1,i would love to know what the director of this was thinking when it was made but i did n't have to be the,i saw this movie for the first time last night and was amazed to discover that it was made on a low budget
1,this is a pretty bad movie,this one is so funny it hurts
1,sometimes i do n't think this is,sometimes they 're not the best
1,in my opinion the film is so bad that you can barely tell,in fact the movie was so bad that it was just bad
1,i have seen some bad movie before but then again what i did n't like was,i was expecting the best to come out of my mouth but that was it
1,probably one of the best movies i have seen this year,probably the most memorable thing i have to say to people who
1,the film is a bit over the top and the movie 's plot is just a,the plot is a bit of an excuse but it 's also a fun movie
1,in fact the movie has a few faults in it too bad the actors,in the end i did n't see any character development in the movie
1,danning 's character is the same,danning was the perfect choice for her
1,the only reason i could rate this movie higher than 10 is,the film has a very simple story and is very entertaining
1,well this is a good family movie that i think is the best,well it was a little over and over and on the back
1,all in all this film was a disappointment,all the while i am not a fan of
1,it 's a movie that makes you want to go home,it does n't seem to be that this is not a great
1,the acting is good but the script is so awful that i was forced to give it ten,the movie is a bit of a mess but it does not have much of a plot
1,sybil danning as usual does n't really have any of the qualities,sybil danning plays a character who is supposed to be an actress who
1,ann sheridan was excellent in it,ann is the best of the bunch
1,this movie was n't bad either,this film is a must see
1,but that 's the only reason i can enjoy this,but the movie just is not a good one
1,this is a pretty good film,this movie was so horrible that i
1,it 's a movie that should not be taken seriously,it 's just that there 's a lot of fun here
1,the acting is so awful that it 's laughable,the film does a good job of dealing in some
1,anyway a film like this that is not so good as it 's just made the movie a,anyway i would have to say that this is one of those films with bad special effects
1,vanity and the film is a very good film about a man who lives on his wife 's roof and finds his body,vanity and prejudice is an important point to the film and i think that it is not the most widely regarded film to be
1,in this movie we are presented with a bunch of very funny and funny,in the end i thought the movie was good but that 's all
1,bill pullman is a great villain,bill bixby plays a character who gets
1,this was the best movie i have ever seen,this is one movie that should never be made
1,when i first saw this movie i was not expecting much from the director and i was,when the movie was n't a success for the first time it was a great show
1,patrick swayze does a good job of portraying the main characters but he is also quite,patrick stewart is a wonderful actor and i liked how he 's in the movie
1,that 's why i think it is,that is why i love it
1,and the movie is a complete mess,and then the movie turns into a boring
1,but i think that the actors should go back to,but this one is a complete waste of time
1,it is the most beautiful film i 've ever,it is also the best of the three
1,in fact the movie is a total insult to all of,in fact the movie is so bad it is funny
1,it 's just a little bit of a stretch to get out of the film,it 's just a waste of time and i think it would have been better if
1,he is also the most annoying character in the movie,he is the most interesting person of the world
1,its a very very long movie and,its a movie you should watch
1,they do n't seem to be trying too hard to be serious but they never get a real job of any sort,they do n't even try to hide the whole plot of the story but the movie has to be the worst thing that
1,after a while they decide to get a few laughs and the only reason they are not the killer is because there 's some really funny stuff,after all the movie is a comedy and an examination of the life of a young woman who loves to have sex with her parents and is trying
1,when i saw a preview i was surprised that the director could have been a good actress and not just the script writer,when she gets a job at the local mall she goes home to her home town and her new wife 's life
1,if you can find something to laugh at here is an enjoyable movie that i recommend to anyone with an open,if you are a fan of the tv series then you 're missing out on a lot of the humor
1,this movie is a must see for anyone looking,this is one that i do n't like
1,carter is in fact the worst man ever in a movie and he has the most irritating character in it,carter plays a role in the film that makes him a great actor as his career as an actor
1,beautiful scenery of a small town in a small village where people are on a,beautiful and funny the whole film is a dream and a very funny one
1,gary oldman plays a very creepy character that 's all he could do in,gary oldman has a good performance here as he was in the movie
1,it 's just a shame because it is n't as bad as it is,it 's a great story but it 's not a comedy and a good movie
1,does he have an eye for the whole thing and it 's not a movie,does he really do it with a lot of his other movies like that
1,and it is n't that it is so bad they just do n't make the mistake,and the ending was so ridiculous i was left wondering what happened in the end
1,illiterate and old and his son who,illiterate is a very good movie
1,for all the wrong reasons you should n't be fooled by this movie,for the most part the characters are very likable and very interesting
1,the only good thing about this movie is the music,the story itself is a little weak but it has a
1,quite an enjoyable and entertaining movie that will appeal to all ages,quite a bit of the film in its simplicity and a few scenes
1,my only question is if this was a sequel,my friends and i were watching this film and i
1,sure he has some kind of good luck,sure the movie is a little over the top
1,i 've always been a huge fan of the original film of the same title,i 've always liked the film 's humor and the humor of the show but it
1,having said the same for the whole movie it is a good movie,having been in the military of a very high school and having been able
1,he is a fine director with an incredible eye but he,he is a great actor with a lot of fun
1,alongside all these elements i would say it is a little slow and not worth a,alongside his previous movies this one is a great example of the genre of film
1,timothy spall is a great actor,timothy spall as his brother is as
1,it is not even that much,it was not even a good movie
1,in addition to a good movie the acting was,in fact it has nothing to recommend it
1,the only thing i liked about the movie is that it is a complete bore to boot,the story is not really about the characters they are trying to do but it 's not as
1,can you imagine that this is the first movie i 've ever seen before,can the film makers invest a little bit of time into the script
1,since i am a fan i have n't seen this movie in a long time,since this was a long run in my head i had high hopes for this film
1,well i was really impressed with this movie,well it does n't seem to make any sense
1,this is not a movie for anyone who does n't like to laugh,this is one of those films where the story seems to be based on
1,chalk it up with a good story and great,chalk it up to it 's original cast
1,of course the film has no real meaning but the director does n't really make much sense to,of course he 's not a bad guy but a good guy is not a good guy
1,as for the film itself it 's not that bad but not as good as in the first two films,as a result of his childhood he has been a successful actor since he is in a movie and he seems
1,even the actors who do n't seem to have a lot of fun to make up for this is a good movie for those that have,even if the movie is n't as much as a comedy it 's a very funny movie that will appeal to anyone with a brain
1,possible spoiler ahead spoilers ahead i saw the movie at the amsterdam theatre festival in,possible spoilers ahead of course it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
1,i saw this movie on the shelf and i was,i do n't know why this film was made
1,exactly because it 's not a horror movie it 's a very,exactly because i do n't want to get into that movie
1,so the movie is n't a big success,so if you are looking for a funny movie
1,the movie is not only a great vehicle for the movie but it 's a very good story,the only thing good about this film is that you can see the whole thing with the actors and
1,the film is a very good and touching film,the story is simple but the characters are likable and
1,there are a couple of interesting scenes but there is no real chemistry between them,there are some interesting twists but there are some moments that make you laugh out loud
1,from what i 've seen from the first film i was n't sure whether there was ever something that was wrong with this movie,from the first moment i saw the movie the first time i watched it was the cover of my dvd collection in the video stores
1,as a result the whole thing was pretty funny,as a movie i think this is one of those
1,the only way to enjoy it was to watch the original lonesome dove which,the film is very funny though but it 's not all that bad
1,the film is about a woman named seita who goes from a mental breakdown and ends up being a little disturbed at the,the acting is so bad and you 're left with the feeling that this film has n't been seen by any means
1,if they had a chance to see this film i 'd have given it a 1 if the film had stayed for a decent audience,if you 're going to watch a good movie that does n't have a plot and a good story this one is for you
1,and that 's what the movie is,and the movie 's only redeeming feature in
1,i do n't know how it was n't that great it,i am surprised it has never been released on dvd
1,as the movie begins you have to be in a state of disbelief to see what the director has to work with the script is,as a matter of fact the story itself was so stupid that it 's hard to tell who is the killer and the story
1,now i am a fan of the tv series and i think that the movie has been very good,now that 's why it 's just as bad and boring as it is and you can see the end
1,it was a good idea to show a lot of the scenes and i think,it is a movie that has to be made in a year or two
1,it was a great movie for me,it was a great movie and it was
1,forget about any other film this is an excellent film and,forget it you 'll have a good time watching this
1,we are not alone in the world or our lives in the country,we all have to be a bit more forgiving to the characters and the
1,the story and the characters are well developed and well done,the movie was a bit too short for me but the director
1,i think that it is not a great movie and the director is also the first to have a great deal of time to come,i would like to give a 0 out of 10 if it was n't for the fact that i saw it at the toronto film festival
1,high school graduation is a great piece of work,high school is not a bad thing and the actors
1,note how this is not a film for a film of any kind,note it had to be one of the worst movies ever made
1,strangely enough he did n't seem to have any sense of humour and was not funny at all,strangely the acting is terrible the script is awful the script is terrible and the script is a disgrace
1,in short it is a pretty bad movie which i do not think i 've ever seen,in the end it is a very enjoyable movie with great performances by the actors and a good
1,well worth mentioning but you have to go to a movie,well this is the only way to watch this movie
1,unlike many of the others the film does have its strengths,unlike this and other films i was expecting a little more from
1,it 's not even worth watching if you have,it 's not a very good movie either
1,this movie was not made for the,this is not a good film
1,this is a movie of the highest calibre,this movie has no redeeming features whatsoever
1,because it is not for everyone but it 's a nice little film and i recommend it to anyone who loves action,because of the great performances by all the actors and actresses and this movie is not a good movie it is a very
1,the movie is a bit slow in,the film was very well made
1,it 's a shame that the film 's only redeemable flaw,it is an excellent film and one of the few
1,by the time it came out in the uk i was n't sure who it was and,by the time it was over i was n't aware how much i enjoyed the film
1,its a very interesting and enjoyable movie,its the most stupid thing i 've ever
1,future generations of the director of the film were also responsible for the death of the young man,future generations of the time are the only thing we know that they do n't have as much as
1,but it 's not a film that is n't,but the movie does n't work at all
1,plot summary for a new movie,plot line is not bad enough to
1,this is a film of the highest quality of the genre,this is just another film that i 've never seen before and
1,of course there is no denying that there 's some sort of moral message here,of course it 's the fact that she 's been in the movie business
1,it 's a very funny film,it was so bad it was bad
1,both of the actors were also the most talented in the film as well as a couple of supporting players that,both the director and the screenwriter and crew had a great time making this movie as well as the original
1,gold is about the only thing that can do,gold has no real reason to see it
1,i do not understand where to begin,i was n't expecting the same kind of
1,this one is a complete waste of time,this movie makes me want to be entertained
1,i saw this movie on a friday night with the lights in your eyes and then i had a good time watching it,i saw this at the tribeca film festival and i have to say it 's not as bad as the other movies it is
1,in the end i could n't help but feel that the film would be better,in this case the only good part of the film is the scene of the girl
1,oh and there 's some nice gore and some pretty gruesome stuff,oh yeah this is the worst film i have ever seen
1,but there were some really cool moments and the acting was good,but the movie is about as exciting as a trip to a time
1,instead it makes a mockery of the movie 's plot and character development,instead the plot is simple and the characters are n't developed to care about
1,they all have a good time,they should have had it in their
1,the movie itself was a bit choppy and the story line was too contrived to be interesting it was a bit of,the movie is about a group of teenagers who decide to take a trip to the woods to save their lives
1,this is one hell of a fun movie,this is a film for all ages of those
1,the film has an enormous cast of characters that have some of the best dialogue i have ever seen,the script is also a bit of an attempt to make the movie look good or worse it just does
1,its a shame that the movie is not as,its just a waste of time watching it
1,even a little bit of nudity is the main reason i did,even the most ardent of actors can act as the actors
1,this is the only film that has to offer it 's audience 's favorite score of the film,this movie is a great movie that is very well worth watching for the good acting and a great
1,first of all i 'd rather see,first off there 's the story
1,similar to it and the original version of the film was the first of the series,similar to the book i read the book i saw the first one and was very surprised
1,in fact i 've been watching the whole movie for quite some while browsing the theater and seeing a good film and i can safely watch the whole thing,in fact i think the best parts of this movie were the two main character actors and their performances and their performances were quite convincing in their roles
1,similarly the director should have been able to make a feature film that is more than just,similarly this film is a bit of an exercise in the way the film is portrayed
1,they are all very good in their respective ways and it,they have been on their way into the pakistan war
1,should have been made a little more interesting for the director and the,should it be because of how he 's not in this film
1,why would the police have such a good,why would you want to see this
1,its not even a good movie,its a shame that the writers had
1,i 've seen the first one and that has to be said in my mind,i was n't a fan of this series because i was n't impressed with the story
1,i do n't know what the director thought but i have no idea how the story unfolds,i think it is an excellent movie that has the same kind of feel that is in the
1,sure it has some of the best music and music i 've ever heard on film,sure there were moments when the character was killed but there was so nothing to be desired
1,if you 're going to make a documentary about,if you have not yet seen this movie
1,a good film with good actors and a decent performance from a good cast,a lot of people are saying that this movie is one of the worst movies
1,it would be interesting if the film had a more realistic ending and would 've made some more of the impact of the,it is very much like a tv series of the twilight zone and the only ones who are n't are the same
1,stay away from this mess of a movie if,stay as far away from home as possible
1,not that it 's not a good movie but it 's still not as bad as the first,not only is it a waste of time and money but for some reason you will have to sit
1,ben chaplin 's performance in the film is a,ben stiller was a real joy to watch
1,he does n't have enough money to go back to his family,he does n't want to do anything and his son is a suspect
1,the film starts with a very long prologue and,the film is a complete waste of time
1,she is not the least bit attractive,she 's just the girl who has the
1,christopher walken was good as a bad guy,christopher lloyd is great and it is a shame
1,i do n't understand why so many people have commented on this movie,i have n't seen anything from this guy in a long time
1,the movie has an allstar cast and,the movie has an allstar cast
1,especially if it was n't that the actors did n't,especially the one thing that makes this film watchable
1,yes this is one of the worst movies i have seen but it 's not that good,yes the movie is a little bit of a comedy but it 's not that good
1,danila was n't even that great and was not a bad idea,danila is a young woman who gets her comeuppance as the mother for
1,it is not a very interesting film,it 's just not worth it
1,i am so glad i did,i have never seen anything so great
1,you 'll have to see a movie with an open mind,you do n't even get to know the characters and the actors
1,perry is an excellent actor and his character is a very interesting actor,perry has to contend with a group of young men and their friends
1,he 's just a jerk in this movie,he is a fine actor with the ability and
1,its just that the whole film is so bad and that,its like a movie that 's a little too much
1,then we learn that the only reason for the murders is to,then the story starts unfolding with the characters of the characters
1,later on he 's trying to save her and he finds a way to get her to leave him,later the film is full of bad guys and bad acting bad acting bad special effects bad acting the worst
1,my only complaint is that most of the actors are not the actors in the movie,my advice for the dvd version is that you can find a copy of this film on
1,overall it 's a great movie,overall the movie was good and some
1,on the other hand the movie is very funny,on the plus side it is a little slow moving
1,but this is a film that will appeal to everyone involved,but i would love to see that in the future
1,ann 's sister is a very strong woman but it does n't work in the least bit,ann sheridan is great as the mother 's wife and the mother who does not seem to be
1,after seeing the trailer you 'll get a good story,after the movie was over i realized that it was a
1,when she arrives in the city she finds a man who is the reincarnation of an old lady that has been abused by a woman who is in love with the young man,when a little girl is killed by a car accident with the help of the local police detective the two detectives find that they can afford their money to go out to the police
1,god i do n't think he 's a genius but it is the best,god bless me this is n't my favorite movie but it is a very bad
1,the plot was very original and i loved that movie,the film 's premise is a little farfetched but the acting
1,when they arrive at the cabin of a local street and their,when the movie started this movie did not work for me
1,honestly if you are looking for the best movie ever made and the ones,honestly i was surprised that the story was not so much more complex
1,lord of the rings is not a movie about an,lord of the rings trilogy does not have it
1,if you want to watch a movie like that it does a good job explaining the concept of a movie and what is wrong with,if you 're looking for a movie where a bunch of friends are trapped in an isolated house then this one is for you
1,meryl streep is great as the woman who loves her,meryl streep and james stewart give excellent performances and the supporting
1,costar and the guy who played the lead,costar john carradine is a great actor but he
1,i do n't think that the director 's intention was to make a statement,i do n't know what the real thing is that 's the way the characters
1,this is one of those movies which i would watch,this film was a waste of time and money
1,caleb 's son and the other tenants are just the right people who do,caleb and his mate are the best and funniest characters in the film
1,lets talk about the ending and the end of the story,lets hope he 's on screen it 's not that bad
1,basically the film is a complete mess of,basically this film is n't bad enough
1,my advice is to watch another film if not for the sake of the audience,my favorite character is the father who is also an alcoholic and a little kid
1,the film 's main flaw is to make the viewer feel that the film,the acting is good and it is n't the worst movie ever made
1,there 's a good cast and a few good moments,there is also something about mary 's character who is a
1,their character is a joke and the plot does n't really come together but the movie is still a great movie that 's worth watching as,their performances are excellent but the film 's lack of focus is given to the film by an amateur cast that is n't really good
1,this movie is a must see,this movie has a very funny scene
1,the only thing i liked about this movie was the way in which the characters were in the book which,the film is also notable in the fact that it 's a comedy that does n't work for everyone
1,some of the scenes are very funny but the rest is just awful,some people may think that the acting is good but not the best
1,i was surprised at the lack of realism,i would have been surprised to find out that
1,i have no problem with this movie,i am surprised by it 's ability to
1,it 's the kind of film you can watch at your local video,it seems the film is a spoof of the original the exorcist
1,we do n't even care about the actors,we all have our own reason for this film
1,i think the problem with this film is that it lacks any real suspense or excitement,i have been looking for a film that is n't bad but still has a sense of
1,even though the movie is n't as interesting as other reviewers i have n't seen much of anything else,even if you do n't believe that the movie 's true value is that it 's a little over the
1,my favorite scene was when one of the boys is walking,my wife and my friends have never watched this show
1,this movie is about two men who are in paris and together,this is one of the best animated movies of all time
1,but i guess you do n't have to see a movie that makes you,but i guess it was n't a good idea to get the movie
1,i do n't think that this movie is a total waste but rather,i 've seen some pretty bad films and i was very surprised
1,let 's start with the fact that you do n't need to,let 's just say the last 20 minutes are pretty good
1,and it 's like a cross between the first,and then there 's another woman who is trying to
1,my friend rented it on the video store for the first time,my wife and i both loved this movie and it made me want
1,nostalgia is the most difficult thing in all of the films,nostalgia has a lot of action but it has to be the
1,i would n't have to say this,i was n't expecting to see more of
1,a very good movie with good acting,a lot of things i 've read about
1,too many of the characters are too stupid,too bad it is n't even funny
1,otherwise the story line is not a bad movie as is most of the time it takes on the genre and it 's not even the first time it happens,otherwise the film is just plain horrible the only saving grace is that it has no redeeming quality whatsoever and that includes some of the funniest scenes in the last 20
1,all the actors are very convincing,all i have to do is make
1,its not a good film but it does a good job representing the issues that occur,its a shame that i was able to sit through a lot of the movie
1,there are many many things that make this movie a classic,there is some sort of a story involving the man who is
1,however the only thing that makes it worth watching for is the acting of the two leads,however there are so many things wrong with this movie i do n't care how many times i
1,the film does contain a very interesting story line with some of the most intriguing characters i have ever seen,the first half of the movie shows the true colors of the characters of the film and how they are made
1,they 're all very good and have a great deal,they are not funny or even interesting to watch
1,few people have seen it and i do agree,few have done it but i 've heard that they
1,in the end we see him and the other characters being tortured by their parents,in fact the film is quite short as a whole the story is not very interesting
1,ironically the story and the acting are just terrible,ironically the film has been released on dvd and vhs
1,i was expecting a lot from my favorite movie of the last 20 years but the acting was,i do n't think that any other actor could have been a more talented and talented director
1,cruel skin was one of the movies that i had heard of that,cruel intentions were so rare that the audience could identify with the story
1,trust me you have n't heard of it,trust me on this it 's the best film
1,the plot has been done by a bunch of other people,the first film is about a group of young people from the
1,dakota fanning is excellent as the main,dakota fanning plays her part well
1,all in this one of those movies that is a little more than a comedy,all in all it 's a pretty fun film and it 's definitely a fun movie
1,that 's the best part of this film,that said the only good things about this movie
1,this movie is a great example of,this movie is just another movie
1,then there is the plot of the film itself and it becomes more and more apparent that,then there is an excellent performance from robert de niro as the conflicted and treacherous man
1,this is a great movie that is a must see for anyone interested in the genre of the,this movie was so bad that i had to stop watching and i did n't like it
1,he was a great director who was n't afraid to use a lot of his movies to get his audience,he 's got a very very small part but he is n't as good as he was the villain
1,first off this is a very boring and boring movie with a very weak plot,first of all the movie has a lot of action and a lot of gore scenes
1,they are just as annoying and boring,they are so bad in the way that
1,if you want to see a movie with a few laughs that will make you laugh then this is the movie for you,if you have seen a couple of films you 've seen in the past ten years or a few times but you can appreciate
1,i'm not a big fan of the genre but this movie has the best of the worst movies i have ever seen,i'm a huge fan of the original series and the original version was so bad it was a waste of time for those
1,fonda plays a young woman who gets into trouble,fonda 's performance as a man is not the best
1,although the story is quite good there 's no real plot and it seems that the director of photography is a very poor director,although i am not a fan of the original and the film 's original i can safely say i was n't going to go and
1,watch it for what it is a good,watch it and you will be hooked
1,the acting in this one is great,the acting is very good and the story
1,the acting is horrible at best and worst of all the film is a complete waste of time,the story is about a man searching for her missing son who gets to her home in the year
1,i would say that this movie has been done many times so far as i 've seen a few times i do admire the fact that it,i think the main reason why i give this film 2 out of 10 is because i did n't have a clue what was going on
1,spoilers spoilers ahead there was a twist,spoilers below this movie is an absolute mustsee
1,i am not even sure if it 's just the fact that it is n't so well done but i suppose that,i think that 's why i gave this movie a 3 because the plot was so bad it 's almost laughable
1,this is a movie that should be seen by everyone interested,this movie is about the same subject as this movie
1,he has been in the military for many years,he has a very good voice and voice
1,do n't worry to watch this film,do n't bother renting it unless you have
1,while a couple of scenes are shot out of their mouths i found the whole thing to be an interesting experience,while it does have some good points the acting is pretty weak and that does n't make it a bad movie at
1,this movie is a real winner because of the sheer,this movie is a complete waste of my time
1,not only is he a complete failure,not even the gore effects are n't bad
1,but it 's a good movie,but the real story is a lot
1,ken russell is a very funny actor and he is the best in the whole movie,ken loach has a great job in making a film that makes a good film but he
1,one of the most enjoyable scenes was when he and his father and sister meet a couple of the girls,one thing i do want to say is that this is a very good movie and should be seen by anyone
1,slightly more than a movie of sorts this one is a very enjoyable one,slightly of course the story itself is a bit confusing but it 's a very
1,every character is a stereotype and the actors are the only real standout moments of this film,every episode is just as bad and the jokes are n't that funny or funny but that 's
1,these are all the same people that have been in the world in the,these two characters are all very well developed and their performances are excellent
1,here he was an actor with a lot of screen time but he is a bit too bland,here we get a movie about how the world will be done and the future is a very different
1,instead of the typical american horror movie it is a bunch of people doing nothing to distinguish themselves from their own,instead of the usual stereotypes that have been done so many times in the past few years they have n't really got
1,the story is a bit of an improvement,the movie does n't get any worse
1,while i ca n't stand up to any of the others this is a great show,while watching the whole thing it 's a nice touch to see a movie like this which
1,he is n't in that one as he has the smarts of his own character to,he plays a character that is very well portrayed by the very talented robert redford
1,and then they cut off the screen,and what 's worse the film
1,not to mention the fact that he was in love with someone who is not a very good actor,not to mention the fact that the movie has an extended cameo by the director of one of the most
1,however the story is about a woman who is engaged in her father 's life,however the film is not so much that it seems to be a little too long
1,why was the movie even so bad,why would a man in the audience be
1,can you imagine a film where a character in the movie is supposed,can you get the feeling the movie is a little too long
1,if you 're looking for a movie that you can sit through over and over again then this is,if they do n't know how to act a bit they 're probably more interested in the film
1,the story is a little convoluted but it is a movie that does n't make any difference,the acting was good the acting was good and the direction of the movie was excellent
1,nick stahl as the cop in charge of this movie is a hoot to,nick nolte is a delight as the character he plays in this film
1,however the film is still very well done and is worth,however i found the ending to be a bit unsatisfying
1,but i do n't have much of a plot line,but it 's all too bad that it 's the only
1,the story is about the search that goes into a man who is,the acting is very good and the characters are believable to boot
1,though the film is not a comedy it is a complete piece of propaganda,though the film is very dated with the fact that it is a film it
1,but the real thing here is the acting,but this film was a total disaster
1,the movie is a little bit slow but the acting is,the film does n't really make any sense at all
1,whether or not they were the same man and that was the,whether you like the show or not you 'll love it
1,this is one of those films where it is so,this was not a movie i would watch again
1,fbi agent james woods has a very small and short time as a hero in the movie,fbi agent james woods is a cop who tries to kill and rape people with a shady attitude
1,rebecca and her boyfriend get a job for each other 's murder,rebecca 's performance as an american actress in the film was just too
1,another thing i can say is that this film is a total insult to the intelligence and the intelligence of the human condition,another thing i can understand is that there is n't any character development to speak of and there is no real story
1,however this film does n't get much attention at the very beginning and the end credits are,however i was n't too young and i would love to see more of her work
1,i 've watched this movie countless times,i would n't recommend this to people
1,snatching your eyes for the most you 're not going to have,snatching the eyes and make sure it 's your own fault
1,everyone else is just a stereotype,everyone else seems to go to the
1,i do n't know what the people were talking about but i do n't know why they did,i was hoping to see some pretty interesting scenes but i was n't sure where to begin
1,he is an actor of a kind,he 's not as great as the first
1,larry 's mother is n't a happy child she 's a little more than a little too nerdy to be a,larry is an expert who is a loner and he is a little bit reluctant to be in his home
1,that 's what the movie does,that 's the point of the film
1,the film 's premise is about a young man named sam who is trying to solve,the film is a very funny movie that should have been called upon the holocaust
1,the first half of the film is an extended prologue of the film,the movie starts off with a couple of good jokes from the first movie
1,as it turns out she 's the killer,as a result the movie is very slow
1,do not expect to watch anything in the film that,do we need more of this sort of film
1,i do n't remember the last time i saw this movie so,i think the movie is a little too long for me
1,in the meantime i have a soft and soft spot in my mouth,in the end it was just the worst movie i have ever seen
1,it 's a pity because it 's so bad that they just do n't make movies like this anymore,it 's just that the story has n't been done before and it has been done by the same guy
1,there 's not even a single moment where the film does n't seem to have,there is no plot no character development no real story and no character development
1,do n't bother with this one,do n't waste your time with this
1,an excellent movie for those who want,an example of a great film
1,so much of the dialogue is just so ridiculous and contrived it 's hard,so what we get to see is what the filmmakers have to say
1,i'm a fan of the book and i have,i'm sorry but i have no idea why
1,if you like it you should be able to watch this movie and do not,if you want the two hour of your life this is a must see
1,still a very well worth the effort and money,still i have seen it and i think it was
1,i'm sure that i would love to see more of the series in the series,i'm not a fan of the original series but there is a fair amount of action
1,almost everything about it is bad bad and not funny,almost everything in this movie was awful the music was annoying
1,the only redeeming factor in it is the acting,the plot line and acting was all pretty good but
1,but the movie is not about the war,but if you are looking for something like a
1,i think this movie should be shown on the big screen,i am sure the film 's producers had a chance to get
1,some of the acting was pretty cheesy and i would have liked to have seen some of it,some may say that the movie is a bit cheesy and not as good or even worse
1,to me that is the only thing that makes this film worth a look and i recommend it to any one who,to say more of the story was that i had no idea that he was trying to make an epic movie
1,at least it 's not for you but,at least the story is very good
1,logic is the key element of this film,logic is a bit of a stretch and for
1,just like the story in this film it is very difficult,just like the other reviewer i 've seen this film
1,this is a pretty awful movie that,this movie is just plain awful
1,however the film does n't work at all,however this is a very enjoyable movie
1,the film has an interesting message about the human psyche and how people do,the first thing that i saw was the opening scene of the movie
1,not only the most disturbing movie but a good film,not even a great film could make this film enjoyable or
1,i do n't think it was the point of,i have never seen such a bad film
1,if you have n't already been tempted and you are a fan of,if you want to watch this film it is a little slow
1,by the time the end credits rolled in the middle section of the picture i was left wondering why i bothered to watch,by the end of the movie you will get yourself on the floor of the story the story is a simple one
1,the movie is very well crafted and does a very good job of capturing the spirit of life as an integral element,the movie itself has a lot to say about it it 's a story about two people each and each other
1,i'm surprised that they made such a great movie out of it,i'm glad they did n't get more of a chance to develop the
1,this is the type of story which is a bit too short but it 's not too easy,this movie has no redeeming qualities to it and it does n't even have a good plot
1,as far as i would see it had to be done in a way it,as for the ending the movie is pretty dull and the acting is poor
1,the story is pretty good too,the film is also the first film
1,i have n't seen it since but it,i was really disappointed by this film
1,i have never been a fan of either of the other,i 've read the book the book by neil gaiman
1,meet the parents with a lot of,meet a girl who loves him
1,we have the two sisters with whom the movie is based and the fact that the film is n't even funny,we are told that she has been married to her son in a mental institution and is a suspect who does n't
1,this is one of the most beautiful movies ever made,this movie has a good cast but it 's a little
1,i saw this movie in my local video store,i 've been a huge fan of this series since
1,the story itself is not so much a film but,the acting ranges from the one to the other
1,since there is a lot of people around them there 's a lot of things going on,since i was not a huge fan of the first movie i had to admit i was n't
1,danika is a great actress in all her films,danika is a film with a very interesting and very
1,it has a lot of potential and,it was an accident to me
1,every time i see a film this is a very bad movie,every time he says it sounds like the movie is about a guy
1,if you 've seen this film you will probably have an extra view and a good time,if you like the genre and you want to enjoy something you 've been warned by this this
1,for some reason i thought i 'd give it a go on but it did n't,for instance the main character 's sister was killed and murdered by the police officer
1,twice in the world of the last mimzy is a wonderful piece of work that is worth owning,twice the same thing happens as he is being stalked by a woman who 's a bit different
1,it was an insult to the producers,it has a good plot line
1,they are not just a good movie,they are both the same two
1,she is a very good woman,she was a very talented actor but
1,by the end of the film there are two of them,by the time i was about to leave the cinema and the
1,that 's not saying it is the best movie ever,that 's because you have to see the first one of
1,if you 're looking for a great movie that can be enjoyed as an adult movie this is the movie for anyone,if you want a real movie and the fact that the characters do n't work for a movie is n't what they do
1,in the end he gets his girl back,in fact he 's a real trooper
1,but i do n't think that this is why the movie is so bad,but the film does not work as an accurate account of the story as it
1,i would n't even have been able,i was expecting a great show
1,i was expecting more than a few of the other reviews,i was really disappointed when the end of the film
1,this is a very good film to look forward to,this movie is just a bad bad bad bad bad film
1,of course it was in the film that,of course he does n't do much
1,i was n't really surprised at first to see it in the theaters,i would n't say that the film was made on a shoestring budget but
1,did n't anybody bother to tell me it was,did you ever see a film like this
1,is it supposed to be a comedy,is n't it a good thing
1,some of the acting in this movie was bad,some of the characters and actresses in the movie are
1,while the plot is not all that interesting it 's a very straightforward and compelling one,while i am not a big fan of the movie as a whole it was a pretty
1,this is the first and only movie of the year that i saw,this film is a complete disaster and i have never seen it
1,errol flynn has a small cameo as the man who is not the first one to,errol flynn 's performance is a bit stiff but he does deliver some fine lines
1,wonderful performances by all the actors especially the lead actress,wonderful acting by all involved and a great cast
1,i am sure i 've just watched it over and over again,i was surprised to find that there was no real plot at all
1,so if you have a problem with the,so the film is a complete bore
1,light hearted and funny and a perfect example,light is a very good film and it 's
1,but there is nothing to be said,but it 's also a pretty good movie
1,if you 're looking for a good film with a good message and great acting this may,if the movie has a great deal of action you can get a grip on it
1,jason lee is the only character in the movie that makes you feel like you 're in,jason robards has no trouble solving this and the film is not a comedy at all
1,norma is the daughter of a rich girl who is now a child of the mother,norma shearer and james stewart both play a pair of very likable men who have the right
1,the acting is horrible the plot makes absolutely no sense or the,the first is a good movie but the acting is horrible
1,firstly i thought it was an ok film but i would n't,firstly the film does not take the whole story too far
1,the script is not bad but that does n't mean that a movie should have been done,the plot is simple and is the only part of this film that is so good
1,helen mirren is a delight as the young girl,helen hunt was a bit of a surprise
1,the acting is n't as bad as the script but the directing is very,the script was so horrible that i did not even notice the characters
1,the acting is so bad that it is funny,the film has a very strong and very strong story
1,his character is not very likable at times,his character is the perfect guy for a movie
1,his wife and her daughter and the,his father is a good guy
1,the film is n't a very good,the movie is a little slow
1,the story of the film is a little confusing and a few scenes are not very good,the only reason i did n't was in this movie was because i had a headache
1,anyways i do n't care what happened to them,anyways it was the only time that he was able
1,yet there 's not really a lot of the original,yet the rest of the characters are so bad that it
1,they all do a great job with the material and the script is very very funny,they are just as bad and the only other person who 's seen the movie
1,forever this is not a movie i would recommend,forever it 's not even bad in a good way
1,also a lot of the scenes were filmed as a kind of homage to the,also the film 's plot is very simple and the ending is really bad
1,however i have to give credit where credit is due for,however the movie is n't really a good movie either
1,the plot is simple and there 's a,the acting is n't very good either
1,the plot is simple and the movie is not funny,the film was n't a bad movie it did not even
1,just as it was a lot of fun to say the least i liked the film,just a few things i did n't like in a film about a girl 's life or
1,1968 's first feature length of the night is a bit dated,1968 the story revolves around two men who get married to two friends
1,the acting was n't terrible but i felt that it was pretty bad,the plot is very interesting and the actors do a fine job of portraying
1,the movie is not as good as the first,the film is about two men trying to find love
1,she is not the only actor to be able to play the part,she is not a character who is constantly afraid of the fact that she
1,while the first two films were good this was the worst,while the film was obviously filmed in the late seventies the film
1,a film that makes you feel like you will be watching the movie,a lot of people have commented about that but this movie has it all
1,in fact the film is so much more enjoyable and,in fact i would love to see the sequel
1,he plays his character with his heart of gold which brings us to a more realistic,he is also in the background of the film and he has a wonderful voice
1,tombstone is a movie that should be enjoyed because it is,tombstone is a film that will not appeal to anyone
1,if you 've seen it you 'll probably find something new and unique to you,if you do like this movie then it is worth your time and money for it
1,it is not a movie to be avoided at all costs,it 's the kind of movie that you would watch over and
1,a movie that was released from an early 80 's and i have n't been to,a lot of things happen in the film are the same as the other films
1,basically it 's a pretty good movie for you to be a fan of,basically this movie does nothing but fill it with a bit of comedy
1,what i did like about this film was that it was a real,what i like about it is that it 's not so great
1,i have never heard of the original,i have n't seen the movie since the
1,there is a very good cast of characters and the,there is a lot of gore but no blood
1,besides this is another film with an interesting message of what is,besides the other characters that do n't have any redeeming features
1,the acting is good but the script is so boring,the movie starts in the end of the movie
1,cavite is one of the best of the series,cavite was the first one of the series of films
1,his mother played by michael vartan,his character is a stereotype and he
1,while there is a bit of a good idea the movie is a bit over the top but still fun,while the story is about a young boy who becomes a little more difficult to accept his life and his family
1,he is a very good actor but i really did n't know that this film was made to,he has to do a lot of talking to people and then he is just plain stupid
1,she 's got a few lines and it is a very good one,she 's the one who gets her hair stuck in the house and then
1,but the movie was n't as good,but i have to admit it
1,the film is set in the middle of a lake,the plot is about four young men trying desperately to get
1,you have to see that it is n't even funny,you 're in for one hell of a ride
1,claire danes is great in this role and she does not disappoint her acting skills,claire danes is excellent as a woman who has to cope with her own personal problems
1,robert duvall plays an excellent and very convincing role in his role,robert deniro plays an excellent role but it 's not that bad
1,i would like to see a lot of people and women,i do n't even know if you should n't have to have
1,christopher plummer is the only reason i gave this movie a 2,christopher plummer is great in his role as the bad guy and that
1,i saw this movie on the sundance channel and was so scared to read that it was,i have seen a couple of the bad ones that i have seen in a movie
1,if you 're looking for an interesting movie with plenty of action and a good story and some good actors this one was,if you 're a fan of the original film and are into the series you will be able to appreciate this film
1,do n't get me wrong i love horror movies,do not read it do not watch it
1,many of the characters are very well developed and the actors are all excellent,many people will have a hard time believing that the director has done a decent
1,all that said there are many things,all the other movies are great
1,acting is bad and the script was awful,acting varies a lot from the actors in the
1,it was a little hard to believe that he was in the movie and was trying to make some serious scenes,it 's a shame that the film was released in the uk for a week or so because it was made in
1,there are so many things i can say about this movie,there was also a good amount of action and action sequences which
1,a lot more people would know who the killer is because i think that he was a great director and a good actor,a very interesting story of the man who loves to be a man who has to be a woman to a child
1,noam was a good choice for a movie,noam 's character is an unlikable character
1,fuller 's the most popular film is the story that has the power to be the most,fuller is one of the finest actors in the world and he is great in it
1,lucas 's movie has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen,lucas 's character is so stupid that i was wondering when was going to make a
1,110 the plot is a little farfetched,110 and i love the movie
1,i think i have seen it several times and it will never be again,i would n't go into detail on a film with this movie but i have
1,think it 's the best way to get a copy of the book,think that this was a very good movie that is just a good example
1,action sequences are so bad you can actually call it a horror movie,action sequences are a tad overdone but the film is very funny and keeps
1,i do n't know why i was watching this movie,i think the movie is a great film and the cast
1,and that 's why i did n't like this,and the acting in general is pretty good
1,if you 've seen this movie you will probably find yourself wondering why it was,if you do n't want to get a few laughs you 'll like this
1,his father was a little over the top when he,his character is the same as the old man
1,they are not so lucky to have a movie,they should be ashamed to accept the fact that this
1,in fact the story is so weak it makes it impossible to follow,in this one the characters are all very shallow and they are all very
1,a lot of the movie is shot in a,a very good movie with a great cast
1,the film was a bit too long,the plot is a little confusing
1,obviously it was n't a good movie,obviously a film of the sort would be
1,it 's just the worst thing ever written and acted,it 's not a good film to say it 's a
1,the movie does get a little bit boring,the film has a very good cast
1,screen legend is a fine film and it 's the first time in which the film is based on,screen adaptations of the first film were made for years with a great soundtrack and an amazing cast
1,the story is very interesting and the acting,the movie was a very good one
1,that was the only reason i gave up the,that 's what i got from this movie
1,the acting was n't great but it was n't really all that memorable,the film is very funny and very funny and it does a good job
1,many people have claimed that this is just a movie of the week and a waste of money,many movies have been shot and are made by the same old people in the same way
1,that 's not all that makes the movie bad,that said this is not the worst movie to come
1,do n't watch it because of the sheer stupidity,do n't expect a big surprise or two but a
1,it 's all about the characters the actors the characters the,it was a little over the top in my opinion
1,sonny is the most interesting character in the whole movie and it 's just the kind,sonny chiba has a very good cameo as always he looks like the perfect person
1,i have to say that i did n't think that was the only good scene in the story,i have been a fan of his work since he was in my opinion the best of all the
1,he had been in the military for a week and was now in jail with the police,he was n't a hero at all but the fact he was a little too old for a
1,i was n't surprised to see a movie that has such a good premise and i have to say this is one of the best i 've seen for a long time,i 've seen some really bad movies from this day and this one is so bad that i could go on to warn you that this is just the worst movie ever made
1,here we have one of the most boring characters ever committed to celluloid,here 's another one i 'll watch for the next 120 minutes
1,sure i know the movie has its faults but i ca n't say enough,sure it 's pretty funny and it has some good laughs but there 's a
1,there were many moments that were so ridiculous and ridiculous that it made me laugh at some parts,there were so many good movies out there that i was watching and i was very surprised
1,after seeing the first film i thought that the movie might be,after the first 15 minutes i was n't bored to tears
1,apparently it 's the story of the first movie which is supposed to,apparently it was a mistake to make a movie out of it
1,the script has the same effect on me,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,besides the fact that it 's an action,besides this is n't a bad movie
1,everyone involved in this movie has a bad taste for their,everyone else is just as good as the first one
1,the film was shot at the time and the fact that it was,the acting is horrible and the story line is not very good
1,despite all these things the movie is a very good one,despite that it 's a movie that has been told to be
1,for the first half of the movie the audience is treated to the main,for a few years i have never seen this movie in its entirety
1,i have n't seen this movie in years and i ca n't say it again but i think it 's a good movie,i was n't sure whether the director intended the money or not to be in that film and that 's the reason why i
1,lena 's mother and mother are in a relationship with the mother,lena is a great character but she does n't really seem to have
1,if you have never been a fan of hers you will love this film,if you do n't like the movie you 'll probably love this movie
1,however the story is n't bad and the,however the plot is n't too good
1,meanwhile it is a little too long and a bit too sentimental,meanwhile the police are sent by their father to help her and her
1,or maybe the best scene is when a woman is walking out of an asylum with a woman in a shower scene,or maybe it was because the actors had no talent but to make the story so interesting and believable and so much more
1,there 's a few good moments in this movie,there 's no plot line or even a hint of
1,this is the first movie i have seen in a long time,this movie is not a comedy and as you will probably guess it
1,i 've never seen anything like the original series and was very disappointed that i had,i saw the movie at the 2005 international film festival and enjoyed it very much
1,her acting skills and she is n't as convincing as,her acting is so horrible it hurts to watch
1,i have to say this is a great story,i was really surprised by what was happening
1,it 's a shame that a lot of people have,it is an interesting film that i have seen
1,the plot is about a couple,the only good things about this turkey
1,probably the only redeeming quality of this movie was the music,probably this film has been done on a limited budget
1,the plot revolves around a bunch of young men who are searching to be married and have a,the movie was a lot better than most bmovies and it was n't even the good parts
1,so i have to add some points of the movie that,so the story has a very interesting and intriguing feel
1,almost every character in the movie is very different from the one who 's the,almost every line in the film is a little choppy but it is n't
1,but i ca n't believe the people that made this movie like the movie should,but the best part of the movie was the way that it was shot
1,the story line is so bad that i actually laughed and cried at the movie,the only good aspect about the movie was the fact that it was shot entirely in
1,well the movie was a total waste of time and a waste of my,well this movie was not for the fainthearted it is an entertaining movie
1,but the plot is really a bit of a downer,but this is what makes the movie so enjoyable
1,however this time the characters are all so annoying and onedimensional that it could have been a little too easy for the ears to get the,however if you do n't want to watch this movie the first time you 're in a hurry to find something to enjoy about it
1,i think this one is the best movie ever created,i would n't say that if you have n't seen it
1,instead of being a complete mess of the genre,instead it is a story of two sisters who get
1,i 've seen many of the movies that are made in years and i can understand why some have said this film sucked,i do n't know why the people who did n't have to watch this movie are not going to be able to relate it
1,a few scenes with a little girl and an annoying,a great cast of fine performances and good actors
1,it 's not a very bad film,it 's also a shame because it was
1,more importantly the film 's story is,more than enough of the actors
1,good for what he 's done,good for the kids and girls
1,this movie is not about people who do so,this film has a few funny lines and some great
1,it 's like a tv sitcom,it 's like a cross between the
1,and that 's what the whole family does,and it is n't as funny as the other
1,that is the most stupid thing i have ever seen in my entire life,that is not what happened in the film the story of a girl 's mother
1,i think that this was a great movie,i am a fan of his show and this
1,absolutely the worst thing about a movie that was,absolutely the best movie i have ever seen
1,the plot is very thin and there are some interesting scenes but i,the film is not very good at first but is quite effective
1,another one of them is a very nice and interesting movie about two women who are married to the french mafia and are attracted by,another problem that is the story of a man who kills a man with an incurable cancer and is forced to fight for revenge
1,they 're just not as good as they are in the book,they should be proud of themselves for the sake of the script for
1,the movie is just a little too much on the action scenes which are pretty tame and the,the story of the movie is that there was n't a lot of people in the theatre
1,this is not a film that you will,this one is not a great one
1,i have seen a lot of movies but i,i think this should have been a movie
1,there 's a great deal of humor and there 's a few funny moments in the film,there is some interesting moments but not in the way of the story which is not the case
1,however there is no denying the difference between the two films which is the only way the same story is made to have,however i have a feeling of being the only one who has seen this movie and was able to get through it
1,that 's what you 're looking for,that 's all he has to work with
1,browning 's first feature length of filmmaking is also one of the best ever filmed,browning 's direction was n't as impressive as the other films but this one is so
1,at first the movie does n't have any sort of climax or atmosphere but the story,at times it 's a bit of a spoof but the plot is very good
1,its a movie you 'll enjoy,its a pity that the movie has
1,i think that this film was made in the early 80 's when the,i was surprised to find out that the film was a complete mess
1,a good movie is a must see,a lot of people who hate movies are
1,consider the movie was made in the 80 's and 60 's,consider the real problem with this film and that 's the problem
1,i was n't expecting too much and it was a bit slow for me,i think you can tell that the story was based on a true story which
1,it 's a pity that the movie,it was a waste of time
1,even though the movie was supposed to be a comedy it still was n't very good,even if it were n't for the poor actors the director and the writers would be able
1,not a good movie but not worth watching,not to mention that there were n't any more
1,for example the movie was made for a buck and the director should have,for some reason he was able to play a part in the movie
1,this is one of the most memorable movies i have seen,this is a movie that should be seen and forgotten
1,to sum it up this film is a complete,to say it is good is beyond me
1,but the fact that i do n't,but it is not that bad
1,but the film has no plot the acting and the direction is poor,but this is a movie that is not even worth a look
1,the film has a certain amount to it,the first time i saw it i was n't
1,let me say that i did n't,let 's start with the ending
1,i am sure the story line was not very well developed but the script,i am a big fan of john lennon and i liked the film
1,this is not a movie for kids because of all the things that are,this movie is so horrible and so unfunny that it is n't funny
1,first of all it is an insult to the intelligence,first of all i must admit that this movie was not
1,still i did n't see a film with such a bad cast,still the best thing about the movie was the fact that it was
1,olan is the one who 's got to be the killer,olan also has an obsession with the other woman but she does
1,the only reason to watch this film is because it has the best actors and actresses and,the script for this film is a bit thin and the characters are just too silly
1,between the two leads they have no chemistry whatsoever,between the first and second seasons the second is a
1,she was a great character and she is a great actress,she was also a good actress but she did n't have the
1,highly recommended to fans of the genre but,highly recommended for fans of asian movies
1,that 's what the film does offer in a way that is quite entertaining to a degree,that 's because i am not sure why this movie is rated r rating for the imdb votes
1,it would have been better if they had n't,it was a waste of time and money
1,i do n't know what the hell is wrong with the plot,i think the only good aspect of the entire movie is his acting
1,it 's the kind of film that makes the viewer think that it 's an indie film,it 's just that the film makes no attempt to explain the motivations or atmosphere of the original
1,the only thing i could think of was the movie,the first half and the second is the worst
1,spoiler warning spoiler alert the end result was just as awful as it,spoiler ahead i 've just finished watching this movie again and again
1,he is the only person that is able to get his hands on his own and his own,he 's a great actor and i really hope he does n't have a chance to do this movie
1,but i was so impressed with this movie i,but it 's a little bit too late
1,the only way to get a decent deal was that the movie was a good one,the acting and acting are pretty bad and the characters are n't even remotely believable
1,it is a shame that such an event is n't given enough money to produce,it 's not a bad film and there are worse parts of the film
1,he 's a pretty good actor but he 's too bland too,he was a great actor but i did n't see it
1,this one really should not be forgotten,this is a very very funny film with
1,it 's a great shame that the movie,it 's not even a good film
1,therefore a few moments were pretty much,therefore it 's not so obvious
1,there is no plot no real characters or no story,there are so many funny parts that i 'll take over
1,her character was just too much for me,her acting career is so bad that you feel
1,still i was a little skeptical at times,still i do not recommend this movie if you
1,who would n't want to make a movie,who cares if the film was made in the
1,halfway through the movie you get one of the best characters to come up in the last 5 years,halfway through this movie you 'll find yourself wondering what happens in the movie the main character is just a
1,although i have read many comments about how the movie is a bit dated the acting was pretty,although this is n't the first movie i can remember i think i 've seen it all
1,anyway i would n't have given it a lower rating,anyway i was a little surprised at how much i hated
1,the film opens with a bang in the coffin and a scene where the two protagonists have their,the first time i saw the film i was a little skeptical of the first two movies
1,newton plays the character with the right blend of charm and humor,newton has a lot more to do in the picture though the film
1,as for the movie it 's an okay thing but it has a good story and great acting,as i mentioned earlier that the movie has the same kind of feel that they did n't have in
1,one of the most underrated films i 've seen,one of the most enjoyable movies of all time
1,i think i would have given a better score as a film but there,i have never seen this show on tv but it is very funny
1,all of these scenes are the most important part of the whole movie,all this is happening with a few exceptions of course but it 's still
1,no one else has ever been so convincing but the script was awful,no real story no character development and even a bit of the dialog
1,i would say that i would n't want to watch the entire movie,i have n't seen the show yet so i do n't know what it
1,the story is n't that bad either,the acting in the movie is so good
1,in this film i have to admit that i am a fan of hers so i was disappointed in seeing this,in the end it 's not as much fun as the previous movie but it 's a little too long
1,this movie is not the best movie,this is not a bad film
1,throughout the movie there are a few moments in which the two are in danger and they are all together,throughout the movie you are reminded of the old west that 's not only about the only time it has the
1,personally i do n't think i have ever laughed so hard since this film is,personally i have to admit that i have n't seen much more than one
1,he was a very nice actor,he is also one of the finest
1,unlike the first movie i was n't expecting much,unlike a good film i 've read many of my
1,rather than the first film it would seem that the actors did not care about each other,rather than be overly sentimental and to the point of being a complete waste of celluloid and time
1,i think the movie is a bit slow at times but,i was very excited with the whole story and characters
1,i have to say that i was a little skeptical to watch this movie,i have to say though the acting is very good the story is a little
1,the story of the movie is so much better it makes the story more,the movie is a bit long in my life but in my opinion
1,and then there was some great acting talent that makes this film worth while,and the ending was so predictable that even a sequel could have been better
1,all the characters are all real and i love,all in all this movie is just awful
1,box office receipts were used to produce the original film,box office poison is a very good movie and has a
1,i think it has a good message but is not in the same ballpark,i do n't think this movie is meant to be an action film but its
1,if you want something to laugh at in your mind then watch this movie and,if you have n't seen this film you 're not likely to see this
1,with this film i thought it was going to be one,with a little more effort it might have been an interesting movie
1,aquaman is the most original film and it should be the same,aquaman is a film that you will watch for its entirety as it
1,jasmine was the first of the three but not the first,jasmine and the rest of the cast are the best actors ever
1,perhaps that 's just how the film works,perhaps that 's why they chose that it is
1,even the acting was bad and the special effects look cheap,even the usually excellent alfred molina as the conflicted man is a
1,teammate of the film 's cast and,teammate joe is a good guy
1,ace man was a good idea for a film with the usual,ace man was one of those films that was very bad
1,as for the movie it 's just a waste of time,as an example of his talent he should have gone back to
1,quite the film is not a complete disaster,quite frankly the film is a little slow at
1,the movie is a little long,the movie is a great piece of
1,i have to say that i did n't care for him but i really liked it,i think this movie is very much a rip off of the first two films of the
1,it is a film that has no heart and soul,it 's not all a good thing but it has a
1,the film 's only saving grace was the performance of the young lady as a boy,the script is a very simple one but the characters all feel as though they are just
1,spoiler ahead i 've been warned about the film but the film is so boring that i,spoiler ahead the movie is just a bunch of characters who are n't very convincing either
1,i saw the movie yesterday and i thought it was pretty funny,i was n't sure how much of a film the film was going
1,thus the whole film is so bad it,thus the movie is a total bore
1,spoilers ahead i 've been waiting for the next movie to come out of nowhere and i 've got,spoilers the ending of the film is a bit abrupt as well the plot is very confusing too
1,or the fact that the character was in love with one man who is n't the hero 's lover,or maybe the fact that the director is in his own right does n't even have a clear reason to
1,there is also a scene where the hero has a conversation with one of the men in a movie,there is an interesting and very interesting story of this woman who is married to a wealthy woman
1,i have a lot of problems with this movie as well,i was very disappointed and i had to go to a lot
1,i would recommend it as one of the most enjoyable movies in my entire family and i,i am a sucker for movies but this one is a waste of time and money
1,no one should know it 's a movie or a horror film and if the,no one can ever accuse me that he could be the greatest movie star
1,unfortunately this was a movie that should have been a major success,unfortunately there is n't a single moment that i would have given the
1,things like this are all so bad,things get really bad when he gets a
1,yeah the movie is a little over the top but it does n't work in the context,yeah the movie is a bit slow but it is very good and i liked it
1,not only do you get a movie that has been a,not that i would recommend this movie to the viewers
1,it 's all pretty much what the viewer would call a movie like the godfather and the lion king,it seems that a lot of people have been killed by the ghosts of a child and a girl named
1,this movie is one of the most overrated movies i have ever seen,this movie is a complete waste of time and a waste of time
1,like i said the whole plot line is a bit contrived and the story is so bad that they,like the other reviewer said this was probably one of the most memorable movies i 've ever seen
1,there was a lot of humor and some really,there 's no real character development at all
1,mark hamill is a good actor and,mark dacascos is great as always
1,as for the rest of this case i think it has,as for the story it 's a very good thriller
1,if they have the opportunity to show the audience the value of their own life this film will be much better,if you 've seen some of the recent tv series the series has a good plot and characters who are believable enough
1,this movie is a complete mess that,this is a very poor film
1,sadly the film is a mess,sadly this film has no redeeming qualities
1,as far as i know the story takes place in the same location as the original the movie and it has no atmosphere,as for the film itself it 's not a bad movie but it 's not as good as some of the later dtv movies
1,land of the ants is one of the most boring movies to ever,land and center are all very good and so are the characters
1,metaphor of what the bible was supposed to be,metaphor to the film for a long time
1,it is a shame that the filmmakers,it was like a home movie
1,for some reason i do n't know why,for the most part the movie is a very
1,i am sure that it will be a good idea but the film does n't make sense,i have n't seen it yet but i still do n't think it has ever been made
1,every character in this movie is so funny they all seem,every single line every word was delivered by the director
1,some people say it 's a little bit dated but it 's definitely the best film i,some of the scenes are just too long and boring too long for a horror movie
1,it 's the kind of movie that has a lot of action sequences,it 's not a bad movie but a few of those things that make
1,holmes does n't even know what he wants,holmes is an old man who was killed by
1,why is this movie ever made in the first place,why did the main character have to go to a building
1,think of a better story than this film and the acting is very bad,think about the fact that they have to be a part of the cast and
1,as i mentioned above i have never seen such a great movie,as a result i was a bit skeptical of this movie and i
1,thus the whole thing is just pointless and not worth the,thus the film is not a total disaster at all
1,the movie is a mess of the highest caliber,the film is not about a single mother who seems
1,china is an excellent place as the film opens,china is a beautiful young man who is a man
1,this is a very entertaining film and one that,this is a good movie and it shows
1,not so much to say that this has nothing to do with the film,not to mention the fact that this film is the only film that has any
1,crash of the abyss is a good movie,crash is a movie about the power of forgiveness
1,that 's why the movie is a mess and the ending is so stupid and predictable that it,that 's how it 's supposed to work for me and the movie 's only good points
1,ruining all of the other comments and reviews about the film the plot is a,ruining the movie you will not regret that this is a film for you
1,there was some really good special effects and great fight scenes for the first movie but this time the movie,there is a scene with the girl and the woman who was supposed to be married in a bar
1,first it was a very poor script and it,first of all the acting was pretty good
1,they have the decency to be able to get their hands on a new one and then they get a job to help them find that there is a chance,they should have been given a better choice to have a movie that they had a good story but could have used the same plot and the same actors
1,also it seems a bit of a stretch to,also the ending is very abrupt and predictable
1,someone who is the real person of this movie should have done the same thing with the same name,someone who is n't a big fan of the book should have been able to read some of the other
1,his mother who has a crush on him as the daughter 's father who is,his acting was so horrible i almost choked my nails out of the screen
1,hitchcock 's film is a masterpiece,hitchcock 's films are always a bit
1,her character has an innate attraction,her performance in the movie was very
1,the only thing i liked about this was the scene where she,the film is also a complete waste of time to watch
1,but if it were a bit more interesting to have a,but then it is n't as bad as the first
1,in this case the movie is just a mess,in my opinion this show is so bad that it
1,i saw the movie when i was a kid in college and we loved,i am not a huge fan of the movies i saw this film
1,i was n't a kid i did n't have to watch this,i was so shocked that they made it to this film
1,the movie is a very good one,the acting is n't bad at all but
1,it 's a shame they did n't get to play the part that was supposed to be,it 's a shame that a film like this could have been released in its entirety
1,instead of trying to make us laugh,instead he is a good guy
1,so the audience gets to the point that the viewer is left with something that 's actually just a bunch of random idiots that seem to have just,so many of these movies are so stupid they do n't even have the decency to be funny and i think they should have made it more
1,i do agree with the comments on this movie that it 's not even good enough,i was a bit shocked to find this a little odd in the first place
1,why not a film that is n't so much,why not just go for the ending to the story
1,but this is not a movie for people who like the,but the movie is n't so bad it 's good
1,although this film is an insult to the genre and a great film it is,although the acting of the characters is n't bad it 's not really bad
1,there are so many of us that that i,there are also some good points of dialogue
1,the film has a lot of plot and has a good cast and a lot of fun,the movie starts off slow but then the movie degenerates into one of the most boring films i
1,bender the movie was made by the critics who wrote the book and it was very good,bender is not a film about the evils of violence but a very good movie for the most
1,i do not remember seeing the original film in the theaters,i was expecting something like that in the first place and it
1,this is a good movie with great performances and some really good action,this is the first of three movies that i 've seen in my whole
1,action packed and very funny and it is a shame to have,action fans are a fan of horror film and action sequences
1,there are several moments of the film where the film has a very very very long shot,there was no way the plot could have ended and it was n't a great idea
1,a movie about a man who has a dream on the world,a lot of people are talking about the film and its a shame
1,now i can get my hands on something that is a great deal of fun in my opinion,now it 's all over the place and is just a little bit of an excuse for the movie
1,i saw the movie at the sundance international film festival in 1995,i 've watched it several times and still have to be one of
1,he is n't a great actress but he was just plain funny,he does n't get the job done but he has a few things
1,the film is also very funny and it 's very entertaining,the first time i saw it was when it was on my
1,it is a very good movie and should have gone to,it is a movie that is a joy to watch
1,when the young man is kidnapped and he is killed by a man he escapes from the clutches of a,when i first saw this film at the cinema the film was released on video in the late 1980s
1,it is the story of a girl who has,it is a very good and funny movie
1,kenneth branagh was also the most impressive character in history,kenneth branagh is also excellent as the villain and the movie
1,what is the deal with the rest of the movie,what was more shocking was that the film was shot with
1,or the real reason why it 's such an enjoyable movie,or the fact that the movie is set in england and it
1,despite all the hype this movie has got a good cast,despite a great cast and a good script it 's still a
1,it was a waste of time and money,it was not so much in the case of
1,today we 've seen this one before,today i am a bit of a fan
1,it 's not a bad movie just a few minutes later but it still gets,it is a pity that such a talented filmmaker has never given a role
1,the acting is horrible the directing is awful and even the acting is poor,the story is a bit confusing as the characters seem more like each other
1,certainly the worst film i have ever seen,certainly it could have been much better
1,the only thing good about this film is the way the movie,the film 's story line in this case is very interesting
1,i have been watching the film for years to come,i was very impressed to see a film that was made
1,somehow the film is n't as bad as a movie,somehow i would have liked to have this movie
1,really the story is a little farfetched,really it was a movie made by a
1,i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good movie,i 've just seen this movie on a friday afternoon and it is
1,first off i'm a huge fan of the book,first of all i do n't know how this movie
1,i do n't think i 've ever seen the film that has a detrimental impact,i would have liked to see it again if i have never seen the original
1,if they had had the money to do that then,if you have n't watched it please see it
1,this film was made on a shoestring budget but in my opinion is a very good movie,this movie was so stupid that it 's hard to watch it over and over again
1,as far as tv movies go i was very impressed to see a good film in the series but i was surprised by that i was surprised to find that this movie had nothing to offer,as for the rest of the cast it 's a little too much to be judged by the fact that the story was n't even original and the acting by the whole cast was pretty poor
1,these are the two most annoying movies i have ever seen,these two films have a lot of good actors and they have
1,wow if you are a fan of the first film or,wow i am going to be a little more forgiving
1,let me preface my comment on how this,let us make the film for you
1,if you 've seen it already and you have seen it on the scifi channel i suggest you do n't miss,if you 're not a big fan of any of the characters i would suggest this film to be appreciated
1,the film was so poorly made it was a waste,the acting is terrible and the writing is atrocious
1,respect me for a lot of the movie and i think it should be a lot more fun to watch a,respect me for the sake of being able to suspend your disbelief and do n't waste your time on it
1,the first time i saw this movie,the film is a total mess
1,most of the film takes place in a small town in which they have been taken with them,most of the time you ca n't help but smile at the screen as a person who just does
1,or at least it was a little bit more fun,or maybe it was because there were no big names in
1,the film is very funny and i have seen it many times,the acting is so bad i do n't know what the point of
1,the story line was very interesting and very interesting,the movie does boast a lot of nudity but that
1,but the film is very good,but it is still a very good
1,did anyone else notice that it would be a,did he have the power to do it
1,what i really liked this movie for,what was that all all about
1,where do you begin with that,where is the director who thinks that
1,a few years ago i had to watch this movie again,a few years after watching this film i could n't stop thinking
1,his performance is so bad it 's laughable,his character is a stereotype of a family member
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen,this movie does n't do a whole lot of good
1,it is an excellent film with great performances by streep and zellweger,it 's a pity that it was not released theatrically on dvd
1,well worth watching and i 'll keep you entertained to,well it was just a bit of a mess
1,some of the scenes were quite disturbing and some of the scenes in the movie are quite well done,some people do not want to be a little more intelligent and the story is so bad and the jokes
1,if you are a fan of the book i would recommend it,if you do n't believe me you will enjoy the movie
1,timothy spall plays the lead character in this film,timothy hutton is one of the finest actors of all
1,the only thing to say about this movie was that it was a waste,the film is a little slow moving but also in a humorous way
1,however there 's a very good story involving,however it is a good family film
1,but the rest of it is really just another lame,but i was very disappointed with the end result
1,i have to say that i was surprised that this was not a film that,i do n't even know what it was about the plot of the movie
1,at the start of the movie he is the one who is a loner,at first the film has a very bad plot but its a good idea
1,over the top this film is a bit of a disappointment because there really is n't a single redeeming feature of it,over the years i 've never watched it but the movie is just as bad as i 've remembered the acting
1,while it was n't as much of a joke that it was a little bit,while it is not a comedy it is a comedy which is a shame
1,if you like this sort of movie you 'll love this one,if you have n't seen a few movies that you have n't seen
1,i do n't know how it ended but what happened,i was expecting to be entertained but i found it very
1,he is not a bad guy and his acting was n't bad,he does not even try to get out of trouble or at least
1,the acting is pretty good for the time but the film is pretty poor,the only redeeming qualities of the movie was the ending which was a complete copout
1,it 's a shame that the film has no real redeeming features,it was a nice surprise to get back to this film and i
1,wow this is the worst movie i 've ever seen,wow you do n't want to be a good horror flick
1,it seems a lot of things are missing the point that,it 's like watching a film in a cheap way
1,in the end the film is a total dud,in fact i think the director should know how to
1,mr blandings 's character was so annoying that we could n't even,mr and mrs the woman who was married for the crimes
1,everything about it is a joke,everything that i can remember was a
1,with a cast of unknowns it is a pity that the script was n't,with that said the film is a little too long to be funny
1,sanjay mcdowall is a revelation as the,sanjay dutt 's performance is perfect
1,this was not a good film,this movie is a real treat
1,i have not yet read the books,i would say that this was the first
1,the plot twists have more holes than swiss cheese the first one,the story is n't bad the acting is worse and the writing is
1,there 's a lot of sex and violence in it,there is a scene of some of them walking around and
1,another example of how a director should be given the opportunity to see the movie again to see how a director could have achieved the same story and the same,another reason to watch a comedy is that you have the feeling of having a little kid who has been in trouble with the other girl from the beginning
1,it seems a little too convenient for the first half and the film does n't even get as much attention,it 's also not very funny but it 's a nice little comedy which does not make you laugh
1,le boucher is a wonderful movie that has some good actors but the story,le cercle rouge is a very good film but it fails to deliver
1,at the same time a man is a woman who 's been raised in the past of the world and the man who is being transported by her father is killed,at times it is a bit too long for me to realize that it 's not as good as that of the others but i have n't yet watched that
1,barmak was a master of the art of filmmaking and art,barmak was not the least bit of a master in this film
1,with the exception of a few of the actors in the movie they are not bad,with the exception of the great music the movie is n't a very nice one at all
1,but this is not the case with the movie,but the film itself is not the worst of the
1,sure the movie was a complete failure,sure there are parts where the film is
1,and the film is a very good,and it 's a great shame
1,here 's a real stinker for me this movie is so bad it,here she is a young man who is a very human person
1,but the real thing in this film is a story that does n't make sense and is about how it 's,but the film is not as good as the first one but the movie is a little slow at times
1,that was a great movie that had a,that 's not the only redeeming qualities
1,then there is the scene where he goes into a coma to retrieve a car,then again the film was n't so bad and i was bored at all the horrible
1,an example of what was wrong with the movie,an american werewolf movie is not only that good but
1,john ritter is excellent as the villain in this film,john huston was great as always and his performance is great
1,i think you should see this movie,i am amazed that it has received such
1,come in and you will get the feeling that you 'll just be able,come on you can find yourself in a way to watch this movie
1,watanabe was n't as good as some of you and you 'll see his work,watanabe 's film is a very well written film of a man 's life and his
1,perhaps the only reason i can see for the film was because i saw the movie as an example of,perhaps it was a good idea to make a film that does n't make a profit to the story
1,however the only reason i watched it was to see,however i was a bit disappointed in the end
1,i do not want to give anything away but the plot line and the performances are all excellent the,i am not a fan of the genre but i 've always been a huge fan of hers
1,from the moment the movie starts you 'll find yourself rooting for the characters and sympathize to each other in,from a very good start i found the whole thing to be a complete waste of time and money
1,and what is it with most people with a sense of humor,and then there is the fact that the story of a young woman
1,is the movie supposed to be a comedy,is it the best of all things in the
1,i have to admit that i am a fan of the series and the film,i was surprised that it was n't nominated for best picture but it was not
1,how the hell could this movie be so awful,how can you go wrong and have the courage to
1,some of the scenes are just ridiculous but it 's a great movie for,some of the jokes are funny but the film itself is pretty lame
1,the plot is simple enough but the script is a mess,the acting was so bad the characters seemed like a bunch of
1,you know you 're in trouble when the movie is n't funny anymore but it 's not that bad and,you can get the feeling that the director was trying something new but it 's just a boring movie
1,again it 's the most boring of the whole film,again he gets the girl to go out of town to
1,however it is also the best of the three,however the acting was n't all that bad and the
1,that was the most stupid and stupid part of the film,that 's what i call a movie that is not a movie
1,nowhere as a whole i was impressed with the fact that the,nowhere that i would have given up on the first episode
1,since it has been released by the director of the original film this is a movie that has,since there is no story to the film its the characters that are so real and real
1,you can see that there will be more about the characters and the situations,you can see that a film made about a hundred years from a different angle
1,she 's the one who is n't the girl that killed her,she does n't get a chance to see him in a film that
1,jason statham was the best thing about it and he was really good in it,jason lee 's character was so stupid it was impossible to identify with him
1,it is n't even that the story is a complete failure,it is n't really that good or anything it 's good to
1,i was expecting a great movie but i could n't believe how,i do n't want to give away any of the plot
1,there are some funny moments though and the characters are so stupid that it makes you angry,there was a scene in which we were talking about the film and the scene where the hero
1,you will probably enjoy this one as well as the ones that are the first two,you have to take the camera in a way or two to the camera work
1,what a horrible film this is,what i got is a story that
1,may contain spoilers the movie was a little slow,may be that it was made at least for the
1,i would recommend it to people who,i have n't read the book
1,watch the scene where the hero is forced,watch out for any other horror movie
1,and it 's also the same old movie from that same old same school,and the film 's main character is a bit too old but he 's really
1,low budget b western stars and a pretty low budget but that 's what makes a film good,low budget movie that looks like a bad student 's movie with a lot of money and lots and
1,the acting is n't as good as the first one but it is n't bad,the only real flaw in the story is the casting of a bunch of characters who
1,i have n't been in a coma for ages,i do n't know if i can get a good
1,a very bad movie that i have not seen since it is a sequel,a few people who are so obsessed with the original story will find it hard
1,d'amato 's movie is the only film i ever saw,d'amato and his crew of characters are all very good and
1,this is one of the better movies on a,this is the worst of the worst movies
1,the first time i saw this movie i did n't know whether or not the film was a comedy or a,the acting was horrible the script was so bad i was bored by the film and the acting was atrocious
1,this movie is a masterpiece in which the characters are introduced to the camera and the characters are all,this was probably the most popular and funniest film i have seen since manos the hands of fate
1,and it 's just too bad that it would have been more,and there are several scenes that are n't even worth seeing
1,the film is not so bad as the other two and the only thing that is worth noting in this film is the scene with the mother and a,the movie is a great mix of both genres and the most beautiful movie about an aging man on the brink of the madness and the love story
1,this is a great movie for kids,this is one of the worst shows i
1,it 's a good story but not very good,it 's a very good film that is not only
1,when it first aired i was in for a great surprise i had to watch this,when i heard of it and the movie itself was so funny i had n't been able
1,i was very surprised at the end when he was,i was n't really expecting any of his films
1,not to mention that the movie has no meaning,not even that one can save you from watching the
1,he is also a good actor but,he 's not even remotely funny
1,one of the best movies of the last 50 years,one of her most famous movies in which the main character
1,we 're supposed to sympathize with the characters,we do not get it on a second viewing
1,about the only thing i did not like,about this movie is a good film
1,sam neill 's character is so good it is a shame that the show was made,sam peckinpah has created a film that does n't have to be seen and it is a
1,further the movie is a very good one but it 's not as bad as the,further it is a film that has to be seen to be believed by all
1,i have been waiting for this movie to finally come across a movie with so bad,i would n't have been so offended if they had been shot on a train station and
1,check out the film and see how the director and writer were making this one,check out the film if you can get it and you 'll never see a movie
1,his acting and the script is great but the script is very bad,his acting is a bit stiff but the story is very solid and the
1,not only is it an attempt to make a statement about a movie that fails miserably,not to mention there is a very long line to the film in one of the most
1,while the movie was n't as bad a movie as this movie it certainly does n't have any of its charm,while the film may have been an enjoyable experience of a good story it was just a bit too predictable
1,terry and june are all together and are not afraid to make a living,terry gilliam does a very funny cameo in this movie as the lead character
1,it is one of those movies where i have a headache at me,it 's a shame that this has n't made much of a cult following
1,it is the most interesting film i 've ever seen,it 's a very sad movie and a good idea and
1,daniel and his buddies were a bit more annoying,daniel auteuil as the head of the group is a
1,i am sure it was a movie about a woman who had a good life and was in a way toward him,i would give this show a 9 but the only thing i do not give it was that it was a total flop
1,the movie has its flaws but the acting is n't as good as i would have,the only thing to be said is to say this film is a little overrated
1,in fact it is so obvious that it 's difficult to make a movie about it,in fact i do n't have any complaints that the director has a vision of his own
1,let 's get a few lines that i think it 's fair to say,let 's face it the story is about a young man named cesar and his
1,the only thing missing was the story of how she went and how she became her friends,the film is a very good film and the film follows a very interesting topic of racism
1,well the first thing i remember was that,well i 've seen some bad films
1,usually i would n't have had a clue about this,usually i think that the film is very good
1,for those who want to see a film i 'd watch,for some reason the writer did not even have to make it
1,given the choice of the actors in it they are not very likable or even a,given the subject matter in this film the characters do n't have much in common
1,is this movie about the same kind of person as,is it a matter of time to come back
1,it has no logic and it 's not,it 's a great movie to watch
1,carradine is a good actor who is always a very bad actor but his performance here is very poor and he makes the film seem to,carradine was the most popular actor in my life but the movie did not even have the feel that a lot of other actors had
1,my favorite was that i could n't see the ending,my advice to all this is a good one
1,my favorite part is when the girls and the girl are chasing the girl and then,my favorite character was the one who was the father of the mother and son
1,but then you get a lot of the movie,but the film 's main focus in a film is
1,he is a man of sorts who is n't even aware of the existence of a man who can only get his,he is the only character who has ever played the role of an alcoholic or in any other form of comedy
1,now it 's a bit of a mess and a little too long,now that i 've seen the first one i think i 'd like this
1,funny and interesting in its own right,funny and poignant the film is n't even
1,i have been waiting for a good movie to have,i was n't even born to watch this movie
1,the movie itself is about a group of men who,the acting is terrible and the script is awful
1,user has to say that i have a feeling that a film of this kind would have been made to a better career,user is n't the type of movie that should have been so good for a laugh but in a very short time
1,all in all a very entertaining movie but,all in all a very good film
1,nothing happens to you in the end but you do n't,nothing new or exciting in this film and nothing more
1,when i saw her in the credits i was n't expecting much from it,when the movie is over you will find yourself laughing hysterically and you 'll be
1,that said i think the director did,that is what this movie is
1,then there 's a couple of things wrong with this film,then we have the token and stupid character who is the main
1,it 's the story that makes the movie a little bit of a thriller but it is definitely worth watching,it 's a pity that the film 's failure to be able to get the recognition of the production company
1,this movie is so bad i ca n't believe,this movie is so bad it 's good
1,george lucas 's direction is quite good and the music was great,george sanders does a good job in the role and does a great
1,overall it 's a good movie and i hope to see more from him,overall the film does have some good moments but the film is n't really a
1,anyway if you want to see an actual movie about a killer snowman then this movie was a,anyway i am not a huge fan of movies like myself this is a very funny movie
1,but i was n't surprised to see how much it was made for a movie i had no expectations,but that was the only reason that i watched this movie because i could have done it better
1,so much for you and your kids,so i am going to go to the
1,the film 's story is told in flashback sequences and is a great example of what a movie can,the story is so ridiculous and so contrived that it could not make it a priority to preach
1,howl is the kind of film where all the actors are involved,howl is the only thing that has ever been done before
1,he plays a man who is a very rich and humble person,he is a little more realistic and his character is so much more
1,well worth a look for all the actors who can act,well i did n't get it i did but it 's very
1,there 's a lot to enjoy here,there 's not even a single character in
1,although i 've heard some of them in the past i was looking forward to seeing this movie,although i think they should make the film a bit better there are some scenes with little dialogue which
1,maybe it 's the director and writer of the movie and i 've,maybe the director is n't trying to make a point about it
1,but the film also shows what a great director this is for,but if you like the original you should see this one
1,it 's also an enjoyable film that has some great acting by the stars,it 's a movie with a great soundtrack that makes it worth watching
1,fred astaire plays a character of a man in a suit who is trying to make the most of her,fred williamson was a great actor and i have n't seen him do a very bad job of acting
1,it 's like an animal movie but it does n't,it 's not the most important film of the last couple
1,should we not see the movie for the,should we not have seen them all
1,anyway the plot is n't a bit of a comedy,anyway it is a good idea for a film to be
1,there are a few good things here,there were no more plot holes
1,the movie is a little bit of fun but there is a little bit of,the film is a little dated but the story does have some good moments
1,easy to understand this is not a good movie by any means,easy to believe it was made by the director of the movie the
1,brought together a very good story,brought to you the movie and then
1,i was n't really sure if i was watching a movie or a thriller,i was hoping that it would get better and that was the reason
1,they are the kind of people that should never be allowed to act,they are not in the movie and the actors are all very bad
1,this movie is a complete waste of time,this movie was a very good one
1,regardless of the lack of talent in the cast this film has the ability and weaknesses of the original movie,regardless of the fact that it has a few moments it 's a little too long and it 's just too
1,finally i saw the trailer on the dvd at the local rental shop where it was released,finally a lot of people do n't care if it 's supposed to be a comedy or drama
1,how could the producer of the film be,how could this be a great movie
1,i 've read the novel and was surprised to learn that it was a film about people who could,i was so disappointed that i found myself asking myself that it would have been a good film
1,this film has a very good story line and the,this is a great film with a wonderful cast
1,myrna loy 's role as the ballerina was so good as to be a little too much,myrna loy is a delight to watch but she does n't seem very believable in this one
1,i am a diehard fan of david cronenberg films and,i think the movie is just a good idea
1,unaware that he was trying to get back to the old west he was a little bit more than a year later,unaware of the fact that a movie like this can never happen and it will make the viewer believe that it 's not
1,then you 're watching a bunch of kids dressed,then the film settles in a little more
1,i have seen the movie multiple times and i do,i do n't know whether to laugh or cry
1,while it is the only time i can think of that as a film i would n't be disappointed if it 's not that bad,while the film is not as good as other movies of the same ilk it is still a really good film with excellent performances from all
1,ben affleck has an excellent turn as,ben affleck is an absolute hoot
1,in the end i thought this was a good movie,in this case it is not a good film
1,and the ending is so ridiculous,and the movie has no sense to
1,predictable to watch this movie was made for the sole purpose of watching a movie that was not even close to being a masterpiece,predictable and contrived and i mean there 's no way that i could have done it again but it 's just so bad that you
1,sure there was a lot of sex in the film but i guess the movie had a lot of potential to be funny,sure he 's the best actor in the movie but he plays his role very well and plays a very believable part of the
1,she is n't a bad movie she 's not just a bad actress,she is a very good actress but she 's too much for her
1,it 's a very funny movie,it seems a bit rushed for him
1,will we ever get back in the future,will smith plays the role of the young man
1,this movie has been done so poorly that we get,this one does n't really deserve to be seen
1,i am a huge fan of horror films,i would n't say that this is an excellent
1,i am glad i did n't watch the movie,i 've watched this movie several times and still enjoy
1,he 's also the first of a lot of problems,he 's not a bad guy at the end
1,the story of this movie is very simple and very funny and i think that the director has been,the movie has a good pace but it does n't seem to be that well it 's not
1,some of the acting is terrible and the acting is just bad,some are not as much to go and say the story is n't
1,so it is a little bit to say,so why did he keep the movie
1,a movie like this should have been put down in this context,a movie with a few laughs and a few laughs at it
1,however it 's the best of its kind and is one,however it does not really matter to a certain degree
1,well i think you should see it if you have n't,well this is what you 'd call a bad movie
1,all in all i would like to thank,all in all not a bad movie
1,and the film has a lot of fun in,and the movie itself was pretty funny too
1,spoilers this was a pretty decent movie but i really enjoyed it so much that i could n't believe,spoilers ahead i was a kid with the movie and the other characters were n't even remotely funny
1,it 's not a very funny movie at all but still a fun one to watch,it was a bit of a surprise to see the movie in a way that the movie
1,that makes you feel like you 're,that is a lot of things
1,every time i see it i will always be my friend,every single person who was born with me was a real fan
1,dialogue wise but this is n't one of my least favorite movies,dialogue is a lot more subtle than most of the other movies of
1,also the movie was shot in a,also the film was very good
1,and the whole thing was so boring and stupid it was funny to watch,and i was surprised to find the whole thing to be a very good thing
1,its like it was made in a very,its a movie with all the actors
1,the script is full of holes and the script is a little too,the plot is n't too bad as it is a little thin
1,she is not a good actress,she was n't in the original
1,the first film was great and the acting,the story is simple but very interesting
1,now i know that this movie has some appeal but i have never really heard of it,now we have a film that has to be the most popular of the lot but the most
1,also the music is a perfect fit of music,also the film was a complete waste of time and
1,during the movie the only good thing is this movie,during this film i was n't expecting any more
1,given that the film was based for a real good idea and was not a good,given the chance i 'd have to be able to see this in a theater
1,this is a movie about a man who is a loner of a man who,this film is so awful that it 's almost impossible to make an embarrassment
1,i have never seen a worse film in my,i do n't know what it is about
1,earlier in the movie there is a little bit of the movie,earlier the story of three starcrossed brothers who go to a remote island
1,this is one of the few films that you will,this movie does n't make much sense at all
1,if you 're a fan of the original and enjoy this movie,if it was not for the fact that i was expecting a more
1,gable and his partners are not as funny as some of these,gable and dunne are very convincing and it is a shame
1,the plot is a bit weak but hey there are a few things,the only thing this film has going for it is the cast
1,urich 's character is so stupid,urich was n't so much a character
1,i have a feeling that it is not that bad,i have n't even been able to locate the original
1,the film was a little too slow but the story of,the movie is a little slow but that 's it
1,it 's a very sad film that should be shown to,it has a very good plot and a great cast
1,daniel daylewis plays the main character in the movie,daniel daylewis is also excellent in the role but i
1,each chapter has its own distinctive characters,each episode has a great storyline and an
1,both men do n't look as if they have been in a very similar relationship in,both the film 's detractors and the critics are all very interested in this film
1,now the movie is a good movie,now i was n't impressed by this movie
1,i do n't know how it would get any better,i saw this film when this movie premiered and i must
1,something like this was a huge mistake,something that is n't even worth the time
1,i do n't know if this movie will go on for hours but that is n't the reason that it 's so good,i have n't heard that 's all i can say about this film it has some flaws but is so bad that i ca
1,everyone involved in this movie is not a,everyone is entitled to say the least
1,i think the problem with this film is that it is so dull and so badly acted that it 's,i was really shocked that it got canceled after seeing it i can only say i have no idea
1,interesting characters in the story are the ones who have the power of the characters who are in love with,interesting but i was n't impressed with the film as it did n't have to be a horror film
1,all these years later he gets killed by a zombie,all in all this movie is a perfect movie to see
1,it 's a very bad movie that i would like to see again,it 's like a bad tv show with a lot of people trying desperately
1,not to mention that there was a scene in the movie,not so much of a plot as you can imagine
1,the acting was ok i did n't think,the story is not very complicated either
1,harris' mother has to deal with the loss of a new love and she goes on,harris' character has a very thick and loving personality that makes his life more sympathetic
1,i have seen it many many times before and since i love a good laugh but this is not one of those movies,i think i 've been a bit harsh since i was in my youth i have a soft spot for this film
1,but the real life and this one is n't as bad,but this is not a movie that is n't funny
1,two years later the girl 's daughter is kidnapped by the mother of a young,two things about this movie are the music and the music and the music
1,the plot is about four men who go to a house in the,the story is a bit slow and the acting is pretty good
1,as for the acting this movie is n't really a bad one either,as far as i am concerned i have seen the original film and the
1,when i watched it i thought it was funny,when i say the movie is bad i mean it
1,movies that are supposed to be funny but are,movies are not bad but they are bad
1,as for the rest of the cast i thought the script was very good,as for the rest it 's a good little movie that i do n't recommend
1,she has the most annoying accent of her life and the fact that she is a,she also meets in the film with the two boys and then she is killed
1,the acting is superb the characters are believable and the story is told through flashbacks,the plot is n't that great and the acting is n't really bad either
1,the film is also filled with flashbacks that are not really funny,the film is a very interesting and touching thriller about a group of
1,a lot of the time i have n't seen the film and if that 's what i would want to be,a few of the scenes were filmed during the day period and there was a brief scene of the young boy walking
1,add to that many things that do n't make sense but there are some good parts,add to that the fact that the actors and actresses make a movie they 're really really
1,chris benoit is a good actor as well,chris farley was a good actor but i do
1,hope lange is in the film and she has a chance,hope that you get a chance to see it again
1,times square and a lot of the same,times of all the actors are great
1,strong and powerful characters with likable personalities,strong and interesting but it was just too
1,wow i think it 's a good movie,wow i ca n't say i was impressed with
1,after seeing this film it is difficult to understand why this is not considered as a classic,after watching this movie i had no idea who this was and who the real people were
1,these characters are not caricatures or personalities of characters,these are the things i love about this flick and
1,it 's a shame that the movie has n't been released on dvd,it 's not a good movie to me that this is the best way
1,i am sure this film could have been a decent movie,i was a bit confused that the film would be as good
1,grey city was a great film about a young woman who has a daughter who was a little more than just a normal woman,grey owl is a very funny film about the struggle between the brothers and the parents of a group of friends and how they live
1,as with most movies that have never been released in the,as a result the movie is a bit too slow
1,i have to say that i was so disappointed when i saw it,i have seen many other movies that have been made and have to be
1,letting the story speak and the characters develop the plot and story,letting it be said to be a bit of a spoiler
1,however there is a bit of a good reason for this film to work,however this is a great example of a film which makes you question the meaning
1,some of the acting is ok,some of them were n't even funny
1,why did i even bother to watch it,why does the main protagonist get to be a
1,yeah so i have n't seen any of these movies,yeah this is an old fashioned and interesting movie
1,naturally the movie is a bit too,naturally they are not even funny
1,the film is very well directed by joseph andrews,the only reason i gave it a 3 was because
1,there 's some really good fight scenes and plenty of cool stunts but they just do,there are a few moments that are really great but the acting is so bad
1,what makes it so great is the acting,what is the deal with the girl
1,i saw this movie in the late sixties and it was a waste of my time,i 've seen the first few movies and i was very disappointed by the movie
1,plus it was not a comedy,plus i do not want to spoil
1,thus the movie is a bit slow moving and not very good,thus the story was very very very predictable and the movie just left
1,i saw this movie at a film festival and i have to say its one of the best,i have to say that i have been in a very good mood to watch a movie
1,it 's a great piece of entertainment,it 's the best of the series
1,molly ringwald as the mother of a rich girl is a bit too young to play and the film is,molly ringwald plays the part of a mother who has to deal with a traumatic relationship between his parents
1,mugs to the camera as if the director had done the movie for some reason it,mugs of the actors the actors are all fine and they 're all very believable
1,the story of two sisters who are sent to investigate the,the plot is very interesting but not the best thing
1,a good idea of a film is the acting,a film about a young woman who is a young
1,the first half of the film is a complete ripoff of,the acting was so bad it was funny to watch
1,george clooney is a good actor but he does have a few good things to say about,george brent is great too and he 's a great actor but his acting is horrible
1,it 's a good family movie that should be seen by everyone who enjoys watching the likes of the first movie,it seems that a lot of people have been conditioned to do so but this has no real connection to the book
1,the plot is a simple one with a group,the film is a complete waste of time
1,as the movie progressed the ending became a little abrupt as was,as i said in my comment this was an excellent film
1,beside that it is a movie that should be seen by all,beside the first of the three thirds of the series i felt that
1,this movie has a very good story and the story was very interesting,this movie was one of the worst of the year 's movies of the
1,a very interesting story but not enough to save the story,a film about an aging and resilient man who is not a
1,i'm sure there is an explanation for all of these people who have been,i'm sure that this film is just the right thing to do n't
1,give it a chance because it is n't that bad,give me the impression that it does n't take itself too
1,and i do not know what it was like,and then you see the end of it
1,he is a little nervous but he never really seems to have been able to pull it off,he is the kind of man that has no qualms of the situation that are made in the first
1,ordinarily it was very difficult to find a movie that did n't have the decency or,ordinarily i did n't see that any film in this movie was anything but good
1,of course they are n't all that attractive and it,of course the film is a bit too short
1,jason statham stars in this film and he 's a pretty good actor,jason schwartzman plays his character in the first movie and the film is n't
1,also in this movie are the characters,also there is some great acting talent and
1,i would like to see more movies that have,i was n't impressed by any of them
1,without the benefit of the doubt this is one thing that i would,without the sex scenes in the movie the acting is pretty poor
1,i would n't have had to have made my own conclusions,i have n't laughed so hard since that was the only film
1,if you 're not a fan of the original you may want to check this one out,if you 're looking for the worst film i 've ever seen this was the one to watch
1,during the film there were a few laughs,during the first season we see a bunch of
1,i am not a fan of the show but this is a very good show,i was n't sure who it would really be as the movie is a little bit
1,i have been looking for a film that will not be missed,i do n't know if it has to be done by a group
1,until i was able to obtain the film i was a big believer,until then the movie is about as exciting as watching paint dry
1,the film is a little long for the plot,the acting and writing were good enough but the acting
1,also i was impressed at the end where she was trying to get the girl out of her head,also the story was not bad the characters were very believable and it seemed like they had to work for
1,he is a little too preoccupied with the story,he also has a lot more time than he could
1,his wife in the film does an ok job,his father is a very young man who wants to
1,it is a good movie but the acting by all of the characters is very poor and the movie is a bit boring at times,it 's a shame that the filmmakers did n't make the same movie twice as it did n't seem that the film was released on dvd
1,in the beginning we see how the people of denmark,in fact it was so good for a laugh
1,well it 's also a good thing,well i do think that this film was
1,now i can see how it 's a,now this film was shot on tv
1,the first thing you notice about it is that the characters in the show are just,the first thing that was wrong with this movie is that there is no suspense
1,it has all the elements of a good film and a good one,it 's like he 's trying to make a movie that is a little
1,since the movie was a little too long for the director it was made in the early 90 's,since i was a little too old to play it in my head i still think that this movie is
1,it is a good story that should never have been made but the story itself,it 's just a shame because this is what makes the movie so unique
1,a great movie for a rainy night,a movie about the holocaust that is a
1,bimbo plays a young woman whose husband is killed by her husband 's daughter and her son,bimbo is the one who gets her kit in the end but it turns out she 's been
1,as for the acting it 's really good,as the series progresses from the first film the
1,totally different from the usual suspects that have been in the us in the first place,totally unbelievable for the most part i found this movie to be a complete disaster
1,the acting was n't too bad but the plot was a little too predictable,the acting is so terrible that the film is a complete waste of time
1,and the scene where he is supposed to be the main,and it is the only real drawback of this movie
1,and the movie is about the family and how their family is in love with each other in an attempt to get the,and the scene where she has the most beautiful scene in the whole movie and i have n't seen the first one
1,maybe the reason i gave it a rating of 4,maybe the director is going for a good movie
1,not to mention the lack of any kind of character development that is needed,not only is this film a very good film but i think that it 's
1,i would love to see a more mature movie,i have seen all the other films from the same
1,however there is no reason to watch this unless you do not have an inkling,however i would have to say this movie is a total waste of time
1,death wish 2 is a movie with no surprises and the,death bed is a film that i will never forget
1,it 's a shame that this movie has been released for,it does n't matter what the movie was all about
1,spoilers spoilers below the ending was the same as the first part,spoilers ahead this film is about a woman 's life and the world
1,nicely photographed by cinematographer john mctiernan and his cinematographer michael,nicely written acted and well written by the director
1,if you 're not familiar with the original and are a bit biased and have the,if you are a fan of the series watch it if you have n't yet
1,yes this movie was not good but it 's just not the,yes the acting is bad but the plot is pretty bad
1,though i 've never seen such a good movie on the shelf i ca n't stand this anymore,though it did have some flaws the acting was ok and the actors were n't too bad
1,wood 's performance is a bit too stiff for the role but the story is not,wood is a fine actor but the film does n't have that much screen time
1,have the filmmakers and screenwriters of this,have you ever seen the film
1,she 's so funny that she makes it difficult to get a glimpse into a character,she was a real actress but i do n't want to be too wrapped up in her
1,he was the most likable of the three characters but he is not the only actor to be,he also has the ability to use the old tricks of the same location which are used
1,dante is one of my all time,dante is a master of art
1,when the first episode of the original series was aired in new zealand,when i watched it i thought it would be a good one
1,if you do not have a clue about it you will see why,if they were to make a good movie about an ordinary person i would
1,given what i think of this film is the best way i can find this,given a few of the cast members i 've seen this show and have a few
1,unfortunately the script does n't seem to know what to do with the script and the script is n't as,unfortunately i was n't impressed with the ending and found myself wishing it would improve as the movie did
1,and the ending was really awful to me,and the movie has a few twists
1,i have n't read the book but it is a very good movie,i was surprised that the story of the film is so predictable
1,it 's not a bad thing that the film could get any worse,it is the kind of movie where all of the characters were stereotyped and
1,this is one of those movies that i wish i could watch and never forget but if you are looking for a,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i 've been watching it over a long time
1,screamers is a film of the highest importance it has to offer,screamers has no redeeming qualities but its just a fun and enjoyable ride
1,i think it 's one of the best films i,i was a bit reluctant to see this film
1,they should have made it a little more fun but instead they are left with a lot more questions that are,they do have the right to make the movie that the director and the director have chosen for the plot
1,little does he get the girl from a different situation but his dad is not really a bad guy,little of the acting of the film 's plot is a little uneven but the performances are very good and
1,it was a very nice movie,it has to be one of my
1,when i first saw this i was a little bit scared and disappointed by the movie,when the film is finished it is not even worth mentioning that you are not in for
1,by the time he arrives he begins to suspect that he is in love with a very mature person and has his,by the end of the movie i was just hoping that someone would have to be in for a real surprise
1,i have never seen a movie infuriated by the utter lack of imagination that made it such a classic movie,i do believe that the director of this movie was the most talented of the bunch to make this one
1,he is a great actor who is also,he 's just a bit too long
1,i was hoping to see something better but this was n't,i 've never been a big fan of the comics
1,except for a few things that made me laugh out loud,except for the fact the film 's plot has been written for
1,when they arrive and the two of them are talking they get the whole family,when i first viewed this movie i thought the movie was going to be a bit
1,this one is not for everyone,this is a very very good movie
1,she 's not even a great actress,she 's a woman in the film as
1,what 's with the other characters,what is this supposed to be a
1,it would be a shame to see a remake of this movie on a,it was n't that bad just for the sake of a bad movie
1,if you have n't seen this movie i recommend you,if i were to make it through i would choose to
1,gripes are the best i can say about it,gripes are the main reason i can think of to
1,the plot has to go to an old,the only real surprise was the ending
1,save yourself the time read on your own,save your money and do n't spend your money
1,the first is the first movie and is very very bad,the film is a very good and original film that i recommend
1,however the movie is just as bad as its bad acting and,however in the end the film is just a little dull
1,the film has an excellent ensemble cast,the movie is about a group of young
1,this is what i think a film like this is not,this is a great movie about a man who has a son
1,the acting in the movie is very good although i do n't blame them for that,the story was a complete waste of time i do n't know who is who
1,fortunately the movie is n't that much fun and the film,fortunately he has a lot of talent as a writer
1,there 's some good acting by john cusack and some of the other actors in the movie,there was a little more depth in that part of the story and that 's it
1,greg araki has an interesting cameo but i think the story is so much,greg araki 's first feature length films are the ones i have seen
1,while it is n't the best movie ever made it does a very good job of showing the true love,while the film has a great deal of humor there are some scenes that are very funny and funny
1,example the fact that this is a film is n't a problem but the acting the directing and the special effects make this a film that will keep you wondering aloud,example i would love to see more of the same old same actors but they do n't look like they were from a very high school project or they were doing something
1,honestly i would n't say it,honestly if you are a diehard fan
1,and the movie does an okay job of portraying the characters,and i do think i 'd like a good one and that
1,i was very impressed by the way the story unfolded in the first place,i have a hard time figuring out if this film is meant to be a
1,i would not say it is a bad film but it certainly has some good acting and,i think the director 's cut is the most important aspect of what is going on
1,it was a waste of film,it 's not just that the plot
1,yes the plot line has some holes and,yes this is a very good film
1,perhaps that 's because i have n't seen anything that has,perhaps this was the first movie i was looking for
1,the movie is a little boring at times and the acting is just a little,the acting is n't all that bad but the story is n't very original
1,expecting that you will be disappointed with the acting,expecting the best to come and the movie has to
1,makes no difference to the other two,makes for a very funny movie and if
1,after watching this i was surprised to discover that there was a good story and some good actors,after seeing the film and seeing some other films that are in the same league with a group of
1,the film 's story is not a very interesting one,the film was a complete waste of my time
1,the only thing this movie has going for it is,the movie was a complete waste of my time
1,i am surprised it 's been released,i do n't want to give anything away
1,one of the funniest films about the war,one of the best movies ever made and it
1,hoffman is one of the best actors in the world and,hoffman 's character is so unlikable and yet so stupid
1,he is a real artist and is,he was n't a good actor
1,it was so bad i was laughing out loud,it is a story about a young couple traveling to
1,i was surprised by this film,i think that it was n't a
1,different than a movie this is one of those movies that you should not,different things like it 's a dream movie that 's just plain silly
1,so the movie is not about the family of,so much of what happens in the movie
1,however the film is n't all that great and it is not the best movie that has made,however the movie 's story and characters are underdeveloped the story is simple and the plot is so bad
1,top billed the acting is very good especially for the lead actor,top notch i love lucy liu but this is not one of her
1,it 's just a fun ride in my book,it 's a pity it was n't released theatrically
1,after seeing the movie i was really impressed with the story which was the first thing that i,after a while the movie is just a bunch of random idiots who do a good job
1,mgm is n't as good in this movie as this one,mgm has made this movie in the us and in my opinion
1,not a good sign of this movie and it is not,not to mention the fact that the entire film is so bad
1, is not only an average film about the holocaust but a good, this movie is an example of how to create a film
1,to begin it is a great film that has the potential to be a good movie,to say this is about a movie i would not have seen would be a good thing
1,the story has the potential of a bad movie that 's not funny,the film is a bit slow but the characters are interesting and the film
1,it is very hard to imagine that the film makers are not trying to be serious,it 's a shame that it 's not even available in video format and is not available
1,but i ca n't say enough of,but this movie is so boring
1,but this is the most ridiculous movie,but it is a great movie
1,yes the movie is a little over the top but it 's not as good as the original it,yes there are moments of comedy that were supposed to shock but the actors were really really bad
1,missions and demons are n't very convincing as they have no sense of danger to the story,missions are not always the most important to any of them but this movie is a complete disgrace
1,i am so upset at how this film is so good and so far fetched that i just have to say that it did n't have a very,i have n't heard of this movie in my entire life i 've only been in the uk and i have been watching it countless times since
1,contrast with the original is the most beautiful scene of this movie,contrast to the story the characters were so interesting to watch
1,he has the most memorable scene,he has done a fine job in
1,in a scene where the camera crew has the ability,in a way that was not funny at all
1,but i guess that was n't the point,but the movie is a complete mess
1,funny but it 's still a good movie,funny thing about it is that it has so
1,the movie does contain a couple of nice shots but the acting,the movie was so awful that it was hard to watch
1,i was so disappointed that it was so awful,i think you should have had to wait for a
1,this is a great film for everyone who wants to see a good movie,this is a very funny movie and i recommend it as a great movie to
1,pardon me if this movie is a masterpiece,pardon me and leave the movie open to the
1,i saw this movie at the boston international film festival and it was the,i would n't even watch this movie if i could have done it
1,well this movie is a good one,well i do n't want to spoil the
1,what is the deal with the movie,what makes the film stand out is its
1,lolita is a movie that makes you want to watch it,lolita is a very very good movie that i will never forget
1,the plot was pretty simple and i could not wait,the movie itself is a bit slow paced and very poorly
1,this movie was so bad i had to turn my eyes in disbelief to watch it and then i,this was a really good movie and was n't a good movie but it definitely is n't bad
1,compared to the first film i have no idea how the movie ends,compared to the original the series had a very different plot line
1,it was just a movie to try and make sense,it 's a shame that the film has no real stars
1,either way it 's a great movie to,either way he 's the perfect person
1,it 's the story of a young woman whose life is shattered in her family life by a young and loving woman named lena,it is a great piece of cinema that will make you laugh and you will see it coming out of your wits for the first
1,when i was a teenager i saw a screening of my childhood and i loved it,when the two leads were murdered the police officers had a few seconds and no one cared
1,the acting is so good that they are actually funny and not just a bad movie,the film 's only flaw is that it does not seem to be a lot of other
1,what 's the deal with the guy who 's got to be the most annoying person i have witnessed,what 's even worse is the script itself which is so bad the acting is horrible the story is ridiculous
1,that said this movie has been released,that is what makes it work
1,the only good part was the one in which the girl is supposed to be,the film is a great vehicle for a movie but i doubt it is
1,leave the theater for an old fashioned and funny performance from the director who has,leave and right and then the rest of the movie is just plain stupid
1,it is not a documentary that 's not worth a second look,it was a little too long and i do n't think it was
1,and i was n't even a little surprised by the ending,and the fact that the film was made for tv is a
1,although this is the first movie i 've seen i can honestly say it is one of the worst horror films,although the movie does have a very strong story it does n't have to be a movie to have it
1,so the only thing that was missing,so what was it all about
1,her husband is a man who is n't afraid to go to bed,her husband 's daughter has been married to her son and is now in
1,this movie is about a young woman who has to get,this film was just too much for me to like
1,this movie was n't even worth watching,this movie has a great soundtrack and is
1,while the first film is quite enjoyable with many of the characters it is also the first time,while watching a few episodes of the series it 's not as simple and shocking as the original but
1,it 's just that i do n't know where the real thing,it was a great story and a good movie to watch
1,they are all very funny and it 's funny to see the same old man in a,they do n't know how to make the movie but they 're not really good either
1,6 the movie is not for all tastes,6 the film opens in one scene with two
1,i do n't even want to spoil it for you because it is a great movie,i think this movie is the best of all the lists of movies i have ever seen
1,it 's not as good as a few,it would have made a great movie
1,he also meets a young girl named melissa who is a,he was not a good man and a good actor
1,by the way i have no idea what happened when i saw this movie in the theater,by the time the movie started it was a little confusing but i found the ending to be
1,but the film has to go down as such,but if you do n't know how to handle the
1,try and find some good horror movies and you 'll have a lot,try and find a better film in this genre and not to say the
1,if the film is not bad enough they are all pretty good,if you want some fun and fun this film will probably be a
1,it would seem that the director was making an attempt to make this story and it failed miserably,it 's like the director was trying to make something more interesting and he just could n't care less
1,we are told why he 's the father of a man who has been raised by the death of,we get the impression that he 's the only actor in the cast who could have been better
1,in short it is very well done and well written,in the first half of the film the characters get into
1,the movie has a very good soundtrack and the music is very good,the plot is not that good but the actors are great especially alexandra warren
1,the movie is a good example of how not to make a,the acting was bad at first but the movie just sucked
1,it 's not a bad idea for a movie to be a good one,it 's also not the first thing that has n't been mentioned in the previous
1,the only real standout was the fact that this movie was n't even nominated for a award,the plot is so ridiculous and the acting is so wooden it makes the movie even harder to
1,even though i do n't think this was,even the music is not much better
1,it is the story of two men who have been married to a woman who has lost their husband and has the,it has a few laughs to it that i liked about it the first few seconds or so of the movie
1,in the end he 's a very bad boy,in short it was a very good movie
1,it is not that i am a fan of films but,it 's not even the worst movie i 've seen
1,my favorite part of the movie was the way the camera was so bad,my favorite line when it was in the movie was the ending where the hero
1,the film is set in a small rural village where the world of the,the plot is a bit thin but the story is told very well
1,meanwhile a friend and his wife are murdered by a mysterious woman and his daughter,meanwhile the man who kills the girl and her daughter who are now married to a
1,the plot is n't too bad either and there are so many things wrong with,the first time i saw this film i had n't seen the film before
1,also there was a very clever performance by the actress who plays the,also starring john hurt in another film about the same subject matter
1,i have n't seen this one since i was a young kid,i was really surprised to find that the movie has been a success
1,or the director who has a good sense of humor,or maybe they would 've been able to make a more
1,sincerely i do agree with the other posters that the acting in,sincerely i was surprised that this film got released on video
1,it 's like the filmmakers of the original show forgot it was just stupid because there,it 's a shame that they are not able to get out of the film
1,after a few minutes of the movie we are left to ponder what happened in the end,after watching it it 's hard to imagine that any film that could have made a better film
1,she 's not the only one to get a kick out of her mouth,she is the most likable character in the film so she does n't seem to
1,i would n't have to say anything about him but that,i have seen all of this movie in my time
1,i was expecting it to be a bad movie but that is what i 'd call the average zombie movie,i am not the only people on this board who have n't read it before and the film has a lot
1,in a way the movie is just a collection of scenes that are n't explained,in fact the movie is a lot of fun and a very good one
1,he 's also a great fighter in a film,he 's also not the least bit funny
1,all in all the movie is a great movie to,all in all i would recommend seeing this movie
1,i have a soft idea of what a film was made for the first hour,i think this movie is a perfect example of how to make a movie
1,that would be a good thing,that would be an insult to the
1,it 's a shame that this movie is not even available,it has the potential of the story of a serial killer that
1,but it is still one of the most memorable and enjoyable films of the year,but if you can get to the end this movie will make you laugh and say
1,i was n't impressed with the ending which was really disappointing,i think they should have done this a few more times
1,marcos has been living in his own home,marcos has to be a complete jerk
1,that 's the reason why this show was made,that was not a bad thing in it that is
1,although there is a few moments of the movie i can tell the story is not a comedy or a drama at all,although i have a feeling that this is not a horror movie there are many moments in it that are so funny that you
1,pip 's brother is also a little bit older than,pip 's character is n't the least bit funny
1,the story is about a bunch of teenagers who,the film is a little over the top
1,but that 's the only reason i can,but it 's not a good film
1,in this movie the main character is killed in a car crash to the police station in the beginning of the story,in addition the acting is horrible with a couple of bad actors in this one who are trying to get out of the
1,i have to admit this movie was great and i was really surprised with the acting,i saw this movie yesterday and it was one of the most enjoyable films i 've ever
1,the only redeeming value of this movie is the acting,the movie was made to be like a movie
1,time is very much a classic but it 's a great one that has a strong cast,time travel was one that could have been done better if it had been made in the us
1,the movie is a mess and is n't very entertaining at all,the first time i watched this i was n't impressed and did n't
1,i do n't think that a film should be made to entertain me about this travesty,i 've seen this movie a couple of times and i can understand why the critics hated
1,these were the two main problems with this movie,these were a couple of points in the film
1,hoping he would get a chance to make a better job in the industry as,hoping they would have given it a chance if it 's available on dvd
1,yet another thing is the film does n't seem to have,yet the story does a lot of the same things
1,although it 's not a total loss to see it at face value,although it does n't have the same impact that the movie has been there
1,i would love to say that there is a lot of things to,i 've been looking forward to this series since the first time
1,although he is not the only good character he 's supposed to be the main character he 's really the only person in,although it is a bit of an exercise in the history of the genre it is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie
1,what is with all the other posters,what a waste of this movie
1,the acting is so bad that i found it embarrassing to,the film is a good mix of action and thriller
1,but that 's not all i can,but this is n't the case
1,so the only thing to be said is that,so the movie does n't work for me
1,there is no reason to see the original movie,there is no plot or character development that is n't
1,it has a lot of funny moments,it was a complete waste of film
1,instead the film takes a little too much to figure out,instead of having an extramarital relationship with a person who was a
1,a few weeks later the young man is the only one who is able to get a job in,a very bad thing that this is one of those movies that you just have to see it
1,such as these two movies and a few good ones,such a good cast is wasted and i do n't think
1,i think he 's the worst in a movie ever made,i think this movie is a complete waste of time and energy
1,do yourself a favor avoid this movie at all costs,do n't expect the same kind of ending to this film
1,i would like to see some of the actors in,i would have been better off watching the movie
1,craig sheffer 's performance was excellent and the film was a bit like a comedy,craig freeman is a great actor but it is his performance that makes this film
1,i do n't want to spoil anything about,i think the film was very good
1,yet the real problem with this movie is that the actors and the actors are not really trying to make,yet i still think that this is a movie that i will watch over and over again and again
1,if you 're going to make a movie about the evils of war and,if you do n't want to see this film go see the original
1,i would recommend this to everyone who is a fan of,i do n't think it is the best of all
1,john goodman as the villain was also a good one,john carradine and his partner are both very attractive and very
1,he 's a little over a top secret of his wife,he also gets a little too excited and he becomes a good
1,a film like the original was n't even nominated for best picture,a few years ago i was looking for the movie on tv and
1,robert deniro is perfect as his father who does his own stunts,robert downey jr is the only saving grace in this movie
1,but it 's a good idea that 's,but this movie has no redeeming qualities
1,well i do n't think i 've ever watched this movie,well it has some funny moments and the humor is so funny
1,a good example is the scene in the,a film about the evils of war
1,incidentally i am not a fan of the,incidentally the film is a complete mess
1,it seems that the director and cast members are trying to get to this point in a different direction,it seems as though they were going to make a film about the aftermath of the vietnam war
1,morris and his friend are all very good,morris 's character is a little twodimensional
1,another thing is it has a few things to say about movies,another problem is that the film does n't have to have a very
1,when i saw this movie at a festival i had to be,when i watched this show i thought it was very funny
1,in my opinion i would have given up the movie,in the end it was n't a good movie
1,however i think i would be entertained by watching this film,however the only problem with the film is that it is not
1,as for the story there is a bit of suspense and a lot of action,as for the film i was a bit skeptical of how it is made and i
1,johnny is the most beautiful and sexy of all his films,johnny is a very good movie as a whole but it really
1,the film is not for everyone but the first half of the movie has nothing to do with the plot and the characters are not believable,the film 's plot involves two friends who are invited to investigate the mysterious disappearance of an old man and the two of their lives
1,i 've seen this movie many times and it is so bad that they just ca n't believe it,i have to disagree with another reviewer that said the plot was very good the acting was ok the story
1,this movie does not have any redeeming features to make it worth mentioning,this is one of those movies that you ca n't watch because of its
1,the first one was the best of the three,the movie is a mess from the start
1,the only reason i wanted to watch this movie was because the acting was bad,the only thing to really have is that it 's the first of a string of
1,it seems that a bunch of people have been killed and killed off with a deadly,it 's all in the same place as the old lady and the lion king
1,a good story line and a good story but i think that the,a good film to be seen but not enough to be entertaining
1,vancouver is an absolute disgrace as the film 's main character is a caricature of the young age,vancouver 's greatest strength in this film is a very small cast and a great supporting cast including john
1,brenda fricker plays a character that is not afraid to accept her,brenda vaccaro is the only reason to give it a try
1,the first part of it is pretty good but i think there were many things wrong with this one,the movie starts with the main character telling her how he is going to be so wrapped up in an
1,now we have a bunch of friends with a bunch of friends,now i am a big fan of the original and even the most
1,it is a great movie that i,it was a very good movie
1,the movie is a very interesting film about how people are going to work and work on the subject,the film also stars a young woman who is in love with one of her patients a woman
1,that 's the whole point of view,that would be a good idea because they
1,you will be surprised that the director 's commentary is so stupid,you can tell the plot was a good idea for a movie but
1,caution is a film that should be seen by anyone looking for a good movie but if,caution is not a good movie but i would recommend to anyone who enjoys the movies
1,scary movie 3 is n't a good film as it is,scary movie that has a few redeeming features like that
1,the film opens with a very strong climax which is so powerful and so satisfying,the movie is about a man who is obsessed with a murder case that goes on
1,the movie is n't even funny or entertaining,the movie itself is a very poor attempt at
1,in my opinion it is not a great movie,in the end it 's a movie you can do
1,an interesting film about the holocaust of the soviet union during a time war,an excellent performance by david suchet who is one of the best actors of the
1,the script is a complete mess,the story is so simple it 's
1,in fact i would have liked to have had more fun with the story,in fact i did n't think this could ever be a horror movie
1,unfortunately i was surprised to find that a lot of people were,unfortunately i think that the filmmakers were the best to come
1,this is the type of film where it is very difficult for,this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,in fact it 's a good thing that a film like that could be made,in my personal opinion it has been a very successful movie in my book
1,it is the story of a young woman who is a woman from the age of 16 and who lives,it 's a pity that they do n't have the same kind of film that i have not seen
1,he is not even funny at all,he has a nice body and a very
1,while the plot has a lot to live up to it 's flaws and the,while the movie does n't have a plot line the movie is very funny
1,but i was a bit disappointed with the plot,but the film has some very very very nice touches
1,while it was a long time since the early talkies were n't even nominated the oscars were on a lot of the production,while he does n't get it it 's very hard to find the right balance to be the first of many films and the
1,but this one is n't even that bad,but the movie is a very enjoyable movie
1,the only reason i even bothered to watch this movie was because,the only redeeming feature of the entire production is the music
1,the story revolves around three young men that have been married to,the plot is simple and very predictable to say the least
1,the film opens with a very nice scene,the plot is so simple and so implausible that
1,since he is a real good man he has the ability to create a new life of the world and that we can relate to it,since the movie is based on a play and the book and i do n't think it is a movie to say it is n't a bad
1,jennifer connelly is a good actress but she was so good in this one,jennifer tilly plays a young woman who is trying to find her husband
1,this film is the worst i 've ever seen,this movie was just a waste of time for the
1,as a whole i am a fan of the series so i am not a fan of the original,as for the story itself well it has a good script and a decent premise but it is a little
1,i 've never seen such a beautiful cast as i am not sure whether i should be,i have to admit that i have not seen a film that i have ever seen
1,the story is n't all that good,the movie is very very funny
1,this film should be banned by everyone who,this film had me laughing out loud
1,naturally the film does have the same effect on me as,naturally the film is a little bit of a disappointment
1,however i was not able to find any redeeming qualities at all,however as for the movie itself well it 's just not
1,i was so bored by this movie that i did n't even know it was a,i think it is a very good example of how a movie can be made
1,aside from the fact that it was not a total disaster,aside from that this movie does n't have a plot
1,then again he 's in the movie and the movie does a,then i was in a theater where the film was made
1,do the writers and producers do not make the film a,do yourself a favor and do n't waste your time
1,in fact it 's so bad it 's good,in the end he realizes that the world can be
1,then we have the token and unintelligent hero of the title and the girl,then there were the bad guys in this movie who are all the same
1,it 's a shame that the director,it is a very bad movie
1,this is an excellent film which has a lot of great actors,this movie is about a young boy who has been living his life
1,into my mind is not the only thing that makes it interesting,into this one is that the story of the film was so bad
1,there is a lot of action and the film does,there 's a lot of action in this flick
1,there is some very good acting performances but they are all very good,there are a number of funny gags that are supposed to be funny
1,just because it is not a horror film is just plain silly,just when you think it 's the best thing in the movie it
1,for the longest and most rewarding scene i have seen in the past,for the first half of the movie it was a great movie
1,the movie has a few twists that are n't so much to,the movie was very well made and it was very realistic
1,and then the scene in which a man walking around,and that 's the only reason to watch it
1,narcissistic and dumber the plot was so stupid that it was difficult to make,narcissistic characters are introduced by people who have n't been a real person since the
1,we all have a different view of the film,we have seen this film many times but i can
1,edward norton 's character seemed very familiar in the first two parts,edward brophy plays the father 's father and his mother and son is
1,we 're left wondering how much longer the writers are to,we all know the story and it 's so bad
1,the film is an exercise in futility and death and the final battle is a little slow paced,the plot is a bit of a clich one might have thought that the director could have been cast
1,claire forlani is one of the greatest actors ever to have the ability to convey a role as a young actress,claire danes plays the role as a woman of high school who 's a bit more than a little too old for
1,just the same thing over and over again,just as i was watching a film about the
1,is it a matter of the power,is that a matter of time and time
1,spoiler ahead spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead spoiler spoilers alert this movie is about two people who are killed and tortured by a mysterious psychopath,spoiler alert the ending was a bit too abrupt but i was surprised when i found out that this film was actually a sequel to the book
1,it 's a great film for the whole family,it is n't a very good film it is n't
1,a movie with a very good story,a very good film about a serial killer
1,the first time i saw this i was really impressed with the acting,the movie starts out with a bunch of friends going to a new house
1,after the war the war erupts,after the first half of the movie
1,this is the kind of movie that i,this is an excellent film to watch
1,in short it was a pretty decent movie that was not only the,in this respect it is the most memorable thing i 've seen
1,it 's not the worst movie ever made or even worse the worst of it it is not,it was the only movie i had seen that actually had something to do with the movie
1,with that said i would n't say this is an entertaining movie,with this film and the cast and crew the script is a real
1,best line about the movie is what the,best of all it is a movie
1,for all of you people you 're going to love this movie but do n't expect too much,for the most part the music is a little stilted and the plot is just too old
1,the movie is not a good film it is not even a bad movie,the only thing that kept me from turning this movie off was the way the
1,rather than a horror movie there are some interesting scenes,rather than a movie in this case the characters and situations
1,shots that make you want to see more of them get involved in the movie,shots are used as a tool to convey a sense of the moods of the story
1,most of the movie has to be the dullest thing i have ever seen,most of the cast members including christopher walken and michael douglas are so good as
1,yes i know it 's not a bad idea but i do n't really care about anyone,yes the film 's plot was a little predictable but the plot was so bad and the acting
1,really it 's a movie you 'll want to miss if,really bad movie with a few exceptions to the story
1,of course the film has a good cast with,of course it is a bit too long
1,russell is also excellent as his wife who is a bit too long too young to be too shy to be a good character and the acting was very,russell and his cohorts are in the same place but in a small time warp in paris it was not so hard on this day of the west
1,i am a big fan of the series of the series,i 've been watching the movie several times since it was released
1,they 're not even in the movie and the movie does n't make any sense,they have to make a movie with some great actors and this one is not a
1,i have to say that this movie really does suck the way the movie is set,i think the film 's biggest asset is how to make such a poor film
1,it has some great actors and some good moments but i do,it has a lot of potential and some very memorable moments
1,it 's a shame the writers could n't have been cast as the original,it 's not so easy to follow it to the point where you can see
1,as it stands it seems that there was nothing to make it,as for the movie itself it is a very enjoyable film
1,in my opinion he did a great job of showing the true love of his character and how he,in the end you 'll find that this is the most difficult to sit through the whole movie
1,i 've been a fan of the series for the last few months and this is the,i saw the movie in the theater and was n't expecting it to be a masterpiece
1,all i could think about was the scene where they were supposed to look like a cross,all of the characters in this film have been killed in the beginning of the movie
1,i do n't think that this is a bad movie,i do n't see what you do last summer and you
1,yes the film is set in ireland but that 's about it,yes he has a little bit of a fixation but he just ca
1,i am amazed that the director did n't have to,i think this should have been a good movie
1,it 's a shame that the film did n't have much to offer but it was a great movie,it seems that this film was filmed on the cheap backlot but the filmmakers decided to make an improvement on
1,the story is a little confusing,the film is about a group of
1,we get a glimpse at the nature of war and how we see a film in which a person,we get the usual bad of a bad bad joke about a guy who is a little boy
1,he 's a very funny person who wants,he 's just not a good actor
1,there 's a few interesting things in this movie that are n't even mentioned,there is a scene in which he goes to the police station with her and
1,this is a film about two people living in a different world where each other is different together,this movie is so bad that it is hard to describe the actors at this point in their lives
1,george romero was n't the first movie to show the world he was,george romero 's direction is the only highlight of this film as he is
1,marsh 's character is not funny,marsh is in this movie and he
1,mcshane is a great villain and i was surprised to see him,mcshane has a small role and the supporting cast is good
1,a few people say it 's not a,a good movie and an excellent one
1,having been a huge fan of any of my favorite horror movies i,having said that the film was a waste of time and money
1,great story line and good acting,great acting and wonderful direction and editing
1,kate beckinsale is a revelation as her character in an attempt,kate beckinsale was a very good choice for her part
1,george lucas is the best director in the world,george clooney is perfect in this film but he 's
1,i do n't know if that would be a good film if,i was surprised by what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish
1,how did the cops find the killer,how can you make a film like that
1,a film like this is not a,a lot of it 's humor
1,girls are not the only ones that can be forgiven and the plot is so stupid that it 's impossible for,girls do n't want to have sex with them or they should not be taken care of by the other
1,we are not talking about the characters,we get to see the first half of
1,i was really impressed by the movie,i do agree that i have to admit
1,set in a small town in the us this is a good movie,set in the present day globalization is a great story of a young couple
1,this show has been made by a bunch of children who are just not,this movie has a very low budget and is a very interesting movie
1,not only is this film boring it also has a couple of funny scenes,not a lot of the film has been cut down to a standard level
1,was n't it just a matter of the matter,was this movie supposed to be a spoof of the
1,on the surface the movie is very good,on the whole this movie was a good and
1,what a great movie a great idea for an actor to act and,what a great idea this is to see a very bad movie
1,am i a teenager with a heart of gold that 's so good,am i going to say that if you 're looking for a good movie
1,subsequently it is a film that you will enjoy watching,subsequently i have to say that this movie is a perfect
1,unfortunately i was not sure what to expect from this movie,unfortunately this is a very bad movie and i did n't know
1,and the movie is really bad,and the ending is a joke that
1,brian blessed has done a good job as well but he did,brian blessed 's acting was so bad that it was laughable
1,a very funny movie that i thought,a few scenes are pretty decent
1,the story is simple and the acting is pretty good especially from the leads who make the whole thing look good,the movie starts off with a very long shot of one person running around a desk talking at a door
1,washington 's performance is the only one who could,washington 's character was a very strong character
1,i 've never seen this one but it was n't a great film,i would n't be surprised if i saw this as a movie
1,and i think that the only thing this,and the whole thing was so predictable
1,a very funny and funny movie,a great movie with a good performance
1,i have n't seen such a good film since i had seen the,i would n't have bothered to see this one for a while
1,still this is definitely a film that you can watch and enjoy,still the plot is a bit too thin for a bmovie with the
1,i am not the only one,i was hoping that some of her
1,when i first viewed this film i was expecting something a little more,when it 's over you 're going to watch the same movie
1,along with this i have to say that i have n't seen it since,along with the great cinematography and the excellent cast this one does manage to keep
1,the script is not the worst of it 's problems but the acting is good enough,the story line was a lot better and it had a bit of humor but it seemed
1,a great cast including the leads and some excellent supporting players especially david warner,a lot of people say it 's a good movie but the acting and the
1,it is a shame that this movie is so bad that it 's not even good enough to be good,it 's not that i do n't think he is a real person but i think they 're going to get
1,the first half of this movie was very well done,the movie is about a guy who gets a job and
1,i have seen a lot of bad movies,i would recommend this movie to everyone
1,some of the scenes of the murders are quite interesting and the film 's plot is very strong,some of the other reviews i 've read about this film have made it a point to see this
1,it has the worst special effects i have ever seen on film,it has a lot of plot holes to do with the plot but
1,some of the dialogue is very funny but that 's just it,some of the actors and actresses do n't seem to work as a
1,both films are the best of the series,both the movie is very well done
1,we all laughed at our seats,we have a bunch of teenagers who
1,it was an accident in the world of war and it shows a great deal of compassion for,it 's not that we do n't like the original the way it was in this movie
1,though i have no idea what i would have thought,though the story is n't too bad it is still very
1,if you 're looking for a film about the holocaust and the troubles of war and remembrance,if i had n't been so impressed i 'd have to say the movie was good
1,both films have a great cast and are not afraid,both films are a lot more exciting to watch
1,so i guess the director and director of the movie had a different approach to it but they did n't even try to make it funny,so if you 're looking for a fun movie i recommend seeing that i am a fan of movies and i really enjoyed a movie about the
1,it is n't a comedy or a comedy,it 's like they just wanted it to end
1,i have seen this movie and i have to admit that i am not a,i would n't have bothered to write this review if i had not been
1,what is the point of making the film,what was the point of this movie
1,nick nolte is a delight as he is,nick nolte is a very good guy
1,randy quaid 's portrayal of an older man is a bit of an eccentric but somewhat likable character,randy hopper and john cleese are the only real stars and the film is so much more than a
1,my favorite part was with the girl who 's not going to get her husband,my advice skip this film and watch the film and you will be disappointed
1,for the first half of a long time the audience was laughing at the stupidity of the characters as if the filmmakers,for all i love the music and the songs of this one i do n't want to spoil it for you
1,the story line is about as good as the original,the story was so bad that it seemed almost tacked on
1,now that 's the only thing i,now this is a bad movie
1,this is a movie you 'd probably see,this is what you 're thinking of
1,in fact it was a good idea to make a sequel to,in fact the movie has a lot of action in it
1,to begin with the movie 's story is very good and the acting is quite good,to me i was not disappointed by the film 's lack of a decent cast
1,i saw the film at sundance and have heard that i was n't a fan of,i have not read the novel but i 've already seen it a few times
1,the only way you 'll see this film are the performances that are not the only reason i can find it in the first place,the only problem with the film is that it has a few twists but a lot of the movie ends with a very good and very
1,when you 're a kid it is a real treat to hear that it 's,when they finally see a movie that has the look of a bad thing
1,a few of the scenes involve some of the best acting i have ever seen,a film that should have been made by the director in the beginning of the movie
1,otherwise this is one of my favorites,otherwise the film 's plot is a little
1,but the movie was a lot more than it was in a movie about a,but the best thing about it was that they could have done the job
1,anyway this movie was a waste of time,anyway this is a great movie for all ages
1,i 've never heard of it before but still it has been my favorite disney film,i think the movie is n't the greatest film ever made but the best one
1,in my opinion i would have liked some more if,in the first scene the characters are the same
1,jill clayburgh and her supporting cast are all very good,jill silverman does a good job as the mom and she
1,the movie was shot at a time when the,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,the movie was a little too long,the story is so bad and so ridiculous
1,that is how they are able to keep a straight face,that was a good thing but that 's about it
1,i am so glad i watched this film,i was very pleasantly surprised by this film and
1,i think it was a waste of time,i am sure that the producers of this film
1,in short the film has a few flaws in it that are n't quite as memorable as the original,in the meantime of his career his mother and daughter are forced to accept that they are both in love
1,this is a film that you will not miss if you do n't know what to expect,this is not to say the acting is bad but it was so much better than the script
1,steven seagal was a great actor but the rest of the cast seemed forced by the other actors,steven spielberg 's films do n't make a lot of sense and i do n't think that it is
1,by the end of the end we have two characters in the movie that were supposed to do the same,by the end of the movie i was just wishing they would put it back together in the future
1,i am a sucker for this kind of stuff and i do n't really want to give away a,i saw this on the tube and the sundance version is pretty much an insult to the original
1,if it was on cable and the dvd cover would be worth it,if i had to give a 0 and the only negative rating i could
1,yes the film was a lot better but the story was weak,yes this is a good movie it 's not very original or interesting
1,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,this film is so bad that it makes no sense at all
1,a few things do n't seem to have the same sense of reality to it in the first place,a few minutes later we learn a little about the story of an old man who has a heart attack
1,the story itself is about a young woman named laura who has a crush on her own mother,the film is not a complete waste of time but the story is pretty basic it is a very
1,an excellent film that has been shown to be a,an example of what a superhero is a movie
1,from the beginning you get the feeling that the director is trying to make something more interesting and then it ends up with some very bad acting that just does n't work out,from there he 's a pretty cool actor but he is so stupid in that you have to wonder if she 's going to get a little too much credit to him
1,blood dolls in the first movie were n't a good one either,blood vidal was in the film for a few minutes but i guess
1,i saw the trailer for this movie on television and i had to wait for it to get,i am not going to spoil it for you but i will give this movie a 4
1,if you 're a fan of the genre and liked the movie i strongly recommend,if i had n't read the book i could n't have been more disappointed
1,i was a little confused about the movie,i saw the film on the shelf the day
1,it is also an odd movie with some,it would be a waste of time
1,many people have mentioned that this film was a great film with the exception of being a big,many of us have seen this movie and i have a lot of experience for the music
1,so the movie is a lot like a movie in which the characters are not developed to each story,so the film is a little bit of a spoof but the story is a bit of a mess
1,many of the characters are very annoying and there 's no reason to care about any of them either,many people have seen him in the film but this movie was n't even close to being a good one
1,these are not all examples of that,these are the two main characters in this
1,truly the worst movie i have ever seen,truly this is an enjoyable little film
1,the film is a complete mess,the plot has some holes and it
1,however the acting of the main cast,however the story was very weak
1,as it turns out she did n't have a single mother and she has a heart of gold to live,as the movie progresses it becomes increasingly confusing and boring at times but it 's a very good film
1,though it is a little too long and it 's not the same,though it is not the best movie i have ever seen the movie is
1,gulliver has the ability to be the hero of the film and the whole affair is the same,gulliver is a great movie that should have been called upon the joker and it was a great movie
1,now the plot was a complete mess,now i have to disagree with all the
1,since then i 've seen the same thing with my friend and we 're not so sure why it 's so bad,since i was watching it for the first time i was so moved by the fact that it had to be one of
1,this is the worst film i have ever seen,this film is a complete disgrace to any american film
1,i saw this film when i was 11 and was absolutely shocked,i was so disappointed that i found myself wishing that the filmmakers could
1,i have no idea that the director is,i was n't impressed by the film
1,stop it from me and watch it,stop motion of the movie and the acting
1,a very good and interesting film for all the wrong reasons,a very good film that should be seen by many people
1,it is a great movie that is so great it 's almost funny,it is also one of the most underrated films i have seen for a
1,or maybe it was just too long,or the director or whatever they do
1,another example of a good horror movie,another thing that is missing is that a
1,please if you want to see a good film that is,please do not watch this movie it 's worth seeing
1,this movie has a great premise but i do not think the film,this film had a few funny moments but they were not really
1,i do n't remember seeing this movie when it was released,i do n't know why i did not like these things so
1,he is also a great actor but he plays a very complex character who is a real loser,he is a very good actor he has no talent in his acting and it is hard to imagine
1,of course the plot is not that good,of course i do n't think that it is
1,i think it 's the most accurate movie to be made,i am surprised that such a movie has a reputation in the
1,while i was in a coma at the time when i was a child this is a great film,while i do n't care for these characters and not the story itself it 's also a very good story
1,the film was so boring that i wanted to watch the movie to the end of the film,the plot is not really that interesting and the acting was not the best but it 's pretty good
1,this movie was not the first movie to,this was a good movie for me
1,this is one of those shows that i have watched,this is a great movie for everyone to watch
1,i saw the film on a whim of,i was surprised to read this review
1,the only redeeming feature of this movie is that it makes,the movie is so bad that it is almost embarrassing
1,he 's got a good sense of humour and,he was just too old for words too
1,he is the one who does n't like it so much,he had the potential to pull off the part of the movie
1,really the film is a complete mess that is not worth the time or,really i am not a fan and the film is just plain awful
1,this is a movie that makes you laugh and cry,this film has a few good moments and it 's a
1,there are some great scenes and the scene where he is trying to get the girl to work on the show,there are no real plot elements no story no plot no plot no story and nothing just makes it boring
1,thank goodness i did n't get the chance to see this,thank god i did n't see it at the cinema
1,it 's a shame that it was made in the early 70 's and i still think this is a great movie,it is a story about a young man who is a little bit of a mixed bag with a family that is the
1,not to mention it 's a good movie that i do n't understand but it is n't,not a single thing that 's funny about it it 's a great deal of fun
1,the story is pretty simple and the actors who are involved in their own life,the film also does a good job of portraying a woman as her husband as she
1,that was the worst of the movie,that 's because i have to say that
1,apparently a lot of people have been killed but this movie had so many plot holes that i felt compelled to write it off and say it,apparently the movie did n't have a clue to this movie but it was the first film that i saw in the series and i did n't care
1,although this film is not about the same subject matter that we all knew it would be about the world it would be,although the movie is not the worst film i 've seen i have no idea what 's going on it seems to be the
1,the film is a little boring but i guess that 's,the movie is very entertaining and the actors were excellent
1,it 's a great movie to see and see,it also has a very funny and entertaining scene when
1,i'm afraid this film is a masterpiece,i'm sorry but the movie does n't really
1,i do n't know how to tell you this story is not a great one as we see the characters and their motivations but they also do a lot of things like,i think that if it were n't for the good acting and the fact that i was watching it on television it did n't make me want to watch it again
1,the only saving graces for me are the special effects and,the plot is pretty thin and the plot is ridiculous
1,certainly a film that is a little,certainly a good movie to watch
1,raising his head and his family 's life he becomes a hero to a tee of the imagination which would be a better place,raising his own hands and the head and the man is so bad that you ca n't help but feel like i was in the
1,the plot is so simple it makes you feel the need to have a few good things to do but that is what this film is,the only reason i can find the reason for the film in which the film is based is that the director and the writer of this film
1,definitely it is the fact that it is the first of the two films to be directed by the,definitely recommended if only the filmmakers and director had to make a feature film in the same year
1,1010 and i have seen a few bad horror films,1010 and i'm a generous fan of horror movies
1,john wayne was great as the villain,john carpenter and his writer michael moore are
1,thankfully it is n't a film,thankfully the film has some good acting
1,legend of a serial killer is not one of the best movies but the fact that it 's a horror,legend of the phantasm is a movie about the evil killer scarecrow the snowman and frankenstein and his mate
1,i am a huge fan of the original and even so i was n't expecting something more,i would like to see this movie again in a theater and that 's why i bought it
1,true the film has its moments but there 's not enough to keep,true the movie is a bit too much of an overlong mess
1,after a while we are supposed to be reminded that this film,after all that i have been trying to locate my family
1,after the first hour or so i started watching a bunch of old,after reading the book the story was very similar to the book
1,never before have we seen him before we see him and the rest of the cast is not as bad as the script,never have i seen a movie with such a bad director and i ca n't even think of the good points in my mouth
1,if you are a fan of horror movies you 'll love this one,if this is the best i can i think about it in that respect
1,this movie is just a bad movie that tries to,this movie was a complete waste of my time
1,i was a little hesitant to watch it,i am a huge fan of the first three
1,to say so but i have a problem,to make sure you are a kid
1,this is the story of a young woman in a small village in the early 1930s when she meets a beautiful woman,this is a very bad movie it 's so bad that it makes it hard to sit through a movie like this
1,yet another reason why i give this movie a 4 out of 10 is that it has a very,yet i ca n't think of another film that i did not like and this one is not
1,you know what to expect from the,you 'll be glad you did
1,they should 've given the director a,they were both good and evil
1,lucinda is not a good character actor but he does a good job,lucinda is a young man whose father is killed in the hospital
1,the movie does a good job of showing it as a very bad movie,the movie is not so much of an impact that it is just a little
1,they all do n't have enough time to make the,they were n't in the movie as a whole
1,i am a little prejudiced of how the filmmakers and director should come out of the picture as it is a good way of explaining it in,i have never watched the show but it is n't a very good idea and i would have liked to have seen more episodes of it
1,he was a very talented actor of the period,he is a good guy and he has done a
1,and it 's like the writers have no intention to make a movie that is supposed,and it 's a shame that such a bad film is n't available on vhs
1,the acting is horrible and the plot is a bit of an excuse to get the plot,the movie also features two different characters a la belle a transsexual an exiled woman and a woman
1,i have to say i liked it but it was not,i saw this movie when i was 11 years old
1,i would not have liked this show but it 's a great show,i am sure it 's a good idea for a movie but the script
1,heroes are sent to jail to find,heroes are n't always the same
1,billy connolly is a good actor,billy wilder has the right amount of
1,of course the film does contain a bit of a lot of the same,of course there 's a bit of blood but that 's about it
1,i would n't recommend it to the masses or even the prudish,i am amazed that it was made in the us in this movie
1,i saw this movie when it first aired on a friday night and thought it looked pretty good,i have n't seen the first film yet but i still have to admit that the story is a
1,otherwise i do n't think i 've ever seen such a bad film,otherwise i would say that the film was not so much fun but the
1,in the case of the film it is a very long way that is not only,in the end it is a very interesting movie but it 's a little weak
1,the acting by all is excellent,the first part of the movie is
1,currently i am not going to be able to find this movie in any format,currently i can understand that the filmmakers did n't want to see any film in the
1,naturally this is not an accurate film and it 's difficult not to like the,naturally it was n't the only film to get it banned as a comedy
1,just a few seconds of this movie,just as you can see it in a
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the first time i saw it i was so
1,originally the first movie is a good one,originally a remake of this movie was released on
1,i would have liked it a little more if the film was more of a documentary,i 've never read the book but the movie is very entertaining and well done
1,i am not a fan of the genre but i think the movie is great in the way that the movie,i was surprised to find that a film of this calibre could n't have possibly been a little more entertaining
1,it 's a pity that it was only released on dvd,it 's an example of what it is to make people believe
1,also the fact that this was made for tv is n't a great idea to watch,also the film 's title song is a little jarring and it 's hard not to notice
1,you can only see the film in an effort to make this a classic for everyone to laugh at,you can see that this film is not about the evils of war but it is about a young man
1,from the moment it was over the film seemed to have no purpose,from the very beginning we learn that this is a good film for the
1,and then the camera pans out of the window and they shoot it,and there was one scene in which a man walking down in a car
1,i think the movie is very good,i was so impressed with it so i
1,but this is just a very bad movie,but then the rest of the movie is just
1,it 's a pretty cool movie but you have to have something a little bit,it 's not a bad movie but i did enjoy the first film better
1,oh yes the story is very weak,oh yes the film 's main problem is
1,the only reason i did n't waste was that it had a lot of potential,the only thing that makes the film watchable is the fact that it 's not a
1,case in point you are not likely that you 'll be,case is a story of the life of two families
1,i have to admit to all the bad things about this film,i have n't read the book but i think the book does a
1,eva longoria is a great director who can,eva unger is also excellent as well
1,actor was not the only movie that made me laugh,actor and director of course is the real life of a
1,of course the real thing is it 's just a bit of a bad movie,of course the real estate agent who has to have the most important role in the
1,you can get the same feeling you 're watching a film,you can tell he is trying to be funny but fails miserably
1,anne heche is very sexy and sexy,anne francis plays the daughter who is a
1,he 's the only actor who can act in this one,he 's just a good actor and i do agree that he
1,the movie starts with a bunch of friends and they try and solve their problems,the only good thing to be said about this movie is the fact that it 's
1,it is also a shame that the film is more like,it is a great performance for everyone in the movie
1,anybody who thinks this film is the good will love it or just enjoy it,anybody who likes the first movie and even the original is the most annoying
1,it is a good movie to view,it 's a movie that has the best
1,as for me it 's not as bad as it could,as an avid fan of the show i was impressed
1,keep in mind that the director and director have been in a mental institution,keep in mind that this film was a success to the public library
1,they all had to do something with a movie that would have worked out as the original,they are the two main characters who come out of the blue zone and the family
1,this movie is a complete waste of time and should be,this film is a must see for any serious family
1,anyone who has seen any of this should be ashamed to have watched this one,anyone who does know this movie will get any more of a chance to experience this
1,i'm not a big fan of musicals that have made this movie,i'm a sucker for this sort of movies but this is n't one
1,i am amazed that i spent so much money on this movie,i do n't see how many films in the world can claim that
1,if you have n't seen this one do you wo n't like it,if you 've seen the first film or you 're a diehard fan of
1,worth the money and effort for this movie,worth the time to watch and if you 're
1,in a way that was a little too much and the fact that it was a movie made me want to throw my,in short it 's a movie with a lot of laughs and it is not the least bit of a screwball comedy
1,chris farley plays the character of a young man in his youth who is a man and his wife and his daughter is very good,chris is very well known but i ca n't help but think his role was so good that the whole thing seemed to have been shot
1,however it 's a great movie with some very,however it was the best of his career
1,the film is set against an exterior backdrop which is used to convey some tension,the film is about a woman who has visions of women in her home and has
1,save yourself a favor if you are into,save this one and get the movie
1,the film is n't a bad thing to say it is a bad movie,the first time we see the same movie the movie is a bit different in
1,well this was n't the only movie,well it 's not a movie
1,the acting was horrible the story weak and the ending was ridiculous,the script and direction are all over the top as if all of
1,notice the fact that it 's a little slow,notice that i was n't expecting too much
1,to be fair he was the most popular actor in the cast,to say that the plot is a bit too thin is beyond me
1,the movie is also very entertaining,the only reason i gave this movie
1,i 've read some negative reviews and i agree with the reviewer,i 've watched it countless times and i really appreciate it
1,check out the film for the first,check out all the other reviews
1,there 's also a bit of nudity in,there was a lot of violence here
1,which i think is a very nice thing,which is a shame because i 've seen this
1,now it 's not a good movie,now that 's a good thing
1,because of the fact that this is just another movie i think i have seen it all,because i 've read many of the comments about that i thought that this movie was a waste
1,he is one of the greatest actors in the history of cinema and i am pleased to say that this is one of my favorite films,he is a good person who does n't want a big tobacco company in a big country in order to prevent him from his wife
1,i have never seen a movie where you know this is bad bad bad and the worst movie i 've ever heard,i 've been looking for something like it ever since i have read the book and that it 's based on a true
1,anyway a movie like this could have been made in the first place but this one does,anyway this movie has some really great moments and is quite good for the first half
1,it is not as bad as it gets,it does n't work because it has the exact
1,it is a very bad movie to say the least,it 's a real shame because the movie is n't even
1,or maybe he just wants to get a job,or maybe the film was shot by the amateur director
1,real life is n't the first movie you have,real life has no place in the film
1,if you 're looking for a movie about the dangers of the art of the world of,if they are to be the next one to make sure you know what i mean
1,this film is a total embarrassment,this movie makes absolutely no sense
1,it does n't make much sense and i have a feeling of gratitude for this film but,it 's a shame that it was so bad and that it was released on dvd
1,beyond that it just seemed to have been shot,beyond a shadow of the doubt that this film is
1,herbert berger is a wonderful actor in,herbert lom plays the lead character
1,my favourite parts were the ones in which the girls were in front of the tv station,my only question would be that you could have done the same thing over and over again and
1,as for the acting of a young malcolm pacino he plays a character that is not in his best shape,as the story unfolds we see the whole film with the exception of a man who 's only a child is
1,they are not even good enough to make a good movie out of it,they were also in some ways a little too much for me to handle this
1,hey that 's right i have a hard time adjusting to a story,hey it 's not that great of a movie but i think it is
1,an example of the movie 's success is its ability to be a classic,an excellent film that i can recommend it to anyone who enjoys the genre or
1,this is one of those movies that has nothing to offer the viewer,this is not a great movie but its very very very entertaining
1,christian bale plays the role of an indian,christian slater is a very talented actor
1,then there is that the story is just about a girl who wants the daughter to be a man,then it goes into the movie 's plot of a movie where it should be the same as the first
1,the film was a complete waste of money and money,the movie 's story is a simple one and it 's
1,so if you 've seen the other movies you have to wonder if the producers,so i do n't want to see a more accurate film about this topic
1,for those who want to know who the hell is the story it,for a movie about real life the audience will enjoy this film
1,similarly the film was filmed in a small,similarly a film of a young woman
1,surely a few years later the movie was made,surely i could have imagined a better movie
1,but the film is n't really a,but this was the last film
1,but that was about as much to the show as,but that aside the movie is a complete mess
1,and the acting is so bad that they are not funny,and the scene where they are walking off the street is a
1,the film is a complete mess but it 's a very funny,the acting in the movie is superb as are the actors
1,i think they are trying to show us that this movie was made by a child,i was expecting a bit of the story of a woman who was born with her mother
1,thirdly this was a great movie for everyone involved in,thirdly i have no idea who the killer is
1,this movie could have been better if they had had a better script,this is not a film for anyone who enjoys the genre of movies
1,the acting was so bad that it was almost unbearable to watch,the acting was n't very good either and the script was so bad
1,in the meantime it 's a very good one,in a movie of which the audience is constantly left
1,or perhaps the best part of the film was when the two guys,or maybe a little more of a movie than a horror film
1,the only real problem i had with it was,the film is set in a time warp
1,all of the actors have done their best work,all the characters are so likable and lovable
1,it 's a shame it 's not available in dvd format,it is n't as good as the first one but it is
1,for a long while they are not in a bad state of acting and the script,for some reason a character was born to play the part of a young boy
1,its not as good as some other films but it 's a fun one,its so obvious that the movie itself is a little slow in the extreme but
1,it 's not the best film of 2001 it is n't bad it 's not a good,it was a great movie with a great cast great actors and a good story line
1,i have to admit i was n't a bit surprised when it was in my mind and i think the reason i wanted to,i do remember that i was watching this movie with a very open mind but i was still surprised when i watched it
1,it is the same old film that we have been watching on the big screen,it 's a movie that is so stupid you ca n't take your eyes off the
1,so why would anyone like this one,so if you want to laugh out loud
1,and it 's not the only other film that can be made available,and that 's what you 'll get from a very funny scene
1,pacing is also good but that the movie is n't really a good one,pacing is not bad but the script is so bad that it 's difficult to
1,howard 's character is so stupid as,howard is a very talented actor
1,some of the other performances are pretty good,some parts of the movie are just a waste
1,you know it is the worst movie of the 90 's,you know the movie was shot with a camera camera but it
1,the only thing i can say about this movie is,the only thing missing in it is the acting
1,well this is not a movie that will appeal to all ages in the,well the movie is not very good or even a little too long
1,have you ever heard of this movie,have no one to do with him
1,the only redeeming quality of this movie was the acting and the acting,the movie does n't seem to have much depth or atmosphere to it
1,the acting is good the story is very,the acting in it is pretty bad
1,on the other hand there is some interesting dialogue and a bit of romance and some good acting,on a whole it 's a good film with good performances by the cast and the acting is all
1,the first part of this film was so,the plot was a bit too thin
1,i was surprised to find out this was not a,i think it 's a great movie to watch
1,there are many things that make it interesting to say,there is a lot of gore in this movie
1,i'm sorry but this film does n't even,i'm sorry it did not get better
1,in the end we never really get to see the characters in this movie,in my opinion the only thing good about the film is the acting which is
1,we all know that this is a great film and we have to be seen,we have a group of people who are trying to escape from a nuclear bomb
1,we see him in a small role as the conflicted,we 're in a state of confusion and sorrow
1,wow i know that it is an excellent movie but it has to be,wow i do agree with the critics on how good the movie is
1,it is a very good show and it 's definitely fun to watch,it was a bit of an opportunity to get the film right
1,many things were wrong with a good movie,many of the characters are so real that i
1,they should have made the movie a bit better instead,they are the best friends of the entire movie
1,just a few minutes of this film are spent,just a great movie with a good cast
1,the plot is simple and predictable,the film is set against a very
1,i do n't know why the movie did n't make sense to the director 's vision and the director was,i think the main thing i hated most was that the film was a little bit of an accident
1,and the ending was n't bad,and there 's also a very good
1,even when the first one ended i did n't think that any,even a few of the jokes and gags were pretty corny
1,well this one is n't bad at,well it was a great film
1,most of the time it 's not as long as he is in it,most of the time i was n't sure if the director was intended to be
1,while the movie is a bit long it is not a comedy or a thriller,while the story was a bit weak the acting the directing the directing the dialogue and
1,along with the usual suspects the plot is a joke,along with a few others in the cast the cast is
1,the only redeeming quality i can find was that the movie has some good points but it 's not even as bad as the other,the only thing that makes this movie worth watching is the fact that the characters are so bad that you do not care about them
1,without the hint of a great actor and a great actress she,without a doubt the most disappointing thing i 've ever seen
1,the film is n't really about as much as the book but it is a good movie,the story is a bit of a bore and the ending does not make sense to the viewer
1,as the movie progresses and the viewer gets to the end of the movie the plot is not a bit contrived,as a child of an ardent fan of the first film i was very surprised when i read the book
1,there were a few good parts of this movie,there is a lot of action in the film but
1,if you want a film to make an attempt at making fun of an american film you must see this film,if you do n't want to get it out of your hands for 90 minutes then do n't bother to waste your
1,bugs and the beanstalk was one of those movies that was,bugs bunny is the best movie i have ever seen
1,i was expecting a lot from the movie but i was surprised,i do n't know if the film is just about two men who
1,it is also a movie that is not only the best of the genre but,it is a great movie with a great cast of characters and great characters
1,watch it with some friends or friends and you,watch this movie if you can find it
1,today it 's not even funny to watch,today the film has been a complete disaster since
1,nonetheless i would n't recommend to anyone who has not seen this movie,nonetheless it is n't really the same as the rest of the series but
1,so many people say it 's a great movie,so i did n't care for her character
1,not much happens in the movie,not to mention the fact that the
1,now i have a lot to say and i'm a fan,now i 'll say that the acting is very good
1,in the end it was just plain awful,in a way i think that the movie is
1,the story is very interesting to the eye and i think it 's very good to have,the only good thing here for me was that they could have made a better movie
1,this is an excellent and very very underrated film,this is one of the best movies in the world
1,in this case the movie is not very good,in a way that 's the way they were
1,other than that the story is a complete mess,other than the fact that the movie is not the
1,if this movie is supposed to be a spoof of a film that is a,if you want to see a very good film this is a must see
1,the first time i saw this movie on tv,the movie is a mess of a movie
1,if you 're not a fan of the comic book or the series 's history you 'll get this show,if you 've never seen a movie you can watch with the kids or a bunch of people who are looking
1,this movie is not a great movie but a good film to me,this is one of those movies that you should n't miss if the film
1,original is the story of a young man and her son as they meet in a mutual struggle in the,original was the only one in the movie where the movie was shot was shot in the back room
1,and i am a fan of the original,and the whole thing has no real meaning
1,but this is what i thought it was a good film and i liked it,but i was a bit surprised to see how the movie was shot and edited and
1,lucio fulci 's direction was very good and,lucio fulci has made a good film
1,well i did not think that this would make any sense,well it was n't the worst movie i have ever seen but
1,overall this movie is a waste of your time,overall this is a very enjoyable movie to watch but
1,nonetheless this was a pretty decent movie,nonetheless the film is a bit over the
1,it has a lot of problems and it has its moments but overall it is a good movie worth seeing and i would recommend it,it 's an interesting film and the acting by the cast is superb and i think that it was a great film to watch
1,as an actor it seems like a real person 's performance,as a child this movie has a nice sense of humor and
1,if they 're going to get out of the way they are all over the place in the middle when,if you are a big fan of the books and liked the original then you should definitely be disappointed
1,it was a nice idea but not a good one,it 's just a shame it is n't a sequel
1,actually the movie is a bit too predictable for the whole family but,actually there is an excellent amount of time to see the film
1,the story is a bit confusing and predictable but the film 's ending is very abrupt,the plot and acting are terrible the plot is stupid the acting is horrible and the story
1,neither the director or the writer intended to make the movie any,neither of them was so much better as in the original
1,thanks to that i can see the film 's flaws as a child 's film,thanks to his best friend he has been able to get a lot of money from
1,no wonder i saw this film when i was,no one has a good sense of humor
1,although the acting was good it was a good movie,although the film has a great cast the film is a
1,it is the story that makes the film so much more enjoyable than any other film that has had in,it is a movie that has been told and appreciated by many others who have seen the first one
1,the story is very similar to what happened on this one,the story revolves around a group of young teens and their own
1,i was n't even going to be able to relate to the characters and plot,i 've never been a big fan of hers but it 's a shame that it
1,lindy is an actress who gets a job and,lindy and the others are the same characters
1,the script is full of cliches and the ending is a complete copout,the movie is about a young girl who goes to the island to visit
1,i'm not sure how to describe that but it is n't,i'm glad that the dvd release is available for purchase on vhs
1,this movie is about a woman who is,this is the worst of the bunch
1,the movie starts when the first one is going to be a bit like the one that is supposed to show,the story is very well told and the movie moves forward as a whole not to make a great thriller
1,i have a soft spot for these two actors who,i was n't really looking forward to the movie
1,flklypa is a great film for a long time,flklypa and behold i have to wonder how this got
1,whats it all that is happening to me,whats a bit unfair for this movie but if
1,where does that sound of the camera zoom,where the heck did i get a dvd that
1,why does this film have to be so bad,why do you have to see the movie
1,however the movie also has some good points of view and some of the scenes are very exciting,however i have to agree that it was one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,there is nothing wrong with the fact that it is a movie about how it could be done,there was a lot of violence in the film which was pretty good and a nice touch of the
1,he was just the right man for his role in this movie,he 's a bit of an egotistical idiot but his wife is not
1,firstly the script is very weak and,firstly this is a bad film
1,the movie is just a mess,the story and characters are so complex
1,it was a great movie and i liked that one too,it 's not as simple as the other films but that 's
1,it 's the same type of movie you get from the,it 's a real pity that such a good movie
1,in the movie 's defense and to a lesser extent it is an easy task that he does n't seem to know that his wife is not a true person and that he has been killed in his own life,in the meantime he is in the middle ages of a movie with an almost mystical music score by john woo but the film 's only saving grace is not necessarily that the film is set in the near future and
1,the movie is also a great movie for the kids and the kids,the script has a few twists and turns but it has the best part
1,the script is a little thin as well and that 's not enough to get the viewer to empathise with them,the acting is very poor and it is a pity that the actors are n't given enough credit to any of the
1,although the first time i watched this movie the first time i was so scared and bored i thought,although a few years later it 's still a nice surprise to be able to sit through this
1,was the film a good idea or a movie,was there anything to do with the production of the
1,well it did and it 's a bit,well the first one was a classic
1,but the movie is a very bad movie and it is not worth watching the film for,but it is a film that makes it all the more difficult to understand and it 's very
1,but i ca n't imagine the last one of the,but the film is just a bit too long
1,as for the story it 's not a good idea,as for the movie it was a little too long but
1,i have to wonder if this one is a little overrated,i was a little surprised that the filmmakers had a lot of
1,no wonder this film was made in the us,no wonder he was not the best man
1,if this was one of the best parts of the book they would be the best,if the story had been done by a group of friends and told the story of the
1,he 's got a lot of fun and it has all the right ingredients that are present in his,he 's a man with no brains no good sense of humor and he 's just so bad
1,i was hoping that some people might find a movie that is so stupid it 's almost painful to watch,i would have given it 2 stars but even for a little more of the same type of film i would
1,the film was shot on a very small budget,the plot is a little confusing but the acting is
1,plus it is so bad that it,plus the acting is very weak
1,the movie has a good cast and a,the first half is a little slow
1,a movie that will never be forgotten,a good film is a good example
1,clues like the one where they have been,clues are revealed and the movie ends
1,i have never been there for anything else that has,i am so glad i saw it at all
1,the film is a very good thriller and it 's a shame that the film does n't have a lot,the story line is so ridiculous that it becomes impossible to believe it was actually made on the spot
1,i'm a big fan of movies like this one,i'm surprised that this is still one of the worst
1,where the hell does the man and his,where the hell does that come from
1,this is a movie you will watch with your friends and,this is not a movie it 's a bad movie
1,also the film is so bad it 's funny,also it 's not even a movie it is a
1,in this film we are shown a couple times the film is not very long and it seems the director and actors are trying to make up a lot of,in fact if you 're a fan of his work and the original movie you should see the film and enjoy his performance as one of the main characters
1,i have n't read the book and i do,i 've seen better stuff in my career
1,there 's a lot of action,there were some good parts of the
1,in the end you get to see the film 's climax in the last 20 minutes of the film,in this movie they have a great cast and it 's the kind of story that makes it worth your
1,robin williams plays the part as a tough guy and,robin hood is a perfect choice for the movie
1,spanish horror films are always the case,spanish cinema should be required viewing
1,the acting is so bad it boggles the mind that the,the story is simple and the acting is pretty good
1,this movie has the best performance of all times,this is a movie you will love it
1,really the movie 's biggest asset is,really it 's not that bad
1,it 's a very simple film with an extremely strong ending,it 's a very funny movie and a funny one
1,jet li is great as his longsuffering sidekick,jet li is one of the most underrated actors
1,all that was said about this film is that it has the same amount of,all that was left was a big budget that made me cry so much
1,or the way she is treated to the movie,or the other way it does not work
1,i would recommend this show to anyone who,i do n't know who 's who
1,the film is a bit too slow for me,the story line is not bad but the acting is
1,thank you to the dvd player of the film and the movie,thank god he did n't have to go to the gym
1,i think this movie is a must see,i am so glad that you can find this
1,what makes this film a classic is,what 's the point of that
1,after the first two films i 've seen this movie as a very bad movie it has been done before,after the first hour you 're just waiting for some kind of reason why this film has a cult following
1,with a little of the same old style and a bit more of a lot of people who have been,with the exception of a great director who 's the director 's best work he 's also very funny
1,after a while the only thing good about the film is the soundtrack,after the death of his friend and his wife and her son they are
1,the only way it has a movie can be to get the audience to think is the way the people that,the movie also shows the struggle between the two and the other and is n't as funny as its predecessor
1,we have seen the first two films,we 're supposed to be scared by a
1,the acting is horrible the script is awful the script,the movie does not have to be so bad
1,this is a great family movie that will never,this movie was so much better than this
1,a very good and interesting movie from the director,a very simple movie with a few laughs but the
1,it is n't that i do n't know it 's not so bad i,it 's a movie you can take over but not in a hurry
1,well the film is about a guy with a heart who is a little too infatuated with,well this is the only movie that i have ever seen that 's better than this
1,the only real problem is that the film 's story is not interesting,the story is n't that bad but the script is awful and the acting
1,this one was n't bad but not the best of the two,this is one of the best films of the year and one of
1,in the end the story is so predictable that i felt cheated by having wasted time watching this,in the film the viewer gets to see the whole thing and then it becomes a lot more than
1,if you do n't want to see the movie then you can see it in the theater,if you are in a league of a film that has a lot of good things going for
1,you 'll find yourself laughing at the stupidity of its plot,you know you 're in trouble when you are in a situation
1,there are a bunch of other actors that are,there is a lot of violence and nudity
1,i do n't think that the actors were in,i was really surprised when the credits rolled
1,too many people in this country and people were afraid that this is the same story,too bad that this movie has a lot of flaws but is the story to tell that
1,the acting is so bad that it makes you wonder what the hell was going on,the only redeeming feature that is good was the scene where the girl of the movie confronts
1,please avoid this unless it was n't for the first half of the movie,please if you are looking for a good story that has some good acting great
1,pretty much every time i see it i have to,pretty well acted and acted by the same director
1,quaid 's character was the most interesting character i 've seen,quaid and his brother are the same as in the first film
1,this is not one of those movies that you ca n't take seriously,this movie could be seen at least one hundred times before the credits roll
1,anyway the movie is very well acted,anyway there 's a scene of a woman
1,this is the worst film i have,this movie is not a masterpiece
1,my friend 's father was a very conservative and caring person and he was a little confused and confused,my only question is why did he keep putting him on a show in order to make a movie that
1,he has done the film with an excellent,he is also very very convincing here
1,the script is not very well written and does n't work in a movie about the story itself and instead it is very,the film has a very good plot line and some of the actors are excellent and the plot is a bit farfetched
1,i was expecting a lot from it but i really liked it,i think the movie is a total disaster and i think they are
1,seems to be the norm 's point of,seems to be a little too much
1,even if they are the most important thing you can possibly think of this film it is the worst movie i,even though they are n't supposed to have a lot to do with them they have a very good idea
1,sonic is a movie that is not just about the people,sonic and his crew were in for some strange reason
1,some of this is n't bad,some of the other reviews have been
1,it is a shame that this show has n't made its own,it 's a movie that is n't afraid of its own
1,it 's not even the kind of,it 's not just a movie
1,wyatt earp is a fine actor who could have given,wyatt earp has an outstanding performance as the villain
1,there 's a lot to say about this film,there are some interesting moments but the film just drags
1,she is a great actress and that she has,she 's an actress in a long time
1,the story is about a young man who goes through the streets of the town,the film is a little bit of a downer for those who want to laugh at
1,such as the fact that they are both so close and the film,such a shame that i do n't have a problem with that
1,interestingly enough it was a movie made in the early 90s so it had the potential of,interestingly enough the film does have a few moments but overall the film is pretty dull
1,make a great movie about the dangers,make no mistake for the film
1,the movie has been done by an,the acting is n't bad either
1,but i ca n't help but feel like i 've been trying,but i did n't see the film until the very end
1,bret sorvino has the best role,bret brooks is great in the role
1,you do n't have to have seen the original in,you know it 's just a bad guy movie
1,that 's the whole point of a plot,that was the most beautiful aspect of this movie
1,this is a very entertaining film,this was a very funny movie
1,some of the scenes were so bad i could n't,some people say that this is a bad show
1,i am surprised that he was able to make a feature film with his own film,i have been in my room in many times and i can understand that the film 's
1,he 's a great actor and it 's easy to say that,he is n't the only person who can save his life
1,creative and interesting the film has a few funny moments,creative film that was made for its release of the first
1,since i was not in the mood for more i was n't impressed,since he 's not a very good actor he is very very good here
1,as far as i'm concerned i was looking forward to this,as a result a movie of the week has been released in
1,special mention should go to show a lot of,special mention is the performance of the actress
1,but i have to say it 's one of the worst movies in my opinion,but this is a great movie with a great cast and an excellent story and it
1,but the best parts are the one where the girl is talking about how she,but the real star is the fact that he has a very small part
1,how many of us have seen this,how many times do you go
1,the story of the movie and the way it unfolds,the story was pretty good and the actors and crew were
1,hermione 's father is an excellent actor and it 's very surprising to see how he could have done his,hermione 's character 's character was n't very funny at all but it still seemed to have been funny
1,he plays the role of a lifetime,he is the first to die
1,what i did like was the fact that the character 's motivations were,what i found was a good story and i liked the characters
1,scene of course is a classic,scene is the scene in which the
1,movie is about a man who is trying,movie is one of my alltime favorites
1,after that it has been released on video as soon as a dvd release of,after all the first time you see the trailer it is a good movie
1,yet the film does have its share of problems and some,yet it never seems to be a film or drama
1,snarky but this one is just a little more than a few of the best movies,snarky little kid is a good show with some nice laughs and some great performances
1,i would n't be surprised if the movie was n't so much fun,i have to wonder when it 's available on dvd or the dvd version
1,i would n't want to be a fan of the original,i am amazed at how this movie got released theatrically
1,he also wrote some of the most,he is an extremely talented actor
1,the movie is about the love of the family and it is,the acting ranges from a very good performance to the actors
1,a few years ago i was able to see,a lot of the movie is about sex
1,another example of the film in the last twenty years is the fact that the movie is not a comedy at all and that it 's a movie,another thing that i did n't like was the way it was portrayed as the film 's plot is a complete waste of time and a waste
1,and the movie is a little dated,and the movie is a bit of a
1,the story and acting are all very good,the movie is about a man who is a
1,to say that there was no plot in the original movie is the best part of the film,to make matters worse this guy is a total moron and is just as stupid as the rest of
1,i think i 've just read the comments and seen the,i was very impressed with the way the movie ended
1,for a film i would n't even consider the movie to be a bit boring it was quite a bit slow paced and at times downright unbelievable,for the sake of the film you will be pleasantly surprised by the fact that it is based upon a book by a man who was not a
1,the film does contain several interviews with various subjects in which a couple of characters do exist,the film is a bit of a bore but the ending is pretty good as well
1,not the worst movie i 've ever seen,not only did the movie not get its budget
1,paz vega does a good job playing her,paz lewis is one of the best
1,the movie is about a bunch of people who go to prison to investigate the mystery of their lives,the only real standout was to make you feel like you were in for a fun time and a fun
1,stan 's dad is a real person who is the,stan laurel was in a coma with the family
1,the first part of the film is quite a bit of a surprise,the story is about a man who has an addiction to her family and
1,the film has some good points and some really good sequences and some nice,the movie was so good that it made me feel good about it
1,stilted script and poor performances from the two leads make it hard to get into the plot the plot and the plot,stilted and dull but the film is a great piece of work and i recommend it to any fan of classic horror
1,this movie is so stupid you ca n't take a joke seriously,this film has been done by the other three yearolds of all ages
1,the only thing that i do n't say is that it is a good story,the only good thing that could happen is the movie is not so much as a
1,so i did n't get much of the movie,so what i did n't understand the film was a
1,i have been watching the movie dozens of times and now i'm glad i did n't,i would n't be interested if the story of a young woman who had a dream with
1,it 's a real shame because the story is so bad it 's almost laughable,it 's the same kind of movie that 's the reason the first one is so
1,i have to admit i love this movie but that is the only thing that makes this so bad that this movie is so bad,i think he 's a great director who could have done a better job and his work in that the script is very good
1,the acting was good and the acting was excellent,the plot is pretty lame as is the acting
1,many of the scenes are so boring they 're just funny in their parts,many of these films made for the sake of being the worst movie ever made
1,as a matter of fact it is a little dated,as the film goes on it is very clear that he
1,however the movie has some good points,however it 's not the only way to
1,watch it and then you 'll see it,watch it for yourself to find out
1,you do n't have to be a big fan of either of these films to make,you can read that the movie is about as much a drama as the original
1,when the two men are killed in the dark their relationship with each other is revealed by the viewer 's intelligence,when a woman is murdered she is forced to take the money and the family 's daughter to the home of her
1,pope and wife are a married couple,pope is a very very good actor who
1,i was expecting to see some of the worst parts of this movie but it 's still worth watching,i 've seen a lot of bad movies but this one is so bad that it 's actually painful to
1,the movie has a great cast and an excellent story,the plot is pretty weak and it 's hard to believe
1,some of the other reviews have stated how to say this movie is very well made,some may disagree with the movie and not even that of those who have commented on this
1,it is a pity that this film has not been released commercially in dvd,it 's an excellent performance and i would definitely recommend this movie to everyone
1,in the first movie he 's a good guy and i,in the end he is the hero of a crime
1,geer 's character is not only sympathetic and the film is a mess that is so utterly devoid of,geer and his crew were a little too old for the role the director had no clue of
1,this movie was so bad that i was laughing my pants off,this is a film that should have been shown on a larger budget
1,a few of my friends were born in their own home and,a good film that should be seen by many other actors
1,contrast in the end of my life of the movie is the story of the life of,contrast between the two main characters in the series the first season was a real stinker
1,from this period of time you will see a very good cast of characters including john carradine and david lynch as a young,from the opening scene of the film the viewer is left wondering how it will end up with such a great film
1,van heflin is the most memorable and most talented actor in the film,van damme was one of the most underrated stars of the last years
1,it was a little more of a parody than anything else but it was a good film for the,it 's a shame because i have a hard time figuring out what i saw on this film
1,you have to be a big fan of movies to enjoy,you know the drill is coming from the first movie
1,this movie is a must see,this movie is a waste of time
1,but i have no idea what to expect from this film except for the fact that it has,but the movie was a total disappointment and i really did n't care about any of it
1,our hero is a very likable character,our heroine has to be one of his
1,he 's a good actress and is also very good in the role as well,he plays a young man who 's hired to be a gangster in the united states
1,can anyone make a movie that 's so bad you 're,can you imagine the director 's commentary on the film
1,the plot line was so stupid the plot was ridiculous the acting was mediocre,the plot line is very simple and the characters are believable and believable
1,the only redeeming feature about this movie is it 's not the most,the film is a bit long but it has it 's flaws
1,giving this movie an award i will give it a 1010,giving the film a little more credit to the characters and their
1,likable and entertaining in this regard,likable and very funny but not in
1,not that it is a little dated but it does have a great deal of atmosphere,not that there is any need of a good movie to make the audience care
1,i have a lot of respect for this and i'm going to say that this is a good movie,i was n't disappointed when a film was adapted from a novel but it 's not even a movie
1,he does n't want to get out of his house but he is forced to go to,he has a few lines which is not the most important thing i have ever heard
1,the story was good but it was n't as good as the,the acting was horrible and the plot was just too bad
1,you 're supposed to feel bad for,you do n't need the same
1,you could not have made a movie of this kind,you do n't get to see any of the characters or
1,mascaro 's story is about a killer who kills the girl and,mascaro is the most famous film that i 've ever seen
1,the film has a very nice touch that i think is an excellent movie,the movie is also a lot of fun to watch and i would say that
1,this movie is a real treasure in the lives of,this movie is the worst i have ever seen
1,instead she is a young lady and her husband is a very young woman who loves her,instead he goes into the house to get his revenge against the evil and the man 's father
1,the only real highlight of the movie is its,the story itself seems like a bad idea
1,after watching the film for the first time i was really surprised,after the first five minutes i felt like i was watching a documentary
1,i saw this movie in the theater in the theater and was so impressed by how bad it was,i have never been so compelled to see this film again and i ca n't even get to the one
1,i would say it 's a movie that is not even,i do n't understand how it was going to end
1,in addition to the acting it 's a great movie,in the end it 's a little bit more than a
1,it has a very very bad soundtrack,it is n't even a movie
1,the plot is a little weak but it is still entertaining enough to keep my attention,the acting was pretty good the story lines were very good but the acting was horrible
1,aristocrat 's son is the most annoying character that i,aristocrat and his men are also in the movie
1,so much of the film is set in an,so i am not surprised it is n't
1,the film is a little too long,the plot revolves around a group of teenagers
1,kelsey is a good actor but the rest of,kelsey 's father is a little too young
1,this was an insult to all the,this movie is just plain boring
1,and then i was in a state of awe for the characters and the plot,and the ending was so abrupt and the movie was so confusing that i felt compelled
1,and the whole thing has a few funny moments that just make you laugh,and if you do n't care about the characters the plot is so ridiculous you
1,if that were what i 'd call it a comedy and i was,if you want to see this movie you should definitely enjoy it
1,reviewers who have seen it do n't think i 'd want to know,reviewers who are looking for something good is n't very very good
1,i have been in high school in the past,i 've always been a fan of a movie and
1,marjorie dee is one of my favorite actors but the script is not as good as it should be,marjorie dee and michael jayston are great and it 's all very well cast as they have done so well
1,lol i do n't know if it 's a bad script and just about everyone involved in the making of it,lol it 's a great movie that will be forgotten at least for a few generations and the fact that you can
1,as the film goes on we see the two of them in a different world,as a result the movie was pretty bad the acting was awful the story was awful
1,i have to say that i have not read any of the other reviews here i,i 've seen a lot of films with a lot of good actors in it
1,this movie was n't so bad it was,this movie is not worth your time
1,the film 's only redeeming feature is the acting by a very young nicolas cage,the story of the girl who lives in the apartment building is an interesting one
1,very few films have a good plot,very little to say but that 's not
1,harold 's character and his father are all a tad underdeveloped at times,harold is just as funny in this movie and he 's really funny
1,long live the first of the three films,long before the film was released i found the
1,scorsese 's first film is an adaptation of his classic novel 'the omega man',scorsese has to do that to make a movie that 's not the first one
1,for the most part i thought that it was pretty good but i liked,for example when they were shot the movie was n't a complete failure
1,and i really liked this movie,and if you want to watch the
1,tom hanks is the one to blame the film for its shortcomings,tom selleck 's portrayal of mr darcy is one of the most powerful
1,it is a very simple story of a young woman who travels across europe,it was a good movie that i would like for anyone to enjoy
1,custer was the most prolific character in the film who was the hero of the show,custer is in love with a man who is in love with the woman who is engaged
1,and the scene where they 're shot is a joke,and the ending is the one in the movie with a
1,even in an attempt to explain the movie 's flaws it was just a complete,even though it is n't as bad as you might find yourself watching it
1,if you like it or hate your kids then you 'll be in the minority for the rest of,if it had been a movie it is a great movie with the best acting job of all
1,as the movie progressed we were treated to the characters we see and we never see anything that,as i recall it was so bad that i could n't even remember any of the characters
1,jack palance is excellent here as a villain,jack 's brother is not an easy target for
1,granted the movie was pretty bad but it was not that,granted the film is a bit too much for me
1,and the movie 's plot is about how much,and then the whole movie just gets worse
1,oh and i was so disappointed that i could,oh yea i was n't really a kid
1,i have n't seen it since the first time i watch,i was surprised that this film would be a flop
1,i would n't recommend this movie to any people who can,i have been waiting for a movie to be better
1,beyond that the film has no redeeming qualities to the film,beyond all the script is not the best i 've ever seen
1,i have n't seen this movie in a long time,i saw this on cable tv at a preview store
1,sets are the main problem with this film,sets in a town that will make you want
1,it seems that the filmmakers have been making a good film and have some very good,it 's a shame he was n't in the movie for more than five seconds
1,anyway if you are not into this movie do n't bother with,anyway i do n't understand why people are not so popular
1,he 's not a big fat jerk and a lot of the movie 's charm,he is a good actor and he is not in it for his role
1,considering the fact that the director had the audacity to create a movie which,considering the subject matter i would have given it the vote higher rating
1,the acting is terrible the script is horrible the direction is bad the editing is horrible,the film is a bit long but it is not too much of a drama and a
1,a lot of the dialogue is so stupid it 's almost comical,a lot of this film is just as good as the book
1,i think that was what happened in the first film,i have no problem with the fact of this movie being
1,granted this movie has some of the most hilarious moments i 've ever witnessed,granted it 's a pretty cool film but it is very very bad
1,the plot is so bad the acting is worse the script is terrible and,the only good thing is that there is n't a lot to recommend
1,this film is a must see,this is a film of a film
1,could n't they have been a bit cranky and,could have been done in a good hurry
1,i am not a fan of the original series and this is one of the best,i do n't think that a person could possibly enjoy this movie as a comedy but it
1,i saw the movie yesterday and was shocked to see the movie,i have seen this movie in the past several years and i was
1,but it 's also an enjoyable show,but i have never forgotten a movie like
1,the movie is a little over the top and it has the usual suspects that are the main points of,the plot is simple and the characters are so boring that it makes for a good film to watch
1,it 's not the worst i 've seen in a long time,it has to be the worst movie i have ever seen
1,somehow it was just another case of the original,somehow the film itself is quite slow and the pace
1,what we get to see is a bit of a puzzle,what 's more the film is just a piece of crap
1,overall i would recommend this movie to all,overall a very good show to watch
1,the film is a bit of a mess but as a whole this,the film 's climax is a classic as the story unfolds slowly
1,and the film is so bad that it makes the whole movie feel like a student movie,and there is no plot or plot development and the whole film seems forced to lose some spark
1,it was a complete waste of time,it is not a film that i would
1,it 's a shame that the director never made more,it is n't even funny enough to be funny
1,is it that a bunch of scientists who,is n't it that good or bad
1,but that 's what this film does and is one of the best,but the movie is so poorly constructed that it 's hard to understand why
1,blanca has an excellent ability of making her character believable and believable,blanca and emma were the most likable characters in the movie
1,he is a great artist and he 's a good,he also is a great actor in this film
1,the story is about a girl who gets her husband to go after her,the film is about a man who gets a job of a job in the
1,one of the most beautiful scenes of the film,one of the most beautiful movies ever made
1,jackson was also in the cast and was very effective in the movie,jackson has a great voice but he is not the same actor
1,the movie is just about a group of teenagers who want to live in a,the film 's plot is so thin that you 'll never see the ending
1,i think this is one of the most enjoyable films of,i saw this film in the theater in my memory
1,the plot is a lot of holes and is n't worth watching,the story is simple the actors are all very good and the story
1,take the scene at the airport when the guy says oh god i ca n't say,take this movie and make the movie as good as you can get it right
1,i'm sure that the filmmakers were n't paying money to make,i'm not even sure what to say about this show
1,this is a great movie with a message that the director of photography was very interested in,this is the only movie i have seen from the first film with that kind of humour
1,this film has the feel of a tv show and the acting,this film is not only for the fans of the genre
1,well i think the best part of this movie was the music which was very nice,well you have to see it to understand what 's going on in the film
1,the only thing this film had going for it was the acting the,the movie also suffers from a very poor script and bad acting
1,bozz 's mother is a woman in paris,bozz is a former cop who is sent to
1,many of the other reviews here have criticized this show and i have no complaints of the people involved with the show i do n't understand,many of my friends think that i would have been in the same class of a movie as the worst of them and i do n't even
1,but the movie is n't bad,but the rest of the cast are
1,the only reason i watched it is because it 's a comedy and as a comedy it is a must,the story is a little thin for a thriller but i think it 's a very important thing to follow
1,once a year is n't all this is,once again this was a great movie
1,if you 're looking for a movie with a good plot a good acting and a good plot then this movie is for you and for,if you want to see a movie that does n't make you think you want to see the first one you need to watch it
1,what 's more interesting is how the writers have managed to build the story and make them,what 's so bad about this film is that it 's not even a bad movie
1,the only thing good about this is the fact that,the movie is a little bit of a thriller
1,it is one of my favorites,it is one of the worst films
1,at the end i was surprised by the ending and i was n't really expecting,at first i do n't know why this movie flopped in the first place
1,to be honest i was surprised to hear,to be fair the story is simple
1,if you have not read the book you 'll be disappointed,if you have n't seen this movie you can see why
1,the story is about a bunch of four friends who want the two to get,the acting is horrible and the plot is so predictable it 's almost laughable
1,that is what the whole movie is,that 's the way i feel
1,this movie is a waste of time and money,this is a very poor attempt to recreate the world
1,this is not your typical bollywood film but it is a real treat in its depiction of the life of people of the time,this is not an excellent film but its good to see how it 's in the works of the great director and the director and
1,when i saw this film it would make my eyes bleed,when i saw it i had to see it again after it
1,the first one was a bit more enjoyable,the acting is n't bad the script is n't
1,in one of the most ridiculous films ever made it 's a very bad film and it 's not even the,in the movie the actors are not the same as the one who did the same thing in the movie
1,it 's like they are watching something that 's not even funny,it 's like a movie that was supposed to be made with the
1,the plot is pretty good the acting was pretty,the acting of the leads is very good
1,that is n't a bad thing because this show,that would n't be too hard to explain
1,yes the plot is a little convoluted,yes it does have the typical elements of
1,this film was not so well written and acted,this is one of those films that i have not
1,instead we get a very lame plot and a few characters that are not,instead the movie is set in the future of the early 20th century
1,this is one of the worst films i,this is the worst movie of 2008
1,the acting of the main leads and the story is just a mess,the movie is a bit of an attempt at making a movie
1,what 's more the most interesting aspect of the film is how,what i did like was this movie 's a good thing
1,better still a film that could have easily passed away,better yet not as much as it could have been
1,i was expecting more from him,i was n't expecting this movie to
1,more importantly it 's a film that does n't have to be a thriller or an adult movie that is a good one to,more than a little a bit of an insult to me i could have cared for a few characters but they were not
1,nobody should know what to expect from the other members of,nobody has a clue what the movie was really about
1,he is one of the funniest characters in the film,he is n't the best man on the planet
1,gong li was a good choice and i have to,gong li is the best character in this movie
1,this film is the most beautiful film i have ever seen,this film is so awful that it could n't even make it
1,the movie is about a group of people who are sent to a planet to search for,the only reason to see the movie is because the director wanted to do the film
1,why did n't they just make a movie,why did they just make the movie
1,that 's why this film is so much of a surprise that it has a,that 's a shame because the film 's only redeeming feature is the music
1,otherwise it 's not that bad,otherwise a film that should be viewed
1,if you 're going to give this movie a go it 'll be,if you have n't seen this film you 'll probably be disappointed
1,there are so many things wrong with this movie i do n't understand why they made this movie,there 's no denying that this was supposed to be a comedy but it 's a little too serious
1,the film has some good points but is so,the acting in my opinion is very good
1,where the film is the best thing you can say about,where is it that is n't explained in any way
1,nobody is even remotely sympathetic to the movie,nobody knows where this movie came from but it
1,victor has never been a great actor in the past few years,victor mclaglen plays a young man who is assigned to become an international
1,everybody has a very funny scene,everybody else is a little weak and
1,the movie was very good in this one and it 's a shame the,the movie starts out as though he 's trying to solve a crime
1,i have no doubt that i would be more than willing to go out and see this film but i do,i think the film was a little too long for me because of its technical content and a great cast
1,as for that i found that the movie was very funny and was,as far as i can tell it is not even a film
1,people like the movie 's plot were very very stupid,people who have been in the military and the media has
1,the plot is simple and the film is a mess,the film is set in the future of the early 1950
1,but there 's a lot of the same thing in the movie,but the movie was not about the war of the world
1,but there are also some really great moments,but then he 's still trying to get rid
1,even the actors are not bad and the movie lacks any of it,even if this movie did a good job of portraying the characters in general
1,yeah the plot is n't that funny anymore,yeah i 've heard it was n't so bad
1,harry callahan is one of our favorite movies,harry is in this movie he plays an american
1,john goodman plays an annoying man who wants to be an american,john wayne 's first film appearance as the director of the movie did
1,however the movie is n't as bad as it should have been,however the story of the girl is quite interesting and it 's not
1,in the end the story is a little confusing and is n't funny,in the end it is not worth seeing the film as it does n't
1,perhaps the best thing about the film is the way it 's filmed,perhaps the best thing about this movie was the fact that the director was
1,to make matters worse the script and editing are all terrible and the plot is,to be honest it 's pretty much a film that i could relate to
1,add to that the excellent acting by john cusack and you 'll be amazed by what he was doing in this,add up the film with its characters all the way through the film and the film is a real treat
1,not only does the story have a great premise and it does a pretty good job with it 's characters,not to mention the whole film is just another excuse for the movie to show the world of a man who
1,what i found interesting was how many of the characters were developed,what i got is the story of a family who is a teenager
1,sorry to see if you are in the mood for a fun romp this will probably appeal,sorry folks but this is a great example of how a movie can be so bad it 's
1,the story line is so bad that they make it difficult to follow it,the film also stars the young kirsten dunst who played in the original movie the
1,but i guess the story is very good and,but it 's not just a bad movie
1,it 's an awful film and a complete waste of the talents of the two main,it is a shame it did not win a razzie award for best supporting actress
1,the movie is a complete failure,the acting was n't bad the actors
1,although the movie is not as good it just does n't have to be that bad,although it 's true that the film has been a major success for many years now i
1,once again i was impressed with the movie,once the action starts and it 's a bit
1,i think this movie has a lot more to offer than it deserves,i 've seen the same film twice as much as this movie
1,the movie is a very bad movie,the film is also a complete waste of
1,it 's just a bad movie to see if they were trying to,it is a film with no substance or any sense of reality
1,for those who like this show as they are i will never see this film again on screen again,for the rest of my life i have no idea how many times this film is a complete joke
1,this is a movie for a few reasons and i do n't want it,this movie was made on the cheap and the way the story unfolds
1,anwar 's character has a very interesting role to play in the movie 's story and it is easy to see how he 's going to turn,anwar 's wife has to be seen as the most beautiful of the world and she gives her a good opportunity to make her look good
1,in fact i have not been able to get into the movie but,in the end i felt cheated by the end of the film
1,i do have to say that i was n't disappointed,i think the movie is a little better than the first
1,we have a movie about the life of a young man who,we have a few good movies with some of the best
1,i was n't really expecting anything else to watch this film but it was still fun seeing,i have never been a fan of the series but i am surprised to see how many movies
1,its the same as the first one which is so stupid so stupid in that you ca n't help but feel sorry for,its the only time the story of a man who 's been in love with his brother and the girl is engaged
1,his performance is n't too bad but it is the funniest performance of his career and his acting style,his character is supposed to be a little too old to be funny but he has no talent
1,this is a pretty awful movie but the director and director are just too stupid to be a good,this movie was not for the faint of heart but it is a good film to be seen
1,this is one of those films that you would love to watch,this is n't an action film it is n't a movie
1,how about the whole concept of a film,how does it look like it 's a cheap
1,much of the film takes place in a small town where the movie is set in,much like the film it seems to have been done in one way or another
1,why did i even care about the character,why is it a matter of what the movie
1,i 've never heard that in my life do they want to make a film,i have never heard of this show and i have never heard of it
1,actually i have seen a lot of bad films,actually this film has a lot of action sequences and
1,very disappointing in a sense that is a bit too hard to understand but the film has a,very much of the plot is the acting is terrible as is the script and the direction
1,the script by neil simon is a mess of the sort that was made at the time it 's just boring and predictable,the movie 's premise is the same as a woman who is a woman who is not an easy target for her mother
1,as a matter of fact one is the only reason this film works,as i said the story was very good and the acting was great especially
1,i am a fan of the first three,i 've seen this movie several times in my
1,watching the movie i was n't expecting much of it,watching the film i was hoping that a more violent approach
1,the film is also a great documentary about life in a different world and is a great movie,the only reason to watch this film was to see what could 've happened to the young man 's
1,so i can only assume that the movie has a little bit more going for it and that the plot is more interesting than the book,so many of us know that there are some people like the people who are the ones who did n't care about the story but they are
1,on a whole one night at mccool 's tv i 've seen this film on tv and i can remember that,on the whole it seemed like a good idea the film has a lot of great action scenes and a good story
1,with this movie i was a little sceptical at the end and the ending is really really bad,with the help of an attractive young woman the woman and the woman who is supposed to have the
1,the film has a lot of action in,the first film is a complete bore
1,she is a beautiful woman but she is not in the book,she was a little too young but the character was very well done
1,if i was n't so irritated i might have to say it is a,if you do n't have a bad movie then i recommend this film
1,it 's a movie of sorts and the movie is a complete mess,it 's a shame that the movie was made by a wider group of
1,mishima is not only a film about a man 's life and how he,mishima also shows us why a person is born in a mental institution
1,for a film about a group of people who have to deal with the,for instance the scene with the dog in the woods was a joke
1,get back to the original version which i have watched on,get a job of this movie and then see it
1,rachel mcadams is a delight for a long time,rachel mcadams is a wonderful actress as she plays a
1,i'm not one to disagree with the critics who say that,i'm not saying it was so bad it is good
1,together we can tell the truth is the fact that this is a movie that,together with a few exceptions it does n't make the grade bad movie watchable
1,this is a very funny film,this time i was watching the movie
1,burtynsky 's direction is very very good,burtynsky 's character is not as complex as
1,if you want to watch a movie about an alcoholic who is trying to be a good film then this is the movie for you,if i could make a movie i 'd be so disgusted and i have to admit that i am still a fan of the movie i
1,oxygen is one of those films that you do n't want to miss in the first 20,oxygen 's father is a beautiful and intelligent film with a very dark feel to it
1,the plot and the dialogue are all,the plot is a bit confusing
1,the acting in the first half of the movie is excellent,the only thing that makes it worth watching is to watch a
1,this was a good movie to watch,this was a great show to me
1,those who have n't seen the movie will understand what 's going on and they are n't going to be able to see it at least once,those who have never seen the film will agree with me that this is a movie that is so bad that it is hard to believe a film
1,tallulah bankhead is great as always she does a good job as the,tallulah bankhead is one of the best actresses i 've ever seen
1,yet the film 's message is there is nothing wrong with the,yet he 's never been made to look for a camera
1,anna biller has a lot of screen time but,anna 's father is a real estate agent
1,it is not a very bad film but it,it 's all that 's done to us
1,you can tell it 's a good movie and it 's,you have to be a huge fan of the genre
1,the story is very weak as the plot develops in flashback,the first thing i noticed was that it was a little too
1,their character is so stupid i wonder how they could make a movie like this,their relationship develops as the main characters are treated by their friends and a couple of
1,words are not funny either which is why it is such a good film,words that were supposed to be used to describe the film as a whole were
1,also the acting was horrible the plot was awful,also it is very funny to hear the words of
1,he is the only one in the world that can save him and he does n't want to get out of it,he has to deal with a woman who is the son of his son who is the father of the son
1,i saw this movie and was not surprised by it,i have never been to a movie where i have a
1,whitaker 's character is so unlikable it could be a daunting task if he was just a,whitaker is very effective as the conflicted and frustrated wife but he is a real jerk
1,but the story is a bit too predictable and the,but the film is a total waste of time
1,sure it 's not the worst movie,sure it is a good film
1,for me the movie has the most memorable moment in the entire film where the characters are in a mental institution,for example the scene where he is on his way out of his coffin is a bit of a shame
1,the movie also has a lot of plot twists and the ending is very predictable,the acting is superb and the plot is so real and so funny that it 's
1,i have seen many movies in my time and it 's not the worst,i have seen it many times and am not afraid to see it
1,but it is very difficult to watch,but it was a good movie
1,i do n't even care if they are trying to be the,i was expecting an oscar winner but he was so bad
1,the film does n't have much to offer and the script is n't even remotely funny,the film also shows the life of a young woman who is a woman and is not
1,the only reason i give this movie a 4 is because the plot was,the only reason that this show is in the least is the understatement
1,some of the scenes where a couple of the characters interact with each other,some have said that this is a good movie but not as good as some
1,so the film starts with the main character a young man who,so i guess the movie 's biggest problem is the ending
1,the movie is n't that bad and,the film is a real treat
1,this one has it all bad acting awful dialogue and the worst special effects i have ever seen in a movie,this movie could easily have been made by people who do n't understand what the movie is trying to achieve and the
1,instead it shows some of these qualities to the characters,instead of a film that 's about the only thing that
1,in the first part we see a bunch of guys and the two drunks,in the end i could n't help but think of a film with a great
1,this is the only film that i can recall when i was a little bit more on the verge of the story of the,this film is a complete disaster and should have had the director of the book a lot more than a few hundred minutes
1,just do n't expect to see the,just a lot of other things
1,patricia arquette is great in her part as the,patricia bergen was also great in the film
1,as for the rest i think it would have been an,as for the movie it 's a very good movie
1,the plot and the performances of the characters are so good that,the first movie has a very good soundtrack by jerry goldsmith
1,caesar 's direction is excellent in the film,caesar is not a very good actor
1,we are given the opportunity to see a good movie that is very good,we have all the old people living in our lives in our lives
1,romain duris is great in this movie,romain duris plays him in an unusual role
1,so if you want to see an excellent actor that 's very well written acted directed and acted this film is for you,so i do n't have a clue why but if you want a movie to watch and enjoy a lot of fun and action
1,ok this movie had some of the worst acting i 've,ok it 's a good thing to go to film
1,gwyneth paltrow is excellent in this film,gwyneth paltrow is the best thing she can
1,it is also the story of two sisters that have,it is a movie that will appeal to everyone
1,this is one of the best movies in a very long time,this is the first film that i saw that was a bit of
1,having said that it is one of the best animated movie,having said all that it is a very good show
1,the movie is not very much,the only problem with this show is
1,never mind that it 's a movie about one of,never before has anyone ever heard of this movie
1,this movie has the worst acting i 've seen in a long time,this one is a great example of what happens when the characters have a
1,the acting of the actors who play alex are not bad,the story is very simple and it 's the story that is
1,otherwise there are a few laughs,otherwise i would recommend this for anyone
1,i saw him as a teenager on the run and he 's still the only,i was a little surprised that this was not a sequel to the original
1,michael caine does a great turn as the villain,michael ironside is a great actor and he has done
1,she 's the most likable actress in the movie but she looks like it 's just too,she 's also a little stiff but she does n't have to worry about the character
1,schneider is the only one who manages to pull a film off with a good performance from an excellent performance by john huston,schneider 's character was a very likable man who was n't in any way shove her down and in some ways he is n't
1,well that 's not all bad it has to offer,well i have to say the acting is terrible
1,now that he 's a big fan of the show and the fact that the movie was n't really a great deal of work is beyond me,now i have to say i liked the way the movie ended and the movie had a nice twist ending that was so great i was surprised i
1,6 i did n't like this movie but it had it 's moments but it was very poorly done and not,6 it 's a shame that the film is not available in dvd with a dvd release of the movie
1,when the main character dies the girl gets killed by a werewolf,when i heard about the film i thought oh the title
1,without doubt this movie had a very good story line,without any of them you would think they were going to
1,i do n't think it is possible to say anything positive about this one,i am a fan of the original series and i am glad i did n't
1,there is no reason that the film is not in the book,there 's not a good one in this one but i do think
1,it 's not even worth renting for the dvd,it 's a pity that this film is not available
1,his wife is a man who has,his character is the only one
1,in the end the whole film was so stupid it was almost unbearable to watch,in the film 's defense he 's a man who is a man with no knowledge
1,yet the film does n't have the impact to make you feel as if you 've been watching a movie from the past the last 30,yet there are some moments that are really funny with the occasional closeups of a woman walking around naked naked and naked in a bath
1,i have never forgotten the last one and this has got to be one of the worst,i was very skeptical about this movie and was surprised by that it was so awful
1,she is a very good actress in,she is n't a good actress
1,but there 's a lot of the same old jokes a lot of the jokes and gags are funny and the acting is pretty,but the story is not all that good and i did find that the film is n't as good as the first one
1,meanwhile it was made to cash in on the success of the first two films,meanwhile the woman 's father is in a wheelchair and is forced to accept a new
1,enough to be a good film and it 's a bit hard,enough a few minutes and so much time wasted on that
1,salt and ice cream is an interesting film,salt was a good movie but it just did
1,this movie was n't even good,this is not a film that will
1,but the story is n't really about two young women who live in an isolated hotel with their,but i have to admit that i had n't read the book so i could not resist
1,i saw the trailer for this show and i think it,i am so glad they got to see this movie
1,schultz was n't in his movie career but he did a great job of portraying the character of the movie,schultz is a very young woman in the film as well as a young woman who becomes involved with her daughter
1,sites are always good and the cast is n't all that great but they do n't do much,sites that are so funny and fun are the same jokes and the only thing that makes me chuckle
1,he 's got the right idea of an old guy who is a little more suited to his family than he,he 's the perfect person but he does n't have the charisma and charisma that he 's been doing lately
1,all in all an interesting and enjoyable film,all of the actors were great the actors were
1,overall this is a very enjoyable movie,overall it 's worth the price
1,unfortunately i ca n't say that i liked this show,unfortunately the movie is n't as good and it has been
1,if you are not a fan of the original series watch this film and do not expect a masterpiece of any sort or other movie,if you can find a copy of this film and have to choose the language to get the soundtrack and you 're reading it then you
1,at one point the movie is shot at the same location and it has to be the best music of the movie,at one time you have no idea what it is about but i do n't know what the movie was about
1,visually the film is a real treat for,visually it 's just another bad film
1,of course the film itself is a very different way to spend a couple of hours in paris,of course the movie has some really good points in that the movie is just plain bad
1,this is the first movie that i saw in,this movie is so bad it was good
1,it seems to have been shot on a low budget,it 's all about the same but the rest of the
1,i would have loved it more and more,i would give this movie a rating of 1
1,you 're in for a treat,you will get the feeling he was
1,nor does i care about any of the characters,nor could anybody else find out what happened to him
1,all of this is the reason why the,all of this was a big surprise
1,there are also a few scenes that make you jump in disbelief,there was an obvious explanation for the story of the characters that were
1,in fact if you do n't like this show then you will be very impressed,in this case they are the only people on the planet who have n't even been
1,no matter what they do in this film it is not as simple to make a decision as,no matter how much it was meant to be a comedy it 's very entertaining and entertaining
1,when you see a movie this is just a joke,when she returns to the village the movie is a little
1,handsome young women with a healthy past are,handsome young people are a common denominator
1,yes it is a comedy but you 'll probably enjoy it,yes i know it was n't going to be a good movie
1,their performances are very believable and believable but the plot is n't too bad,their lives are very interesting and are n't too bad but i ca n't say
1,thing about it is that the film is so bad,thing is a little farfetched as is the story
1,everywhere the movie is just a bunch of random,everywhere i 've seen some of the others
1,as for the acting it was n't bad but it had a very good cast and some,as for the story i think the main characters were all pretty much like they were
1,on the other hand i found the story and characters to be very believable,on the other hand the film is not the only movie that i think the
1,scott and his wife 's boyfriend and sister are a very nice guy who is a,scott and the other actors are the main reason i wanted to see it for
1,i'm a big fan of horror horror movies and this movie is the exception,i'm sure it would make some viewers feel as if we were watching the same
1,this movie was made on a shoestring budget but with a low budget,this is a great family movie that will make you laugh at the fact
1,duris 's character was so unlikable and his performance in this film was a little weak,duris does a wonderful job as usual as he 's a good actor but he was also
1,an example of the movie is the way the characters talk in a way that it,an american film maker who has done it has to be a very talented director
1,the acting is superb the writing is good,the story is simple and very entertaining
1,ultimately there 's a very good cast that 's also a bit odd but it 's a little too long,ultimately this film is about a group trying to survive from their jobs to save their lives but in the end
1,the movie also features a great deal of humor and some great acting,the only thing that really bothered me about this one are the acting
1,worst of all it was a very poor attempt,worst of all was the acting and editing
1,in fact the entire cast is very good and the,in fact this movie was a waste of time
1,this was the best film i have ever witnessed,this is not the case with the movie
1,stray dog is a movie that is n't even bad,stray dog is a film that i would n't have seen
1,it would be nice to see a movie like this,it does not have to have a great cast
1,yes i know the film is a little bit of a mess but it is,yes the acting was good the writing was good even the directing is bad
1,dick tracy is the only character who is the best character in this movie as it is supposed to be in the same way he does with the same kind of character,dick tracy 's film is one of those movies that i would not have missed so i could have had the chance to see another sequel in the series and i will be
1,it 's not even a good film,it 's the worst kind of movie that
1,letting it all hang and it 's just not a movie,letting it be said that the actors were pretty good
1,in a nutshell i think the reason for this movie 's release is that it was not a total success of,in fact i do n't think it was the intention to get rid of the characters in the first place
1,in this movie there is a lot of the movie 's problems,in the end you 'll find yourself wondering if he 'd ever had
1,it was a very nice movie to watch and i loved it,it 's just a little bit of a shame that this film had
1,every one of them is the best,every scene is a bit confusing
1,one of the most memorable films i have ever seen,one thing that 's wrong with this movie is the ending
1,the only good scene in the movie is where he is in a,the plot twists are so bad that it 's impossible to tell
1,it 's the worst movie i have ever seen,it 's just a bunch of kids getting into the
1,unlike in most movies there are so many ways out in the world that are so funny that you do not need to,unlike other movies the acting is great and the story makes one wonder what the director was trying to do with it
1,storyline is a little choppy at times but the story is so complex and,storyline is a little confusing but as it is n't a good one
1,what we get instead is a story of two young people,what makes this movie interesting is its lack of originality
1,if you are a horror fan you will enjoy this film,if you want to see a truly funny movie you will love
1,this is a movie that is so bad that you ca n't help but laugh,this movie had a great deal of humor in it for me as well as a
1,i do n't know what to say about this movie but,i do n't even care why this film got released
1,first it is not a film about a serial killer that he,first of all this was a movie made by an american
1,in the meantime i would give the movie a 10 out of 10 i did,in the end i found it very disappointing but the movie was very good
1,they 're all in the same predicament with their lives,they all had a very funny and very good script
1,they are just as good as some of the best of,they have to be the worst of any of them
1,i have seen the original film but this movie was a,i think he 's just too bad a character actor
1,has the viewer feel for his family,has anyone who 's a fan of hers
1,ok this is a movie that i think of this film is not a good movie but it is a,ok so the main character dies and is forced to go to the city for his father 's funeral
1,it has a great cast and a decent cast,it is also one of the most memorable and moving
1,you know you were in for a real treat and then the,you can watch them and get them to know the difference
1,the movie is about a bunch of people who have sex with the children,the story is about love love and love but that 's just the point
1,even though the film is supposed to be about the human condition of the film the movie is not about,even if it is supposed to be an homage to the original i would have given this a 10
1,this is not a movie about the war,this is one of those movies that i think
1,i do n't think that this movie is a real masterpiece,i do n't know why it was n't the worst film ever
1,yes this movie is not for everyone,yes there are some nice moments in the
1,note how did the director have this,note that i was n't a fan of
1,i was a bit skeptical about the plot and the ending but it was,i 've read the book and i think it 's an awesome movie
1,in one word she is the only person who can speak in this film to a child,in fact i 've never seen a movie actively uttering that kind of story but i do n't
1,finally the story of the film is very different,finally the movie is a complete mess and it fails
1,frazzled people do n't know who they should or why they want to kill the killer,frazzled but the movie does n't have to be the easiest to find it anywhere
1,the movie is about the power of a group of men and their relationship,the story of a widowed woman who has to be found on a small island
1,kaurwaki is a good woman but her mother is a bit of,kaurwaki is a great actress she plays her character very convincingly
1,as an actor he looks so bad he looks embarrassed and,as a matter of fact i do n't think so
1,unfortunately this is n't a bad film,unfortunately the film does n't have a coherent
1,apparently the movie has a very limited budget and is probably one of,apparently he is not in the same league as he is here
1,during the first half of the film i found myself cheering,during a few years this movie is a total disaster
1,this is a great film and the movie was,this has to be the best movie ever
1,it was the first time that i saw the film on tv,it 's a shame as to who is going to be in the
1,if you 're into a horror movie do n't waste your time,if you 're looking for a good horror movie this is definitely one
1,at that point we get a glimpse of the characters of the,at least the story of the novel was a bit farfetched
1,alex is the real person in the film and it is a pity that he was n't in the film or his,alex is a good guy who is a little bit too young to understand his own life in the first place
1,i was so bored when he made a film called,i think that the director is a talented actor
1,i do n't think that it is a bad film,i saw the preview for this movie on the scifi channel
1,though a bit of the film has been done in several ways it 's not very well developed,though the story is a little predictable the ending is a bit too weak and it 's not worth
1,he was the first film he made and it,he is the best of all he can
1,but then the film is so bad,but this was an excellent performance
1,alas it does n't even matter,alas it 's too bad that the
1,when it comes to the movies the director 's commentary has been made,when i first saw it on the scifi channel i thought that it was
1,the script is a joke from beginning to end,the movie does have a great cast but the movie
1,the film was shot in black and white and the actors were all excellent,the only way to get the movie is a great idea was that they had
1,the first thing you notice about this film is that it is a very bad film,the story itself was so predictable that i could n't help but laugh at the clock
1,which is why this movie is not a good one,which i do n't like in a lot of movies
1,i was a little confused at first and did a very good job,i do n't understand why i bothered i could n't find a way to
1,that said it 's a great movie,that said this film was made for television
1,his performance was so bad that he made it impossible,his role is also quite strong and very convincing
1,i would say this movie is a must see for anyone interested in a great film,i was n't even aware of the movie as it was so bad that it had no
1,i am a fan of the first movie but this one was,i am sure it was n't a movie or a movie
1,i was so excited when i heard of this movie,i have seen the film dozens of times and it is
1,something that is supposed to be a spoof for,something that would have made a good film
1,they should be ashamed of themselves,they 're just trying to save the
1,in fact i would have preferred the movie to have,in a way they were n't all that bad
1,apart from the presence of a few people in the cast the film is,apart from a few good moments the whole story is just plain dumb
1,for a film made in the seventies it is a movie to avoid,for instance in the scene where the woman is in the house of her
1,while it is a true story the acting is very good and the story is good,while the story is quite simple and the plot is not all that great and it is
1,do n't watch this film you 'll see,do n't worry me this film sucks
1,this is the best example of a good film i have seen and it 's,this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen in my life
1,candy 's character in this movie was not even remotely good,candy has some nice moments with her but it 's not the
1,i'm a fan of the original and i do,i'm not going to give the same away
1,rounding off a copy of this is the most disturbing thing,rounding out the cast is a great deal of talent
1,it 's a great movie and a great movie,it 's a good movie but a good one
1,the movie has been said to be,the movie is n't even funny
1,kimberly barrymore is a fine actress who 's always a pleasure to watch and the film has a lot of good performances and,kimberly bates is a good woman she is good as an old man she does n't have much of a role model
1,grudgingly he is forced to leave the city to,grudgingly he was able to pull it off
1,or the fact that she 's the best thing on earth ever gets in her way and she has to be one of the,or maybe it would be a better idea if it is a drama and a comedy but i think it would be better
1,post traumatic stress is not the only film that makes it even scarier to watch,post apocalyptic war is a film about a young boy who travels to the west to
1,first off it is n't a bad movie,first of all if you are a fan of
1,if you 're looking for an action movie with no real scares or thrills you 're in for a treat,if you like a film that you will never understand as a matter what happens when you see the film it
1,you will see the end of this movie,you have to have the ability to read this
1,i do n't think i 'll see this film again,i 've been watching this one several times over the years
1,my favorite line of all is that i was n't laughing at a movie,my only complaint is that the story is a mess of a movie
1,i 've just been waiting for a movie to happen in the past,i was hoping that he was in for a rough ride but he is
1,so many people do not like this movie because it seems that all of the people in the audience are not really enjoying the film,so many of the things that made me so mad and disgusted was to see that i had to see a film about the evils of
1,save your money and wait and see what it is,save yourself the time and money do n't waste your time
1,i do n't think that the film was made,i would n't recommend this movie to anyone
1,but this is not a movie,but the movie 's plot is a
1,i 've been watching this one many times and have watched,i think the movie is a masterpiece of the genre
1,in this one it 's very clear that he 's a coward,in addition to the film 's success it is a film about a
1,strange and unsettling in all aspects,strange that the movie 's success is
1,this is a movie that i think is a very good and enjoyable movie,this is a movie that you 'll enjoy from a friend 's time
1,he plays the part with a very broad intensity,he plays a good role and plays a character named
1,its not just an attempt to cash in on the success of the book it has the same story as the original,its not as good either as a film it is a film about a woman and her family that has the ability to
1,this film should have been made to be a good movie but it,this movie is just a waste of time and time and money
1,the film was a lot more than the first one,the plot has a couple of good twists to say
1,i do n't know why i did n't have a clue,i was expecting the most shocking movie to be a good one
1,the story of a group of teenagers who have been a big success are the main characters,the film is a bit slow at times but overall it is a very enjoyable movie
1,do n't bother with this movie,do you know the plot and you
1,this is what i thought was a good idea of what,this is one of the best movies of the year
1,i think i would have done better myself if i had seen the original and it was n't,i do not think that the director should be allowed to be a hero but he does n't want
1,answer to a story of this woman that is not only the one responsible to survive she is a young woman who,answer is that the film is not only an attempt to introduce some kind of story but it does not work
1,overall a great movie with a nice cast,overall the film is a bit dated
1,it 's not even a comedy,it is the most powerful thing in
1,this movie had me laughing so hard,this is not one of them
1,or is there an opportunity to show a little more than just the same old stuff,or if this is n't a bad thing i think this is the movie i had hoped
1,if you have read the book this is a pretty good adaptation,if you are an old person i would recommend you watch this movie
1,shakespeare and his crew make a great film,shakespeare has made his own films so that he
1,when he returns home he becomes a little too young,when i was younger i could n't find a good reason
1,18 years earlier the director of this movie was,18 the story is a lot of fun
1,there are some nice scenes but not enough for me to really care for them,there is a lot of action in the movie but it is not a bad movie
1,often it 's a great story but the acting is n't as great as in the,often i felt compelled to watch the whole thing hoping that it would get better
1,he has a very good sense of humor and is a great actor,he is not just a good person he is a true believer on human
1,its a good movie with some great actors,its a shame they do n't make a sequel
1,while the acting is bad the script is a bit thin but the actors are so bad i could n't,while i think the film could have been done in less of a budget it 's a bit long
1,i do n't think this movie should be a big success,i do n't remember it being so bad it 's funny and
1,an excellent cast is wasted on this one,an interesting movie for me to watch
1,shortly thereafter the film 's director 's wife and the,shortly later the film becomes a little too long
1,so it 's a shame that a lot of people here are,so it is an important role to be a good movie
1,the only good thing about this film was the fact that it was filmed in a very grainy and cheap manner,the acting is terrible and the script is so bad that it 's hard to believe that it was made in a
1,i would have liked to have known that a little more would have,i was really surprised by the movie but that did n't help
1,we are not shown to be a part of the world,we have a few of the scenes with a couple of other
1,slim has been a favorite of mine since the 1950 's and it 's always a pleasure to see him in a movie,slim is not the only film that i could not recommend this to anyone interested in a story that has a very good cast
1,this movie has nothing that makes you want to see more,this is a very good show that i would recommend
1,it 's a great movie about life,it 's a pity that the movie never
1,such is the case with the director who 's obviously trying to,such a shame that it 's a good film to watch
1,i have to say the ending is just so stupid,i am not going to be able to sit through any
1,the only good thing is the fact that there 's,the film was shot with a digital handheld camcorder
1,the acting is pretty bad especially by luke wilson who,the film has a very nice soundtrack to it
1,this is one of the worst of the year,this film had a very funny story and some great
1,jamie foxx plays a woman who gets a,jamie lynn spears is a great actor
1,however i did like the film,however this was one of the worst
1,but the rest of the cast was very good,but i think this is a great game
1,gung ho is a movie which is so bad that it actually makes,gung ho was a good film for those who enjoyed the movie
1,not that i think that the movie was a waste of time but if i,not only was this film a success it had the potential to be good
1,and then the story is set in the middle,and i have seen some pretty good movies
1,in fact i was surprised by the acting and directing,in fact they are all just so stupid that the movie
1,leslie vernon and george clooney play a very loudly creepy guy,leslie nielsen plays a man named sam who has to go to
1,the plot twists are so predictable and contrived that they become a chore to sit through,the story revolves around the lives of two friends of two men a young boy named sasha
1,please avoid this movie like i was in the mood to find it,please avoid this movie at all costs and if you can find it it
1,something like this happened in that movie,something that was not funny was a complete
1,whalley and the rest of her life were the best in the movie,whalley 's role has an innate sense of humor and the ability for her
1,the movie has an interesting concept but the movie is very good for the whole family,the film is a bit boring and i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie
1,this is a film that will keep you interested and,this movie is just a good movie to watch
1,the only thing missing in this movie is a scene,the film is n't even worth mentioning to me
1,i would n't recommend this to any other movie buff and to avoid,i do not know what to say but that 's what happened
1,altman 's direction is a direct contrast,altman is also a great filmmaker
1,i would like to see this film again to,i 've always thought the story was good
1,i am not a huge fan of the genre but i have no clue what a real movie is,i was a little disappointed by this and even though i was n't watching it for quite a long time
1,examples of that i found myself asking for my money back when they were making movies,examples of the film are the scenes where a little extra of her face is cut to
1,tweed has a small role in his role,tweed is the only one who is able to
1,this is just an awful movie,this was a really awful movie
1,as for the film it 's not as bad as some of the films it has,as a result the plot is very simple and the acting and editing are awful
1,that is the main theme in this movie,that 's not to say there 's a lot
1,happy with his first meeting with the woman he,happy is the word that describe this movie
1,frees your local bank robbers from the united,frees the president for a long time
1,ah i 've seen a lot of the other comments,ah that was the first part of the movie
1,anyone who has a problem with this movie needs some more cash to get the message of it,anyone who is n't a fan of the show should avoid seeing it for the sake of a rental
1,he was in the movie for the first time on the sundance film festival so he had been making,he plays a good guy on the verge and he does n't have a clue about the movie
1,only to be made for the sake of watching,only the most ardent fan will see it
1,throwing in a few twists to make you jump,throwing momma 's character in his hands and the other
1,the film is a real treat,the movie is about a girl who
1,i have to agree with another review here that he was the greatest character on the show and the film was just a complete waste of,i am a sucker of the movies and this film has some very good qualities but the plot is so ridiculous that it becomes impossible
1,how can a man in a suit be,how did this happen in a film
1,this is the first movie that is better than this,this movie is not for those who want to laugh at
1,she 's got a great sense of humor,she 's not so hot as to be a
1,i do n't think that a lot of people liked this movie but i thought it,i was a little skeptical about this movie but it was a waste of time
1,on the other hand the acting is pretty good with all the cast members including peter cushing and,on the surface it is very good for a good movie about the man who plays othello
1,do n't get me wrong i love it but that,do yourself a favor do not watch this movie
1,i was expecting a lot more from this movie because it was a very interesting movie,i 've been watching this film countless times over the years and it is very difficult for
1,with a supposed budget of about 1000000 that is n't the best of the film,with the exception of a few exceptions i found this film to be a complete waste
1,although it 's not as good as the earlier film it is a great movie nonetheless,although it is not a great movie and it 's very difficult to follow it it 's
1,i do n't think this was the only,i was very impressed with the film
1,the story is about a young boy,the movie was very well made
1,masking the plot is a simple and sometimes funny little,masking this one it 's not really the case
1,and then you have a great movie,and i did n't really get that much
1,this is n't a very good film but it is a good film,this show has no redeeming quality whatsoever except for the fact that it 's
1,on the positive side it 's very good and i would recommend the film,on the other hand if you have seen the movie you 'll be disappointed
1,so what i do n't remember was that a good cast was wasted,so i have n't read the original and it 's not even the same
1,how does it have to be a movie,how about a film that was so bad that
1,maybe i 've seen more of him,maybe he 's just going to get the
1,despite being a good film it 's a great movie,despite a few faults the film also features some of its
1,it 's a good thing to say the least,it is one of those movies that you can watch
1,fortunately the film is n't even worth the time and,fortunately it is a little bit slow and dull
1,like the first film this has a few moments,like the rest of us you 'll have a good
1,the plot of the first episode is,the plot is a little convoluted
1,legendary cast member of the film and a supporting cast including a strong supporting cast a,legendary film maker michael winner is a master of art and the art of art
1,it was a nice surprise for me,it was n't that good either i was
1,the story of two sisters is a bit of a tragedy to watch,the film 's story is about the search for the man of the woman
1,military service is an example of a very good,military is not a movie i will watch
1,i have seen this film and i have to confess,i think that it was a good film to watch but
1,that 's what i would call a horror film with,that 's a very sad thing about this film
1,pearce plays a tough role in the film,pearce and his men in the movie are just
1,both the story and the characters are so good that it makes,both of these people have a good time in the film
1,we have the movie that makes this a film for anyone who is a fan,we are not supposed to be rooting for her in the beginning of her life
1,fresh riders are all the same and they are all the same,fresh out and present with the most memorable of the film is the
1,yes there is a lot of action in the movie but i think that the main character is,yes there 's some really good stuff about this movie but i really wanted to like it
1,apparently this is a film of the week when the film was made for,apparently there were many things that would make an adult movie like this
1,this is a pretty good film and a very good film but not enough to save the movie,this film is not for everyone especially for those who want to make a movie about a group of
1,i 've seen the first one and i was impressed by the,i do n't know why i watched this show so long
1,thanks to that there are some good actors in the movie,thanks to his best friend the man is the one who takes
1,go ahead and buy the dvd,go see the movie for the next
1,i saw this film on the sundance channel and it is a shame that the film does not,i think he is an actor and is very talented as the director of all this film
1,the story is a little too much on its own good and the characters all fall flat,the story is very thin and the characters are n't fleshed out as the story progresses
1,it was a complete waste of time and,it 's the best movie ever made
1,out of nowhere i 've seen the movie and it,out of ten because it is a good movie
1,in fact there were several things that were funny when it,in fact the whole movie seems rather like a student
1,as for the rest of the cast it 's a shame that this,as i said before the film 's style is very well done
1,the acting is horrible the effects are horrible the,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,its a shame because there are many,its the worst movie ever made
1,the script is a bit stilted but the characters are so interesting and funny and the characters in it really make it hard to root for the characters,the film opens with a woman walking in the woods and her daughter and son are trapped in a car and then decide the truth is n't a very
1,briefly i found it very hard to believe that such a movie would be made,briefly the film has been set in a place that will be remembered as a warning
1,i was n't really sure what it was all about,i am not a big fan of either of these actors
1,if you are looking for a good laugh out of a few laughs and,if you 've read the book it was a little bit too long
1,anyway i have n't read a comment,anyway it 's a good movie
1,neither the characters nor the situations that are supposed to be the main characters and all,neither did i miss a single moment in the film when the movie was released on tv
1,and the film is a bit overlong and boring,and the film has a very interesting ending with a
1,maybe it was just me to watch this movie with me,maybe it 's just my opinion that is the point of this
1,lynn is also a nice woman to watch as the young lady,lynn spacek and robert downey jr have the best roles in this film
1,you 'll be amazed at how good a film this was,you could n't even think of a single person who is a
1,it 's not just the movie it 's not a bad movie,it has a lot of action and some of the scenes in the
1,it 's a shame that the film is so hard to sit through,it 's not a bad movie but it was a fun and entertaining movie
1,i think that the reason for seeing the movie is that it 's so funny that you just ca n't believe that it 's not a comedy,i do not recommend this film to anyone unless your into a bad film and not just for a few minutes and a waste of time but if
1,meanwhile there was the fact that he had no interest at all,meanwhile there are several things about her being a bit more than she
1,think about it if you have n't been to the same extent as the one in the,think of all things the movie has a good cast with excellent performances from the leads
1,the story of two sisters who have a relationship together and the two fall in love with each,the first time i saw the movie i thought that this movie would make some good movie
1,my only complaint with the film is that it was a total waste of film,my only complaint is that they do n't have a clue about what they are
1,do not waste your time or money,do n't waste your time watching this movie
1,the story of this film is that a bunch of teens who have been cheating on the mafia 's work,the only reason to watch the movie was to see the very early preview that was on the box
1,i think that the director did not have to,i was n't expecting to see the movie
1,he also is a good actor,he 's not as convincing as the
1,we have to be one of those,we all want to see it
1,not only did he not have a good time at acting but,not only is it very good it 's not very good
1,as for me i 've been watching this film,as for the acting it 's not bad
1,waiting for a great show that was n't on my own but a good time,waiting for a dvd release of this movie you have a chance to do better
1,man was that bad luck that i had n't spent the entire time,man of a thousand fingers the movie does have some of the most interesting
1,i have a fondness for a few more films,i have to say if you do n't believe me
1,anyone who can appreciate this film should be ashamed of themselves,anyone who has ever seen this film will agree with me
1,she 's just a normal man with a heart,she was the only reason i watched this movie
1,ustinov plays a very complex character and he is a likable person,ustinov plays a man who is in love with a man who is
1,after the film was over you would expect the director to be a little less than a director and the writer and producer,after watching it i could have sworn that the director had been a bit more interested in the story than in the first place
1,she is a good guy and that 's why i,she does n't even seem to care much more
1,it has a very simple story line,it 's a great movie to see with
1,i have to say that i 've always been a fan of hers and this is a good movie,i think the only thing good was that the characters were n't the only thing that kept you watching
1,this is an example of what to do and to be able to see how a movie can make the viewer want to see the film,this movie is so bad you could n't make a film with a camera work so you can tell it was shot by a junior crew who
1,she was also one of the best actors to ever grace,she 's not a bad actress but she has a few decent
1,the movie itself is a complete disaster and i think it 's just a waste of time,the acting is so bad that i ca n't even be bothered to watch this movie
1,this film was just plain silly,this one is the best one that
1,i think this movie would have made a great movie,i do n't know who it is because of that and
1,as a result the story of the story revolves around the characters and the events,as for the rest of it i think it 's a very good movie
1,they do n't even have the decency to be a good movie,they are a group of scientists who do n't even know how to
1,i do n't want to ruin the plot for you but i think you could,i have never seen a movie so much for its characters as a child
1,some of the dialogue was n't that bad,some say it 's not as good as it
1,it has been done by a man with such a strong imagination for the film and it,it is n't the greatest movie of any time but a film that makes you cry
1,after a while it becomes obvious that he was not in the right place for the film,after seeing a series of movies i have a feeling of being the best of them
1,he 's not the only person,he 's a great actor and it
1,an interesting and entertaining film about a,an excellent film for all ages
1,the only redeeming feature is the fact that they did n't make much money at the box office,the only thing to really be said is how the director managed to get the whole thing to a
1,fighting scenes are so fake that you 'll laugh hysterically,fighting sequences with a few exceptions is the best of the
1,i was very disappointed in how it was made and how the film was made,i 've seen a lot of bad movies in my time but this one is the
1,robert culp was a very funny comedian but he just was just plain awful,robert culp is the only one who manages to make his character believable
1,the movie is a total disaster with a bunch of boring characters,the acting is horrible the script is bad the acting is bad the
1,i'm glad that they did n't,i'm surprised that he was able to
1,whether they were a good or not i 'd say a lot about the story,whether you 're looking for a laugh out loud funny or laugh out loud funny and
1,however the story is not very good either,however i have no idea what 's going on
1,who is a little prejudiced and a little more dangerous,who can forget the fact that the film is about a
1,lance henriksen is a good actor in this movie and he 's,lance henriksen plays the character of the villain in the original
1,the film also features some great acting by some good actors and actresses,the film is a little slow but the acting is so bad that it
1,actually the movie 's main flaw is,actually it 's a great movie
1,why not just make a sequel,why not make it a horror film
1,this is a very very well made film,this film is a total mess of its own
1,it has the same kind of humor that i can say,it is very hard to tell which is a good idea of
1,even though they were all the same as they were in,even the worst of the movie is n't even funny
1,it 's the only time we can see the world and that 's where the fun of the,it 's not the best movie of it 's kind i 've seen and it is n't
1,and it 's not as good as the first,and i 've seen a few of the original movies
1,actually this was probably the best film of the bunch,actually i have a hard time believing that i was n't
1,i was really disappointed at how the movie 's plot could 've been so much better,i 've read that many people who liked this film had a sense of humor
1,the story is very simple and it 's hard to follow,the script is n't the main point of the story
1,all the actors in this movie are excellent,all in all a very entertaining film but not
1,moments of the movie is just plain silly,moments are so funny the characters are hilarious it
1,basically he does n't get it but he 's a very good actor,basically a lot of people who have commented on movies like this should be
1,and the fact that this movie has,and it 's just so awful
1,steve carell is excellent as usual,steve guttenberg 's portrayal of the film
1,the plot is simple and the acting,the film was a complete disappointment
1,if this is not for everyone who 's not familiar with their work then the movie is a must see,if you want to see a very funny film about a group of young kids who do n't get a chance
1,technically it 's a very nice film and worth a watch,technically this is a good film if you like to see it
1,like this one does not want to get rid of the characters and the story is very simple and very very interesting,like most of the film 's later output the film fails to deliver the goods and is a very enjoyable one
1,michael dudikoff plays a good cop in an old man who is n't a hero he has no redeeming qualities,michael madsen plays the role of a serial killer who is the victim to save his wife from his death
1,who 's to believe that a film could accuse,who cares for the film 's plot line
1,but the movie is so good you 'll be glad you did and it was the best,but it is not the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it is a disgrace
1,people do n't get the point of view of the movie,people have said the film is very well made and has a
1,unfortunately there are so many good films and there are so many great ones,unfortunately this is just one of those things that really did n't happen
1,it was not a film for me to be surprised that i had not been able,it 's not the worst film ever made but its certainly not worth a rent
1,if you like the first film you will probably like this,if the film was n't bad enough it 's just not worth
1,slippery and cold blooded and yet the characters are,slippery and simple as it should have been
1,the film does contain some very funny moments such as a little girl getting stabbed in the balls but,the story was interesting enough but it was just not the same as the rest of the series
1,also it was a great movie and that 's what i was hoping for,also the music is beautiful and adds a touch of realism to it
1,if you 're a fan of the series do n't bother with this one,if you have n't seen the movie yet do not read the book
1,joey jacobi plays the part very well,joey is the perfect choice to play this
1,that is the reason why i watched this,that was not the best part of it
1,the movie is about as good as the original and it 's not a,the film is an utter failure and i ca n't wait to see
1,he also has the same character in the first film,he 's the only one who 's actually in the film
1,the first part of the movie is a classic example of the latter which,the plot is a little weak but it 's also a great one
1,it is not a movie to tell the truth,it 's a good movie that will be a lot
1,i 've seen the movie countless times and this is,i have to wonder where the film is heading
1,tough to say but the story of a young girl is just as good as the movie,tough luck is an excellent example of how a movie can be done without a budget
1,if you are a fan of the genre this is a must see,if you want to know what is going on in the film you should
1,i would n't be surprised if he 's,i would recommend this movie to everyone
1,and the whole cast is very good,and then you have the recipe of it
1,the film is very entertaining but it does n't take much away from the,the film is very interesting and there is a great message behind it
1,i'm not a big fan of the genre but i'm glad i,i'm not sure how to get my hands on this film
1,this is a very good movie and i recommend it to anyone with an interest in the sport,this was one of the few movies i 've seen with a very limited budget but it is n't
1,director david cronenberg is the master of a few films that are in the seventies,director james m jones has a good sense of humor but it is a pity that
1,overall this movie is a total waste of time,overall i do not see the reason why they do
1,the first one was about a young woman,the movie itself is a complete mess
1,the plot was so bad that even the distributors could,the film was a lot of fun to watch
1,in this movie they are all pretty much all,in fact i thought the acting was excellent
1,its a very enjoyable film that is n't afraid to show that there is no plot in it and the actors,its a pity that there is n't more than one person here and there who would like to watch it
1,dish is a film that has no redeeming qualities,dish to the film is that a movie that has
1,horrible movie that was supposed to be a comedy,horrible acting and bad special effects were the only ones
1,you 'll be glad you did,you 'll see the same thing
1,through this movie he becomes involved with his mother and daughter,through this movie i felt i was going to be more impressed
1,secondly a lot of people have been complaining about the movie but it 's just not worth,secondly it 's a movie with no real plot no story and nothing of any kind
1,so i think this show has some of,so the movie does n't make sense
1,in a movie that was a bit more of an attempt at a thriller it would have been much better to have,in this case we are left to ponder the importance of what the director is trying to accomplish with his life
1,at the end of each episode they are a little more believable than the ones who have come to the surface in,at first i thought he was a little too old for his role but he is very good as the character
1,it 's just too bad that it 's just the beginning of the film,it 's a shame that the film is not available in dvd for purchase as
1,to the contrary i do n't see any spoilers,to sum it up this is a must see for
1,overall i 'd like to add a little bias for,overall the film is a little slow and boring
1,that is why the movie was a lot longer than the film,that 's a good thing to say because the film is a little
1,while he is a bit of an egotistical jerk it 's still a shame that,while i was not expecting too much at all the film seemed very promising
1,i have seen many other movies in the theater that are made up to be a masterpiece,i think it should be the movie 's biggest mistake of being a complete waste of time for
1,and the film 's climax with the main character 's character is a total,and if that is the case this should be a warning to anyone
1,one of the most memorable parts of the film is,one of the best films i 've ever seen
1,and it does n't matter what it 's all about,and i am a lifelong admirer of his work as one
1,i'm sure you 're gonna have a movie in my heart but this was so,i'm glad i did n't have to be a big fan of the series
1,come on people are so stupid that even the most ardent fan of the film should have seen the whole film,come on a few years later you can find a new dvd version of this show and i think that 's worth
1,grand canyon is the first time that it has a very,grand canyon is an interesting film about the human race
1,i think i 'll never get tired of seeing the same old movie,i do n't know what to do with the script but i have to
1,have you ever read an entire book that,have you ever seen the first movie
1,even the actors seem to play some of,even the soundtrack is not as memorable
1,warren beatty was a very good actor in the movie,warren beatty 's performance is not bad but his performance in
1,gap between these two films is an excellent piece of work,gap from the first film and a little of the end of
1,was that the only reason i did n't,was it any better than this movie
1,and it has to be one of the worst movies ever made,and the movie does n't even try to do it justice
1,bill maher plays a doctor whose son was kidnapped by one of those,bill maher was a great actor and it had some great scenes
1,like many other films of this sort i think they should have been better,like many others the movie has been a bit too much to be taken seriously
1,he has no idea who to be,he is not a good director
1,there is a great performance from james cagney as he 's,there are no other films like this to be made
1,she was a great actor and i loved the movie,she is the one who loves her and she does n't
1,i have no idea that this was an old production but it is n't,i do recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a truly moving thriller
1,why the hell would he kill his mother,why does anyone make this film and the other
1,however the plot of this movie is,however i did n't know it
1,it would be a nice idea to,it is a very good movie
1,the film 's plot is not a bad one as a whole movie is the worst movie i 've,the movie has a lot of fun and the action scenes are awesome the fight choreography is great
1,so it does not seem to be that the,so what if you do n't have to
1,they did n't get to the end and the plot was too weak and predictable,they do not have the permission to get rid of their lives and they are not
1,he has no idea about the situation,he 's the best actor in the movie
1,these are the two adjectives that this movie is,these were not enough to keep them on the verge
1,coppola 's direction is a very good touch of art in this movie,coppola is not only a very human character but in fact it 's a
1,i have to agree with the reviewer that the movie 's soundtrack is a bit choppy,i 've been trying for a few laughs but i do n't think i 'd seen the
1,it is a film that should never,it is n't even a comedy
1,kate beckinsale is good as the main character and,kate beckinsale is great as she is here
1,we have a group of young kids who have a little crush on their friends and their sons who,we all know that the movie is about the same person who made the most of his films
1,she is the only person who has the strength to have a miscarriage on her face and she has her own face that 's all,she was a very nice woman but i was n't expecting to see her as a woman who was raped in the middle of the woods
1,instead it 's a movie about the evils of the war in the us,instead we get to see a man dressed up in a costume of the mask
1,the movie is a bit predictable and not even worth mentioning,the movie does n't even come close to being a classic
1,the story was n't bad but it is still a,the acting is horrible and the acting is terrible
1,perhaps they were making some of the most important movies in the future but the film is so good it makes you laugh,perhaps the most important element is that we have to assume that it has been made with such a limited budget but it is
1,especially when he was in the scene,especially when you consider this as the worst
1,this was a good movie but it was just not,this movie is a waste of time and money
1,not only was it a great movie it was made by the bbc but the story,not that i'm a little harsh and i did like the movie and the movie
1,as for the film it 's very well done,as for the plot the only thing interesting about this
1,but the film is a real stinker,but i have no idea how the film
1,if the movie has a flaw to make the characters seem real it,if you 're into the genre this is the movie to watch
1,the story of a young girl who moves through to an,the first half of the movie is the first one
1,a great film that i can watch over and,a great cast of actors in this movie
1,this movie has some nice special effects and i liked this movie but i think it would be better,this movie is a total waste of time i wish i 'd been so bored by watching this movie
1,aware that this is n't a great movie to make,aware that this was n't the movie for me
1,the movie is also very entertaining with great music,the movie also has an unusual plot and the acting
1,it 's a very bad movie but that 's not to say that this movie is bad,it 's a pity that the director and his crew have made such a low budget film
1,for me this movie is a must for any movie fan,for the first time ever this film does not come close to
1,so the audience is treated to a great performance by the director,so i guess the writers had no idea who the movie was
1,they are a bunch of people,they did n't even try to put
1,the film was shot in the early seventies when the first film was made,the story is not a very original one but rather a good one
1,beyond that the film does have a very interesting plot line,beyond the usual fare of the genre and the general public service
1,i was really shocked by the story line,i do n't know why it would have been
1,the film has a nice atmosphere but there is no real,the film is not even as good as its predecessor
1,i do n't think this movie is the most interesting in the genre,i have seen many of the other comments here and i 've seen the
1,that 's what the movie is about,that 's the reason you should see this
1,instead he is given a chance to do his duty,instead he 's just as good as a guy that has
1,i was hoping for a great movie about a group of teens,i have never heard of the movie until i saw a preview of
1,i was so excited when i first saw it,i have never seen such a film in any way
1,and if that 's what i wanted,and the acting was pretty terrible
1,you have to be one of the most talented filmmakers to come across as a very good actor,you have to take a look at the director 's creativity as he does not make a movie like
1,this movie is a total waste of time,this is a film that should never be made
1,woe that i did n't have to pay attention to it,woe for his character and i think that his character was supposed
1,it 's a great movie to watch,it was a very moving experience and it
1,this is an excellent and very enjoyable movie to,this was a waste of time and money
1,i do n't know why they did n't make the movie,i would not be able to watch the first twenty episodes
1,if you have n't seen this movie you have not seen it yet,if you want to see a good film about a group of kids that
1,her boyfriend who is a young woman,her performance is the only one
1,on the way they are attacked by zombies,on the other hand it is a little too
1,i do n't think i would want to watch this movie again,i 've seen a lot of people and this movie is a perfect
1,maybe this is not what it is but the acting and writing was good,maybe the best of all the movies that were made in the late 90s
1,in fact there is a lot of sex and sexual content in which the film is set in a brothel in which the film is set up,in the end it seems that this time he has been a member of the gang for several years in a week and it does n't take him
1,the movie itself had an amazing soundtrack and a good story and the acting,the only thing that kept me watching was the way the film ended
1,it is a shame that the filmmakers never made a movie for,it is a film that is very difficult to relate to
1,your friend and you have to see the show to see it,your only real gripe is that they are n't in the least bit
1,a good story line is a good one to get,a film with a good cast but a story
1,i am not a fan of films that i like,i am a big fan of the series and i think
1,undoubtedly this movie was made by someone who does n't know what they are doing and they should be ashamed to have seen it on tv,undoubtedly the most memorable aspect of the film is how it was made and that the movie is not about how much the creators of this movie
1,laurence snipes is one of the worst,laurence fishburne is also very good
1,this movie is an insult to anyone who enjoys,this is a movie for the whole family
1,the story of a woman who has been living for her life,the film is a very good film with an allstar cast
1,specifically the movie takes a lot more serious and more seriously and more seriously than just plain,specifically the film has the look and feel of the first film which is a shame as it
1,when she returns to the apartment she meets an older man,when i heard of this movie i thought the movie was a
1,its the best part of the movie,its the worst movie i have ever seen
1,michael pare 's character in the film is an obnoxious idiot,michael madsen is also very funny as the villain and a very
1,and the scene where he and his cronies,and the story has a great story
1,rodney dangerfield was a good choice for his role,rodney dangerfield 's character is a caricature of a man
1,still the movie is not a complete failure,still it 's a pretty good movie
1,the movie is n't really about the killer,the first half hour of it is just filler
1,spoiler alert spoiler spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead i was expecting something like that to follow and i was really expecting it to be a,spoiler alert a lot of the movie 's plot is told in flashbacks and then it goes downhill when the killer starts talking
1,a good story for you is a great movie,a few people in this movie were very good
1,both films were very much like the one with them being so bad that they just could n't get any better,both the characters seem to be trying very hard to be funny but they 're too stupid too quickly to make it
1,the acting is good but the script is so bad that the director is so bad it 's laughable,the movie was shot in the late 1920s when the first time in hollywood was filmed in color so that
1,the acting is horrible and that 's not all it is,the film has a good message but the director should have been
1,and i do n't want to give away any,and the film has no redeeming feature whatsoever
1,the story itself is so bad that it 's difficult to follow the plot but it is n't a good movie,the film opens up with a bang that is the only thing that makes it to my mind the whole thing is
1,i do n't understand why people are so disgusted with this kind of crap,i 've watched it countless times and every time it comes on and i have
1,the movie was shot in new zealand and,the film was very slow and boring
1,red corner was an enjoyable film but i found myself unable to find anything in it that i had expected,red buttons is one of the best comedies i 've ever seen and it is not a bad movie
1,frankly this is not a good movie and is certainly,frankly i did n't know it 's about him
1,the film is also a very nice film but it,the only problem is that it 's so boring
1,i have n't read the book but i 've heard it,i think it would make the film a success for me
1,or the scene where the two men are in their room,or maybe he should 've gotten the oscar for this
1,feast on the senses of the great escape of the dead,feast on the director is the most interesting film i have ever
1,not that this matters was bad but it could n't have been more,not that i do n't want to give it away but it is worth
1,she is a good character and i believe,she does it for the first time
1,i do n't know how i would get it from the library but i can watch the whole thing,i 've never seen anything like this in my life and is so stupid that i was n't laughing
1,we do believe in the story of a young woman who has a crush on him,we are also treated with some nice scenes and some of the best scenes in the movie
1,but this is the worst of the two,but this movie really does suck me
1,mckee is a master of the macabre in his film,mckee does n't seem to have a clue of what to
1,this movie has the feel of a tv series with an interesting premise,this is the best movie that i have seen in my life
1,so what was with her character when she made the best actress,so the movie is set in an isolated city where all the inhabitants
1,gone is the same thing that is the same,gone was a lot of people in the cinema who
1,let 's face it it 's a great film to watch and enjoy,let me tell you that i 've only been disappointed in this film because
1,guess i was wrong with it,guess i would like to watch it
1,but the movie itself is very entertaining,but the fact that the director has a
1,the film has a great deal of humor but the story,the film is n't a masterpiece but it still works
1,the film is a bit of an exercise in logic,the only thing good about this movie is that it 's
1,when she was a young boy who was born and raised in a new age with her family in the early 30s she became pregnant,when i read the book that said it was a movie it was going to have to be the most original and thought provoking
1,probably the most disappointing character was the fact that it was just a little bit of,probably the most interesting aspect of this film however has to be the casting decisions
1,at least i have not read a book that is a good one,at least it 's just as entertaining as it should at first
1,a very funny and entertaining movie,a lot of people have complained on
1,on top of this the film is not as good as a lot of it is in the style of,on the way the film is set in a mansion and the story begins with a bang of fate
1,paul giamatti was good as usual but this was a very poor movie,paul muni was a great choice for the role of john merrick
1,also the ending in the end was pretty lame,also the fact that they 're trying to make it
1,basically the whole film is shot in such a way that we have to wait for the next hour to arrive and get to know all that 's going on,basically the movie was pretty bad and the acting was terrible but it was a pretty good film and i was surprised that the movie was n't made at all so
1,it 's like a bad tv series of the show that is n't funny and the jokes are hilarious and it,it 's like that they made a lot of money and went out of their way to the next project
1,i do n't think i 'd ever seen a movie that did not have to be made,i think this would be a great idea for the film 's creators to make their own film
1,this is one of the best movies i have ever seen,this film was made in 1997 so the producers decided to make
1,this film is so incredibly boring so badly that it 's,this was a film that was made by an american
1,preppy men are n't always in the world but they do a fine job,preppy men who have a secret admirer of the world of the day will find
1,the story is not really original,the only thing i liked is the
1,whereas the story is very weak the movie is a little long,whereas i think a movie should be shown at the oscars it is
1,what is the deal with him,what i got from this movie was
1,it was an interesting movie for me it was n't a movie it 's a good movie,it seems as though the makers were trying to emulate the movie 's original story and they did
1,that 's why i liked the first film so,that is how it 's in the movie
1,but if you are interested in watching a film that does n't have any real plot and you,but this one 's only good thing and it is n't that i do n't see that
1,i have seen all other movies but i do not like the fact that this was a,i 've always been a fan of hers and i have seen that in my lifetime
1,i was expecting a movie about a bunch of teens who had a dream,i have to agree with the other reviewer about this movie and it did n't
1,with an exception of an american film that is more of a drama about two women the movie,with his first major role to work he 's a good actor but he has no talent
1,now i can understand why the movie was,now i can get my hands out
1,i think that the movie is a good mix of action and romance,i 've seen the trailer for it but this is the worst film i
1,stevens and his friends and coworkers find themselves embroiled in a violent situation,stevens has the right role but the script is so bad it 's almost
1,and it 's a great idea that is a good thing,and i do n't know why the movie was rated
1,it was a nice idea to see this film on a dvd release,it 's a pretty cool movie but there is no substance in the story
1,marion has a lot of sex with her and,marion davies is perfect as the young woman
1,grimly it would have been much more effective if a character study and character development were so different,grimly speaking of a movie that 's not even remotely funny it 's not as clever and as bad
1,however there was a lot of the story of the original,however the story was very good for the whole family
1,the acting is pretty bad the story was bad and the writing was n't even close to being good but the story was good,the first one was about the first one the last 20 years and the first one was just a bunch of random teenagers
1,a great deal of humor was put into the mix and it was the,a film that should have been titled the shining and a lot better
1,the story is so simple and so full of holes it is difficult,the acting is terrible and the plot is n't a good one
1,the plot twists are not the only one and there are,the movie has a great cast and an interesting premise
1,the only saving graces are the performances of the supporting cast,the story is simple the plot is simple the plot is simple
1,the film starts off with a very funny and suspenseful,the film is a very good and entertaining movie
1,you do n't need to read the book or read the book,you 'll be glad to know that the movie 's original rating on
1,there 's a lot of good things about this movie,there 's nothing inherently funny about the movie except maybe the
1,the story was pretty simple the movie was so boring,the plot is so thin that it becomes a chore for
1,knowing that the movie was based on a real event that was a major success in the movie and it certainly was n't,knowing what the hell is wrong with the film it is a bit of an insult to a lot of people who have already
1,i saw this movie in the late 1990 's in the,i would give this film an 8 out of 10
1,it was a great movie for me,it 's a shame that the filmmakers and
1,such movies like plan 9 from outer space and manos the hands of fate,such a film is the story of a man who is married to him as
1,after a little while you can still see the movie,after a couple of episodes of the series i was expecting
1,the movie is also about the relationship between two friends and their parents,the plot is very weak the dialogue is awful and the story line is
1,signaled as the main character 's mother is not a character 's fault,signaled the film 's success it 's not a film that will have a
1,in the film it does not take away from,in the end he becomes a big jerk
1,over the years of this film it would be a little too long to be taken seriously,over the years i 've watched it twice and will never be able to see the original
1,it would be nice to see a,it 's a pretty good movie
1,when i first saw the film i thought this was going to be a very funny episode that should never be made,when the main character is played by an actor who is in love with the main character he becomes convinced that his father
1,no one could have done a better,no matter how bad they are
1,i do not recommend anyone to see this movie unless you want,i think this movie was a lot of fun to watch
1,aside from the fact that this movie is an insult to the intelligence of the filmmakers and,aside from the occasional violence of a few other minor characters the plot is just awful
1,there is no point of view,there 's no real plot to speak
1,rosemary 's baby is one of the most underrated horror films in the series,rosemary 's baby is not the worst horror film ever made but the acting was
1,what was the deal with the director of a clockwork orange,what i do know is that there is something in this movie
1,the acting was n't good the movie was,the film is not even as good
1,the only redeeming feature was the soundtrack which was,the acting is superb the directing is superb
1,then we meet the two young men,then there are the two leads
1,you 're not in for a bad time,you have no idea the film is set in
1,and that 's what makes this movie,and the acting is very good
1,still this movie is not as bad as it should have been,still the movie is very funny and entertaining to watch and i still
1,although the film is about as much about life as a whole it is still one very good film,although the film is not as good at the beginning the movie has a very strong cast that i enjoyed
1,while it is true that this is a film i have seen in a long time,while the film 's title is the same as the film itself it is very very funny
1,the acting and script were awful,the first half of the film has
1,22 the film 's biggest success is that it 's,22 years ago the director has made this movie
1,basically the movie is a bit of an action movie with a lot of,basically it 's a very poor movie but not in a funny way
1,these are the only reasons i watched it,these were not the best of them all
1,and if the film is really good the acting in the movie is n't very good and the script is n't that good,and it really makes me want to see a movie that has a great story to work with and a good story and characters
1,however it is a little dated and the movie itself is not,however this movie was so bad i wanted to walk up and down
1,the movie is a little too long for a movie that was n't good,the acting in the other films is very good and the script is pretty good
1,you do n't see it coming from the same director,you can see the movie as it was written by someone
1,most of the time it 's hard to imagine what to expect,most of the actors are very good in the roles they played
1,it 's a shame because the first half of the film is not,it 's a shame the film was made at the box office
1,then it becomes apparent that this movie is a,then again it 's just not that bad
1,although this is a bad movie i ca n't believe it has the worst movie i,although it was not a very good movie it was just a bit too slow
1,but the film 's biggest problem is its pacing,but i think the movie is not as good as
1,i was very surprised to find that this was a very low budget movie and i really liked,i 've seen a lot of bad films in my day and it is one of them
1,sometimes it is a bad movie but it has to be said that,sometimes it 's hard to find fault with it 's plot line
1,charlie brown plays the lead role in this film,charlie brown is one of my favorite actors
1,finally the ending was a bit contrived but it is still a good film,finally the movie 's main character is the most annoying character i 've ever heard
1,how many people can see a movie where the actors are just not believable,how can a director like nadja with a camera can be so bad that it
1,but i ca n't imagine how the movie 's plot would,but that does not mean they were just as bad
1,the film was directed by john carpenter who is known for his work,the film is very well done and the characters are very likable
1,not only does she do it with her but the fact that she is in her,not that there was any point in the film that was n't in the book
1,as far as the acting of the cast is the script it 's a bit weak,as a result the film is so bad and so boring that you will never forget it
1,how about a film where it 's all a little,how do they have a baby and a woman
1,the movie is about a group of people who live in a remote cabin in,the movie was very well made and it had a lot of action sequences
1,the film has the most memorable scene in the whole film and the climax is one of the,the acting and writing are excellent and this is not even a film in its own right
1,this is a movie for people to,this movie was a huge flop
1,imdb says this is a film about two women who live in paris in a rural suburb in america,imdb lists a few movies that i have watched and i can tell it is a little easier to swallow
1,sure you get the idea of how much more can go,sure this movie is n't a masterpiece but it is still a
1,so it was a movie that could have been better if it had been made to be a,so if you 're looking for something more than the sum of the parts watch this film
1,i was a little skeptical and confused,i was so excited to know that the
1,action is a big disappointment and is very rare to see,action packed tension with a great soundtrack and a very strong story
1,but the story is pretty thin the,but this was n't the case
1,so the movie was a little slow and i could n't help but feel sorry for the characters,so the story is about the struggle for an old man who has a past in the past
1,and then i saw the film,and the ending is one of the
1,that is the only positive element in this movie,that is the best part of the movie
1,i have to admit that there is a lot of good action and action in the movie,i was hoping to see more of him in this movie and that was a good thing
1,bad acting bad writing bad acting bad,bad bad bad awful bad bad
1,though i was in the mood for a few minutes to get this film out of the blue i have,though he has a lot of talent to show how he is not the one to blame his work
1,it seems that the writers and writers decided to put the movie in the same way as the first,it is an odd and touching film and i would like to say it 's a great movie
1,the movie is just plain awful,the story is very similar to the
1,paxton and his men are a little more likable than in the,paxton is the only one who can do a great deal
1,an interesting film and an excellent performance for streep,an interesting and entertaining film that i would watch for
1,all the elements are done in the form of a few,all of this is very very much to be found
1,while the film is not the best in the world in this film it 's a very good movie,while this film is a masterpiece i have to say it 's the best movie i 've seen in a
1,maybe it 's too late but it was,maybe he 's a little bit generous
1,the story of the kelly gang' is about a,the movie is a little long at times
1,i think this is a very good film,i was surprised at the ending of this movie
1,but i did n't have any expectation,but this is a great movie
1,the acting in it was good the story was ok and there was a lot to like,the story is so weak it could n't even have been developed to be a complete waste of
1,just a little bit of a mystery to be found in the film and it 's not,just as it was in the book it seemed a little odd at first but the film was
1,henry winkler is excellent as always,henry silva is the best in the
1,this is n't a very good movie,this is one of the best movies of
1,i do believe that this is a film for people who can handle their lives in their own right,i have been a fan of movies since i was a boy and it is a great movie
1,the film is a total waste of time and energy,the story was a little weak and the ending was predictable
1,but this movie is a total dud,but this film is so good it 's
1,after a while the film is a little long,after a series of events and one of the characters
1,then again what did i expect,then there was the scene when he
1,this is a very bad film,this is a film with a message
1,it 's like the movie is trying to make a new movie but this one is n't,it 's not as though the filmmakers have made a film about them but they are not
1,some people do n't know what it 's,some of the scenes are pretty bad
1,as the two boys get together they are all very likable,as far as the movie goes this is pretty funny
1,ranging from one to the other,ranging from a very funny scene with
1,this movie is one of the funniest i have ever seen and it,this has been seen as a very good movie in the past
1,expressionistic cinematography by the legendary ennio morricone score by max steiner and of course the legendary composer,expressionistic photography by robert taylor has the power to be a very nice and exciting film
1,after a very short opening sequence it was the only thing good about the film,after seeing this i was thinking of a movie about an assassination attempt to make a
1,if they could have done a little more of it it could have been so much more,if they were making a movie of it then they would have made it better and if they
1,after a long time when the movie ended and i had n't,after the first five minutes i was hooked with the story
1,quiet and very funny the story is just,quiet riders is a very entertaining film
1,i 've seen many movies that have a,i do remember it as a child
1,intelligent in fact it is not a typical film noir movie,intelligent but not a little more subtle than the original version
1,the first movie was very good with some good fight,the story and plot development are all pretty good
1,the script is a bit thin with a lot more plot holes than,the acting is horrible the dialogue is bad the dialogue is awful
1,why do n't they try to make it a big deal,why did he have to spend so much money on this
1,they have to be in the movie industry,they were all a bunch of losers
1,i was really expecting to see a more realistic and realistic movie in my view but i was very wrong,i have to say that there is no need to say that this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,captured the same way the first time i watched it,captured in the movie the story is very simple
1,here 's where i saw this movie,here he gets into the story of the
1,last year i saw a screener of this film on cable,last night i watched an episode where i was looking at the
1,there 's also a lot of violence and the nudity is pretty cool,there 's also a bit of nudity and the gore is a little over
1,the movie does contain several elements of the story in this one,the script is a joke and i would n't call it a comedy
1,the only way to watch it to me and the audience is a very good,the movie is a little slow paced and the acting is not bad either
1,take a look at the way this is presented,take it a step ahead of your time
1,during the movie i have seen a lot of bad acting in the film,during the course of the film he was a man with his wife and he
1,the film is a bit of a mess but the ending does not make for great,the first part was the most interesting thing about this film but it was n't a movie
1,i was n't surprised by a lot of things and this is a pretty bad movie,i was expecting a lot more than this movie but not as bad as it should at
1,i do think the movie would 've made a more interesting,i would recommend this to any fan of the genre
1,the movie is a great example of how,the film is not about the war
1,imagine if you are a fan of the genre i would recommend the original and if it,imagine this movie in that the only way we should not get out of the mind
1,laugh out loud funny lines are hilarious to watch,laugh at the same time when i heard this one
1,at the end of the movie there are,at the time this film was made
1,in fact there have been some good movies in the last years,in the end the main character is not a good one but is
1,you can tell that there were no real actors to work,you know that the story line will have you guessing
1,it 's the sort of movie i 'd give it a chance because of,it is n't that bad or so bad it just is n't funny
1,jeff bridges is one of his best,jeff bridges is excellent as always
1,his role in the film is a real treat to the eyes,his character 's actions are just not funny and i would n't want
1,i have never been a big fan of any of his films,i am not kidding at all i just do n't understand why
1,overall the film is an enjoyable watch,overall it does n't make a whole lot
1,a lot of this was the worst film i 've ever seen but that does not mean that i 've never seen a movie where i have seen a lot of bad and bad,a film about a young boy and his wife who are trapped in the desert in the middle of nowhere and are forced to accept the truth that the family is n't in
1,the film is a little bit too,the story is not very original
1,one of the most enjoyable moments of the movie is the way the camera pans out the camera and the camera angles,one of the best things about this movie is the fact that they do n't have to get the name right
1,it 's a shame that they were able,it is the best of the lot
1,well the film is a complete copy of the,well that 's the way i do it
1,that was the only reason for this movie,that 's how i can download this movie
1,however this is not one of those,however the story was not very interesting and
1,probably the best part of the film is,probably the best movie of all time
1,explaining that they 're not going to go on for the first two episodes of the movie but i do n't think they should have made the film more entertaining if they had,explaining why i have not seen the other two in his long life but i do not think that he 's the one that he is in the world and his heart
1,it is a story of a young girl from a young girl who has,it is a very moving movie that is not afraid to be realistic
1,wilkinson was n't in this movie,wilkinson 's performance was very good
1,she 's the kind of guy who,she 's a pretty bad actress
1,finally the film is a good one,finally the story is so bad that it
1,the film has a good story to work with,the movie is a good example in a very good
1,the acting was terrible but the story,the plot is not very interesting
1,a great deal of humor is the fact that the film has so many layers that it makes you laugh so hard,a young woman with a secret who is not afraid to be an actress who 's been a very young woman in a
1,no one can deny that the movie,no one is in this film
1,in the movie he was the first of the many,in the first movie the characters are n't developed
1,after the initial shootout of the two men in the,after a few minutes the movie is just padding
1,if you 're a fan of the original series you 'll probably like this one too,if this was supposed to be something like a spoof of a movie i would have to
1,but this is not a good thing,but the story has been told by the
1,hallam and the beast is a very entertaining and entertaining movie,hallam is an expert who was a very gifted woman
1,the acting is very good and the script is good enough,the plot is a little confusing but i think it was the
1,later on we see that there are a bunch of people who are killed off and they are in a different,later on she meets a girl and she is taken in by the girl who was killed by her parents
1,the story is a bit confusing and the film 's ending is too confusing,the film does n't have a lot of gore to it which is not to
1,but the film does n't do much for,but the film was a bit long
1,after the success of a good film this is not a good movie,after the film is over you will never forget the fact that it is
1,the first half is quite enjoyable to watch,the only good thing about this movie is the
1,for a film that is not as bad as this,for some strange reason that the movie is a complete mess
1,he also has a great talent as a character,he has a very good role as an old man
1,well this show was just plain bad,well the only thing that i really liked
1,this is a movie that will make you feel like you will be seeing,this film was one of the most enjoyable things i 've ever seen
1,having read the comments on imdb about seeing the film and having read the books of the book by reading the story i thought this movie,having said that it is a movie that is not only one thing but rather a movie with all the actors and actresses in it
1,although i am not a fan the original story is quite good as it,although it 's a good film it is still a very good film
1,he 's a great singer but this is the best part,he had a great idea of a new life and the people
1,major quibbles in the movie are the fact that it is a,major spoiler ahead is that the plot is n't that bad
1,the only thing that kept me watching the whole thing is the fact that the entire movie was shot in,the movie does n't make sense to me but i do n't understand that it 's a real life
1,i saw a screening of this movie at a local theater and i thought,i would n't have to give this movie any more than 2 stars
1,i 've seen a lot of movies made in the past and that are n't all good,i am a big fan of the horror genre but this one is not for everyone
1,the movie starts with a young girl being murdered by a car,the movie has a lot of action and some action sequences but there
1,at one point i was expecting something more like watching a train wreck but this one is not that bad,at the beginning i was wondering if they had made some bad movies or worse yet i decided to rent it
1,the movie is not a complete waste of time,the film is a complete mess of a movie
1,needless to say they did n't have a clue about the plot,needless to say the first two thirds of this film are a little
1,the film is also a great deal of fun but it 's not a great story,the acting is so bad that i ca n't help but laugh at the lack of a
1,you have to be in the mood to make a movie about a bunch,you do n't want to see anything like this in a long time
1,she is not a great actress but she makes you believe,she is a great actress she has a good performance
1,if you have n't seen the series you will see how,if you do n't believe me you 'll love it
1,he is also a great director,he was a bit of the jerk
1,but then again what i mean it was a bad movie,but this is the first film which is so bad it makes
1,like the other movies i have watched this one and i do not like the ending,like i said it 's one of the funniest movies i have seen in years
1,it 's a great movie to see,it is not a bad film
1,unlike in the first two films this one has the same effect of the first,unlike most documentaries about the dangers of the holocaust i can say that it is not
1,his acting is very poor although the rest of the cast is excellent,his role is the only redeeming factor i 've ever seen and he has
1,it is an interesting film and a great one,it 's a shame that it 's only available on
1,i have n't been a huge fan of the original and the two versions are quite well known but i 've always loved the original and have read,i am so glad to see a film that was so horrible in my memory and i am not surprised that i wasted money on the film
1,plots and characters are just plain awful,plots such as the one being the ones
1,the acting is horrible with some of the worst lines i have ever seen,the first time i watched the movie the whole movie seemed like a good joke
1,it is not just the fact that the film is a little bit more,it 's a shame that the film never got released in the uk
1,the acting is superb especially the lead character 's daughter who is the one who is attracted to her,the only thing that made it worthwhile was the fact that the movie was made in canada and it is
1,how can the viewer think so,how can anyone not be in a
1,and the ending was n't the best i,and it 's not a bad movie
1,and it does make me think about a movie that makes the viewer believe,and there was no way of getting the movie to be so funny
1,unless you think that the film is an accurate portrayal of the lives of a person in real life,unless they 're not a little girl i do n't think they 'll ever get back a job
1,plus it 's the story of a woman,plus that 's the problem with that
1,over the years it 's a pretty good idea to make a film that has to,over the course of the movie there is a very interesting and interesting plot line
1,the movie 's story is a very simple one,the first half of the story is the first
1,it 's like a bad student 's dream of a man 's dream,it was a very enjoyable movie but the film did not work on me
1,yes i do n't like the film,yes the story is simple but it 's
1,there are some good parts but they do n't really work,there is a lot of violence here and it 's very very
1,bozz 's attempt to get the president of the,bozz and his friends are all on vacation
1,this movie is not worth your time,this movie was so bad it was n't
1,every single joke of it was so predictable,every once in a while i get a feeling
1,nevertheless he is still in this movie but,nevertheless this film is a complete mess
1,this is a good show for those,this movie is just as great
1,yet it is the same old thing as the story,yet this movie is not so great it 's not
1,as it stands out it 's a very good movie,as for the other actors i have to wonder what the
1,then again what do we get here,then the movie is about a man who
1,do n't waste your time with it,do n't worry about this movie
1,and the ending was just too abrupt,and it 's all so bad
1,but i was really looking for a copy of it and i have n't seen it yet,but the fact that the characters and the story are so stupid and stupid you have no reason
1,she was also a great actress and was very very well cast and a great actress,she was so bad that she was able to get to the bottom of what was happening
1,and i do n't know if the writer of this movie is a fan,and then the camera pans off the sound of a guy 's face
1,does this mean that we are just talking about the,does anyone know where to start with a plot
1,there is one very brief shot of the film where it,there 's no need in the movie to be there
1,you 're a fan of a few movies,you know it is a good film
1,i have to say that the film is a little bit of an exercise in the plot,i have been waiting to find a copy of this movie and i have to agree with the
1,and if you are not a fan of movies you will be disappointed,and that is where the film begins the story is not as much of
1,i have seen some pretty good acting by all,i am a fan of the original book but i
1,i think it should have won the awards for best supporting actress,i was n't really expecting a lot from the first movie but was
1,the only thing that makes this film watchable is its lack of logic,the only saving graces to this movie include a few scenes where the actors
1,im still trying to find a way to get my hands on this piece of crap,im sorry that it was n't a big budget film and it is not the best but
1,during the first half of the movie there are numerous other things that make it a bit more fun to,during the movie they were just a bunch of guys who just wanted to kill someone with their weapons
1,not that i did n't see any,not to mention the whole movie
1,i have never seen a movie before that that made me want to be scared,i would have to be surprised if they were not just talking about the plot or
1,the story is not that bad but the actors have no personality to speak,the film is not about a young woman who 's been raped and raped by
1,other than that it is not a movie about the evils of human behaviour and a very disturbing,other than that i have seen a lot of bad movies but this one is just awful
1,wow this is the only film of the decade where it 's not the best of its kind that i have n't seen,wow what is the motivation for the rest of the film but i do n't see that any of the actors in this movie
1,unfortunately i did n't see this as an action movie,unfortunately it is n't as if he has to do anything
1,a good movie to watch with your mates,a lot of things happen and the movie is
1,any other movie could have been better,any movie in which you could have made
1,i saw it at an advanced screening in the theater with a bunch of friends and the kids and we,i think this film was made by people who have a lot of trouble with a movie like this
1,he is also a very good guy,he 's not just that stupid
1,it is also a very nice movie,it is a very simple story and a
1,this is one of the funniest films,this is a very funny movie
1,after a series of unfortunate murders the audience is left with more than the little bit of suspense,after the first hour of the movie i had a hard time figuring out what the hell
1,still this film is one of those movies,still it 's a pretty good film
1,minor spoilers ahead of this movie,minor spoilers ahead i had the misfortune
1,the movie starts with one of his friends in,the movie is a total waste of time
1,it 's a real shame that they have made this film,it 's just a bunch of silly people trying to get their
1,this movie was n't even that good and i thought it was pretty good,this movie is a must see for everyone who loves movies about relationships or people
1,soderbergh and his crew try to tell their tale,soderbergh has created a masterpiece of art in which a
1,the film is set in the near future,the script and direction are very good
1,full metal jacket the only other person who has seen this film is to,full of tension and surprises and a few scenes that i found interesting
1,then the two meet up with one of the girls,then there are some funny moments in the movie that do
1,he has a very small budget,he 's the perfect person to make
1,nina was a great character actress and was a very good actress,nina is a woman in the middle and a love story and the
1,the story is n't bad but i was expecting something more,the only thing i can say is that i do n't have
1,intellectually the film was n't even nominated in the least for the academy award winner,intellectually the movie was a very poor attempt to cash in on the popularity of all
1,it 's a great film about a young,it 's a pretty good show though
1,people who are looking for the film should watch this,people who do not like the book or do n't know
1,believe me i 've been in the mood for a while but that,believe me i was so disappointed that i was n't watching it
1,there 's an occasional attempt at making this film,there 's nothing inherently original about the movie
1,but if you have a masochistic fascination with a film that is,but i do n't care if you 're a bad actor
1,the plot is so ridiculous that the characters are so stupid the characters are,the film is a bit of a mishmash of events in the movie
1,molly ringwald is a delight and the film does a good job of portraying the characters,molly ringwald is one that i have n't forgotten since her career as a child
1,dylan baker plays a young man who is diagnosed with a,dylan is not a good actor or even a villain
1,there was also a scene where the hero,there are a couple of good performances
1,that 's all i can say,that is a great example of how
1,clark gable was in a film of his own as a child who had to deal with,clark gable plays the part of the great dictator in the film 's first major role
1,his wife is not as attractive as the one with all but a bad wig,his performance is n't bad but he does not have much to work with and the
1,another reviewer said i did n't like this,another thing is the acting is horrible
1,they were just as bad as a lot of movies,they are a couple of good examples of why this film
1,there is a lot of violence and there is a scene,there is an attempt of being a little too serious
1,unfortunately the story does not work and it is n't a film,unfortunately the rest is just a bunch of clichs and the story does
1,one of the most interesting movies of all time the adventures of the young people in a very small town in,one thing the director wanted to do with the script is the fact that he has the most important problem
1,it 's a shame that it 's,it 's not a bad movie
1,for a film about a man who has a very good career he decides to take his home in his life,for a while you have a good movie about the evils of war that are being held in the united states and
1,i was expecting something like it was the movie,i am a fan of the original but i am
1,although he has to have an indepth role in this film it is not clear he is just a good actor,although the movie had some interesting points such as that was the only good thing about the movie the acting and the
1,so the story is a little too simple,so it 's all about the acting
1,spielberg 's direction was a little heavyhanded at times but the movie was n't very good,spielberg 's direction is also very strong as he 's able to create suspense tension and suspense
1,the film is a complete mess with the exception of a very bad script,the movie is n't as good as some of the other comments it 's a
1,i am not a fan of the original series but i was,i do n't care if it is a comedy or not
1,that 's why it 's not the best,that 's why i love the movie
1,directed by a master of the craft it is,directed with no sense of style or skill
1,collides with the same characters as the old ones who played the characters and are not in the story they,collides with a lot of the film is the story of the mother of a young woman named seita
1,my favorite parts of the movie include the scene where the two men are dancing,my favourite part of the movie is when they are dancing with their friends
1,some of the dialogue is so poor the acting,some of the scenes are not that great
1,it 's not a bad film at all,it was a good movie to watch but i
1,it also has some interesting characters and i do recommend this,it is not a movie you can watch at home
1,do the people who have the patience,do not bother seeing this movie
1,but i do n't care for any,but then you have a movie
1,in the end this is one of those movies that i will never tire of,in the film he 's not a great actor but his performance is so good that
1,though the movie has a very good plot it 's not that bad at all,though i am glad that i can get past that i am a fan of all
1,for instance the scene where he tells his wife to his daughter that they are dead,for example the entire scene in which she sings a song at a dance bar and her
1,incidentally i do n't care for any of the actors and the director is not a filmmaker and writer,incidentally i was in my seat when i saw this movie i did a pretty good job of the movie
1,all i can say about the film is that it was a good movie,all i can say is that this is the first time i ever walked across
1,i 've always liked the show and was excited,i would like to see it again on dvd
1,for the first half hour of this film it is clear that there will be no more than 10,for me the best aspect of this movie is the way the camera moves through and the shots
1,there are two scenes which are very effective and the actors,there 's no real reason why this is a movie
1,i 've been in a similar situation since i saw the movie i thought this movie was great,i was n't expecting anything from the movie and it was just a waste of my time i could
1,so the film goes downhill from there,so i am going to see this film
1,even the acting was awful but that,even the music was pretty good
1,but i do have a lot of fun making,but this is n't just a bad film
1,utter crap out of my head,utter nonsense and not for everyone who
1,this movie is a waste of time and money,this is one of those movies that you can watch
1,and it was so bad that it had so many good lines,and that was the only good thing in the whole film
1,i do not know how the director managed to make the first three movies in the same,i was n't even aware of the film and was surprised by how bad it is
1,we have no idea why the movie is a lot of fun,we are talking about a group of people who have to take a
1,in this case the characters are so much more interesting in,in a film that 's not the most interesting one
1,i 've heard that the film had been shot in english and had been filmed in english,i think that the director was trying to give us a new movie in the end but this
1,here we have one character with a,here 's a real question why
1,bruce willis is the perfect choice for this movie,bruce willis is a good actor but he has nothing
1,its not a comedy that is n't funny,its a pity that this movie has a wide
1,one of my favorite moments for me,one of them is the same
1,unlike many other horror films the acting was atrocious,unlike other films this is a great movie
1,of course there are two main characters that do n't make any sense or,of course there is a bit of nudity and the nudity and gore
1,lucy silverstone is a very talented and talented actress,lucy is a good actress who has been a great
1,in fact this is one of the best of my generation,in the end the movie does n't even have a happy ending
1,the movie also is a bit over the top,the movie is a great snapshot of the life of
1,this movie is just a bit too long and i would n't recommend it to anyone,this is one of those awful horror movies that i have seen so far i can hardly
1,i 've read the other reviews on this film and i was very excited to read the book i thought it was,i have a soft spot for this film as a whole it 's a great movie with a great story line
1,therefore this one is the worst i 've ever seen,therefore i was n't expecting a movie about this one but
1,it is a great story and i,it is a very good movie
1,the movie is a little too much for a movie about a young girl who has to deal with a young woman,the acting and directing is excellent with excellent performances and the acting is very good with excellent performances from the leads
1,the story is a lot like the book which is about an evil killer named kenny and his,the plot is a little slow at times but the acting and the story are all good
1,i was n't even interested in this film until,i am not going to spoil this movie
1,how could a sequel to this classic sequel to the original,how the hell did the director think this was a good comedy
1,this film is the epitome of a true classic film that is n't really about the,this is the type of movie you should n't want to see again or do
1,those who do n't care about it should n't be able to make a sequel,those who enjoy a movie about the dangers of the human mind are very difficult for
1,i have to say that i love it,i would n't even think of the title of
1,it is a movie where you have to,it 's not even worth a look
1,when the movie is over and the story is so weak it is impossible to care about,when you watch the movie you can tell you the whole thing just does n't work
1,this movie is a must see for anyone interested in the culture of war,this is one of many movies that i have watched over and over so much
1,i am not a big fan of the movie or even the original but it was a very good movie,i 've seen it a few times and i have to say the movie did a good job with the plot
1,staple of all the other actors that play the same,staple of it all is a very nice film
1,there are two characters and situations that are completely different from the ones that were mentioned in other films,there is some very good action movies in this film the story line was very good i liked the first
1,she 's not a bad actress,she is not a very good actress
1,the only reason i gave this movie,the story itself is quite simple
1,this movie is about the adventures of people who have not seen the world and yet,this one has it in spades but is n't as great as the original series
1,having just watched the first one of it it was like watching a lot of movies,having read a comment for this movie i was surprised to find that it is not an
1,it 's not just a bad idea,it 's a great movie and i hope
1,the plot is pretty basic and there are some really nice sequences,the acting is pretty poor the actors are bad and the script is
1,limbo was a great movie it was a great film,limbo is a good film for those who want good entertainment
1,they 're not just a bunch of men,they are both good looking and have the same
1,if the story had had the best parts of it i might,if you do n't believe me you will love this movie
1,the acting is very good but the movie 's plot line,the first half of the movie is just plain dull
1,within the first 15 minutes of the film it turns the characters into a repulsive and irritating monster that is so predictable that you feel cheated and bored by a lot,within the first half hour we have an endless sequence of the two protagonists sharing a large amount of footage of various scenes of how the two men are together
1,even the usually dependable kristin bergen and the rest of the cast do not seem to be the only one who is able,even though i have n't seen a movie this bad in many years i can honestly say that it is n't bad
1,too bad i was so wrong in this,too bad the script is too convoluted
1,the plot is simple enough to be believable,the movie starts out like some typical horror film
1,we have to go see the other films of the past and you should see the movie but you 'll have to see it,we have a movie about a family of friends who have problems and problems and they are all trying to find each other
1,or even when the movie was released on video,or even the most ardent of the characters
1,i have n't read the books but this was the best,i am a fan of the series of tv series
1,i do n't want to say that the plot is n't bad enough to be a movie,i would like to thank you to a movie that i can watch over and over but this
1,but it 's not a bad film either,but i think they are not all that great
1,imo the movie could not have been made in such a way as to get,imo it would have been a lot better if they could make it better
1,this has to be the worst movie i,this movie has nothing special to say
1,the film is a very moving film but it does not have the same affect as any of the other films,the film has a couple of good actors including a couple of the supporting characters and a great story with a few
1,i do believe it is a movie for kids who love this show but they,i saw this movie in a theatre in new york where it was filmed
1,well that 's why i gave this movie a 1,well you 'll probably be watching the original film
1,although there are some great moments of humor and the occasional laugh at the end i found myself,although the film was a great deal of comedy it was a little bit slow at parts
1,well worth watching just for the performance by the actors,well that 's the way i 'd like to make it
1,this film was one of the worst of the year it,this film could n't possibly have been a good one
1,the film is not a complete disaster,the acting ranges from the very beginning to
1,these two characters are just as funny and the characters are all very likable,these are not the most famous things in their careers but they are good enough
1,the movie was n't even good,the movie is n't about a group
1,although there are a few flaws and a few scenes that are n't as memorable as this one i felt,although i think he 's supposed to be a little bit of a jerk he 's a good actor
1,this is one of those movies that i wish had been more enjoyable,this was one of the few movies i would recommend for everyone to sit
1,these two are two men in a hotel room in the woods,these are the characters and the plot and the performances are all solid
1,for the record this is the best of the three tales,for a movie that is a complete disgrace of any kind
1,james garner 's acting is pretty much perfect and,james earl jones 's performance is a joy
1,about the only thing you 'll get is that this is a film about a bunch of people who have,about a year later in the film she was killed and he is not afraid to leave the house
1,anne is the best character ever,anne heche is the only one that
1,that is not a compliment but a great piece of work,that is a shame because it did not make much sense
1,also a little bit of nudity is,also the music is very good
1,thankfully he never gets to the end that he will have to go to,thankfully he 's in the middle of a bad situation in the past
1,for me the worst part about the film was the way the lighting was done,for some inexplicable reason it is so bad and the saddest part of it is the
1,this film does not work for me,this film does n't even deserve to have
1,secondly he had to make his movie more of his own personal style,secondly it is a very poor film which i have n't seen since
1,there are no real surprises and no surprises to this story,there are some great songs and dance routines and the whole idea
1,i think the best thing is that the actors in this movie had no talent and i just hope they did it with more money than they would be,i think he did n't have a lot of money and he did n't have a clue of what was going on and he was n't given enough credit to
1,its like it 's supposed to be a spoof movie,its not the greatest horror film ever but definitely worth seeing
1,i would have preferred this movie to be more than one movie,i would like to point out that i have seen this movie several
1,the story is very good and the characters are likable as well,the story is not so much as the movie is told and the
1,it 's an insult to the filmmakers and the cast,it 's just a shame that it never got released as
1,the story of a young man searching for his son 's family and his mother and his family in new orleans and his family 's family,the script does contain a couple of interesting elements but the script is so poor that it 's hard to understand how they would have been in
1,it was a complete waste of time,it has a lot of fun
1,yes it 's true that the film has no real,yes the film was shot on location in england
1,i was n't sure whether the director intended,i was n't sure what to expect
1,that is what the movie is about,that is a shame as there is a
1,while the story of the movie is very original and the characters in the,while the film is not a total disaster it is still pretty good
1,fred gwynne is the only one to,fred williamson is a good villain
1,there is a good reason i can think of a movie that has some,there 's also a scene where the hero has the hots for him
1,the story and characters are not developed well either and i think,the acting was good but the story was n't good enough
1,i am sure i 've never seen any of the other two stooges or any of the other,i 've watched the film multiple times and it is still the best of it 's kind
1,and the ending where she is a child,and i 've seen the original bambi
1,we know it 's a good thing to see,we are not supposed to be scared but we 're
1,tshirts like the other characters have been so good and it is so easy to understand the movie,tshirts were so bad that i could barely see why they were making the movie and the movie itself
1,a film of the nature and spirit of a young woman 's life is a very good one but this,a good idea of how the movie is supposed to take place in the middle of a crowded building
1,i have to admit that i 've seen worse acting and acting,i do n't know how anyone could get the idea of this movie
1,this film is not a bad film at any level it is not a movie,this has got to be the worst of all the films i have seen
1,although this is an excellent film i am glad that the dvd was available on dvd because they were not available on dvd,although i think the main reason why this is the film for me it 's not as good as the first one
1,indeed this is the worst film to ever hit the mind of the earth,indeed the film is a bit over a few minutes but it 's very slow
1,it 's an example of this film 's,it 's like watching a bad movie
1,maybe if you 're going to see something more like a tv movie you have a pretty,maybe the film is not worth the time i spent to make it in my collection
1,she 's got a lot to do but she has to do it,she does n't know how to use her as the opportunity to escape and
1,if this film was made for tv i would n't have,if you like the movie you should check it out
1,my friends were laughing at the film and,my advice is to watch this movie
1,george c scott has a few scenes that are n't even funny,george brent 's acting was good but he did not do much in
1,two people in a different location,two of the most talented actors are
1,though there are some great songs i can tell you that the music is n't the least bit memorable,though i do n't have a clue that i do n't have much to say about the film this is
1,you know that the film is not going to be a success for anyone,you have to wonder why i do n't know how to describe it
1,as the film goes on i found myself cheering for the screen as it was revealed to my audience when it,as an example of how to use the camera to look in a mirror the camera angles are very tight
1,this movie is an utter embarrassment to me,this is the first feature of the series that
1,how could you feel like a man with your hair and a bottle of,how can you have a movie that is as good as the original
1,it 's not a movie for a movie that 's supposed to,it would be a shame to see the same film again
1,this movie is a must see if you like to watch movies with some of the most talented actors,this is the story of a girl who 's been married to another actress who is now in the middle
1,men are not so bad it looks good enough and the script is just too,men are not always as good as they are and not in this case
1,and that was the best part,and it was a very good movie
1,and it is not the same,and there 's a lot of sex
1,they are just trying to be a new yorker and they ca,they 're both pretty funny and it 's just as good
1,lou diamond phillips was great in his first talkie role,lou is the real life character who makes it hard to
1,this is the story which is very very sad,this movie is not worth a cent of my time
1,its a shame to see the film on dvd soon,its very funny and it 's fun to watch a movie
1,as far as i can tell there have been a lot of bad horror movies in this genre,as a film maker i can assure you that the acting is n't too bad the plot is weak
1,the only reason i give it a 2 instead of a 1 is because it was so bad,the film is also about a man who has his own dreams and dreams about his wife and child
1,also the story has more holes than any other one,also it was nice to see her in the same role
1,andy garcia is great as always,andy lau and his son are in
1,this movie is a total waste of time and effort,this is the story which takes us on a journey to
1,that 's the only thing that can stop me from,that 's why i have to see it again
1,when you get to see the movie and see the real footage of the main characters you can find them in this film,when i first heard the name of the film i thought that the film was a good film to begin with but it was
1,before i get into the story i have no problem,before you know it it 's a big deal
1,ending was a bit confusing but it 's still a,ending is a joke but it never gets boring
1,they are the most likable and lovable people,they 're a great deal of fun
1,miraculous is a very good movie,miraculous and funny i am still laughing
1,but the movie does n't even try to make the audience any,but there is a very good reason to watch this movie
1,in fact the movie is just a little bit,in the end it just is n't funny
1,honestly a few scenes are pretty good and you can see the whole budget of the film,honestly a great movie that you could not have done with a good story or an interesting story
1,however the film 's story was too thin to make you want to see it,however if you are not going to watch it you 'll not be disappointed
1,a lot of movies are not funny at all,a great film with an amazing cast of excellent actors
1,warner brothers have done this in a long long time,warner brothers did not have the guts to make an action
1,i was surprised that he was so funny,i was so shocked to find that it was
1,oh and it 's all in the script that the director is trying to be clever to make,oh my i am not sure why he agreed to take his clothes off in a movie
1,another thing i noticed about it is that it was made,another thing i did n't really care about the characters
1,every scene is a joke and the whole film seems a bit too,every time i see it i will not be able to watch
1,incendiary is one of the better movies i 've seen since the last,incendiary is one of the best movies that i 've ever seen
1,the first thing that struck me was how much the movie had been released,the story and characters are so bad that you ca n't even make it up
1,it is n't the most profound scene in the movie,it is one of the funniest movies i have seen for
1,but the film has a nice score to it with some of the,but it was n't that the film was a little too much
1,in a film like this i have no idea what to do but i,in fact i have not been able to see the film for years
1,i do n't want to be so harsh,i have been waiting for something to happen but
1,there 's a lot of action in this movie,there is an obvious lack of a story and a
1,dammit i 'll say that i 've seen this film dozens of times and it 's not so much a film as a horror film,dammit i am sure that the film would be better if it had been more of a comedy but it was so much better than that
1,candyman is not a good film but its a good one,candyman was a great film and i loved it so much that
1,unfortunately the story is about a group of,unfortunately it does not seem very good
1,i 've seen this film several times already because it 's not a bad film and,i was very impressed by the way this was filmed and how it came out
1,i was surprised at the number of scenes that the director had previously achieved in his work,i do n't think this movie was supposed to be a parody but it was a very good
1,however this movie has no real story and no character development,however it was not as bad as the first time around but
1,i have not seen the movie but i do n't know if,i do n't understand why so many people hate this movie
1,and that 's a shame since the original,and there was a few good moments
1,the story is not a bad one and the actors do n't seem,the film is an interesting piece of work that i found enjoyable
1,as far as acting goes it 's not that bad,as for me i do n't know how to make a
1,instead it has a few good points the movie has,instead it makes the viewer feel sorry for them
1,well it 's not that bad but this,well the plot is very good too
1,i 've been looking for something more to the original and i can say that the ending is pretty good,i have never heard of another movie where the plot seems to have a very simple premise that is n't a
1,get a job of a good movie to see how it could have been done by some good actors like peter falk,get ready to see a film about a man who is obsessed by the death of the devil and the man
1,well it 's not the best movie,well you do not have to
1,i think it 's a great movie because the director was a master of,i have never seen a film infuriated me as much as i can
1,this is not a film for everyone,this is one movie you have no intention
1,changing from the usual fare of the first one the movie suffers from one of the best endings to the movie and i do n't think i will,changing from a few of the other comments i have read here that i think i will be watching something more than a few of these episodes
1,the story line is a simple one,the acting is very good and the acting
1,during the depression sequence the movie starts with a very interesting and touching,during the course of a film the story is not very compelling
1,the movie is a mess of mine,the acting is horrible as well
1,watch it on the big screen and then,watch this movie on a rainy day
1,apparently the movie was made with a low budget as a result of a budget,apparently this film was shot in the same way as the one with the camera but
1,the plot is simple but the actors and actresses make it work to watch and you have no,the first part of the movie is really great and really makes me think about the film
1,lucille ball does an ok job as the heroine but her character is,lucille dench plays mrs kelly a very beautiful and beautiful young woman
1,has it been made for tv to be in the top 250 of,has n't anyone noticed that this is the worst film ever made
1,this time the movie takes its own course,this is the worst movie ever i have to
1,but if you have to watch the movie it is a great movie,but then again i 've never seen a movie like this before and it
1,dave and the chipmunks are a bunch of friends who have no,dave the frog has a lot of fun to work with
1,doris day 's character is the worst thing i 've ever,doris wishman does n't make a movie about this subject
1,there is one scene where the main character is walking through the door talking about it,there are some scenes that are just too funny but it is also a bit of a
1,the film is about a woman who marries a man named kisna and,the acting was so bad it was almost painful to sit through
1,i was very excited about this movie at the time and i was so excited to see it again,i would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in watching a film or a horror movie
1,i was really impressed with the story and i did like the ending and the ending,i have a problem with the fact that i have to say this is one of the
1,ed harris is the only reason why this movie,ed wood has made the best of this
1,scott wiper is a genius as his wife is a very funny character,scott is a very good character and i hope they make more films
1,it 's like an old lady with a heart of gold,it does n't matter how much money it has to have made
1,ca n't even begin to get rid of,ca n't wait for the next ethel
1,i have to give credit for what it means to have a good cast of characters,i have to say this movie was pretty good but i thought the actors could not act
1,i 've never really seen a better actor in this movie than the average,i have to say this was the best film i have ever seen
1,there is a very good scene in this episode where it is the funniest show,there were some good moments but the film could 've been so much better
1,for some reason i have n't read the book i am so disgusted by the plot,for the first time in the life of a new generation there are two different stories and
1,this is a movie that i would not be able,this is the worst film i have ever seen
1,a movie that i would watch again and again,a few scenes that are just plain stupid
1,guy and woman have a good chemistry with their respective lovers,guy is a bit of an actor and his acting career is
1,there were also some funny moments and i liked the characters,there is n't a single good thing about that one is that
1,as an actor he was a great actor,as a result of the film i was n't
1,heshe 's not even a good actress,heshe was a real person and was not
1,is the only movie i can recall,is it supposed to be serious
1,with that in mind the movie has been made for,with this one he was n't a good man
1,according to most of his other comments on this site i have to say i am not a fan of the,according to my fellow classmates this is the only movie where i 've seen the entire thing on the imdb
1,the story is so predictable the story is boring the story is contrived and,the only redeeming feature of this movie is the cinematography by george romero
1,funny how the film 's title song,funny but not the worst ever
1,the movie is a great example of the great talent of this type of film,the acting is terrible the script is bad the script is stupid and it is just
1,i 've never seen so little of his work as a,i 've never read anything that i 've ever seen
1,i 've never been a fan of the series but the series did n't have to be much better,i would not be surprised but i do n't see the point that i did n't know i was watching
1,this movie is not a complete disaster,this is the type of movie that should
1,it 's not that this is n't bad,it was a bit of a surprise to see
1,pufnstuf was n't a movie that was n't made,pufnstuf has a very funny line that is not only
1,i was n't disappointed by the film,i do n't think that the characters were
1,richard widmark was a great actor but i really wanted to like him in the role i thought that he could act as,richard gere gives a wonderful performance as the father of the mother who is not quite as strong as the other two
1,shipped away from the film with a very long and short ending the film has a very weak plot,shipped out to a local bar where it belongs to the local sheriff in a new england city district attorney
1,how about that we have a good time,how can the director 's character be so much
1,the movie was a little slow at times but it 's a great show for all,the story is about a group of people who have to deal with a group of strange
1,6 the scene where a girl has a crush on a woman,6 the story was about 3 men who have to spend a weekend
1,just as a movie with a great cast,just to get a few lines and the jokes
1,is there any reason that the audience should not get the impression that they were watching the movie,is n't he a man who thinks it 's his duty to make this a little easier to swallow
1,some of my favorite scenes of all are the ones where they,some people say it 's just a waste of my time
1,i 've heard that this has been a very popular film by an excellent director of,i was a bit surprised that this film was a flop in the first place
1,i would recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it,i was hoping that the movie would have been a success but instead
1,i have no idea why the film is called to have so many people to choose the plot to be a,i am not a fan of movies and this is a movie for all those who have n't seen it
1,the only thing good about it was the acting,the story is a mess and i think that the
1,my wife is a great fan of the movie i loved this,my advice is to see it and you will regret it
1,we are not told how much the movie is,we know how to make a good movie
1,the movie is not only a comedy that is a satire on the life and times,the script is n't too bad but the story is very interesting enough to warrant an interesting
1,the story is so full of holes it 's not even worth a second viewing,the film has a good plot line that i liked the most part the acting was
1,like a lot of the movie it has the same effect of the first one,like the first episode of the original bambi 2 was n't a good show but the
1,as a result of this movie it is not a film to me,as a result the film never stops to focus the story and the characters
1,if you 've read the book and read the book you will probably be missing from my life,if it 's not for the good acting and the fact that the actors do n't do anything better
1,arnold schwarzenegger was also the perfect choice for this role,arnold schwarzenegger was excellent as the villain who was in this
1,there were some scenes in the movie where they were trying to show some emotion in the way of the movie,there was also a good deal of humor in the film but it 's just not enough to carry the movie
1,if i was a little too young i would have given it a 0,if you 're looking for a film that is n't that bad then you should
1,chan is a good actor who does n't really know what he is doing in real life,chan and his team of misfits is a little too eager to be good and it seems that
1,hard luck in all aspects and for a film with a little more,hard boiled is the best of the four and far far better
1,like the film it has a very good story and some great acting but the story is so weak that it is almost unrecognizable,like this film the film is a very good one and the movie is a bit too dark and it 's not really a horror
1,this movie is a total failure to watch the,this is a movie with a capital rating
1,in a way this film is an excellent example to me for what the director is trying to convey,in this version the film is a tribute to the book which makes it more fun and less than a
1,the movie 's biggest flaw is that the actors are so bad that they are just so wooden,the story is a bit weak the acting is horrible and the characters are all unlikable characters
1,everybody else has to go out of business and have the,everybody 's the one that made the movie even better
1,the first thing that makes you hate it is the fact that it has no relation to the original,the film starts when the hero arrives at the castle and the girl goes off and kills them
1,words of people in their past were a bunch of people with a bad disability,words of his own movies are n't bad but the film is just awful
1,i think the director should have been able to make a movie about the real life of the world but the director should,i would not have bothered to go see this movie in the first place and i could have done a better job
1,the only thing that made the whole movie worthwhile to watch was when the actors,the movie was shot in a cheap way and was n't a complete waste
1,when the film is over the top it 's a shame because the director is so,when the movie was released theatrically made the film industry it was a complete failure
1,there have been many movies that have been so much,there are so many things wrong with this movie
1,tony soprano as the lead villain and the rest of the cast are good enough as a couple that have not,tony todd plays the part of an aging character who is not only a loner but also a love story
1,the movie is n't about the killer,the film was made for tv
1,a film that i have to see again for a few months as an example,a lot of people think that they are not in a very good mood
1,there is some good gore scenes but there 's a lot,there are many things that do n't make any sense
1,do they really think they 're a bunch of people who are,do n't get it right i did n't see this film
1,well the real thing that really happened was the story and,well worth watching but not the worst film ever made
1,the movie is a bit over the top,the first thing that struck me was that it
1,both the characters are not as developed by,both are a good thing to watch
1,his wife who is a lawyer and has a crush on him and his family,his mother is the daughter of the family but the father is n't really able to
1,kris kristofferson as the lead character is a little weak but,kris kristofferson has made me laugh out loud every character
1,all that matters is just the first part,all this and a bit of the same
1,the film 's title is a little misleading as it is one of the best,the plot is a bit contrived but it is very very well done and well worth
1,there are a lot of bad movies out there but the film never rises above,there 's no need in the movie but the story is not very interesting
1,the acting is superb and i liked the way he handled the emotions and feelings of character,the plot is about a young man who goes out to find the missing woman in a small
1,what the filmmakers do n't get the license and do n't know,what makes this show great is how the show got canceled
1,there is one thing that i would love to say about this film,there is n't an ounce of suspense in the first movie and the film
1,this is a movie about the power of war the struggle,this is the most ridiculous film i have ever seen
1,i 've read the book and it is a great surprise,i 've seen a lot of movies in my day and this
1,a movie with a good script and a decent plot,a few of his fans of the show are a bit
1,it 's just so ridiculous you ca n't make any sense,it 's not a movie for anyone to get a glimpse of
1,also in the cast are the characters,also the music is great and the acting
1,as a fan of this series and seeing it on the,as a result the movie is just a bad movie
1,i think this movie is the best i have ever seen,i have to admit though this is the worst movie ever made
1,my rating 4 out of 10 stars,my favorite character in me is the guy
1,way too often the film takes place in,way of saying i love this one
1,inexpensive and i have to mention that this is a great movie,inexpensive movie is a classic example of the kind of movie where it
1,possibly because the film 's premise of a woman is to make it interesting to watch,possibly the most overrated scene in the film is when they do n't seem to have a
1,however i was surprised to find out that i could n't find anything else in the way of,however i do n't think it 's a matter of fact that he is a great actor
1,i have to admit though i'm a huge scifi fan and this movie really is one,i 've seen many movies with a little more depth than it usually is and it really
1,actually a good deal of action is the only thing that makes the movie a classic,actually it 's not as bad as the first one but there really is n't anything that
1,to be honest this film is so boring it makes you angry and angry,to me this would be the only reason i gave it a 2 because i
1,this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen,this is one of those movies which you can see as it
1,mr and mrs 's son are a,mr blandings is an interesting character
1,overall this movie is a masterpiece in every respect,overall the movie is not a good film it 's
1,honestly it was n't the worst movie i 've ever seen,honestly it 's a very good movie and it is definitely worth
1,that is how this movie was going to be,that said it was a pretty good film
1,this is a very good film and i recommend it,this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,it 's a pretty lame movie but it is not a good movie,it is an excellent movie with a strong message to be learned
1,i think they are all very good,i 've never seen a film so strongly
1,so it is not a good movie,so what 's with the other characters
1,freddy and mouse are the real stars,freddy 's dead end is a movie that
1,maybe the director was trying too hard to be edgy and i do n't think they would have made,maybe it was the best part of the movie that was n't the case but it was n't
1,i think it 's not the best film ever made but it is very well done in,i think i should have given it a 10 if i could but i did n't
1,a few minutes later the movie becomes a complete failure but then again it 's,a film of sorts that has been done with a thousand of other reviews
1,in my opinion this is the worst movie i have ever seen,in the film he does an excellent job as a writer who is
1,some people think that this is a movie with a lot more laughs than,some of the acting was pretty cheesy but it just does n't work
1,the first time we saw the movie was in the,the acting was bad but the story was good
1,they have no problems with the rest of the film,they were not so good as the bad ones but not
1,he 's a pretty decent guy,he has a very small budget that
1,after the film 's conclusion i could n't tell what 's the point of watching the movie,after a very good start with a woman in a bikini she decides to leave her and her
1,however there is an element of this film that i can understand that it,however it has a few good scenes that are n't really funny either
1,not so much the same way that it 's so,not only that but the acting is pretty good
1,a great performance by a supporting cast,a great cast and a fine script
1,this movie was so funny it is funny,this is an absolutely terrible movie that is almost
1,after seeing a film about two young women in the same luxurious film together they are both very very,after the death of a child he meets an innocent man named angus who also has no qualms
1,i am not the type of man in the movie,i have no idea how the movie ends and it is
1,in fact i 've seen many of his movies but this one is so bad it could n't make any sense,in my opinion it is the worst of the bunch of the first movie and is a great sequel to the series
1,they have to be the biggest star on the movie,they all seem to have been made of lego
1,rhames is the main reason why he should n't be the last one and it certainly should have been the one,rhames 's character is a bit too much and the plot is n't too complicated but the characters are well developed
1,but this movie was just too bad and i do n't want to go into the film 's faults and the acting,but if it is n't for the fact there are many things to be done in this movie it 's not
1,i was surprised to find that the film is a little,i was so excited when it came out on dvd
1,this is a must see for any anime fan,this is one of the worst movies i 've ever
1,by the way the director should have been a bit more focused at all the actors,by the same point of the story is a bit more of a comedy that the director
1,he was not the first one to die but his family is a very good guy,he 's a real cowboy in the beginning and it is a good movie he can handle
1,this is not a movie about a man who,this movie has everything the movie 's title
1,the film opens with the two men in the desert staring at a table at a,the acting is so awful that i was surprised to hear how awful it was
1,after the first hour i decided to give it a shot,after seeing the whole thing i had no idea of what the
1,perhaps the best movie ever made it 's way to be,perhaps the director should not be sued for this movie
1,they should have made a film that 's more than just another movie,they are both great and the movie is very well paced and very entertaining
1,this movie was very good and i did n't like the ending,this is a movie that has a very good cast and great music
1,and the story itself was pretty good,and that was the only part of the
1,as i said i ca n't believe i had seen the film at,as it turns out the movie is a complete waste of time
1,then we learn that the real life of the family is a real,then there was the fact that this was a really good movie
1,that would probably make it a little more entertaining,that 's the whole point of the film
1,there are so many things wrong with this film,there is a reason that this film is a bit
1,where is the story that i do n't understand,where the hell were the vampires and geeks
1,i was n't expecting a much less accurate plot and,i have to say that i was very disappointed
1,also the film is about a man who gets his heart broken and is trying to kill himself,also the scene where she 's lying with the girl is pretty much a carbon copy of her
1,let 's make an appearance to the,let 's see what you do
1,and that 's the only thing that is missing the point,and i was n't sure why this movie was made
1,and then the ending was so bad it makes a mockery of,and the movie is a good example of what is right
1,this is the best movie i 've,this is a really good movie
1,yes this film does n't have a single moment to it but it does have its,yes this one is not the worst movie i 've seen in quite some time
1,from then on the whole film is set in a very interesting time,from what i 've seen the movie was a waste of time
1,the film is a very good thriller and it does it justice with plenty of great action,the film is set in a prison where a group of people get involved in the making of
1,i was really impressed by his portrayal of the characters and the story line,i was surprised how this movie has to be a sequel to the great classic
1,he does not have the strength to,he is a very funny character
1,as a matter of fact it 's the kind of movie that you can only laugh at,as far as the story goes i did n't expect a great action film to make me interested
1,the only saving graces in the film,the script is n't too bad
1,the acting is good with an ensemble cast who could have been more competent,the film is very good with lots of great acting from the cast
1,terminally in this movie is the worst of the worst movies ever made,terminally the film 's plot is the same as the first one
1,i'm a fan of the original series but after seeing a few episodes it 's still pretty much,i'm a big fan of the series and i liked it but i really enjoyed this movie
1,i'm not sure why but i do not have anything else to say about this movie,i'm sure the movie was n't a complete waste of time but the movie was pretty damn
1,ok so the film is pretty good but i do n't think that it was a,ok so if you want to watch this movie i suggest you do it yourself
1,ps the film itself was very bad and i think the film 's main asset is that it lacks the wit,ps i would have preferred to see a lot of the film 's shortcomings and the cast did not work
1,such a movie is the same way as the first movie,such a film is an insult to all the good people in
1,then the plot is told by the same director that he was a great actor and a lot more then the film,then you have a movie that 's about a guy who is a cop on a mission to be a cop
1,chicks are supposed to be funny and they are n't really,chicks have been in the spotlight for a while now
1,the movie has a couple of scenes where there 's nothing wrong,the movie is a little too much for the younger crowd
1,if you like the first two and you should see this movie,if i were to give a 0 of 1 i should
1,john wayne as a tough guy who is a cop to get to his wife 's house is n't exactly a good movie but,john wayne 's performance as the lead character was a good addition to the movie and was a very nice surprise to watch
1,i have to wonder why they did n't have to make a sequel,i am not a big fan of the movies but i was n't a
1,besides the film 's plot twists the film lacks suspense and it 's too long,besides the plot and acting of the film 's script it 's not a bad movie
1,at least i had heard of him and had to endure this movie because he,at least that was the only way i would be able to see it
1,well i 've never been a big fan of the comics but i 've seen some other films that are so bad they 're,well you can see that this movie does n't even get the exposure to the book it 's just an excuse for that
1,on the other hand the movie is pretty good,on the other hand if you are looking for a
1,this movie is a must see,this one is just another example of
1,in this one it is not that easy to identify with it,in the meantime the film is not a typical horror film
1,following a series of murders on the other end of the tracks the only thing that makes the film work are its characters,following a few years of age in a year of the holocaust this film shows the power and strength of an artist
1,thank you to the writers and directors who have made this movie,thank goodness that 's not saying a whole lot for the whole film
1,at first it seems like it 's a little off topic but in the end the movie is still pretty good,at first i did n't like this film because i'm sure there are no other actors in the production of the original
1,i 've never read the book so far but i have to say that the film 's plot summary is very interesting,i do n't care if the filmmakers or producers were trying to be too hard or just trying to get a copy of
1,with a supposed budget of about 1000000 i was expecting more,with the exception of the great music the music was n't as
1,it was a great movie for the time,it 's not a bad film but is not
1,banderas is a young man who has no interest in,banderas is the most convincing person in the business
1,but the movie is so bad that they,but this film is a must see
1,because of the lack of action the movie is really really bad,because they do n't know what he 's doing and why he is
1,this one is a classic of course the best of,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,it 's the same old story as this show was,it 's like the actors in this film are trying to
1,it 's also a shame to see,it 's not that great either
1,my friends and i had a lot of fun with this movie,my favorite character is the one who is supposed to be the father
1,the movie was so bad the actors could n't act,the film has an underlying message to the audience that i
1,i do n't know why this film was,i was very impressed by the story
1,actually it was not a bad movie,actually if you want to see this movie
1,now i 've seen the movie a little more than i can say in a film,now the film would 've been much better if it had been shot in a time where
1,too bad it was n't so great,too bad it was n't released in the
1,this was a very good film and,this was a very good movie
1,yes i do n't think he 's a bad actor but it 's just a good job,yes the film does n't work out for the rest of the movie and there is not much
1,interestingly i did n't have a clue what to expect but this movie was a great surprise,interestingly the movie starts in the middle when the hero is in the car and the girl is
1,anyone who has ever watched this show has ever seen the original show or has read the series or read the original,anyone who has ever seen this movie will be looking for something more than a bit of a waste for it
1,mainly it 's not that great and it is n't,mainly this movie is not worth a rental unless you are
1,spoilers ahead this is an excellent film,spoilers ahead the story is a little slow
1,i do n't know what to say about the plot but that is the main reason why i did n't watch this movie,i think this movie was a lot of fun to watch and maybe that is enough to get me into the film
1,talk to a guy who is supposed to be a man who has been in love with her,talk about the movie is n't bad but the fact that this is the kind of movie that has
1,there are so many of us that you can watch the,there is a good deal of humor in the film
1,faust is a classic of the original film,faust is the best movie i 've seen this
1,as a result i had to be in that mood when the movie was released i was very pleasantly surprised,as for the acting i 'd say the film is not the best but it is a good film
1,i do n't know who 's doing a good job,i have n't read any of the other comments here but
1,this is an excellent film and i highly recommend it to everyone and anyone with a sense of humor can appreciate it,this film is the first to be banned in 2007 it was released at a time when the first film was released in
1,blood and gore are a little off the,blood surf is n't one of them
1,it was a nice movie to see and,it was so bad it was funny
1,i was n't sure whether the director intended to,i am not a fan of the genre
1,it 's a good movie for a rainy day,it 's the story of a boy who is a
1,love story love story and love and hate,love is not all that interesting for the young
1,excellent film of its time in which it is set in the,excellent performances by all involved in the production design and cinematography
1,at first glance it is an interesting movie with lots of great actors and a few nice shots and a lot of,at the end of the movie you see that she 's a woman and the two lovers were n't very much
1,like the first film the acting is pretty bad and the plot was pretty predictable,like the rest of the film the plot is very simple and there is a few
1,it also shows the life of a child,it is an odd and sad little film with
1,if they did it they should not be able to pull it off,if you want to see a good movie this is a must see
1,his acting is not bad but it really is n't,his performance as a man is very believable but not as
1,this movie has the potential of being,this is a really good movie
1,i 've never seen such a terrible movie,i have never watched a movie so much so
1,the acting was terrible and i really felt bad,the movie is a mess of a film
1,dina delpy is the one who is a great,dina danes as the young girl is wonderful
1,watching a movie that i had seen on a sunday night in the,watching this documentary is a reminder of how the movie was shot
1,it is a very funny film and one of the most memorable things in the film,it 's a shame that the director did not have to go to the bathroom with this
1,they do n't make movies like this anymore,they are the real people who have to do
1,all of the other actors seem to have lost their jobs,all of these films have a great cast including some actors that
1,to say that the movie does n't have to be seen is the same way that it is,to be fair it 's just an average movie but i would not say that it has a lot
1,the film is about a man who wants to be,the script by john ford is a complete failure
1,i was really excited at how bad this movie was when i heard about what i was watching,i am a sucker for movies that have so many great actors but they are not even good
1,instead the characters have a very different feel and a sense of humor,instead it 's a rather bland movie that has nothing to say
1,my favorite character is in the movie and the story of the father was played by john goodman who plays the main character with the same name as the original film,my friends and i are in for a big thrill and we are all just talking about how the story is told and it is not so bad it 's good' but
1,could have been better off being better,could n't they get a bit of sense
1,while it may have been more realistic and less realistic it 's still a fun and fun film,while i am not going to spoil it for the rest of the movie there 's no real plot
1,the acting is terrible at best and worse it 's the worst film,the plot is very simple and the story is a bit weak
1,it was n't funny it was n't funny,it 's not even a good movie
1,his acting was very poor and i think it 's a bit distracting for me to have a more difficult time,his acting is not very good and the plot is not as good as the first two but it is also one
1,for me the best part of it is the fact that it is in the top 100 of movies,for instance there 's no attempt at a coherent narrative to make the viewer care about the characters
1,i'm glad i did not get the dvd in,i'm sorry i had n't seen this movie
1,the movie is also very well done as,the acting was n't as good either
1,finally the two guys decide to go to a remote town where it 's going to be a big hit on their honeymoon,finally the film does have a few things going against it and you get the feeling that the film 's end is too much
1,long time dead and the dead end of the,long live a long life of young people
1,someone who has a mental capacity for a life is willing to be a little more willing to accept it,someone in the cast is a veteran and the director who has a great talent in this is the only good
1,because of the fact that the film has a little bit of it it is not a,because they did n't have any kind of talent to make a movie about the evils
1,and if it was n't for the great acting of a few,and then the whole film takes place in a big mansion
1,the first time i saw it i was laughing hysterically at it and i did n't even bother to get it,the story line is very similar to a movie that is n't a typical hollywood film but instead of a good one
1,that 's a big deal because it is one of,that 's why i have to write a review
1,one of my favorite shows of the last years of my life,one of these guys is killed by his wife in a small ditch
1,because there are so many things wrong with this film it,because i do not know why it 's a film
1,granted it is a film that is a,granted this is not a great movie
1,we see him in a small role as a character of a man who 's trying to protect his wife from being a little more than a normal boy who has not been able,we are not shown on a movie that i would recommend for anyone who enjoys to be honest about what the director and the people involved in the movie are trying to accomplish
1,we do n't see him in this movie but he,we get a lot more than a little sugary
1,but it also has a nice touch of humor and a good story,but the best thing is that it 's just not a great movie
1,second the film is not about the people in the story,second the movie itself is quite funny the plot is simple and
1,this is an excellent documentary and one that is very rare,this movie is about a group of people that have a lot
1,having just seen the movie i thought i would give a damn,having been trying to find out what is the best movie ever made
1,some of this was not the same,some of the scenes are a bit slow
1,i have been searching for a movie with the same name,i have seen this film many times and i still have to
1,director and cowriter john cassavetes and his wife david who are a,director david lynch has done a wonderful job in this film
1,wiseguy and the other two were good actors in this movie and it 's hard to say where they were,wiseguy the film 's only saving grace is that it is an insult to those who want to be able to
1,the only good thing in this film is the,the plot is simple as the story progresses
1,great film about a dysfunctional family,great film and i think that it
1,however i do n't think the director could make a sequel to the book,however in one of the most controversial scenes of film i have a crush on
1,worse than this is it is not that,worse is the story of this one
1,the movie is n't even funny enough to be fun,the movie does n't make a whole lot of sense and
1,the acting is good with the exception of a few minor players but i have to admit that i,the first time i saw it i was a little sceptical that the characters were just so stupid
1,they did not know it and the story did n't work,they do n't seem to care for the other characters
1,the movie was so poorly written that it had to be seen by all,the film is very slow moving and has the worst dialogue i 've ever witnessed
1,he was the only one who was able to get,he also had a good sense for the film
1,i was n't impressed by the movie,i do have to say that this movie
1,liberally the film is a complete mess,liberally the plot is simple but the movie
1,i have seen the trailer for this movie so i 'll be honest about it,i was a kid and i had the misfortune to sit through the whole film
1,from there i was able to suspend disbelief to find something interesting about the,from the beginning of the film the film has a very nice twist
1,in fact it was the same thing to be the only,in fact he was n't a good director for him
1,and that 's what you 'd expect a lot of,and the acting is bad the direction is awful
1,all in all this is a movie that you 'll enjoy to watch,all in all this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,why was it the same thing,why does n't they just make the
1,although there were plenty of movies that were very entertaining and entertaining i think that,although some have compared with the original the rest is not even worth mentioning
1,one of my favorite movies of all time,one is the guy who played the lead role
1,believe me it 's not even worth the time,believe me i have seen the same movie
1,the film is a bit boring but it is n't a film for everyone,the movie is about a young woman who goes to school with her parents a
1,my favourite parts of this film are the clips that are,my favorite character is the guy from the original series
1,it was a very good movie and that 's why it 's a movie worth viewing,it 's not a good movie to be taken seriously and not for the good but it
1,i think the movie was a good idea to show the,i would recommend this movie for any movie buff out
1,the acting in this movie was horrible,the acting was good especially the first half
1,let 's make sure the director has the courage to do something like the director or he 's,let me make you believe that it is a film of the highest order of the year
1,john ritter is a wonderful actor in this movie,john cusak plays a very nice guy who is a
1,he is a man who can control her life in an empty environment and make him an equal to the world,he is a good actor but that is just what he is doing when he can act like his character
1,all i can say is that this has to be one of those movies i 've seen in the past few years,all that matters to the film the film is about a young woman who lives in a small village in the country
1,that 's why the movie is n't really the same,that the director and producers had been involved in the movie
1,not to mention the scene where the hero 's character was killed the priest is,not only was the acting poor but the story was n't really very good
1,recommended for fans of italian cinema,recommended for fans of the genre and
1,one of the most memorable movies of,one of my favourite moments ever
1,this movie is just a bad movie,this is one of those movies that should
1,according to my fellow classmates that is the story of a man who has a secret mission and has to deal with his own personal demons and is willing,according to the imdb user 's rating the film is about a group of teenagers who are killed in an isolated asylum where the killer is a werewolf
1,god is a good movie it is a good example of what it is,god bless me this film does n't deserve to be seen by everyone
1,after all this is a bad movie with a capital d,after the first hour you realize that you know it is not
1,the first part of the film is the same and that 's a bit too much of an achievement,the only good aspect of this film is its ability to be an interesting movie and is not the only
1,the first half has the same kind of character as the first and the film 's plot is quite,the only reason i did n't watch this film is if one is looking for a good film
1,even the most ardent fans of the genre will appreciate this film,even if you are a fan of the original it 's still worth
1,one of the biggest problems for me was that,one of my favourite movies of the year
1,the story of two friends in love and their marriage is very similar to each other,the story is about a man who is sent to the united states to be a hero
1,they are n't the type we watch,they 're both a bunch of people and
1,the only reason i gave this a 1 was that it was the,the acting is horrible the directing is worse the dialogue is awful
1,i was really excited to see this film,i saw this film on the scifi channel and
1,another thing that bothered me about most movies is how the director and the director were making movies like that,another reason i did n't give this movie a 1 is the fact that it 's not only a comedy but
1,big time to go on to make a movie,big time is the best movie i have seen in
1,spoiler alert a little boy with a bad name of the dead boy 's girlfriend who lives on a farm near the lake,spoiler alert spoiler ahead there are a group of scientists who have a secret service agent who is assigned to the case of a
1,he has to be one of the greatest,he also had no problem with it
1,but the movie is a good example of why a film is made,but it 's not the worst movie i 've ever seen and that it
1,it 's just a bunch of kids trying,it 's just a waste of time
1,jbl 's character is not even the most annoying of his,jbl is also a very bad and very bad film
1,the film has a very good story which makes it very easy,the movie is very entertaining and is n't a bad one
1,unfortunately the director is unable to make a coherent film in its entirety and the film does not make a coherent film,unfortunately the story of a young boy who is not a little different is not the most compelling part of the movie
1,the plot revolves around a group of young kids who find a cure for a killer,the movie 's main flaw is that it is the only one of them that is very
1,the plot is pretty good and is very good,the movie also suffers from a lack of originality
1,james gandolfini 's portrayal of the president,james bond is a great director
1,that said the story was very good,that 's because i was in a state
1,i'm a huge fan of the books but i have,i'm sure it was not intended in the us
1,there is a lot of violence to be had and that 's what i liked about this movie,there is a very good reason why the movie is n't going to be a sequel to the classic
1,so many people in it did n't know that it 's a bad movie,so i guess i have n't heard of this film since i had seen it
1,but then the movie started to drag and the director forgot,but then again that should have been a lot worse
1,in fact the acting by this is so poor that the movie becomes laughable,in the film there is a lot of things wrong with this movie
1,it 's all about the world 's population of the time,it has to be the absolute worst film ever made
1,deluise 's character was so annoying that i did n't care for the characters,deluise 's character is so funny he 's a hoot as a woman and he
1,when it was on the shelf i saw it at a sneak preview screening at the local cinema festival,when the movie is made of course in the first place the viewer will see how the movie was supposed
1,spoiler ahead it is a very good movie and should have been,spoiler spoilers i think the movie is a bit too long
1,the plot is very predictable and the ending is a bit abrupt,the film is a very moving one to the end of the movie
1,those who think that this will be a great,those are the two reasons the film fails
1,sure the film is not a good thing as it has plenty of atmosphere that,sure it 's an indie movie but it 's just a bunch of clichs
1,i would have loved this film and the film 's direction was excellent,i would have thought this was a decent movie but the acting the script
1,a film that should have been called a little longer than it is,a few people will see this in their movie theater and it was great
1,we get to see this show and then go to bed,we do not see this movie as soon a long time as
1,so i have to say that this film is the greatest i 've ever seen,so why does this film not only have a few good scenes but the actors do
1,there are a few scenes that make you cringe but the rest of the movie is really really bad,there are some good moments in this film but they have nothing to do with the film 's plot
1,this movie is a waste of time,this show has to be the most stupid
1,i think that is what the film is,i was very disappointed with the film
1,frank 's character is also the reason why this,frank morgan plays the lead role as well
1,sexy but not in an ordinary way,sexy and charming this movie is a perfect
1,there 's a reason why the movie is so bad,there were several things that were wrong with it
1,talk about how a movie should be so bad,talk with the other reviewer in this review
1,the first thing that happened to me was the lack of a decent script,the film is a bit dated but the movie is a good watch
1,it 's like watching an episode of a show,it would be interesting to find the courage of a
1,i have to agree with the comments above that this is one of the finest movies i 've ever seen,i am not a big fan of this film but i do n't think that the story would 've improved the
1,he 's the best man to have the perfect villain,he was in fact the best actor in the film and
1,i was surprised at how bad this movie,i have been watching it for ages
1,in fact the only person that is able to make up this mess is how he does the job to,in fact it 's a little slow and i did n't know how the movie is supposed to be
1,hopefully the filmmakers and director should be,hopefully this will make more sense
1,the acting is very bad and i,the film is an absolute failure
1,i think that the movie is n't that funny and it makes you think it,i would have to say that this movie is an absolute waste of time
1,but i think the movie is n't that bad,but i did n't really expect much from this one
1,but if the film was so great it is the first time i saw it,but the real problem with this is the fact that the film was n't the first
1,even if you are a diehard fan of these type of movies this is n't it,even more often the jokes are so stupid the acting is bad the script is horrible
1,and then there 's the acting and it is the,and i do n't think that is a coincidence
1,obviously i am not sure why the film has been,obviously the director is trying to emulate the original
1,the acting is good but there is a good performance by,the film is also a great vehicle for the film
1,the plot is very thin and the movie lacks any suspense or tension but it 's really a good movie,the film is a good movie for a rainy day and i would recommend it to any fan of any of
1,each episode is a classic and is,each scene is just a dream
1,especially the two lead roles which made this an enjoyable film to watch,especially when you think the show is being canceled in the first place
1,another thing that i can say is that the movie is a little weak,another example is that the main character is played by robert montgomery and his brother
1,unfortunately the movie never gets boring,unfortunately the only redeeming feature of this
1,but it is not so bad,but then i found it to be
1,i have seen a few episodes from the past like the simpsons and they are all excellent,i 've watched the film numerous times and still feel sorry for the actors in it
1,for the first half of the movie the audience is treated as a,for example in this episode the hero is trying to kill himself
1,this is the first time i have ever laughed,this film was made with an open mind
1,i was surprised to see the film was made in the seventies when its released on dvd and,i would have been more impressed if the movie was not a bit shorter in my view
1,both the film and the film is good,both of them were not only good for their
1,robin hood plays a tough guy who wants to,robin hood as the detective is also great
1,as the film progressed we were introduced to the characters,as a result of the film itself is a bit dated
1,the only real gripe was the director of this movie,the plot of the film is simple enough to be a
1,it 's not a good horror movie but it does not really matter that,it 's a very funny movie and it 's a joy to watch
1,and that 's what it is the director does,and the movie has a few good scenes
1,foxx as a young cop is not a typical hollywood cop and the two leading men are a bunch of losers who get,foxx 's performance is very good although she 's not nearly as good as the other two or three of the others
1,it 's a great idea that i have,it is a shame that such movies
1,he 's a bit stiff and not even in the slightest way but his acting,he is a man who is not afraid to make his own personal decisions
1,the story itself is very weak and the story is weak and the acting is worse,the story of the kelly gang' is a great one and the story is a little slow
1,it is a good movie and it 's one,it was a waste of time and money
1,he has been a staple of the original series and was able,he is a very funny guy but not a good one
1,i have to wonder about the real life of the,i do agree with the comment on the acting
1,some of it was good for me,some people will probably be disappointed by it
1,michael caine as a young cop is a real treat to me,michael moore is a very fine actor and a great actor
1,the film is set in a rural country where the town is located and the lives of,the story of the movie revolves around two people and their relationships together with each other
1,what the movie is about is a bit,what the hell are they doing here
1,i was surprised to see that the film was so low budget,i think that 's what makes this show a definite classic
1,this film had so many problems it was almost impossible to get into any character development,this movie has some good actors and actresses who play the roles of the movie
1,other than that i have to agree with most of those who did n't like it,other than that it 's very hard to believe that this is an action movie
1,while a little slow paced and a bit dated and the plot,while the movie is a little slow and not much else
1,i was n't expecting a big success to this movie but i thought i could,i saw it at the london international film festival and it blew me away
1,when the young woman is kidnapped and he is taken to a nearby house where the local population of the family members are left in a,when she is n't a woman i would n't call her a real hero but i would have thought to be a little more interesting
1,the story is n't bad but it 's not,the story was so bad you could n't tell it
1,vampires were not the only thing that kept my interest and,vampires vs dolls in this one are all very good
1,time of day is definitely one of the most entertaining and enjoyable movies in recent memory,time and again the same can be said for the first half of the film
1,though i think a fair amount of time went into this movie i,though i do n't know why the hell is so so stupid
1,additionally the movie takes place in a futuristic landscape that does n't make the slightest part,additionally the movie itself makes it very difficult to understand what the director was thinking
1,had i not been watching this i would have turned it off,had the director ever been able to tell me something was wrong with
1,blessed with a lot of action and the ending was so bad you could,blessed with the first movie is the one with some good looking guy
1,but it was the last movie to die,but the movie is about a young kid who
1,after the first twenty minutes i was a bit surprised that it would have been,after that the film ends up with a bang and then becomes the first
1,maybe it has a lot of potential but it does n't have the feel of a,maybe it was because the director of the book was not interested in this movie
1,why do n't you try to watch this movie for the first time,why does he make a sequel that has a very long running time
1,though i 've seen this movie several times i have to agree that the acting was pretty good especially the one in,though i did n't like this film as much as i thought it was one of the best of the two
1,good luck to see the end of the,good luck and a nice surprise ending
1,hilariously bad movie and a complete waste of the talents of david cronenberg and steven soderbergh,hilariously awful and not funny in this case and the film is pretty dull at times
1,this film is about three guys who are sent to prison by the government in the same,this movie was so bad it makes you wonder how someone could possibly have done it
1,if you 're looking for a scary scary movie with the same name that is,if you like the original series you 'll find it hard to relate to
1,it has been done before and in other films like it 's release and i think that,it 's the only thing that can be denied that this was a really bad movie
1,anyway i think i 'll watch this movie again,anyway this is a movie about a young woman who
1,it was a great movie but it was too slow,it 's a shame the movie was made in the first
1,the only thing that makes this watchable is the fact that it 's the only one,the movie is not a bad movie but a decent one as it 's a bit too
1,i have no problem with the film 's plot,i have to say that this was a really bad
1,think the movie has no plot line,think of this film a lot of time
1,even when he finally does n't get to see him die he is rescued by the police and is,even though the characters in the movie are very interesting they were all good actors in the movie
1,the film is about the life of,the story was n't too original
1,protective of the devil 's daughter and his son 's son who has no interest whatsoever,protective of the most extreme of the most heinous and disturbing aspects of a film i 've
1,i have seen the first three seasons of 24 episode and have seen this film and i can only say that i was very,i am not a big fan of the genre and the two of them do a great job of conveying the same plot
1,if that was a real thing you would have to,if you have n't seen this film do it
1,unfortunately the film does n't work at least for the first hour,unfortunately for the viewer who was in it the movie could have been
1,even the actors are n't the best actors,even in a movie where you feel like you
1,it would be nice to know that it was n't a big budget movie,it has some interesting characters some interesting moments a great story and great action
1,director john woo is a great director,director richard harris is one of the few
1,all of this is a bit too much for me,all the actors are all good especially freddie highmore who was
1,liam neeson as the hero is a real treat to watch,liam neeson is one of the best actors in hollywood
1,while the movie was not as good as it would have been but it,while it had a very good cast it was n't very well made
1,now i'm glad i watched a movie with a,now the film was a bit more entertaining
1,bob newhart is the only one who 's ever played a decent role,bob is not the most talented person he 's supposed to be a sympathetic
1,i saw this on a shelf with my parents when i was in college,i do n't know if i can watch it over and over again
1,eugene levy is a great actor,eugene levy is perfect as the hero
1,parted to the world of course in the late 1800 's,parted by the devil is a very funny film and is a
1,please do not watch this film if only for your own sake,please do n't bother with this one if you want to laugh
1,it is a very simple film,it 's also very difficult to get
1,he 's a very talented actress,he does it in some way
1,the story line is a bit confusing and the story is n't a lot of fun to watch,the film starts with a couple of young men and women who live in a small rural community where
1,however this movie is a very bad movie,however it was also an enjoyable little flick
1,it would take a lot to make a film,it was n't until they had been born
1,as a longtime fan of the first movie and even the great hulk hogan i found his first film to be a great and enjoyable movie to get,as for the story well the story does n't seem like it would be written without any sort of care and that is the main theme of the movie
1,he also plays a good guy and the movie has,he was in fact a bit of an idiot
1,i do n't think i 'll watch this movie again,i do n't think anyone will notice that this movie was
1,andy garcia is a great comedic actress but this is n't really a film,andy garcia 's portrayal of a woman is so ridiculous that it 's almost painful
1,i 've seen this movie twice but i have to say that it was,i have been waiting for a movie to show up and be entertained
1,he has done a lot of films in his career and i have no idea who he was or,he was so stupid and funny and so funny that i did n't even recognize him at all
1,i saw this film at my local cinema and i was so impressed with it,i have been looking for a copy since this movie and the first movie has been
1,the story is about a girl whose mother is killed by a mysterious woman named slausen whom i think it is a pretty girl who has a daughter 's body and tries to save her mother,the film was n't really about a group of people who are searching for an accident and that their parents are in love with each other but also the one they have been living together
1,this is not a film about a woman,this is a must see for everyone
1,bastard 's daughter is n't an attractive and one dimensional,bastard and girl is a great movie that should be required
1,you can see the ending of this,you 'll never see it again
1,they are the best of the two,they 're all in the dark and foreboding
1,as i said earlier the film is very well acted and is very well acted,as an american i am still trying to find something more appealing about this movie
1,we 're supposed to believe that the main characters in,we all know that this is not a movie
1,i have never seen a film so padded,i was hoping that the writer might get his
1,it 's a shame because the whole story is n't a bad movie and the acting is worse than the first part i was surprised by the acting,it 's a shame that it did n't have many scenes in the film but a little bit of humor and a bit of the usual humor of a
1,you do n't have to be a big fan of either,you could tell he 'd rather be in the car
1,it is a pity that the filmmakers and producers decided to make a feature length film,it is one of those films where you have to suspend my disbelief and it 's hard
1,i have to say this movie was a waste of time,i think that this is one of his better films
1,needless to say the film is a complete bore,needless to say the acting is pretty bad
1,the acting is good the plot is good but it 's,the story is a little bit of an action flick
1,anyway this film is not the best of all it has,anyway the movie was shot at a couple of times
1,anyway i have no problem with these movies,anyway the movie was shot in a very grainy
1,like a child 's play a little boy and his son,like all of his other films the movie was just so bad
1,if it had a bit less than a little stagy the movie would have been a lot better,if you have n't read the book you have to read a lot of what is a good movie
1,but it just does n't work,but it does n't matter that they
1,the movie has been made a lot better,the film is a little over the top like
1,why is there so many things wrong here that i did,why did i have to give this movie a 7
1,i think he was the one who was in the movie for the most part,i have seen this movie many times but the only reason i give it 2 out
1,i think it 's the best movie ever made,i have n't seen the original film in years
1,it 's a shame to be so mindnumbingly bad and so much of a waste of time on this garbage,it 's just the kind of movie that you have to sit through because you want to get a headache
1,then the whole plot goes to show us how a man could get a job,then you have an excellent performance from the actor who plays the role of a good
1,this is the first feature film i 've seen so far,this film has some redeeming qualities but it 's also a great
1,i think this movie was very funny and had a,i have n't been so disappointed by this movie
1,i was so bored to see the whole thing,i was a little shocked by the fact that the
1,i would like to thank anybody who watches this film or just enjoy the first film but then this one does not,i do n't want to spoil that because i'm not saying the plot is bad i think there are some good parts but
1,my wife and i were waiting to watch a movie,my favourite is in the middle of the night
1,i do n't know what to think about it but there,i would n't even call a movie a horror movie
1,solomon is a very good film,solomon is a good actor who is
1,the only thing i would like to say is that there was a bit,the only good part of the story is where it is set up
1,definitely the best of all time,definitely the worst movie i 've ever
1,i have seen many movies that were good,i do not understand why it was so good
1,i do n't see what the director was doing in this movie,i do n't think that the film is going to be so long
1,i 've been a fan of movies and tv movies and this,i was very impressed with the way the movie was shot
1,i think the movie was shot at a very low budget as it,i was surprised to find that it was a pretty decent film
1,towards the end when they are in the car they decide to leave and start,towards one moment i felt like i was watching the worst movie ever made
1,the film is n't a good movie either,the only good thing i can say about this
1,i saw the first one and the second,i was so disappointed with this movie
1,the movie is a bit too slow,the film is a little long but it
1,soon after a few weeks of his life he 's discovered the whereabouts of a man who is responsible,soon he becomes a hero and a womanizer who 's been in the hospital at a time when his wife
1,i was expecting a movie from the director,i do n't know where to begin but this
1,the film opens with a young lady named laura and her boyfriend and the two sisters who,the film does have a couple of funny moments and the movie is just so good
1,combine a couple of the most hilarious moments,combine with the original and not only is the
1,as a result it 's a movie that makes you laugh at the jokes,as an example of what the filmmakers think of this movie the acting and directing
1,later i had seen a lot of the movie and was not impressed with the ending and did n't see what the director did n't,later they are forced to go to the local sheriff 's house to retrieve his son 's fortune and kill her with a vengeance
1,mendy 's story and the plot is very simple and the story is so strong that you cannot even care about the characters,mendy and his cohorts are the same and the movie does have its moments of humour and it 's really not the worst film
1,some of the scenes are not so bad it 's bad,some people have complained about this movie but i was really disappointed
1,there are some great actors including robert de niro,there were also several scenes where the main characters in
1,some of the acting is ok,some of these are the worst things
1,i have seen it many times but i was very impressed,i was really excited that the film has been so long and
1,this was n't even one of his best films,this film is not the greatest movie ever
1,renfield and his wife are the best things in the movie,renfield is an excellent movie that has a wonderful cast
1,penelope wilton was excellent in a small role as,penelope cruz is very good as the mother
1,if you want to get the point that i do not want to give away the,if you have n't been warned about it do not waste your time with this
1,of course he was the only one that had a chance to make the whole point,of course it is true that they are all very good and the story is about a
1,fully the only other one i 've seen that 's a very different kind of movie,fully realized of the first movie is the same way the same story line has been told
1,i am amazed that such a waste of the talents,i do not recommend anyone to watch this movie
1,i was a little skeptical of this film but that was probably the case with,i think this movie should be seen by anyone who enjoys an intelligent movie
1,with a supposed budget of about 1000000 i can tell that i did,with the exception of this series it 's a very good movie
1,a few years ago it was released on dvd and i had to,a good film for those who want to have more to appreciate
1,i'm not even going to get into this film for the,i'm sure that the actors were n't in the movie
1,the plot is pretty thin and it 's hard to follow it in a movie,the film 's title refers to the same theme song from the film and it 's
1,ireland was a good choice for the,ireland is a very good film
1,the acting by everyone involved is pretty good,the script is n't bad but the acting is
1,but it 's not the only movie that i did n't want to watch,but then again the movie does not have the potential to be a movie it
1,this was one of the best movies,this was a pretty funny movie
1,heston is a master of all his films and the cast and crew are excellent,heston 's film is the perfect movie for the viewer who should be ashamed to see
1,the story is not a simple one,the acting is superb and the plot is
1,best of all is his performance as a cop,best in all this series is a good show with
1,i think this is one of the most enjoyable of its type that,i think this show should not have lasted longer years for me
1,as for the film it was a very poor idea to make a film out of the book,as far as the movie goes there is a great amount of suspense and a few scenes involving a
1,not even the great minnie mouse and the rest of,not even the original actors are a great actor
1,at least that 's what i thought it was an excellent movie,at the end of the movie i had a hard time believing that
1,this film is an insult to a lot of people who have read,this movie could n't have been a better choice to be made
1,the story of a girl who is in love with the girl is a,the plot was so thin and uninteresting the acting was n't even convincing
1,ok so i did n't see it coming and was a bit skeptical about it,ok this is an excellent movie but the director is not afraid to give it much
1,i do n't think that the actors were actually trying to portray the movie 's real story,i have not read anything in the works of john sayles but this is his most impressive film
1,a lot of the scenes seem to have been stolen,a very good performance from the cast and crew
1,during a time of crisis he decides that the woman is the man,during a visit to a new school where they get their hands down in
1,prison is a wonderful family movie,prison has a great deal of humor
1,in my opinion it 's worth seeing for those who like,in my opinion there 's a good amount of humor
1,it is also very funny to watch,it was an enjoyable little film but it
1,love of god but not a good movie,love to all but one of those
1,they are just not funny and they 're pretty much just plain annoying,they were n't even close to being the best movie i have ever seen
1,i am not a fan of this movie but there,i was a big fan of the first movie
1,who 's responsible for a crime movie,who knows that the director was trying to
1,they are so good in this movie,they do n't want to kill the girl
1,veidt 's acting is superb and he plays an excellent character who has always been,veidt and his team are also very good actors and the movie was great
1,it is a great piece of cinema,it 's a very funny show about a
1,i saw the movie yesterday and the acting and writing was terrible,i would n't have been surprised that the movie was n't made at
1,it has a few flaws but is,it was a little more interesting
1,having said that i was n't really expecting anything,having said that i am not a big fan of
1,this film is so bad it makes you want to throw your head out the window,this movie is not only a comedy but also a drama and an examination of a young
1,the acting is horrible the script is bad even the acting is terrible the story is awful the,the movie starts out with a group of guys and a couple of friends in the desert
1,written by a very talented director,written for the screen it should be
1,there were some scenes where he was supposed to be in a movie and i was n't sure where to start,there are several other movies in this genre that i 've seen in quite some time and are not even as good
1,the movie is a little boring but i do have to disagree that the movie,the story is not a typical hollywood formula but it has a strong story
1,christian slater plays the role of a very cocky man who has a secret to settle down and down,christian slater does a decent job as the villain but he 's very funny as the head commander
1,that said the film is not a great movie,that was not what i was expecting when i watched
1,i would not have been in the film for a film like this,i have seen this film countless times since it first aired in the early
1,i am not the target demographic for this movie,i think he 's not as bad as his character
1,i would like to thank u that it is n't that good,i do n't know what to say about this film because i did
1,imagine the movie that it 's based on a book,imagine that if it were n't for that you might not
1,i do n't want to spoil anything about the plot,i 've never seen this film heartily comprehend why
1,a young woman with her own family meets in his house who is the daughter of his son and sister of the son,a great film in which i have to admit that it is a movie that will appeal to everyone with an interest in a
1,the film 's main flaw is that,the first is a bit weird
1,just do n't watch it you 'll get the chance,just when it was n't all that bad it seemed like
1,i have a feeling that the film has,i was so disappointed with the ending
1,so the film is set in the same year of,so i guess it 's the same old stuff
1,russ tamblyn and matt damon are a fine pair as the young lovers,russ tamblyn plays a young man in the same league as a woman in
1,this film had a lot of problems and the story had no,this is just another movie that is just awful and boring
1,it is a movie with a lot,it was a very entertaining experience
1,and then i saw this movie on the shelf and i think,and i did n't even know that it was a comedy
1,we are shown in a flashback that makes the audience laugh and the scene of the man being chased,we all know the same old same old guy that we all know is not a big deal
1,molasses with a very low budget and the result is a very good,molasses in the end i could n't stop laughing at this film
1,what was the point of making such a bad movie,what makes this movie great is the way that the characters
1,but the fact is that it is not as good as the book and not so bad it,but it is a movie that should have been shown in the us for a few weeks
1,i have n't seen the trailer for this before but it 's a lot better than the original,i 've always been one of the few people that thinks of this film as an example of how
1,i was a little puzzled when the film started,i am a bit prejudiced that this film could not
1,the story is about two young boys who go through a trip to,the acting was so bad that it 's almost painful to watch
1,the movie is not a comedy or comedy,the movie is about the same guy who 's
1,other than that i have to be honest i do,other than that it 's a really good film
1,the movie was a total disappointment,the story of this one of those
1,as a film maker of the original i did n't like it,as i mentioned above this was one of the worst of the genre
1,she is n't even remotely attractive,she 's not a bad actress but
1,not a great film but it is still very enjoyable,not a single bullet or a gun or even a gun
1,it is one of those films that i can think of that has,it was n't funny but the movie had a very good plot
1,after a while i could have done it,after a series of unfortunate events involving some kind
1,of course the movie has its own moments,of course there are a few good points but
1,to my surprise it 's a great movie for the entire,to the devil 's eye the movie is very good
1,i 've been waiting for a lot of movies to be a great action film but this is one where i can only compare,i 've seen the film kazaam and have to say i was really moved by the story of the film in the end
1,the only thing that made this movie watchable was the fact that there was n't a,the movie was just plain stupid but the movie had a great deal of potential
1,i 've seen a lot of the movies that i 've seen in this genre that they made,i am a huge fan of the original but i have not seen the first two movies
1,why is it a movie like that,why do i think that the best of
1,a very enjoyable movie and a good one,a very interesting and very moving experience
1,when a man is trapped in an underground facility where he has a secret admirer of the,when she arrives and she starts crying at the phone it 's a bit too much
1,by the end of the movie the audience is left wondering if the director could n't have done a better,by the way the movie is not a comedy or an action movie with a few twists to it
1,and the fact that this is a great movie,and i 've never heard of it before
1,here we have a film that has a similar plot that,here 's a movie that will have you laughing hysterically
1,there 's no plot no characters no,there are a few good points
1,i was n't surprised at how bad this film is,i have seen some really bad movies in my time and
1,by all means this is an excellent show,by the way the film has a great cast
1,the movie also features a couple of memorable,the movie is very much like this
1,this is the kind of film that,this is a pretty good film
1,this movie is not about the war and the political system,this show should never be seen as it was just a series
1,and the ending is the best part,and what is that the point
1,josh 's son is a real estate worker who is not afraid to leave the city in an alley,josh 's dad 's name for the first time was the most annoying thing about the whole movie
1,after that the story begins and the film becomes increasingly predictable and becomes predictable at the same time,after a few episodes of the show i was excited to see that this was the second best episode
1,this is not a great movie but it is definitely worth your,this film does n't have the feel of an oscar winner
1,purely the fact that the film is not a comedy is a testament to the film 's,purely the film is n't that bad it 's just a bad attempt at a spoof
1,while the movie is not the best of all the games it is definitely one to see,while the first film has a little bit of drama it still manages to keep my interest
1,it 's not a bad film,it was so funny i had to
1,repeatedly the film is a bit of a mess but as a whole,repeatedly a lot of the scenes have been left and right now
1,when the first one of the characters in this show was the one they showed the characters in their own right the movie was so boring that i,when they arrive at the airport station the two decide to get the hang of the car and the car chase is a vehicle for a movie
1,to me it is just a bunch of clichs,to sum up this movie is an interesting movie
1,you 're in the middle of a row and you 're watching the whole,you have to be very careful to understand the difference between the characters
1,jason biggs was great in this but the script was so awful,jason statham plays a young man who is sent off to a crime
1,gidget is a great actress and she has a great supporting cast and is very likable in this movie,gidget 's character is a real witch who is a very human woman who is a very very human being
1,that was the only way i could,that 's what makes him great
1,for me one thing that really made me think of the,for the most part this is a good family movie
1,larry has been a very good character,larry is a real man who has to
1,buddy is the best of all of the two films,buddy is not one of his best movies but his performance
1,in fact it 's a pretty good film,in the beginning of the movie she gets to
1,with all of the above i would not be able to see how the film would be made to make it a success,with the same name as one of the best films of all time it is the story of how a young man is a
1,i was expecting to see some of these films but i found this to be pretty dull,i saw the movie for free in the theater but i had to admit it was a very
1,i have no idea where the movie was going,i saw this on a cable channel and was very
1,especially when he is confronted by the fact he is the only survivor on board and his wife is,especially in my eyes of the same year as the first two movies i saw in the theater
1,i think that the best scene shows when one,i was n't expecting anything from this film
1,we are also in the military,we are left feeling that the characters
1,it is a very funny and funny film,it is not a comedy or a comedy
1,as far as the technical aspects go on the film is still a great piece of work,as an adult i was so annoyed with that movie as to be about how people should have
1,then it becomes a joke about a man who is n't a master of the world,then there were some funny scenes but the movie just got better and more entertaining
1,a movie that is not only for the money it 's not for everyone but also the people involved in this movie,a good movie that is n't just as good as it sounds like it 's a good movie but it has some good
1,sure this is a bad movie but i did n't like how a movie can be,sure it 's an excellent performance but it 's just that bad and not funny
1,i do n't think that this movie would be too much to bear in my opinion and it is not a bad,i have seen a lot of other films and they were just as good as the other ones on this site
1,in fact it does n't have a plot to the movie,in a scene that is as a result of the movie 's
1,it 's a shame the movie has such a good script,it is a movie that should never have been made
1,script acting direction acting everything else are horrible except the movie itself is n't a good movie,script is very weak and the plot is a little weak but the characters are very likable
1,if you want to watch something that will be the best way to film you 've come to expect to see a good thriller,if you 've never read the book you 'll know that it is very much a movie for people who are not familiar with history
1,some people have claimed that the movie is a bit slow but the characters are n't the most important things,some may say that it was an excellent performance in all of them but this one is n't that bad
1,what a great idea to show a woman with a heart of mind,what i liked was that they were making some really stupid movies
1,actually it seems that the movie is a spoof of the first movie and it was very much,actually it has a few good moments and i found myself cheering for them in the end
1,cary grant is also excellent as the tough guy,cary grant and james stewart are excellent together
1,the movie 's main asset is its,the movie is a total bore
1,in fact he was a good actor and it was not,in the first scene he shows up in his apartment
1,it has been released on dvd and is,it 's not a bad thing either
1,pola x 's is a masterpiece of a movie,pola x has been a classic for years and years
1,however the story line and the plot is just as predictable as the original,however i was not disappointed by this film because the characters had no personality at
1,but then we have that we see the movie and the two of them end up being chased by an evil maniac and then a bear,but the best thing about the film is the fact that it is a bit of a mess but a little less than a bit slow moving
1,this is a pretty bad movie with the obligatory gore fx the gore is very poor and the acting is atrocious,this is a movie that should be avoided by everyone who likes to see movies that are so bad they can make
1,the movie has a lot of action and the acting is ok,the film 's plot is very simple but the characters are all too
1,directing is a very simple aspect,directing and editing are the most beautiful
1,he plays a man who has the,he was n't a bad guy
1,lead up for the first time in the life of a new girl in this,lead up to the cast of the film are a group of young boys
1,probably the most interesting thing in the movie is that you ca n't help but wonder,probably if you 're a fan of this genre you probably wo n't like it
1,if you are interested in seeing a film about an obsessive killer who has a bad sense of humor then this film is for,if you have n't seen the movie you can find the soundtrack in which you are watching something that will change you forever
1,if you like the genre you 'll like it,if it were n't for those that have been involved
1,although this was a great show it has some flaws,although the story is not that bad it was not that
1,but the movie just does n't make any sense,but the story was just too weak and too short
1,the film is about as exciting as the movie itself,the plot is very simple and the characters are believable but
1,columbo has the most charisma in the movie but he 's still a bit more believable than the rest which makes it a great film and,columbo is a man who is a loner and has the ability to fight against people who are so much more than he bargained for
1,i saw this on television at the sundance film festival and it was n't bad,i have a feeling it would be a good one but it 's not a movie
1,like in the movie there is some very funny scenes between the,like the first movie i was expecting something better than this
1,one of my favorite actors in the movie is the one,one thing that i did not like was the acting
1,at the end of the day the movie 's end,at first i think i was watching the movie
1,something i have to do is the movie,something like it 's the most important aspect of
1,you have to watch this film to get some laughs from your local friends,you know that the first film that has been made is an adaptation of the
1,for some reason i think he would be able,for a while it was n't that bad
1,he 's also very very funny but he did n't have a lot of fun and his lines are hilarious,he was the most popular man in hollywood and the only person who knew the truth about the movie
1,the only redeeming quality of this movie is the fact that the actors do n't,the only way you could watch this movie was the ending of the movie
1,the movie was so bad i almost stopped watching this movie for no reason and i do n't think it is a,the story is so full of holes that i was wondering if the writer could have done a much better job
1,anyway i am not one to disagree,anyway it 's a great show
1,unfortunately the movie was shot on a low budget,unfortunately this is not a bad idea but it 's
1,after a few days of the war the british troops were killed,after the first hour the film is still a great thriller
1,note the fact that there is no story in the first place it is,note how they 're able to get the whole thing back in time
1,it is a shame because they were all good movies and it was n't even good,it does n't even have to be a movie for all the fans and the fact that
1,the first half is a classic,the acting and script are pretty bad
1,you can watch it and laugh out loud,you 'll have to sit right through this one
1,do yourself a favor and watch this movie,do n't worry about the fact that i love
1,the first part of the movie is not a very bad one,the film also features a very good performance by david carradine as the
1,hackford 's film is not the greatest film in the world,hackford 's the man who played jesus is a little stiff and
1,especially if you want to know what a great movie should be it will be a long time to come,especially when he is in a wheelchair he 's just trying to make a big deal out of himself
1,really i think that this was just an awful movie that had been released straight out,really i was n't a fan of either of the main characters or the actors
1,it was n't until i started watching it i was n't able to understand what was going on and was n't that bad,it 's not a good film as it is n't a film about people who are gay or have problems with their lives
1,well worth it for fans of the genre,well worth a look to any parent 's film
1,they are all so great you could n't tell them what the hell they 're doing,they should have been proud of this movie because they had to make it into an actual
1,we 're in the same predicament as we were supposed to believe,we see her in her own way in the first scene and then
1,the movie is a bit like that but the script is n't really very original,the movie was n't as bad as i remembered it was the worst i 've seen
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and money,the story of a man who 's been kidnapped by a
1,while this one was n't bad i still enjoyed a few of the actors from the earlier movie the other actors,while there are some interesting moments and the ending leaves you wondering why the hell is there so much about a character
1,i do n't know why this film is not available on dvd,i saw him in the movie and the guy was just plain bad
1,corbin bernsen was excellent in his role as the evil butler and his character was the best thing about him,corbin bernsen is one of the best actors of the last decade with his role as a cop who is in
1,in fact it 's a shame that the director did n't have the guts to pull off this schlock and not,in fact it has a good cast with the exception of john cassavetes and his performance as the main character
1,he is n't as good and his performance here was quite good,he is not in the book but in fact he is n't in
1,ok this movie is a little slow and,ok so it was n't the fault
1,bad guys in the movie are not good,bad acting bad script bad directing bad script bad
1,why was it necessary to show that it was a real,why did n't they just make a movie like this
1,seeing it again is a very good film to,seeing this film is not even worth renting
1,but the film is so good that it 's not even fun,but i do not have any problems with that in this movie
1,along the way the young couple are invited to the hospital to stop the mysterious spirits,along with the other comments i 've seen it 's a great movie and i will always
1,but this is a very entertaining movie,but this is a very poor film
1,but i ca n't wait to see,but that 's the whole point
1,malone has a knack for getting to the bottom of a heap of the film 's own,malone was also very good in the role although he has been given a few good lines
1,the first part has a little more of the same,the first movie was a masterpiece of the book
1,they have all the talent of a good cast,they have been in a million other films for many
1,i have to admit it is a great movie,i was really surprised at the depth of the movie
1,also the film is a complete waste of time,also starring joe don baker as the main protagonist
1,if you want to be entertained by the movie 's message and its message about how they 're supposed to be the one that is the best part of the whole movie then,if you are a true fan of the series watch the original instead of the first one if you want to see some action and some good acting from all the stars
1,the story is very interesting and the acting is great,the film is a good one to watch but it just
1,there are some scenes which i liked were the ones i had the opportunity to watch,there are some very interesting scenes in this film but they are not very convincing
1,he plays the role very well,he is not the only one in
1,for some reason i found the movie so good to see i felt that it was not,for a movie of this type this would probably not be the case with this movie
1,misty mundae has a lot of charisma to play and it 's the best part of,misty mundae looks like she 's in a lot of movies that she looks like
1,andor as a result of all the problems i had with the first one,andor the film 's message is not as relevant as its subject matter
1,and i have n't seen it yet,and the fact that she is the only
1,rip torn a few times and you 're left with the,rip off the dvd and the dvd extras on dvd
1,unlikely to see the film is not a masterpiece of art and it does n't matter if it was a comedy,unlikely to see it 's in the theater for the first time but it was n't even close to anything else
1,most of the characters are so unlikeable that you can almost believe that there 's an actual reason,most people are n't interested in seeing this film and i think it has a cult following
1,i do n't think this movie should have ended in the end of my opinion but it,i think this movie should have received a nomination for best picture of the academy award
1,clark gable and his partner have a small screen time as,clark bartram was in a small town of the dead
1,thank god i did n't pay a dime,thank goodness i do n't know why
1,the script has a very strong plot but it,the acting is so bad it 's untrue
1,some people have criticized this for the fact,some of them are not that good
1,neither is the plot to go to,neither of them was any better
1,thanks to the fact that this movie was a remake of the movie i have to agree with me on,thanks to the cast and crew of this show they are given a chance to be a great star
1,i'm a teenager and it 's a good time,i'm not going to spoil the movie for you but
1,i do n't think that the director should have made the film more enjoyable,i 've been waiting for something to watch and i have seen the movie twice
1,instead we have a film that does not even have one,instead they 're just trying to find a new meaning in the
1,aimee is the most annoying woman of the lot but she was n't,aimee is a good actress but her acting is just plain terrible
1,they were not even the best actors,they have been living in a house that
1,question what the hell 's happened to the people,question that it is n't a good film
1,in a nutshell this is a terrible movie but that 's it,in this episode a man who has been kidnapped by the other members
1,but the real life of the film is that the,but i think it should n't be too late
1,i was very disappointed to read that this,i think this is an excellent movie
1,the acting is good and the direction is excellent,the first time we saw the movie we had an
1,joan crawford as the wife is also the best i 've ever seen on a film,joan severance is a wonderful actress but the actress who played the bad guy was pretty awful
1,his mother has died a long time ago,his character is a likable character who can be
1,despite the shortcomings of the plot there is nothing new,despite that this film was n't made for tv
1,kudos to the cast for their roles and their acting ability,kudos to the director for making it to the screen in the
1,you do n't see the movie coming from the first movie,you can see it coming from someone who has seen the other
1,pity the first movie is better with a few scenes in which the hero is in the middle,pity i never got to see this movie again and it certainly has some of my favorite moments
1,it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen,it is a story told with the help of the man and his son
1,it 's a shame that the movie has a good deal of,it 's a movie that is worth watching for the characters
1,the movie is not so bad at the end,the film has a nice atmosphere to it but it
1,the only reason why i watched this is the scene in,the film opens with a woman running through a swamp
1,the acting is so bad that it makes the entire experience so hard,the only thing this film has going for it is the soundtrack
1,based on the true story i thought this was going to be a movie about the evils of war and the struggle to get the president to the case,based on the book the author is the producer of a film about the same name as the one who 's the killer in the first movie with the exception
1,but it is not that good,but if that is the case then
1,i have seen the first three and i,i do not know what it was
1,the first one was a very good movie,the script for instance does n't make sense at
1,this one has to be a complete waste of time,this movie was very good and had great potential
1,his character is also a stereotype in this movie,his acting skills are not as good but the film
1,the movie has its faults the first half is a very good one and the one in particular that is the best one,the script by john m murray is one that should have been left to the viewer to decide whether it was a drama or
1,danny kaye is a fine actor and is the only actor who has ever been better,danny trejo and his partner 's wife are in the same room as the one
1,my friend and i watched it over the weekend and thought that i would like it,my only problem is the movie 's ending is a bit slow and it drags along
1,i think the director is trying to emulate the film but it is very very,i have seen this film many times and it is definitely my favorite movie
1,the movie has the same feel that i did in the first place,the only reason i gave it a rating of 1 is because of the
1,but the rest of the film is a mess with all,but the plot of this film is a bit confusing
1,if you like the book and liked it you will enjoy this one,if this were to rate a movie i would rate them higher
1,if you are interested in the subject matter of the story you might be disappointed,if you 're looking for something like the crow you wo n't be disappointed
1,when it is revealed the movie is n't as good a film as,when she 's a woman she is attracted to the other two
1,the plot was so predictable and boring and the acting was awful,the acting is terrible the story is awful and the special effects were
1,i 've seen the movie multiple times now and i still find myself wondering if that 's a bad thing because i think that 's a,i saw this film on the sundance channel and was surprised at the positive reviews on imdb on how it would be considered a classic
1,but then you get the idea,but i think this movie could have
1,at least he does n't get it,at least that would be something
1,they should have done it better,they are the only real people in
1,electrician has a great deal of fun with the kids,electrician was one of the most annoying actors i have yet
1,one day a friend has a dream on her head in a very small town in the woods,one of the most beautiful movies of all time and it has a strong story about life and how
1,i think it 's not that good,i have n't seen any of the other
1,his acting was pretty bad especially considering the fact that he was a very bad man,his character is a stereotype of an old man who 's trying to get out of his
1,bridget wyman was the only one who could,bridget fonda 's performance is very good
1,as for me i'm not a fan of this movie or any other film i have,as i recall the film was a big hit and a little dated at that
1,but this is the story of a man who has a wife and is now pregnant and has been married to him,but the fact that it does not seem to get any more serious and less complicated is a bit of a shock to
1,the acting is n't great either,the first one was a little better
1,the plot line was very interesting but the execution was n't very good,the script was good for the first two episodes but it 's not that
1,the plot has been so thin and the movie is so poorly executed that it 's not funny it 's just not funny,the story is pretty much about the man who plays the hero in this film but the movie does n't have enough of the
1,the first time i saw this movie when in the morning i was a little puzzled,the story line is a good one but that 's what makes this film so enjoyable
1,are we not a fan of his films,are they trying to get rid of the real
1,alas the film has a good story and good characters,alas the story of the movie is just so ridiculous
1,though not a good film at all to begin with,though not as good as the first film the only good
1,she 's an amazing actress who should stick to the role in this movie and,she also had an excellent performance in her performance in a very good movie
1,with the exception of the first one the only thing that bothered me was the fact that he is a very,with an added bonus of a movie and a half of the story this is the one with the best
1,it was like watching a documentary of the beatles and the people in,it is a shame the actors were not associated with the movie
1,by the end of this movie the audience feels like you 're just getting shot with some random,by this time the film has a big budget and some of the actors are so bad
1,it 's not even that bad,it was not funny to me because
1,the first part of the movie is,the first movie was so bad
1,another thing i noticed about this movie was that it did n't,another problem with the film is the way they were portrayed
1,you do n't have to be a fan of the genre of the genre to find,you 're not supposed to think that you 're watching a movie of that sort
1,combine with some of the worst movie ever made,combine in to make it a bit more interesting and
1,the acting was n't bad either,the only real surprise was that the
1,in this film i was not prepared for the movie to end,in this movie the director has made the movie and its characters
1,all the people who gave us this film have a great time making fun of their,all of this is done in a realistic fashion by some very very attractive people
1,since the film 's director 's cut is a bit short it is still a nice little thriller with some,since i have seen the original film in the past thirty years it is still one of my favourites
1,bogeyman is a very interesting story about an older man who is searching for a young woman who has to deal with,bogeyman does n't even have a superpowers and is a victim of the dead and the other is a giant squid
1,that 's all i could have done,that is why i love that it is
1,but i do n't care for the character,but the movie has a certain charm that makes
1,one can say it 's not that good,one of my favorite scenes was when a couple
1,i was a bit skeptical when i saw the movie in the,i think the director has been making a movie about him
1,but the film has a nice twist and does n't leave any impact,but the real world is that the director has made a film that can
1,i was very disappointed with the ending,i think this is one of the most
1,that 's the only way to describe it as i would,that said the movie is a very interesting portrayal of the life
1,marty is the first to die and the only person who has a problem with,marty was a great character actor and he was very believable in the movie
1,unlike the first two seasons of the same name the film has an interesting and original story,unlike a lot of other films the plot was pretty lame and there were some very weak elements
1,the film is a very funny one and i really enjoyed the movie,the film was made up of several scenes of the film and the final
1,in this film we have a bunch of young actors who do n't act in their roles but have no talent,in a film that has been made of a group of students and a couple of friends in their house they find
1,poets day was a great film to watch,poets is the best thing about the movie
1,however as for that i think that the film is just another one of,however the movie is a bit over the top for its own good
1,tidbits such as the ending are so stupid i could barely make it any way,tidbits were used but i did n't expect much from this film but the acting was
1,utterly pointless and boring but i 've seen it all before,utterly pointless and a lot of the movie is n't even a
1,although the acting in this movie is not bad at times it is a good movie to watch,although the characters were a little twodimensional i was hoping that some of the actors involved could be better
1,i think it 's the worst movie in the world because i do n't think that,i was a bit reluctant by the time when i saw a preview of it
1,in my mind it 's a very well made movie,in this regard the movie has a lot of problems in
1,i do n't know why they 're so good,i would say that i am not alone with all
1,in the film it does have an underlying theme to this film but it seems to me to be an elaborate attempt to make a point to life,in fact i thought it was the worst film i have seen in a while so i ca n't wait to get into the whole mess of this film
1,that said this movie has the same effect that i have seen so many times in my life,that 's not to say this movie is so bad it 's good i just wish it could get
1,are we supposed to sympathize with a bunch of people with their heads,are we supposed to believe that they do n't want to be there or
1,i'm not going to spoil the movie but it is n't that great,i'm surprised that this was released in the uk for a few weeks on
1,this is a movie that will not disappoint,this movie has a very low budget and is
1,the acting was so bad it was painful to watch,the film is a complete waste of a perfectly good cast
1,the acting is horrible and the story is so,the film is a great piece of work
1,what i liked was the fact that the story,what is with the other reviewers here here
1,deborah kerr 's performance is a bit too old for her role as,deborah kerr plays a woman who is a young woman in love
1,and if you can get past the fact that you,and i think the whole thing was so funny
1,hitchcock was able to make this film to be a very bad horror flick,hitchcock 's direction has been done in some ways by some of the other characters
1,full metal jacket in the first film with,full moon jacket is a great movie
1,one of the best movies of the year i have seen it,one thing i liked most about the film was the fact that it
1,if you 're a fan of the series or if you want to see a real good horror flick check out the other two,if this is what happens when you see a good film that you can watch it with a few beers in your heart
1,quite a bit of a film that is not a complete waste of time,quite frankly i do n't know why but i 've heard some comments about the
1,that would have been much better,that 's what i think is the
1,cn is a movie that is so bad it 's funny,cn is the best movie i have seen for years
1,hopefully you 'll get more than enough to keep your interest,hopefully we will see that it 's not a comedy
1,gawd the film 's story is very good the plot and the,gawd i would n't have to go to the video store
1,i am not even sure whether the director or the director intended to,i saw the movie on the cover and i was very impressed
1,the film was n't even good,the story line is so bad it
1,at least in the case of that the film is about a man named sam who is trying to make an,at the end of the day the audience is left with no reason to be scared and the movie ends
1,apart from his character 's flaws it is not a comedy at all and is n't a bad idea at all,apart from the aforementioned of this film i think it 's just a great piece of work and a great piece of
1,i do n't know how i felt about a movie about this film,i think this is a film that i would watch again and again
1,i think it is the only reason the movie gets a wider release,i was n't really expecting anything much more but i was impressed
1,prior to the original the story is a bit confusing,prior to this movie the movie is about a young man
1,you can tell the actors in this film did n't really care about their characters,you can see how the people in the audience can identify with their problems
1,bullitt is also a movie that is worth a look for,bullitt is a movie that will appeal to all ages
1,you can watch the whole thing,you 'll get a sense of what
1,this film is not for everyone but it is a must for all fans of the genre,this is what i would like to say is one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,in one of the most ridiculous scenes we see a character driven to the point,in this movie it is a film that is set up as a drama
1,apparently the film 's producers are trying to make a,apparently there are no other characters in this movie
1,i think i 'll just watch a movie and i would like to thank you that they were all going to make this movie,i do n't know where i can find it on the dvd but it 's also a nice change from the fact that it is
1,imagine the real mccoy and his wife,imagine the movie for its rerelease
1,one can see why it has a very long run and has it all a great cast,one of the few problems i did n't like was the fact that there were so many other
1,or maybe it should have won a razzie award,or maybe a few people will enjoy it
1,it was an excellent movie with excellent acting by the cast and the story lines,it 's all the more shocking to the audience and the film is very entertaining and
1,there 's a scene where the camera is filmed,there are a few laughs in it all
1,scenes in this film are just plain awful,scenes of this film are a real eyeopener
1,if you want to watch a movie with a little bit of action and,if you are a fan of this genre you will not be disappointed
1,steve zahn is just the perfect actor to carry this movie,steve carell is the one who does n't do a lot of
1,once you get to the end you are left with a feeling of,once you get to the end this is a very good movie
1,among other things he 's been the first movie in the series to be an improvement on me,among all of these are the performances from the cast of the movie 's actors and actresses
1,but it was n't so much,but i guess it does n't matter
1,gosh i was n't expecting much more than,gosh this is n't a bad film
1,scientists were sent to the island to save their life,scientists are not always a group of the men who go
1,as the first film and over the top of a plot synopsis i,as for the acting i would n't have expected a better movie
1,the acting was pretty bad the plot was awful and the plot,the acting is pretty bad the characters are all cardboard cutouts
1,i saw this movie at the toronto international film festival,i am not a fan of the original but there is
1,this was a waste of time,this was probably one of the few
1,back in the late 1960s when it was n't all that,back to the film it 's a pretty good movie
1,when you 're not supposed to be a serious person and you 're,when i saw this movie it was just an old fashioned movie
1,this movie is one to watch,this film was made by an outsider
1,spielberg and his cinematographer john cassavetes are not afraid,spielberg does n't seem to care about anything
1,so the film is a little slow and boring but i think it 's not just the,so much so on all accounts there are a few things that do not really work
1,just like you 've said the first time i saw this i had a great time watching it,just to name one of the worst movies i 've ever had the misfortune of seeing and it is
1,here the movie is very boring at its heart,here it 's the film 's only redeeming quality
1,i saw this film and it was one of my favorites,i 've heard some positive reviews here about this film
1,sometimes this movie fails miserably in its presentation of its story line which makes no sense whatsoever to the plot,sometimes you can find a new movie on a dvd and have the original cd version of this movie
1,although the film is not as funny i still do n't get this one,although it was n't a big budget movie it was still a little too good
1,rogers and the director had a lot of fun making a movie with the right ingredients,rogers does n't seem much in this movie and he is very funny as a man who
1,shout is a great example of how bad a film should be and it is one of the,shout is an understatement for anyone that likes a movie and is in love with the other
1,in short the film is an insult that anyone can enjoy,in this film the director does n't make an appearance
1,this film is about love and friendship with a young married woman named,this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
1,i do n't think the movie is supposed to be a spoof of any of the other,i 've seen this movie several times now and it still has me wondering if its just a
1,aspects of the film were made in the first place and the plot was so predictable that you could hardly see it,aspects of the movie do n't seem to have any relevance at all but are all the actors in this film
1,the only thing that i would say is that they do n't even,the story line was very well done and the acting was good
1,kurtwood kline was one of those who,kurtwood spacey is a good actor
1,if there was anything to show in it that i 'd have to say it is my favorite movie,if you want to see a good movie about the holocaust you can tell that a good movie is not
1,only a few of us have n't yet seen this movie,only a few minutes later we learn that she is a good
1,indeed it is n't even that bad,indeed the story is about the same thing
1,i was hoping this could be a decent film with,i think it is a great movie to watch
1,a very good movie to see,a great movie and a good film
1,that 's what i think it was a great movie,that is the only flaw that this movie has to offer
1,overall the film has the feel of,overall the film was n't bad
1,but the rest of the movie is not as good as i,but it 's not that much to say in the end
1,these people are not very good actors,these two are just plain awful
1,he plays the part of a very young man with a conscience and is also an actor who has never been a,he does not want a big man to kill him but he 's still a little crazier than he usually is
1,the plot is simple to begin with,the story is pretty simple for an indian
1,he 's the only one who has been a hero but he,he 's a real man and is also a real person
1,to be honest i had to watch this,to sum it up the acting sucks
1,the story line is about a young man who is diagnosed with his mother 's death,the only redeeming factor is the fact that it is a comedy that the whole family should
1,she is the only person who has a chance to be a good person,she is not only a very good film but she is a very good actress
1,a lot of the dialogue in this movie has been changed and it 's not funny at all,a few weeks later she 's the only one with her in a scene and she gets into the
1,i'm sorry but i do n't think that the film,i'm not even going to comment on the plot
1,you 'll probably have to see the dvd version of the movie,you can get a lot of fun out of it but i think
1,believe me you do n't have to be a fan of hers and have seen a lot of movies,believe me when i say that i was n't expecting it to be so bad it was funny
1,having said that this movie is a great piece of entertainment,having said all that he is a great actor he has a
1,all in all this is a good family film with a nice score and a great story,all in all it 's a nice film with great performances from all involved but that 's all
1,the story is simple yet the characters are all so likable and interesting and you can feel the emotions that are in them,the film has a couple of problems with the plot but the acting is so bad that you ca n't even be watching it
1,5 a couple of people with a brain full of water and have a drink on,5 out of 10 i would love to see the movie on the big screen
1,obviously there is a certain amount of gore but the movie fails to generate any kind of atmosphere or,obviously there was no real plot in all of them and the story is n't a total bore
1,if you have n't seen any of the others in the past go and see the movie,if you do n't have a clue about the movie it 's a pretty funny movie
1,during the course of the film it is clear that the film is not a good film,during a visit to his new wife he is forced to help him out of the clutches to
1,i think it 's the best film i 've ever seen in my,i have been waiting for this movie to be seen on dvd
1,it was a very enjoyable movie,it 's a very simple and touching
1,that 's a big shame since it 's a remake and i do n't think that it is that much of a cult classic,that is the only reason why this movie has such a great cast and a good director that you will probably find this film interesting
1,its like the director was trying to make a good movie,its a very interesting story and the acting is pretty solid
1,the film was n't a bad movie it was so bad that it was n't funny,the plot and acting are pretty good but i have to say i liked it
1,that is a shame because the whole thing was,that is a great combination of the two
1,the story has a lot of twists to it but the story is so,the first time i saw this film i was laughing my asses off
1,thank goodness for the fact i have a fondness for the story of the story,thank god i saw this movie on cable tv and was very impressed by the ending
1,i have to disagree with others about that the acting is pretty bad,i do not know who to blame but if this was a film that
1,harlan 's character is just as believable,harlan has been a great actor since but
1,very funny in this movie as the plot of this film is not as good as the one but it does differ from,very few are the same old jokes that are so much more than the ones that have made the show a classic
1,released in the philippines in the late 1980 's this is an excellent film,released in the us in 1980 in the late 1990 's i was very impressed
1,it 's not a bad film at all but it just does n't work for,it seems to be a very poor attempt at a slasher to be serious
1,that being said i would say this movie is,that 's why this movie is so funny
1,filled with the usual clichs and situations the film is a very interesting experience,filled with the usual clichs of the original the movie is not funny and the
1,the movie 's premise is n't that great but that is not the point,the movie is about a guy named melvin who is the son of the man
1,tom and jerry have been together to make a movie,tom and beth are both the main characters and the movie
1,the story is about a bunch of people who have been living in a home town and have their friends who want to live together,the film is set in a country of alabama where a small group of young people are killed in a crash to a mysterious deserted mayan
1,the film is n't as bad as the first one,the acting is so bad that i found myself cringing when
1,following it all is just another film,following the story the film starts to become
1,the first is a bit slow,the movie has a very nice score
1,awfully disappointing but the movie is a very good film with lots of good,awfully bad movie about a guy who 's a teenager in a suit
1,except for the fact that they are not as good as their own they have a little bit of screen time,except that the movie is a bit predictable with its message and it is a bit of a stretch to watch it
1,but the story is very interesting and is very well done,but that does n't stop the movie from being a disaster
1,it is n't that the movie is bad,it also features a few of the most notable
1,taken by this director and it 's about two young kids who are in the same town as one other one,taken from a movie i saw it in a theater and thought it was one of the better movies ever
1,considering the fact the story takes on the first two thirds of the movie it is a good mystery movie that is n't very good,considering that this was not a film i 'd give it a chance for the fact that it 's not so much as a b movie
1,the movie is a great example of how not to make a film,the movie also contains some very very very bad acting and a few other
1,the only thing that made this movie interesting was that it was made in,the movie was not about the battle against the communists the us government
1,ok it has a nice little plot but i think it was n't that great,ok the movie was bad the story was bad and the acting was bad
1,some people might say that it is n't as bad as i,some people say this movie sucks it 's just plain stupid
1,once a movie is made of a great director and the director who is a great director,once again it makes you wonder if this is going to be as a parody of the first
1,it 's a real shame that the movie was so bad in this case it was not,it 's a shame because it 's not a good movie it is very well made
1,the acting is terrible the directing is awful and the script is just a mess,the film is also a very entertaining film but in the context of the movie it
1,the film has been a lot lately,the film is a complete failure
1,that 's the only reason why i give it a 2,that being said it 's the best of the three
1,but that is a big problem,but the story is pretty much a
1,they are so cute and so funny,they did n't have a movie that is
1,people should be happy to get out of this,people who have read this comment on the imdb boards
1,because it was the last of the series,because he 's a very bad guy
1,it seems like a good movie that i have n't seen,it is a great story that should not be missed
1,i do not recommend this for anybody who,i have to say i was surprised
1,yes it 's the same story but that 's about all,yes this was a good film but not the worst
1,and it does n't even matter,and the ending is pretty abrupt
1,hilariously i was expecting a lot from the movie,hilariously bad film from the director of a great film
1,they are all in a lot better than the ones with the exception of the movie and the actors,they did not have any chemistry and did n't even make it through the entire movie but it had to
1,of course the film is about some people trying to make a statement about their own,of course the only thing that really stands out is the scene where the hero and his
1,the acting is pretty poor and the story really is n't,the movie is very good to watch with the actors
1,cinema is a classic in all aspects,cinema has a similar message and is a
1,i do n't think the writers intended to show us the whole point of view of the story of this film,i have seen a lot of movies and i can honestly see that i 've never seen a worse film
1,i saw it a few years before it was released and i was surprised by it,i have to agree with other people saying that this is a good movie with excellent performances
1,at that point in the movie there is a scene of,at the same time he is a very talented man
1,this film was so bad it actually made me mad,this is one of the funniest tv shows ever
1,using the name to the original was a good idea for the film and it is still a very interesting movie to watch,using the original was the best in my opinion and the most important part of the movie was that it was a bit slow
1,it is also the first time that you 've seen this show you will,it is the story that makes no sense and is a true masterpiece
1,i would love to see a movie that was a complete success in the series,i would give a 10 but i was n't so much of a problem
1,i have never laughed so hard when this movie was released and i had to rewind out the,i do n't even know what to say i do n't understand why it 's so bad
1,even the usually dependable judi dench could n't,even the music is n't that bad
1,his performance was n't bad either,his character 's is a bit of
1,this film is a great example of how the movie was made,this is a really bad movie and i would rather waste my time
1,they are the best of them,they are both the most beautiful characters
1,if the movie was so boring it would be a lot easier than it should have been,if you have n't seen it you 're missing out to see a film that is not so
1,it 's just not funny it 's just bad,it was so stupid to watch a movie that was
1,please please do not read the book or watch the film,please stop reading the book and do not read the book
1,robert montgomery was a great actor but the rest of the cast was also awful,robert englund has a good time playing the part of the lead role but he 's
1,if the movie is n't so bad it 's just a joke to sit through and,if it was n't for the fact that the movie was n't a bad one
1,i have a feeling this is the best and most underrated movie,i was really bored and i had to sit through it
1,basically it 's the story of a group of friends,basically there is a plot that is very interesting
1,as for the story it is very hard to tell which is really bad,as the film unfolds you get the feeling you are watching a movie that is
1,maybe it was a spoof of the old west films but i was,maybe it 's time to make the mistake of a good movie
1,the story is not a simple one,the film is a very moving one
1,i do n't care how it was going to end,i am not even a fan of this kind of movies
1,most of the actors are just as stiff and lifeless as the rest of the movie,most of the film takes place in a small town in which a small boy is killed
1,the only thing i liked was the fact that it is a complete rip off of the first movie but that is what the story does not,the film opens with a scene involving a couple walking through the woods and a car crash and the final showdown of the movie with a couple of
1,in this case the film is very entertaining,in the end you will see how this is
1,carn also has a great sense of humor which makes the most part very funny,carn 's first feature film in his own right is also a film that is a
1,what was the problem with the film,what i got was an extremely lame film
1,change of heart the only thing in the,change from his past and his life
1,the acting is superb and the characters are likable but it really,the movie is a great example of how to be good
1,nice try to be cool with this film,nice movie for those who love the first movie
1,this movie makes no sense whatsoever it is a total,this is the only real flaw of this film
1,and the acting is horrible the plot is ridiculous,and the fact that they have no chemistry to develop
1,spoke out for a few reasons,spoke of the movie i did n't
1,working at a bar is a movie that i will never forget,working on a small budget is not the best part of the movie
1,i do n't think i 'd ever seen this,i have no idea whether it was the intent of
1,for those who like the original series it will have you laughing hysterically at the tv,for instance the two main actors who had the same name in their roles were the main
1,so it 's a movie that is n't a waste of time,so it 's just that there is a reason why this movie is
1,in my mind it was a great idea,in short this is a very very enjoyable and
1,so why does he try to save her,so what if it was not for the fact
1,the acting is pretty good and the acting was good,the story was not too original and it was n't really
1,and the acting was pretty decent,and the movie itself has no plot
1,and the ending was very unsatisfying,and there 's a lot of people
1,while the original series had been a bit more successful the show is also very good,while it is n't the worst movie i have seen it certainly does not work
1,the film 's only redeeming feature in its first half,the movie itself is very much a bit slow
1,instead it has a lot to say,instead the movie just drags on and on
1,still it 's not a good film,still it was a great film for the
1,i think this movie is just plain bad,i was surprised that they did n't have to
1,the film is a little too short to be taken seriously,the movie is a total waste of time and a waste of
1,the movie was shot on a shoestring budget and in,the story and story are n't all that interesting
1,i saw this movie in the late eighties and it 's a very good one,i do n't even think of the movie as the first movie i 've seen in
1,cats were n't all as bad as,cats and monsters should be ashamed
1,knowing how to do a film that is as good as a good idea,knowing that the movie is supposed to be about a killer in the woods who
1,let me say it is not a,let 's make it the first
1,so the movie is a waste of time,so the film is a little too long
1,throw in a bunch of people getting,throw out the cast as well
1,but i do n't think the filmmakers were trying to make,but then again the whole film is a complete mess
1,probably if it is n't for the good,probably not even in the movie industry
1,maybe it was because i was looking for something different to the movie,maybe he 's supposed to have just been trying to make some more of
1,the only thing this movie has going for it are the actors and the acting,the story is so predictable that i did n't care for any of the characters
1,and the acting in the film was pretty good and the characters,and that 's the only reason i can watch this movie
1,douglas fairbanks jr 's character is a bit over the top,douglas fairbanks as the chief of the group is a little too
1,no real character development or anything in the film for you,no real character development and a story that is a complete mess
1,is it the same thing that the,is there anything more to say
1,very little of this is the case of the film which,very well done and well executed by the great cast
1,it is a film about a man searching for his,it does n't work out for a good story
1,pat morita has made a great villain and this is,pat boone is the best of all the actors
1,however in a sense of time the film 's impact of the narrative is not revealed as the film 's narrative develops,however there 's a few good moments and a few of the actors that are in the film are very good
1,what 's the point of making a movie with such a good idea,what makes this movie a classic is that the movie does have a great
1,in my humble opinion this is a very good film,in my opinion this is a must for any fans of
1,and the ending is the worst part of all,and the movie is not a total failure
1,yeah the movie was good and the acting was pretty good but that did not save the,yeah it is a bit cheesy but it 's still a lot of fun and fun
1,qt was the one who had to go through the same thing,qt is not a bad guy but a lot of good actors can
1,at the same time it 's a great story and a,at one time the film is a little too much
1,the movie has a lot of action sequences but it 's so boring and it does n't,the first thing that was wrong with was the story of the characters and the plot
1,for example the scene of the giant spider slashing at the end of the film is a bit cheesy in this case but the final fight scene was quite brutal,for the first hour the only thing that kept me watching was the fact that they had a little bit of screen time and did n't get much of it
1,then the camera pans up on a cliff and then the camera pans on and on with him in it 's head and the camera pans down on him,then there is the scene where he has a crush on the woman who 's a little more of a character and the fact of him is the fact that
1,first there is a very bad movie that is about an hour and forty minutes of boring,first i was looking forward to seeing this movie i was really excited to see what is going
1,apparently the director was making a mistake of his own,apparently it is a bit of a shame that such a
1,it is a very bad movie and i ca n't imagine how much i missed something,it 's all so obvious and boring that it 's not even fun in the slightest
1,it is the worst movie i have ever watched and i have seen many many movies,it is also one of the few movies i can remember that it had been filmed
1,the acting is horrible and there 's even some pretty decent cgi,the only reason i did n't give this movie a 1 is because
1,i'm sorry but that is n't enough,i'm not sure how they 're gonna get
1,that 's not what happens in the film as the film,that is what i thought it was going to be
1,in fact this movie is a total waste of time and a waste of my time,in fact the whole cast is superb and the acting is good enough with the actors
1,all i saw was a movie which i saw,all in all this is a good movie
1,he 's just so stupid as you ca n't help but feel,he is a man who loves the girl and loves her
1,they are so good and so good,they are n't even remotely convincing
1,to me i would like to say that the movie is a complete waste,to sum up this story is n't bad but not bad at all
1,first of all this was not a good movie and i thought,first let me say that i was impressed with the film
1,we get to see some of the most famous actors from this movie but their character is so stupid it 's untrue,we know the story of the president of the united states who has to do his bidding and is willing to fight for
1,mark twain is one of the greatest and most gifted actors to ever grace his screen,mark wahlberg as a former cop is the most memorable thing he 's ever done
1,s epatha merkerson plays the character of elizabeth taylor,s epatha merkerson plays the young woman of a woman
1,my friend and i rented this dvd and we were laughing at how many people that were so disgusted by the movie,my friends and i saw the film last night and we were n't expecting to see a film that was n't so bad
1,as a result of what is going on at all,as it stands it is not a bad movie
1,hang the movie in an excellent direction,hang on this movie is the fact that
1,invitations to a new generation of the dead men in the house are also a lot of fun to watch,invitations a group of friends and the local sheriff in order to make a living out of a couple of people
1,the story was pretty good and i liked the idea of,the movie is not very funny and not even funny
1,care about it all and the characters and the story are all excellent,care about the man responsible to his wife and his mother 's life is
1,big time for all the good guys and the,big name actors are wasted on this movie
1,while the film does a lot of research on this film i felt that it was,while the acting was good there was some good acting but not in this one
1,it 's a shame it did n't go anywhere,it is also the story of a woman that is
1,it has a lot of potential but the story is very good the characters are believable enough,it was a good movie and it 's not the best film i 've ever seen
1,has the film been a classic in all respects,has the audience believe that a man who is a
1,maybe they were all trying to find a way to make this movie but they,maybe that 's why it 's a bit of a stretch to watch it
1,i think it is the best performance in this movie,i was really bored when i watched the first one and
1,a few people who are so critical that the,a very good movie with a wonderful cast
1,while i did watch the whole thing in the theater i felt it was a very good show,while it may not have a lot of laughs in it there are also a few funny moments
1,i have n't read it and the plot is so thin the acting is awful,i was so bored that the movie did n't make any sense and did n't even
1,angelina jolie is a woman in the movie but she has been given much to do,angelina jolie has done a fine job as one of the most beloved actors ever to grace
1,to me it was a very entertaining movie and i really enjoyed the way the movie unfolded,to be honest i did have a lot of problems with this movie and the ending was so
1,only in a few minutes of this film it was a very,only a small portion of the movie would have been made
1,it is the most difficult to believe the film was made by the,it is the most powerful portrayal of a human being in life
1,to me it is an enjoyable film that will not appeal to everyone at all,to be honest this has got to be my all time favorite movie ever
1,they should have been ashamed of the situation and instead of making a sequel to the book,they should n't have done that at least they could have used this one to make it more
1,and the acting is pretty good,and i really enjoyed it and i
1,the film is a bit long and it 's not really,the acting is superb and it 's all so good
1,the only problem i have with this movie was the fact that the director was n't,the film has no plot and no plot and the film is very poorly edited
1,the acting and the directing are horrible,the acting and script is awful
1,legendary movie stars john carradine as the president of a tobacco company who had a good role in the film,legendary film maker who is also known for his work of work is also quite impressive in the film industry
1,in fact i thought it was going to get better when it went and i did,in the end the main characters do n't even have a clue that the characters are so
1,they 're all a bunch of kids who get together,they are both good looking and do very well
1,this movie is an insult to all,this film does n't have any kind of
1,the film is about an english actress named anna and their relationship with each other but in their opinion they find themselves in a,the acting was bad and there were a few scenes where the actors were not acting or the camera work they were using
1,i 've heard the movie 's message about the bible,i do n't think the film has a purpose
1,we are supposed to be a part of the movie and we are supposed to care about them,we have to wait for the film to get a bit too boring but it does n't take long
1,yet it has a very simple story line and a very nice ending,yet it 's still a good film and i can understand why i did
1,a very enjoyable film and one that everyone should see,a film like these that should be made available on dvd
1,the story is very similar to the original but it is so bad it 's almost impossible to suspend belief,the plot revolves around a group of teenagers who have a reunion of their own and a group of people who
1,naturally they were the best and funniest in the world and i loved it,naturally he and the others have a good life and the two leads in the
1,moments that are so good to make you feel like you 're,moments of the movie are not funny and it never works
1,the film is also a very nice one,the film 's title refers to the film 's
1,rutger hauer plays a character he is n't very likable and is very funny as a slimy man,rutger hauer was the most convincing character of the movie and he had a great supporting cast that i
1,yoko and her friends go off to their homes to get their own way,yoko davies and michael gambon are very good in this movie and the supporting cast
1,however there are some good performances in a couple of moments but,however the script is also the worst i 've seen since
1,it is a great film to see and see,it 's a real shame that i had n't seen
1,i would like to know what 's going on,i am so excited about the film 's faults
1,we are supposed to believe it but this time around and a bit,we have a group of characters who have an obsession with each other and
1,if i had to pick a better movie in my book i would have a,if you can see it in your dvd player please do n't watch it
1,it 's a movie about the hardships of a man that makes a very profound,it 's a shame that a lot of people think this film is good
1,the only thing i can say i found that this movie is a bit of an exercise in a long time to come when they,the first thing that i did n't like was the ending which was a bit disappointing as i did n't know what to expect
1,the movie 's climax is a bit schmaltzy but i think that the film has to be the best one of which i can remember,the movie itself was not the most popular movie i saw it but the story is pretty good and it 's not just a good idea
1,this is a movie for those who love the old,this is one of the worst movies ever made
1,it was an excellent film for all ages and,it was n't so bad it 's bad
1,and then they cut to a few of the scenes,and that 's all i can say about it
1,the movie is n't bad at all,the film is also about a group of
1,plot holes are nonexistent but there are plenty of twists which make the film watchable for anyone with more than,plot twists abound and the movie is about a bunch of young teenagers who live for a rich man
1,if you like a good action film you 'll love this,if that 's true i can imagine how much it is worth
1,it was a very funny film and i loved it,it 's a shame that he did n't get a chance
1,i think that it is the same movie that makes it all the more interesting to watch,i was a little skeptical about the film and the acting and editing were ok although there was
1,how the heck do we see a good horror movie,how do they manage to keep the pace of this piece
1,now that 's the best of the movie,now i know i am not going to go
1,despite a few weaknesses in the movie there are several flaws,despite all of the shortcomings it 's a film about two women
1,i was really surprised by this movie,i was n't disappointed by this film
1,please do n't waste a rental or watching a movie like this,please avoid this film at all costs unless you are a diehard fan
1,standard of the film has the same appeal to it as in the first film,standard action movie is n't the only one of the best films out there
1,are we supposed to care about the characters and their motivations,are we really trying to make a film about the real thing
1,there were so many things that i do n't like about it,there 's a lot of nudity in the movie but it is also
1,i would recommend this flick to those who do n't have any doubts about it,i was n't sure whether to watch this or if i 'd rather than be a
1,she is a woman of a woman who 's been kidnapped and is n't afraid to leave,she was n't really good at the time but she was n't a very good actress
1,imagine the movie in its entirety and the acting it is the best i,imagine this movie and then it would be good but it 's not
1,and i did not expect much,and the ending of his life is
1,if you have not read the original book you should probably find the ending quite satisfying as well,if you 're looking for an interesting film you 're not missing a thing of a movie
1,overall i think the reason i gave a movie a 4 rating is 1 it 's just,overall the movie is a waste of time and money and it 's not worth renting
1,terry gilliam has a small role in this film,terry gilliam is a master of the industry who is
1,it has the same plot but the story is so simple and the,it 's a shame because it was a total waste of time
1,i do n't know if it is supposed to please the masses or the,i was so excited and surprised that the story was actually quite interesting
1,i think the main reason why i did not like this film was for a change of the fact that the movie was shot independently,i was n't expecting much of this movie but i found it interesting and i found myself asking myself what it would be like to have
1,people who have seen the movie know it was based,people have been talking about the movie 's shortcomings
1,purple rose was a wonderful movie,purple rain also has a few funny
1,i do n't know why but i was surprised to learn that the director,i 've never seen a movie where i saw this movie so much
1,she was in it for the first 15 minutes in her life,she also has a daughter 's wife and she says something that 's
1,this is one of the most entertaining films i have seen for ages,this movie is a great example of what a horror movie can achieve
1,the film is a complete waste of a great cast and a very entertaining and entertaining script,the story of the film is the story of how a man can live in and in a
1,the first half of the movie consists of some kind of bizarre subplot involving a woman in a car,the film is n't even close to the truth the film tries to get a hold of a good idea
1,soon a man arrives at a small provincial,soon they get married but are n't
1,i would say a lot of the plot and acting,i do n't remember the name of the movie
1,in fact this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen,in fact it 's all the worst of them and i do n't know
1,this is the best of the three movies,this is n't a film to see as long
1,the script is so poor that there 's no real plot the only,the film is about a group of young adults from their childhood
1,grant is a fine actor but his character is n't too likable or unlikable,grant was an extremely good casting choice for the part of his career and i
1,and the movie itself was n't a,and it 's not a movie
1,he is one of the best actors ever to make this film,he 's just so stupid that i wanted to slap him
1,but the story is n't really that great,but i have to say that this is a
1,but i think the movie is a little,but it 's a very enjoyable movie
1,when the movie finally starts the final sequence was a bit slow,when i saw this movie i thought it would be great
1,the only reason i gave it 10 was because i was a little confused,the plot line was very weak but the actors who did n't have any chemistry
1,had the filmmakers cut the movie into the movie the story could have been a,had this film done a good job it would have been a good one
1,even the soundtrack is so poor you ca n't be a good movie,even the worst of the worst horror movies ever made is a good one
1,perhaps it would be unfair for those who want to watch something like watching this,perhaps it 's because the director has n't been able to convey the essence of this
1,not to mention it 's a movie about a woman who 's not going to be married,not to mention the fact that this is a great show to watch on tv in the early
1,possibly because of the lack of a,possibly the greatest movie ever made
1,i'm still watching the movie as it shows a,i'm not sure what to say about it
1,inside a building is a movie that is a lot more fun,inside of the film is a little bit of a letdown
1,it was not a movie i would watch if you want to see a really bad movie with,it has an allstar cast that includes some of the most memorable characters ever put on film
1,however in that sense the acting is superb and the script is so sharp that it,however the film is a bit too long at times and a little too talky
1,as a matter of fact the film is a real winner for its time,as i watched this movie i could n't help thinking that it might be a
1,with his trusty hair and eyes he has a great deal of charisma for the characters,with the exception of the first scene in the movie it is a real pity
1,this is a movie with the exception of an actor who can play a role of a lifetime actor,this is the story of an elderly family of sorts of the family members who are sent to an underground
1,i saw this movie at the 2005 international film,i have n't even heard of this film
1,concerned with this movie was a very bad mistake that i was,concerned about it 's success is to have a few laughs
1,but this was one of the best,but then again that 's how much i
1,the movie was shot in black with a few friends at a garage,the acting is very bad and the movie is just plain boring
1,i do n't know if it is my favorite movie,i was really looking forward to seeing a movie
1,not only does the movie not have the sorta redeeming qualities but it has a nice cast,not that it is too much of the imagination and only a few scenes were cut from the
1,like many other users i was n't impressed at all the film is very slow paced and not very well developed,like the movie you 're in for a good time but the story is very weak and the characters are so bad
1,i have never seen such a terrible movie in a while,i have to say the story and the direction of the movie
1,very much on the way of being a film about a,very similar to the classic american version of the classic
1,unoriginal and pointless but the most fun part,unoriginal and boring but a great movie
1,as i mentioned earlier the film was n't a very good film,as far as i'm concerned i would like to say it is the
1,do n't get me wrong i enjoyed the movie,do n't worry that i do n't have any luck
1,i was expecting more from this film and i was very disappointed with it,i 've seen it many times and i have to agree it 's just another
1,fido is a film that is a bit too long,fido the man with a golden arm and is a great
1,the script was so bad i actually laughed at the jokes,the only thing that kept me going was the music
1,they should n't have taken anymore in the first place they had,they are both good friends who just want to kill people
1,along with the cast are all good,along the way we meet the two leads
1,nothing is left out of this film,nothing happens but it is a very nice
1,it 's a shame that the film has never been released on,it was a good film and i liked it very much
1,the film is a very interesting documentary about what happened in the past of what,the movie starts out with a bang and a little bit of a climax
1,this was a waste of time,this was one of the few movies
1,words cannot describe it as a bad movie,words were made in the early '90s but this
1,this movie is a very entertaining and original film with a wonderful cast,this is the worst movie you 've ever seen and it is not funny
1,and the whole cast of people that were involved in this project was a great idea and the director did,and the ending is a complete ripoff of any movie i 've ever seen i have seen this movie
1,he is an amazing actor and that he can,he was the perfect choice for this movie
1,by the time he 's in the film 's most popular title of the film it 's,by the time it was released the film ceased to be a sequel to the original
1,gosh i do not think that 's a,gosh this movie is a real stinker
1,saif khan 's character is so bad and is not,saif 's character is very funny in his role
1,fortunately the film is n't as bad as its,fortunately it does n't even try to be
1,the film is a bit like the original,the plot is a simple one with some of
1,the movie is very well done in a sense that the,the story line of the film is a little weak
1,a good film for a few quid,a great example of the greatness that was
1,the story is simple enough to make,the acting is horrible at times
1,since this is a great movie it is the best movie i 've ever seen,since this is a film that i would love to see again i would recommend it
1,if you 're looking for something that 's not bad enough to be a horror flick this was the movie for you,if this were n't bad enough they just decided to try and get to the bottom of the barrel and then the film
1,quadrant 2 was a great show for the whole family,quadrant of the dead is one of my favorite horror movies
1,lucille russell is also wonderful as the lead singer who was,lucille dench 's performance as an actress with no talent
1,dictators like this were the best i had ever seen,dictators are not that they are n't all that good
1,as the movie progresses it becomes obvious that the film is not just a comedy it,as a result the movie does n't even make it big on a big screen
1,i have seen this film several times and still ca n't believe it is,i think they should have done that in the beginning of the movie
1,they do n't even bother to make the film any more,they are just the kind of ignorant that is not only a
1,it has the feel of a great movie,it was not as bad as this
1,it is not a film for everyone 's taste and the performances and acting are fine,it 's the only time we watch it in its entirety and i do n't remember anything
1,so much so that it is a bit too,so what 's the point of this film
1,this movie is an excellent and very enjoyable one to watch,this movie is not about people and how they can go in
1,the movie was made with such great actors and i have to,the story is not as good as this one is n't
1,it is very hard to find a film that is very interesting and is n't really a good one at that,it 's a movie that i would not watch if i were in a coma with a group of guys and a
1,secondly i thought that was pretty funny,secondly the film is a mess and is
1,it 's the story of a young and lonely man with a heart of gold and his love for the family,it 's a shame that the only reason i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 is that it did n't
1,i would n't have seen this film in my life as,i do n't remember that it was a good movie
1,the only reason i did n't give it an eight is because it had me in,the movie has some nice twists and turns but the script is n't too bad
1,and if you like watching this movie that makes you laugh and cry at you,and the acting by the two leads in this movie are all fine especially ving rhames
1,after all the movie is a little bit too slow,after reading the other comments here on imdb that imdb is
1,reading the book is a very good film,reading the book the story is pretty basic
1,she 's a good guy who 's trying to make her,she was n't the only actress in the entire movie
1,she 's got an affinity for her and the,she does n't seem to care for her
1,was it the intent of the story,was that a good idea for a film
1,audition is a very funny movie,audition is also an excellent film with
1,however there were some moments where you see the characters and,however this was just another excuse for a bad movie
1,there is a bit of a lot of humor and a lot of the scenes of,there are some great songs but they have the usual charm of the original story
1,i would n't recommend this movie to anyone,i saw a sneak preview of a movie which
1,the acting is horrible and the direction is awful,the film is n't about a man who 's a
1,the acting is good and the story is very,the film is a complete waste of time
1,my favorite character is the guy with the golden arm,my friends were watching this film as it was shown in
1,as for the movie it does have its moments in the,as for his acting skills it seems a bit stiff
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen,this is the best movie i 've seen in years
1,there are so many other films i 've seen that made me cry,there were a lot of good scenes the movie was n't bad but at
1,the film opens in an interesting fashion where the viewer is left wondering why,the movie is not for everyone and is just a waste of time
1,i 've read a few reviews of this movie and i have to confess the film is pretty bad,i do n't think i have ever seen anything like that in any other movie or even the godawful acting
1,i 've never really been so moved by watching the film,i have to say i was very pleased that i did n't
1,words that do not translate with me are the best of,words are always a lot more fun than this one
1,5 the acting of the two lead actors was excellent,5 this movie is a total waste of time and a
1,laura gemser is the one who is a good actress,laura linney has a great supporting cast but she plays a
1,mostly the film is a mess of the first two,mostly because of the lack of a decent script or a
1,it is a pity that the film did not receive more publicity and it 's not available on video,it 's a shame that it 's not a bad movie but it definitely has some good moments
1,every scene in the film is a masterpiece,every single character in this movie has a very
1,peter falk is a good actor but his,peter o'toole 's performance is also good
1,the movie has a good soundtrack but the film 's score is so,the movie was shot on location and was shot in the locations
1,if i had to choose between the two and the other i 'd happily be surprised with a very poor performance from,if there 's a movie about him you would probably want to see this film in an hour and a half
1,but the story line is really great,but the film 's biggest flaw is the
1,yet it 's also not as good as the,yet the story and the performances are excellent
1,this was one of the first movies i saw,this movie was so bad it was laughable
1,the story is not as good as the book but the,the film 's climax is a bit of an anticlimax
1,but i have never seen a movie like this in such a narrow matter,but if i did watch this i would have given a better review of this
1,all that said the film was great,all in all if you love movies that
1,peter cushing is good as the evil but deadly and the bad guy gets,peter falk is a great actor and he is a very likable actor
1,the acting is good and it has some good special effects but not a bad one at that,the film opens with the girl who has a crush on her father and she has to deal with
1,instead it 's a very good film which is a must see,instead of watching this movie i would n't be disappointed if i could
1,exploring the story of this is the only one to see it,exploring the real world of a man who has to go to the
1,harpo 's performance is also very good,harpo is also the only good actor in
1,it 's just the same way that they do it 's a wonderful life with a lot of good action and the whole,it 's just a bad film about the evils and how they are made aware in the past but what the hell
1,the acting is so poor and the plot is so stupid and the acting is bad,the movie does have some great action sequences but they do n't really add anything to the
1,i have to say it is my first film,i think the movie is a bit of a spoof
1,i would like to see some good movies that i have seen but this,i do n't remember anything like i said the movie is so bad
1,seeing the old and tired man is the closest he 's in his life,seeing that i was not a fan of the original i was impressed with the
1,though the movie is n't a complete waste of time it 's definitely not the best it could have,though the plot is a bit thin it does not make much sense as in the previous two films it
1,when the film finally finished i was so excited by it that it was,when i heard of that this was one of those films i liked
1,no one is ever really funny and the movie is so boring that it makes you wonder what the,no other than this movie i would n't want to be able to predict how bad it is
1,but that 's a little more than,but it 's not that bad
1,in fact i think the best of the films was the one where a,in the meantime of the film he is able to communicate the same
1,never mind that it was n't a,never really got to the climax
1,apparently there is the fact that it 's not only about the war,apparently he is a bit of a loser in need of therapy
1,with this film we are treated to a very bad movie,with the exception of being a good movie and a great movie
1,but the film is not for everyone,but i have never been to a film
1,what is more the movie shows that all,what is the difference in these movies
1,possible spoilers ahead the film opens with a very long sequence where a man is stabbed in,possible spoilers ahead i 've read all the other comments about how bad this movie has
1,i was a bit surprised that the film was made,i saw it at a screening at sundance and i have
1,he is a good character but not a good one either,he is a master of his own family and a great family
1,the acting was bad and so was the plot,the movie has the worst special effects ever
1,the plot is very thin and the actors who played themselves are n't very good,the movie has a lot of good points and the actors are very good in their
1,i 've heard many of the reviews that,i think that 's what i got
1,so the film ends up being a total failure,so it is a good movie for those who enjoy
1,as a result of the film 's success the film does manage to hold interest in all the characters and,as far as i'm concerned the movie is n't really bad at all but it 's just plain bad
1,the film is also about a young boy named sasha who is sent to a hospital to,the story is n't very good but the performances are so good i could care less
1,from the opening scene where the two are shot with their eyes and the sounds of an old woman 's body in a room and,from there the story is told with flashbacks of the two partisans and their relationship with each other and the way the story unfolds
1,of course the plot is not a very strong one but the acting is superb,of course there are some great actors but the story line is just too ridiculous
1,ashley is a great actress but the,ashley 's acting was pretty lame
1,it 's all the more thrilling that,it 's not even that good
1,and that 's not all the way i do n't know,and i think it 's an important point to be done with
1,pando has an interest in the making of a movie about how to,pando 's direction is so bad that it 's impossible to watch
1,i'm glad that there are people who have seen this,i'm sorry if i had a problem with that
1,he is also very convincing and has an interesting role,he 's also the only person who can act and he
1,my favourite line is when i saw a couple of the movies i thought the best i ever saw in my youth,my favorite part is a song in the middle of the movie which i found the whole film to be a bit of
1,everybody is just too young and too healthy to be too sympathetic with this movie,everybody who has seen the show knows that this is the same old crap that was
1,even if that sounds like an important task in,even the music by jerry goldsmith is better
1,the story is n't a good one,the first half hour is a very funny
1,the movie is about a group of people who get a,the acting is horrible and the plot is pretty weak
1,but this is a great story of a young girl,but it does not make for good or bad
1,first of all the acting was horrible the plot,first the movie is not a horror movie
1,then the movie started to be a big disappointment,then there is a lot of the same
1,woodstock and his friends are all very funny and have,woodstock is a great show for fans of tv
1,her husband 's life has a heart of gold and,her performance was so bad that it was laughable
1,the story is simple and full of surprises,the movie has a nice touch to it but
1,even the actors in the movie are n't really all that impressed by the story,even though the plot and dialogue were not bad the actors were pretty much wasted and
1,take the time to see the movie i would be more,take the film to the level of a true story
1,but it is n't so bad it 's good to,but that is the best part in the movie
1,the movie was made in the us,the acting by some of the actors was
1,the plot is about a girl who 's been kidnapped and killed by her,the film is about a young man whose life is not his own
1,the only reason i did n't give it a 2 was because it was the first movie i 've,the acting is good and the script is good and the actors in this movie have great chemistry
1,he 's a bit stiff but his character is not a real person,he 's also quite funny and has a very nice touch and he has
1,crack the camera and then you 're,crack up to a few laughs
1,so the film was released on dvd so that the film,so why does this movie have so many positive reviews
1,and the film was made to have the same effect,and i was n't really impressed by this movie
1,watch it if you want a laugh,watch if you like to see a movie
1,why did he have a cameo as the main character,why not make a movie about a bunch of friends from
1,revealing the true facts of this story,revealing how to make a movie about a
1,the film was shot on video but in that case it 's pretty much a documentary,the movie does not make sense to the audience as it 's a real documentary
1,then you 're going to go out of your way to try,then there was a lot of things that are n't funny
1,ugh that 's not the problem with this film,ugh that 's what i got for this sequel
1,that is what makes this so enjoyable to watch,that is n't the best of this film and it
1,the plot is a joke but the characters are n't very well developed,the movie is a complete failure and that makes you think about how a
1,also the ending is the worst,also a very nice score from the
1,of course they do n't get it,of course i have the patience of my
1,the plot twists are pretty lame as well as the main plot,the acting is terrible as well as the directing the sets the plot
1,now the director is trying to do a different movie but i do n't know,now this is a film i would recommend to anyone that enjoys good movies
1,it 's a shame that so many people think this film is a total waste of celluloid,it 's a shame because it has the most famous of the best and best of the genre
1,but the plot itself is just so bad,but the best scene in the movie is when
1,and that was a little unfair,and i was really disappointed in the
1,well it is n't so much a horror film as it is a parody of,well the film is n't that bad i do not recommend it at all
1,does anyone know where to begin the tapes,does she know what she 's doing
1,george lucas is n't the best director but his film is a,george sanders is excellent at playing a role in the movie
1,these are not what they seem to be in the film but as a matter,these were just my first two cents i had the lp of the dvd
1,the story and characters develop well enough,the story is not very good
1,this has to be the worst film i 've seen in the last 35 years,this movie has some of the worst dialog and acting i 've ever seen
1,back in the eighties a film that was supposed to be set in a place with a new director a budget of 8000,back in the early 1960s we were in a small town where this was filmed and was shown at the very very first of
1,this film makes no sense and is,this was probably the biggest problem
1,as it was i would have thought that this movie was a little less realistic than i 'd expected,as i mentioned above i was n't expecting to like it but i thought it is a great movie
1,in the end the film has a good story,in this case it is an excellent film
1,although i do recall the movie being an action packed film i have a few laughs,although the movie did not have a very good plot line the acting was great
1,meanwhile a young couple gets killed by an alligator,meanwhile in the middle of the movie the only thing
1,watch it and you wo n't regret it,watch it if you like a bit of action
1,she is also a beautiful and talented actress,she has been the most famous character of this
1,it 's a very funny film that has been done well by many other people,it is a movie that has a certain plot line that is not to say much
1,thought of this movie as a good,thought this was a bad movie
1,the story of this movie is just too old for the first half,the acting was pretty decent although they had a lot of potential and the
1,the movie is just a little too long for the,the acting and direction of this movie is excellent
1,basically i was a little skeptical and i thought the whole thing was,basically he is a young man who is in his own way
1,there was no chemistry between the main characters,there are some interesting points to be found here
1,but there were so many problems with this movie it was hard to believe that there was no story and plot,but the best part of this film is how the two main characters in the film are supposed to take care of
1,i saw this film on the shelf for the first time in the uk,i have a feeling that i have never seen any other movie that has made
1,we see that there will be a sequel to the original film,we have the movie on a dvd set of the movie
1,there is also a scene with a girl who is a whore but she 's not afraid to let it go,there is an element of the film that really made it a good film but the story is very weak
1,leila and her friend are the perfect pair and the film has an interesting cast as the main character 's gradual obsession with his son 's life,leila has a good sense of what he could do and she 's not even the most beautiful person but he is the best one of all
1,and the ending is one of the most memorable i 've ever seen,and the film has some great moments and it works very well
1,it would have been nice to hear them in this movie,it 's a pity that the movie did not have a lot
1,and the movie is very good,and that was not to say the
1,the movie has a few good points,the movie also has some interesting parts which
1,and the film is a little too long,and if there 's a reason why the movie
1,for those who want to see a great movie about a young man and a child,for the rest of the series you will be glad to see the next one
1,i do n't know about it,i would have loved to see this
1,old fashioned and stupid and the movie 's plot is,old fashioned horror is n't the best of course
1,a movie like the texas chainsaw massacre and,a lot of the acting was bad
1,released in 1995 this movie is a very good movie about a man who is trying to,released in 1995 and the fact that this film has been made is a must see
1,the movie was just about the same guy and it 's,the film is very entertaining and a lot of fun
1,seasoned actors who are also known for being a gifted and talented director,seasoned actors of course have been a great director and the director and writer
1,but i was very pleasantly surprised,but it was a great movie
1,the only thing i liked was the scene where he is walking through,the plot was very thin but it was a bit too long
1,i would have loved to have had more of the movie,i have n't even mentioned the first one of the series when
1,the film is very well done in the extreme and as it is in the movie,the plot is a simple mess of the original story but there is n't enough twists in
1,if you like the original then you should n't be disappointed,if you are a fan of the series then this film is
1,callahan is a master of the craft but not a single one,callahan is a good actor but this movie lacks his acting ability
1,he 's a good actor and his performance is very good but the,he is a good actor but he 's not in this one
1,cary grant is one of the best actors ever for,cary elwes is one of the best actors ever
1,i was expecting to see a lot of action,i would n't recommend this movie to anyone
1,later on in the movie the characters go to a different kind of place where each person lives and dies,later i have seen a lot of the movies i 've seen but it was just a good movie
1,it is n't just for the sake of your liking,it is a shame because it is the most controversial movie
1,well i did not have much expectations for,well this one really has an appeal
1,this film is a total disgrace of the book and i hope it,this is a very good example for a movie to be made
1,i do n't know about the movie but this film is just so stupid that i have to wonder if i will have to read the,i do n't remember the name of this movie but the movie was very entertaining and i was impressed with the performances and the story
1,tommy stewart is great as well,tommy lee jones 's performance in the
1,and i think the director is not too bright or the director should just be,and it is one of the best examples of how the film is made
1,frankie muniz has done an excellent job as always and is a joy to watch in a movie,frankie is not a bad guy who does n't seem to be the best way to spend an evening
1,the story of a young woman who works with a child 's mother and her family,the acting is good and the direction is very well done and the acting is very good
1,james stewart is a good actor and,james cagney is a wonderful actor
1,i do n't know who is the killer but i,i am not a big fan of this movie
1,too bad that the movie did n't seem,too bad it is n't a movie
1,if i had to choose to give my daughter a break and a chance to watch the show she could have done a better job,if that 's the case i think the producers should have been a bit more careful to try to get into the plot and the characters
1,this is a film of a film that was released on dvd by alpha video company and is a very underrated film,this is a movie that is a must see for all ages and should be seen for all generations in the family as
1,with his trusty voice in the background and a little more he does not seem to fit into the film as an actor,with no apparent reason for it to be taken away from the book and the characters in it are there you can say the
1,further the movie is about a group of men who go on and on the verge of,further it is also quite good that this movie is made available on vhs and dvd
1,these are the things you can do about the characters and the plot,these are the two main reasons why this movie is so awful
1,glenn ford 's performance in this film is so overthetop and so unbelievable that it is hard to believe the,glenn close and his friend have been in a relationship with each other but their friendship is never resolved
1,spoilers ahead i saw this movie at the 2005 film festival and it resulted on a big,spoilers ahead i was so disappointed that i had never heard of this film at all
1,the plot line is a little thin and the,the film opens with a very strong conclusion
1,he plays an annoying role in the film,he is a great actor and i hope he
1,even though it is a little bit more than it has a good message,even the most ludicrous of the film 's plot was a total copout
1,i would n't want to see the film,i would have rated this movie a zero but
1,this is a very good movie and it deserves better,this film has a very low rating but it is a
1,there 's a very good reason to be in the film industry,there are some interesting twists and turns in the story but there 's
1,now this film is the worst of all the bad movies i 've seen,now i'm not a huge fan of the genre and that is why the series
1,the film is a real treat to see,the movie was shot during the war
1,the only redeeming thing about this movie is the acting,the movie is n't bad it 's not bad not bad
1,did anyone know that he was in the,did it have a very bad ending
1,plus the ending was really stupid,plus it was so bad that it
1,the first film has some interesting elements of the story but not enough to make you dislike,the story is a little convoluted but it 's a little more than that there 's a bit
1,adele is one of the most interesting characters in the movie and the,adele taylor is a young woman who is in a mental state
1,i do not want to give away the,i think this movie was really great
1,skip this one if you have n't already and have not been fooled,skip it at the end if you have not seen it do n't bother
1,with the exception of the original cast and the production values it has been done,with an excellent cast a decent script this film is not even that great
1,final fantasy viii 's a good movie,final verdict i do n't know how many
1,and there 's not much more,and then there was this scene
1,xiao 's performance is a joy as he is in it but he has a very small part,xiao was n't so bad he was so annoying he was actually a jerk but he is a good
1,the movie does not have the best special,the acting and story are very bad
1,however this film was just horrible,however the movie does have a few
1,but the real problem with this movie is,but then again it 's a movie
1,there 's also an extended sequence of the film that the audience will enjoy,there are some interesting moments and a lot of the humor that is present in
1,throw in a few words and you 've got the makings of this kind of,throw the film with a grain of salt and an insult to its viewers
1,you can get a better look at the story,you can get a lot better than this
1,for the first 30 minutes or so of the movie it was just a little bit,for all the good points of the movie the acting in the movie is superb
1,in my opinion a very poor movie,in addition to the fact that it was
1,i saw the first half of the movie and it was very good,i would like to say that there are many things wrong with this
1,while the movie is a bit slow and drags it just does n't work as a comedy it is a drama and,while i do n't think that 's a good thing i have to say the movie is not bad at all
1,the plot line was pretty good,the movie 's plot is very interesting
1,in fact there are a few good things in this,in the end he 's just a bad person
1,it is a good example of how not to make a film,it is one of the better films i have ever seen
1,save yourself the trouble and watch it,save it from being a bit of a
1,the movie is also the worst movie i 've,the film 's only drawback is to entertain
1,he was the only person that kept me awake for days after i was in the mood,he plays a man who has no idea of who he is and that he has to deal
1,in this case the movie is a very,in fact it 's not even funny
1,the plot is pretty good but that 's not enough to sustain its goals from,the movie is a bit slow but the film is really really really boring
1,midnight cowboy has been a staple of many times and i do not know why i do not,midnight cowboy is the kind of movie that you can only watch with your buddies on video
1,the acting is horrible as is the script,the acting is terrible the story line is bad
1,even if you have seen all those movies i would n't have had the pleasure for it to have been done so,even when the movie does get its audience back to the movie it is not as much fun as the book
1,the movie does have its moments but is still a good film,the film has a lot going for it but it is not as
1,as for the rest of the film it 's a complete waste,as far as i'm concerned they 're not a good one
1,loved it but i do n't have a problem with the story,loved the movie and it was a little slow and did n't make
1,but i was very surprised when the film was,but i guess that 's all there really
1,also the fact it has some really cool moments of suspense but not really enough,also the movie was a bit long and the plot was n't too good
1,alan hale 's performance is a little overdone at times but as an early actor who is very convincing in acting as,alan rickman was very good as the father of the rich and the father who is the father of the family
1,the only thing that kept me watching was how it ended,the plot is very weak and it drags the movie down so
1,the story and characters develop in this movie,the movie has a very very very bad script
1,neil simon has an awesome cameo as the villain and the two leads are well,neil shore is the real world and is the best actor of all time
1,some scenes are not funny or exciting,some people have commented on imdb that this
1,of course the film has no real story but it is still a fun movie,of course they have a little girl in the movie and that 's why
1,alexandra russo has to be the only highlight of the film,alexandra zellweger plays a spoiled and depressed housewife who is sent to
1,i 've seen it over 30 times,i think this is an excellent film and
1,obviously it has been done to death and the people who are making the same mistake should,obviously the producers of this movie did n't know how to put the camera to sleep
1,by the way the film was made in a small town where it 's,by the end of the movie you know that there 's not one
1,its a good story but it 's not the best,its the same story line that is n't even funny and
1,this movie is a must see for anyone interested in a culture,this film is a masterpiece of its time and it does
1,you can get the feeling that you 're watching a good movie,you have no idea who 's who or what it is
1,i saw it in a theatre with my friend and i laughed out loud every time i heard that it was going to be,i have seen a lot of films from the past and there is always a lot of good horror movies to be made
1,it is also a good family movie and a good movie,it 's a very nice thing to say the story is about
1,for me it 's not that good,for example there are the obligatory moments when
1,david cronenberg was a genius in the making of films and the movie was a big,david is a man who wants to be his own family and has a heart
1,so i think you will enjoy it as well,so i have to say that i do enjoy this
1,this movie was very well done,this movie was so bad i was
1,almost every character is a stereotype,almost as bad as the first film
1,i 've heard a couple of things about it that,i would n't have been able to endure it
1,the only thing good about the movie was the fact that this film was made in the first,the story is simple enough but the acting is so bad that it is a little embarrassing
1,all that was needed were the actors of the,all the actors in the film are good
1,it 's a shame they could n't have been more,it was so awful that it 's almost unwatchable
1,and if i could give it 0 star i would rate it,and that 's not the best way i can describe it
1,louis jouvet and his partner are both good,louis calhern plays an aging man who is torn
1,kurosawa 's direction is so much better and the acting is top notch,kurosawa also has a knack for making a documentary of his life in the
1,this film does not have much of,this film was a huge disappointment
1,i have to say that the plot is a little,i have no interest in watching the whole film
1,every single person in this movie thinks they 're going to do,every single scene is just a waste of time and money
1,i am surprised to read that there is a story that can be understood in an interesting fashion,i 've always loved the movie i thought it was good it had the look and sound of some
1,the story of the movie is a very,the movie has a few good laughs
1,i have n't seen this film since and i have to say i did n't have a clue,i think this movie is a very interesting one to watch and i can honestly say the film is
1,it 's a real shame it was n't released theatrically,it was the most interesting part of the film
1,un enfants is not only the greatest of,un is a real person to watch
1,so the film is a bit too long,so many people have complained about what it was
1,she is the only reason why she 's so great,she is an actress in this movie and it is very
1,that 's the only way it can be,that 's the only redeeming factor of this movie
1,i have n't seen the film for years and is so disgusted at it that i have to say that the story is n't really bad and,i would say it 's my duty to warn anyone that this movie had a good cast of actors and the director was not the director
1,i have no problem suspending my interest in this film,i do n't think i have ever seen this film in
1,i do n't care if it takes a little too serious to be shown but there are some really great moments,i 've just watched the first half of the movies but i have to admit that the film has a lot of
1,i do n't know if that 's true or not but it 's not as good as that,i have n't seen any of the other comments here but this is one of the best
1,with this movie it is a very interesting one,with that said and done it 's a really good
1,sadly the movie 's only redeeming feature is the fact that,sadly he is n't able to make a good movie
1,a very good movie with some great actors,a lot of people do n't seem to have
1,the film is a very interesting one at times but it does,the film is n't that much more entertaining than the original
1,i think the movie is a little too slow and the story is n't that great it just does n't work at the box office,i was surprised that they did n't have such a good time when they were trying to be a movie and it was just so good
1,we know the real reason for that,we are also treated to some of the
1,otherwise this film is not a total waste of a movie,otherwise this is an insult as the plot is pretty lame
1,only the two lovers are in the background,only a little bit of the same story as
1,i have to mention that there is a great deal of humour and sexual references between the two in the first scene and,i do n't think it 's possible to say that this is an important film to watch but it 's definitely not
1,you do n't get to see any of the characters in the story,you can tell the story of a woman and her son who is the
1,that is why it 's not a very good movie,that 's the main problem in this film and it is
1,it would be interesting to know that this film is not as good,it is a great film for those who have not seen the original
1,they were not so good at the beginning of the,they are both the same actors as their partners
1,i have seen many of these films and that 's a good thing,i do n't understand how they could possibly even be a good person in
1,it was the first movie to be released in 1994 and the only thing that was good was that it was n't even,it is a shame that he does n't get the credit to the actor who plays the role of a young man
1,brian keith is perfect as the father,brian yuzna had his most successful role as
1,films like this get the lowest rating,films like this were not made for the
1,i'm a sucker for independent movies but i do n't know,i'm surprised that the film is n't available at home
1,it is a movie that has been made in years and has the,it is a great film but it 's not a good movie
1,the only thing that kept me watching was a good performance by john cleese,the only thing that really stands out is the lack of a good deal of
1,unfortunately it is a great film and it 's not the best film ever made but its a good example of the genre,unfortunately it 's still a bad sign of the worst movie i have ever seen and it 's one of the worst
1,the only thing that i do n't like about this movie is how much time it takes to get out of it,the plot is so bad that it could n't have been written by a single single person in an office cell
1,klaatu 's son who is also his father in his own right,klaatu is n't a very bad man he has no choice to speak
1,and there was a lot of potential from the actors involved,and it 's not a good movie at some points but it
1,rydell 's father is so much better than she 's in the book but it 's still the story that makes me feel that i could relate with it if i 'd seen it,rydell and his wife are all together and the story is so predictable that you can hardly understand any of the other characters but you 're supposed to believe the story is just a little
1,others in the cast including the excellent helen mirren and david o are the only real standout,others are either the only one who is a fan of any of his films or is that
1,if you 're not familiar with the subject matter you will probably be bored by,if you do like watching this film i would suggest you watch this film
1,she is n't as good as she seems to have been in the past and the movie is n't really as good as the original,she 's so bad in every possible way that you can only wonder whether she 's just being thrown away in the first 15 minutes of
1,from the start of the movie i thought that the,from start to finish this is an excellent film
1,this film is one of those films that should,this movie is a complete waste of time
1,these are some of my favorites to,these characters were n't believable enough
1,could have been done by an amateur,could n't we be more wrong
1,i would n't go into this expecting much more from the director and the director,i saw this movie at the 2005 toronto international film festival and it was one of
1,when she is in a wheelchair and a car driver is stabbed in a car with her head and then she says,when a character is introduced to a person who has a mental breakdown with someone else he is unable to communicate
1,this movie was one of the worst i 've,this is the first of a long line
1,it 's just a shame because the story does n't have much,it 's like watching a movie that is n't even funny
1,how could the director of the film have a movie that does n't have a budget for a digital feature,how can a man who does n't have a good sense of humor or even a sense of humour
1,this is a very good example of how not to do a film,this film has a very good plot and some very funny lines
1,i 've always enjoyed this film and i think this is,i am glad that this movie did not win awards
1,like the original movie the film does boast a very good story with an interesting concept to boot,like the first film this is just as funny if you 're a diehard fan of movies
1,vic is an excellent actor who does n't need to have,vic is a good actor but he is very poor
1,this movie is not only a good film,this movie has no place in it
1,the only real standout was the performance by the actress who was,the acting is very poor and the script is just terrible
1,when i first saw this film i loved the film and i liked it,when they are being threatened by the cops to fight it the movie takes a
1,colum 's brother and son are not in the film,colum and mr are the two men and they both are
1,even though i have a soft spot in my mouth i still think this is a very good movie,even though it was the first movie i 've heard of a movie i have never been able to see
1,it 's not the same story but it 's just not very good,it was an insult to all the people who made this film
1,most of the characters are so stupid they 're just,most of the time i was laughing hysterically hard
1,but it has no redeeming qualities,but the story is very good
1,on the plus side the acting and the direction,on his way home he finds his wife
1,here is the plot of a young boy who has a crush on the people involved in a life,here we get a film that is n't a bad film it is so bad that i ca n't help
1,people who have seen this movie know who they are and what they 're doing,people who are so bad you 're so funny to know that you 're watching this
1,hudson has a very good performance as the lead,hudson 's character is a very strong character but his
1,john carradine is also a great actor,john cusak 's direction is superb as well
1,the movie starts out with a bang on the floor,the movie was very good for the entire family
1,you will find yourself rooting for the character of the characters,you can see a lot of the movie 's humor
1,gary cole 's character is so bad and so stupid,gary cooper was a good choice for the part
1,i have seen this film twice and will not forget it,i was so impressed by the fact that it seemed so unreal
1,yep it was the worst movie i have seen in,yep the movie is not a comedy at all
1,i was really surprised that this movie did n't get nominated for a score by a score of 10,i 've read this review of a movie and it is one of the worst movies ever made
1,probably the best of the series,probably the worst film i have ever
1,i was expecting to be surprised that there was a scene in the movie where they were trying to make the film and,i was very interested in seeing the film i thought that i 'd give it a chance but i was n't disappointed
1,i 've been a fan of the comic book,i think it 's a bit too long
1,some people may be offended by this show,some of the scenes with a man being shot
1,sylar is the first film that i saw from the theater in my childhood,sylar is one of the funniest comedies ever made and the only real reason i
1,shady to the extreme and the audience is treated to an underdeveloped ending,shady characters and a story of the nature of the war in the west
1,wilde and his friends try to get the truth of a life that 's not as good as the one that they,wilde 's performance is quite well done and the movie is a great example of how to do a good thriller
1,like many of the reviewers i have seen the show and the series of episodes,like a little kid i was n't even able to relate to the characters
1,when she returns home to her exhusband 's family,when the movie started it was very boring
1,use of a camera lens is to convey the camera,use that to be the best movie ever made
1,this film is not about how the,this is a very good movie
1,leonardo dicaprio gives us a bit of a,leonardo dicaprio 's character is a stereotype
1,thanks to that the movie was made for television,thanks to the fine cast and a great cast
1,a great movie to watch and enjoy,a good idea and a great movie
1,given the cast of the film they did n't have to go into it,given the choice of actors involved in this film the acting is excellent the direction
1,the story itself is a bit contrived at times but overall the movie really makes it worth a look,the film opens with a very long prologue where two of the kids are celebrating and the two are reunited
1,bringing it out in a way that will make your head hurt,bringing back the movie is not even close to what it 's supposed
1,allen 's direction is a very poor imitation but not enough of the actors' own life,allen is a very good actor but his role is very well done in a very convincing
1,sure he was n't the only good actor in this movie and the only real character in the movie is the,sure there are some good moments but i do n't think it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
1,there 's the scene in which the girl goes through the roof to get a bit more screen time in the final reel but the rest,there were also a couple of scenes where the characters seemed to be a bit awkward and the plot line seemed very contrived and contrived
1,this movie is so bad that i actually cringed my pants,this is one that you 'll want to miss twice as well
1,i think he was a great actor and i really loved that he was very convincing in this one,i have n't seen it since the first time i watched it so i can say it is a good
1,this film was just plain bad,this movie was so bad i almost
1,anyway i have to say that it is,anyway it is a very nice movie
1,i was very impressed and i would love to,i was n't surprised to see this movie
1,it 's just a good show and a nice change from the usual columbo fare,it 's an odd idea for a story and a story line and an excellent story
1,we do n't get the sense that the director,we 're not going to forget the name
1,perkins and matthau are a perfect pair of performers,perkins 's performance is not as good as it sounds
1,it 's a shame because it was a good movie,it 's not a bad movie at all but it just
1,this was a pretty good film,this is a great movie for those
1,peck is the perfect actor for whom it is not his fault that his father is a,peck is a very good actor but the script is terrible and not even worth mentioning
1,i would recommend this film to any fan of the genre,i was really excited to know this movie would be a good
1,the only thing that was funny was that the characters were n't really developed to make them all believable,the film is set to make a film about the lives of the people who killed the man and the
1,i think that it should be a lot,i am not a fan of movies
1,here the film is an extended version,here it was an action movie
1,shu qi is the only reason the show is so great,shu qi and her two pals who have the same problems and
1,i was expecting to enjoy the movie but i was not disappointed,i have n't watched it many many times and it 's hard to
1,granted there was a lot of good,granted this was an excellent episode
1,also the film is not about the battle between a young,also the film is a total downer to sit through
1,ok i have to admit there was a lot of potential for this film,ok so i do n't care if it is a movie or two but i
1,did i have a chance to see this movie at least twice a week,did the filmmakers not know what to do with their film or the film 's
1,mr blandings does a good job of directing,mr bean is a good actor and he 's
1,now i have the opportunity to see this,now i'm not gonna get that one
1,sooner than the movie itself is in a nutshell,sooner than the usual fare this is a film that
1,the movie is a little long but it is n't,the story is simple as it progresses and has a great
1,anthony perkins is the perfect choice for this type of comedy,anthony is a young guy who 's been diagnosed with his wife
1,there is also a bit of nudity in this movie,there is a scene of an elevator with a huge rock
1,the film is a complete waste of your time,the plot is very interesting but it is too late
1,but i do n't want to give away too much,but the rest of this story is very weak
1,i was expecting something like a cross between the original and the original,i would n't even have bothered to watch a movie about a serial killer
1,i have been watching many of my favorite movies lately and,i would n't even say it is a good thing
1,maybe it was the director 's fault but it was n't that funny,maybe it was that bad or bad or the acting was just plain awful
1,so why would he want to go out with such a,so why did they have to make this a movie
1,it 's a pity the filmmakers never managed to get to a,it 's like that the film takes a turn for more
1,warning spoilers this has got to be the dumbest most boring movie i 've ever,warning to the film makers it 's a good movie for a rainy day
1,one of them has an affinity with a child he met in the past,one day he 's in prison he has a chance to go to the city
1,and i have n't seen a bad movie that has a similar theme that i did n't understand,and the fact that it does n't have to be seen as a good idea to be the worst
1,i was expecting a little more from this movie and it did get a little too old,i 've seen this show many times and it 's not a complete lack of commitment
1,it 's a pity to see that many movies have made,it 's an odd little film and it 's not
1,i do n't know what the real purpose to the film was but what it is is about a woman,i am glad i did not give this film a 2 because it 's a bit over the top
1,dev 's story is about a young boy who is born in a very,dev is a young man who is not a master of the city
1,the script was pretty good and i could,the acting is n't all that bad
1,i do n't think i 've ever been able to see the,i think that it was a very good movie to see
1,west 's eleven is a movie with a capital c,west is an interesting film and is a must see
1,these two characters make it hard to care,these two films are just the same
1,i think it should be a good movie to watch,i 've seen it three times now and now it is
1,grimly stimulating as it is a film with all,grimly inaccurate in terms of acting and acting
1,they have no clue of whether the real person is the ones,they are all pretty funny and it 's all very funny
1,but that is not saying much,but i did not think this was
1,how could this be a good film,how many movies can this be
1,he is n't even the good guy,he plays a good guy in a small
1,but the rest of the movie was really bad,but this one is just not worth the time and
1,one of the best parts of the movie was the music,one scene that really shows me how to tell us that it
1,when i read the comments i have to disagree with the comment that it 's a bit of a bad movie but it was a lot better,when he is asked to go for a new life in the country they are both physically depressed in his attempts to get rid of him
1,shannen ullmann plays the mother of an eminent and wealthy woman who has a crush,shannen is the daughter who has been kidnapped and abused in the first place
1,the only real surprise was the character played by a few other great actors,the story is simple and very predictable in the beginning the ending makes me think
1,the plot is about a man trying to get back to her past to regain money and her life,the acting is horrible but the script and direction are so bad that you ca n't even get away
1,the film opens with two very strong characters that are very well developed but not very well,the script was horrible the characters were uninteresting the plot was boring the dialog were terrible
1,here is a good movie and it does,here she is a young woman who wants to
1,it 's a pity the movie is a bit too long for its own good or is not that great,it has the potential to be a good movie and it is not a film implemented as a comedy it is
1,from the start of that point i was,from there it 's a little slow
1,especially when they do n't really do that,especially the one in this movie where the girl
1,this film is an insult to the intelligence and,this is one movie that makes me angry
1,and the fact that i was n't a fan of the film was also quite,and that does n't mean that they 're making a movie like this one
1,it seems to be the director 's intent that the director,it 's not that it was n't a great film
1,there are also several other examples in the movie that were made out of a,there are so many things wrong with the movie the script and the acting
1,the first movie i was left thinking,the movie is a complete mess
1,there 's a reason for me that a lot of the other actors are not in this film,there 's no real reason why this movie has to be released theatrically or even if it 's not
1,leslie caron is the most annoying character in the movie the plot is ridiculous and the characters are all cardboard cutouts of this film,leslie vernon is a pretty bad man but he 's a bad guy in fact the film 's plot has a few twists and turns
1,i do n't think it 's a great film,i have never seen such a terrible movie
1,it 's a good family film that should be seen by everyone interested in,it 's not a bad movie but it has a few redeeming qualities
1,you know it 's a comedy,you 'll see how this film was
1,as i said the plot has been written in an earlier movie,as a result the plot is very simple and there really is n't
1,but if you 're looking for a,but it 's not so great
1,well worth seeing just to see if it can be a good,well you ca n't help but laugh when the movie starts
1,timothy spall as the chief cop and the rest,timothy dalton is also excellent in the part
1,rather than the usual suspects they are the first two characters,rather than having sex with a woman he tries to find a
1,this movie is the kind of movie that you,this movie does not make any sense whatsoever
1,the movie has a nice little twist about it that makes it,the story is very simple and the acting is very good
1,this film could be a lot better if,this is an excellent and funny movie
1,the plot is simple and very funny,the movie is about a group of friends
1,jeff goldblum has always been in a,jeff fahey is good as always
1,still a good movie with a good story line and,still it 's just a good movie to watch
1,i saw it in the us,i was surprised at this movie
1,she 's not just a young man who is a,she 's a very good actress in all movies
1,the acting was bad and the story line,the film is a very long journey to the
1,it seems to be a little bit to the,it 's just so bad it 's good'
1,the only redeeming feature of this game is the,the film is an excellent piece of work
1,the film 's main weakness is that the film is n't really a masterpiece and,the film starts out as a drama to the film as the action unfolds
1,the only problem is that there are a few scenes of the movie,the acting is superb and the story line is very well done
1,well this movie has a lot of potential and i can only,well the movie was n't as good as the first film
1,director john hughes is an expert filmmaker who is a master of a genre,director and writer stephen j r lewis jr and writer james wong howe 's novel
1,this movie is not a good one,this film is not a great movie
1,yes the film was a little slow but the story line of the movie was very entertaining and well done,yes they were in fact a couple of friends and a little girl who was the only one in the house
1,disapprove of the story is the acting the acting the direction the direction,disapprove of it 's own problems it 's a film that you 'll enjoy
1,that is the only thing i do n't like about the,that the movie has a little more of a plot
1,you 'll probably find a lot of funny situations in the film,you know it 's the last line you know of the film but
1,in the end there 's something about the whole ordeal of a woman who has to be the daughter of one of the girls,in my opinion it is an entertaining film to watch with its commentary on how the people in the industry can get their head on
1,with the exception of the director and writer and the cast in their respective ways this would,with the title song sung by a group that 's a giant head of the sun
1,all in all the movie is a bit slow at times,all the elements of the movie are there in a way that
1,i would n't be surprised if i had a choice in my life,i was really surprised by the ending and the way they are
1,stolen from an early sound film it has a good script and a good cast,stolen from other reviews i have to say it was a great movie to watch
1,he has a lot of talent in it,he is a very good character actor
1,as for the film it 's not even worth it 's reputation but it 's still,as far as i know there 's something about mary 's character in this movie
1,the movie starts out pretty good,the movie is n't as good as
1,but it is so much better,but the movie was so bad that
1,malone is one of my favorite actors,malone is a great actor and his wife
1,in my opinion this is an excellent,in fact it was very disappointing
1,in my opinion the best part of the,in fact there were some good scenes
1,and the whole thing was just plain stupid,and it is the same way that we have
1,slowly it goes into an interesting story,slowly he becomes an angry man
1,when i first viewed this movie i thought that it was an incredibly bad movie,when they finally arrive in the woods there is a little bit more of the plot
1,that 's what the fans want,that is what the movie is about
1,just as you would n't have had to see it to be made for a good film with a cast of,just when i think this movie has been a little too much for me it is n't even a comedy
1,camera work is excellent and there are some,camera work is not always the best
1,and the ending of this movie was so predictable,and the whole thing is just a mess
1,he has been in love with the man he has been waiting,he was a great actor and a real joy to watch
1,because of a very poor script i have to say that this was a,because of his talent he also had a great job in the end
1,at the end of the movie i thought the whole thing was a complete waste of a good idea and a good,at the time i had to sit through a film i would have to say i did not have any expectation
1,so the movie was a good film but it is so bad that its almost impossible to make out,so much of it has a few of the elements that i liked most of it is that the characters
1,the film is about a group of people trying to get married for a weekend club in a country,the movie is a little too long for a long time and the ending is a little unsatisfying
1,ideally it was a very enjoyable movie with some good actors and great actors,ideally the film has an eerie tone that the filmmakers have managed to make and
1,the film 's story is not a bad one and i would n't have had to,the movie is n't really a horror film but it is n't really a comedy
1,rachel mcadams is a fine actress but she is not given the right recognition,rachel mcadams plays the role of her mother as the mother 's mother and daughter
1,the story itself is so thin it is almost impossible to make it through the whole film,the movie 's premise is the story of a girl who is trying to find a woman from
1,it 's a shame because the movie is pretty much,it is the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,but the film has a lot to do with the characters in a different way,but i did not think this was a good movie because it was so bad that
1,not to mention that this is one of those films that you,not even the great sammy davis jr could save this movie
1,1010 the film opens with two men walking in a bar,1010 ps it 's not a bad film at all
1,as a result the film was n't really that bad but the acting was n't bad either,as an adult i could n't resist my own feelings for the movie but it is very much
1,he 's a little suspicious in his own ways as the,he is one of the greatest actors of all time
1,in this case a man who is n't afraid of his wife,in this movie the story revolves around a woman who becomes a prostitute
1,angels have a lot of screen time,angels are n't the only ones who are
1,i do n't know why the hell is so good,i have seen this movie and i still do n't know
1,every character in this film is just plain stupid,every time you see the action you 'll get a
1,get a few people who like the,get it out of your head
1,throw the crap out of the window and you 've got,throw on a couple of things to make you laugh
1,if you 're looking to see a good thriller then go and see it,if you 're a big fan of the genre and you have the patience to
1,you have to see this to find out why the director and director decided,you will not be disappointed with what 's the greatest of the series
1,theodore rex is one of the best and most underrated movies i 've ever seen,theodore rex and his crew play well with the film and they 're all excellent
1,even the actors who were in this movie were pretty good,even the acting sucks and the script is not funny
1,from there the story begins to develop a new life,from the opening shot of the film and the climatic confrontation
1,i'm sure that there are people who have not seen this movie yet,i'm sure that the director had to have a lot of fun making this
1,this movie is a waste of time and money it is not worth watching,this movie is about a group of young adults who have an affair
1,i would not recommend this film,i would have loved this show
1,i do not understand what the point of this project is that the acting is terrible the plot is awful and the,i do n't care for all involved in this film i do n't think it could have been so much better
1,one of the worst movies i 've ever seen,one of the worst films i ever saw
1,roles of a group of kids and a group of friends with a bunch of friends who,roles like the one in the film are a few of the actors in this movie
1,despite its shortcomings the film is a total bore,despite all its flaws this film does not have to
1,when they are talking about each other the same is also said about the movie and it is true,when you see this show i think it 's a shame that it 's not even as good as the
1,and what is worse than that,and the acting is so over the
1,it is one of the worst films i 've ever seen,it is one of the few movies where a lot of people
1,the movie is a great film with a good story and great performances by both goldblum and jolie are superb,the movie starts out with the main characters being stalked by their classmates and then they are killed off by an
1,then the movie started to drag,then there 's the fact that it
1,i do n't even know if it 's the best,i would love to see more of these two
1,some parts are a bit contrived but i guess i was n't going to get to see the movie,some say that he 's been involved with the other people on here but they do n't have to be
1,this is a really good movie,this is the worst movie i have
1,i do n't know where to begin,i would n't recommend this movie
1,this is a really awful movie,this movie is a must see
1,during the first half of the movie it is obvious that the actors from the film are amateurs in their own right,during the movie 's running time the film is about the struggle between two characters and their relationship to the extent that we
1,neal scheider has the best lines in the movie,neal mcdonough was a real treat to this movie and
1,i think that this film is just a little bit too,i was a teenager in school when she saw it
1,brian depalma 's score is the best part of the film,brian de palma 's direction is a very good touch
1,its a very very good and funny film,its also very interesting to see the first one
1,although the film itself is very dated the film is still a very,although the film is not a masterpiece it does have its moments
1,as for the movie you can see it coming from a mile,as for the acting it does have its moments but that 's what
1,from what i 've read in the past paragraph i was surprised that this film,from the start i found myself wondering what was the casting for the actors
1,if the movie had a good plot line it could have been good but not,if you want to see the first movie you have to watch this film
1,although the plot is a little confusing there is a lot of action,although there is plenty of action the film is a little slow
1,also starring the great donald moffat as a man who is a bit too old for this,also it 's not very interesting but at least that 's what it appears to be
1,the story is simple enough but it does n't have any real depth to it either,the only thing that kept me awake is the fact that i did n't like it
1,a young man 's mother comes to the aid of,a few scenes with a little bit of nudity
1,for the first time i saw it and i must admit i had to wait till the end,for instance the opening scene is one of the most memorable sequences in the whole history of the movie
1,i do think the whole thing is a little too long for a horror film but the,i was very surprised to learn that the film was not a complete waste of time
1,the film is a bit boring but the story line is very well developed,the acting is good the plot is interesting and the actors are wonderful
1,she 's not a good person,she has a few funny lines
1,the story is n't that great but i think the actors are very good and the story is good,the plot is simple but the story is so predictable you 'll never get it out of your mind for
1,the script is a little confusing but it is n't the best movie,the film is about three people trying to get a divorce together
1,everything is perfect and is so bad and you wonder whether,everything about the acting and special effects were very good
1,for those with only a taste in mind i have to say that this is a very poor film,for instance in one episode the two are in the water and then we 're talking about the show and
1,douglas fairbanks jr is a great actor in a,douglas fairbanks is one of my favorite actors
1,there is no need to make a documentary with a,there really is n't a lot in this movie
1,gorgeous women and a good deal of,gorgeous women in black and white
1,in one scene he has no idea about his life in the world and the fact that he is not just,in a way you have to see a few of the actors and actresses in it that you will enjoy
1,but there is no real plot here and there,but the movie 's main flaw is that the story
1,everybody is entitled to a very strange,everybody else was in this turkey
1,i have n't seen this movie so many times but i was impressed by it i was so glad i did,i do n't think that 's why the movie is so good but i would say if i was n't so bored
1,scott bakula is the only reason that i do n't,scott baio does an excellent turn as the villain
1,we do n't know where it all begins in,we 're not told why the characters are all that
1,by the end the movie is a bit too long but,by all means do n't waste your time on this
1,only a few of the actors have a certain degree of humor,only the most superficial of this movie would be in the book
1,i do n't think this film was a good idea to,i do agree with the other reviewer about the film
1,american graffiti does n't make for an appealing movie and is one of the best,american graffiti is one of my favorite shows in all of the series but it was
1,the film is a complete mess of the first film,the movie is not about the war of the united states
1,from the start you have to be kidding me to the end,from the first time they encounter the woman she has to go on
1,he does a good job with the character of the mother of the father,he has no idea what it 's like to have a good time
1,this time the movie 's premise of,this is a very good movie
1,i would like to see the movie,i think that the acting is great the
1,the story and dialogue are all very good especially,the script is a complete waste of time
1,the story line in general was quite original,the first thing that i have to do is
1,after all this is a very entertaining film,after all it has the same kind of ending
1,the movie is a bit slow but the characters,the plot of the film is the story
1,the film has the feel of a madefortv movie,the first half of this movie is a masterpiece and
1,the acting and directing and directing was superb,the movie is also very entertaining to watch if
1,it was not that good either,it 's just the opposite of a
1,james garner has a great talent as well,james caan is excellent in this role
1,the film was also directed by steven soderbergh who has been involved in numerous other films and this film is one,the only good thing i can say about this is that i do n't want to give away the ending of the
1,then there is the scene that is the only thing that keeps me watching,then the film cuts back to the present in the last five minutes
1,the movie has a good plot good acting and great music,the acting is very good and the plot is very interesting
1,though he is a little stiff it 's still a shame because the movie is not as good as the others but,though i do not think that this is the worst movie i have ever seen it 's a very good movie
1,however if you 're looking for something that is not bad enough to be entertaining you 'll,however in this case the main character and the woman is so boring it is unbelievable
1,his character is the only thing he has in the first half of that movie,his character is a stereotype to me and the director has no idea what to do
1,while he is a little old in the end she does n't have much in the way of character interaction,while he is not in his place the film does a good job of capturing a very complex subject that is
1,despite his presence and her acting skills i found the film to have been,despite that there are many moments that are just a bit too long
1,three years later he was arrested and murdered the family,three men and a woman fall down a mountain river with
1,its a good thing to watch but you know the rest,its not a bad film but it is definitely the best i
1,i have seen it several times and still have to wonder if it has,i do n't know how to describe a movie but this one does
1,i have seen some pretty bad stuff but this,i was n't impressed in this movie either
1,today a film which is not only for children of all ages should not be a waste,today 's movie industry has been used to make a film that is a real treat
1,and then we see a young boy,and that 's what i thought
1,rampling 's character has a lot of time with the story but she 's still a great character,rampling was the one who seemed to be a lot of the character and was n't even the character
1,nevertheless the script is so awful that it is impossible to understand the acting,nevertheless the plot seems very contrived and it seems to have been thrown in there
1,people who are n't like people like me should,people are either mentally frustrated or mentally ill
1,no one should really be a fan of this movie and that 's the problem,no matter how hard you try to get to see the movie you will find yourself
1,so the movie is just a cheap action movie with a couple of plot twists thrown together in a few minutes,so many times i have n't seen the original version and i do not have a clue if it 's the best
1,the acting was terrible and the story line was horrible,the acting was pretty decent for the most part
1,many people have claimed that this show was made to entertain,many movies have been made and i 've seen them all
1,tedious and dull and a waste of time it 's almost impossible,tedious is the only word that i would describe this movie
1,yes the movie is not so bad,yes i do n't understand why it was
1,this is a great film and i recommend it to anyone who loves action and suspense,this movie is about a woman who is a witch who has her father to be a
1,i do n't know why this film did n't work on the big screen in,i think it was a great choice to play a movie in the past
1,i have no idea what the movie is about,i would like the movie to be released on the
1,holbrook plays a reporter who goes on a rampage to find an antidote to a local serial killer who 's been in,holbrook has a very nice body that he can use but his accent is so bad that it 's almost funny
1,1010 the first half of the movie are just the two,1010 the first one i thought it was great because the acting
1,owner of the united states is a great film for all ages and for fans of the series,owner of a small town called el diablo is a great movie for those who want to see the
1,alok nath as always is excellent as,alok nath is a great actress
1,he is n't a bad director,he does a pretty good job of
1,but then i have to say that i am a fan of the book and this is one of the,but i do n't want to spoil my own problems by the fact that it 's a great movie
1,unfortunate that this is the only reason why this film is so bad,unfortunate but this one has the potential to be a good horror movie
1,the only thing i liked about this movie was the,the story is so bad that it becomes laughable
1,obviously the writers were trying to create a,obviously the movie did n't make sense
1,probably the greatest scene of a film that i have ever,probably the worst film to ever win an academy award
1,in fact this is a pretty good film,in this case the film is very funny and
1,it 's a shame that it never gets released but it,it 's all the more shocking for the whole movie
1,your typical horror flick has a little bit of action and the gore is,your friends would be happy but this is what makes this film great
1,i have to admit that if i did n't have a movie i 'd probably watch it,i would love to know how the movie got out of the blue and how did the director
1,damon 's character was a total wimp who was a,damon 's character was the same as the one
1,my favorite line is when he tells him that it should have,my wife and i saw this at the sundance film festival
1,godzilla has a very creepy and sinister look at the,godzilla has a similar face that i have seen
1,i saw this at a sneak preview in the theater and i was shocked to learn that i did n't find it funny,i think this movie was made for television but it is a very good film that 's worth a look at the film 's
1,i am sure this is n't an attempt to be objective and i can imagine the audience as being a bit more interested in seeing,i have seen many other films in my own life and i think it 's the most boring but it is definitely the best
1,it was a great movie for everyone involved in the,it has a couple of funny moments in it
1,finally the director and his friend have a,finally it was n't even that good
1,mike is a bit of a jerk and the rest of,mike myers does a great job playing an undercover cop
1,the plot of the original is the usual formula of the main character,the film is very funny at times but it does n't work
1,when the film begins it is a good film to watch and it is worth watching,when i heard the film was on and on the cover i had to be surprised that
1,most importantly the movie 's climax is quite predictable,most importantly the film is a complete mess of a
1,so i was expecting that this was,so what was that all about
1,the film is n't bad at first but it 's a good film and it 's definitely a movie,the movie is n't bad but it 's not the least bit of a stretch to the film
1,emanuelle is a film that makes it all very difficult to,emanuelle is a very likable young woman who loves her
1,this is one of my favorite films in,this is the worst film out there
1,in the end the film is a total waste of time and money,in this case i think it was just too good to be a good
1,the plot is a joke that is n't funny,the only redeeming factor of this movie was the acting
1,just the way you are in the book is a great one,just like that of the movie this movie was just a bit of
1,when i first viewed this film the movie was on and it was the worst i have ever had the misfortune,when the first scene in the movie was so incredibly boring it was painful for the viewer to laugh at
1,the film also shows that a woman who had no problems in life can be a bit of an accident,the movie is about a bunch of young kids who decide to go back home and try to find a new
1,the film was a little slow in parts but it is a great movie,the film 's climax is the most powerful and most unsettling scene in the history
1,the first half of the film takes off at the climax and the,the movie does n't get the point of being a good movie
1,i'm a bit prejudiced when this show premiered,i'm glad i saw it on tv
1,rene zellweger is the only character who does n't seem to fit in,rene de vivre and her friends are the only ones in the world who
1,comic relief was the first time i saw him perform with,comic timing is also the main focus for the film
1,the movie is a total mess of a film,the film also features a couple of very interesting moments
1,he 's also an expert of his life,he 's just so funny and funny
1,so i guess that 's why,so many of these people do not
1,the first half of it was a complete waste of time and i am glad i did n't pay,the plot is about a girl in the middle who is pregnant with her son and is killed
1,the acting is good and the story line is good,the story of two young men who fall in love with
1,the acting was bad and the story,the movie is a good movie
1,another thing i did n't think was the fact that the film was a total waste of time,another thing that i found funny is when it was shown in this series and was a little more
1,i was surprised by the fact that the story,i am glad they got out the trouble
1,and it was also an attempt to recreate the,and that 's the only way it 's
1,just a few months ago i was n't disappointed by the fact,just like most other movies this is n't one of them
1,also i do not believe that the director was the director 's first film,also it 's not a great film as well as it is but it 's
1,12 years later the movie 's title character has been played by a young man and his wife,12 out of 10 and i will not spoil the plot for the rest of my life
1,it was n't that the first time we got a chance to watch this movie,it is a shame to see a film with a little of a budget that is
1,especially the scene when the woman is walking through a table and is chased,especially the scene where the kids are walking in front of a car
1,all in all a must see,all in all a pretty decent movie
1,but the best thing in this movie is a bunch of the most,but then you get the impression that it 's a bad film
1,notice the movie is a masterpiece,notice that the film is not only
1,the movie is not a bad thing,the film does n't seem to have the
1,must have been a huge success for this one but there,must you have a lot of fun with the movie
1,oh my god i was a kid,oh yeah and there are plenty of people
1,putting the two together to make a coherent story,putting in a performance by christopher walken as a cop
1,i'm a fan of his films but i have n't seen the other,i'm not one to say the least bit about a film that is so
1,it 's a real pleasure to see a good film,it has the same story as you can expect
1,although i have a soft spot for the characters they are very well acted,although a few of the scenes were cut i found myself laughing out loud with
1,this is the worst thing i have,this film is a must see
1,overall it was a pretty good movie,overall i do n't understand why
1,i think it 's an important role,i was so impressed with what i had
1,the first half hour of a film is a little slow and boring in,the first time i watched this movie was on the tv channel channel
1,the first movie was a little slow but in my view a very entertaining movie that,the acting is so bad i have to confess that there were no redeeming qualities
1,the film is about a family of the two sisters who go to the beach,the story is very simple but the characters are not developed by the story
1,but the fact remains that there is a lot of potential to have made,but there is no denying that this movie is not a good one
1,he is so funny in his role that he is so funny and so funny that it was painful to,he 's a good guy who is n't afraid to kill people or something but they 're not funny
1,i was really impressed with the story and the characters,i 've seen it several times and will never tire of
1,on the other hand the film is a complete bore as a whole and it is,on the other hand i do find myself laughing about what happened in real life
1,the film was made for tv and the film itself is not as polished as it should have been,the only reason this film got so close to the box office was because it is a remake of a
1,also the fact that the movie was shot in a black and white and very short way is,also the film is a very moving film with the usual suspects and a very good ending
1,just as good is the way it was written,just like i have n't read the novel
1,the first is that it is n't even funny,the first half was pretty decent and i did enjoy
1,but the story is a little confusing to watch and is quite predictable at times,but there 's a lot of action and a couple of scenes with the main female
1,it 's the story of a young woman who is a bit of a geena davis and her life,it is also one of those rare films that makes you want to go back and see if you want
1,this film is a must see for,this is a very bad movie
1,they 're all very good and very very,they were all good actors and actresses
1,after seeing the movie for the first time i have never heard of it,after watching this i was surprised by the fact that the movie is so terrible
1,this movie is not the worst movie that i 've ever seen,this was the first of the two films that i saw in the
1,do n't get me wrong there were n't many things that were good but the acting was so terrible that i felt embarrassed that,do n't be fooled if it were n't for the fact that it had the look of an oscar winner for the movie
1,try and do not see this movie,try to do something different and you 'll
1,now i have to say that i,now the story has been changed
1,i have n't even heard of it,i think that the movie is a bit
1,i 've never seen another film that i had watched from this point,i have a soft spot for the movie that has been done
1,the film is a good example of what 's going on in this movie,the acting is terrible the script is poor and it 's not funny at all
1,we know he is n't a bad guy he is the killer,we get to see a few people running through the woods
1,no matter how hard he try to be a,no wonder it 's just not a comedy
1,this film is one of the funniest i 've seen in a long time,this film was a huge disappointment and the only thing that made a good movie
1,as a whole i am amazed that this film was so popular in hollywood,as i mentioned above i have to mention that the acting is good
1,predictable plot twists and turns that are not to a,predictable and dull and i did get a headache
1,if you like good movies you 'll probably like this one,if they did n't make a movie that 's good enough to
1,if you have not seen it do so but if you have seen a few films of this genre you can see,if i could find the dvd on this disc or dvd i might have been the one with my own eyes
1,seeing this film i thought that it would be a decent idea for a sequel,seeing a woman who can act like a child in her early twenties is a nice
1,but i do n't remember the title of this,but it 's not even a good movie
1,stupid and boring but the story is so predictable it 's unbelievable,stupid is a movie that you should see in any of those categories
1,the film is not only boring the acting is horrible and the acting is just awful,the film is about a young woman who lives in the city with her husband and mother
1,first the characters in the movie are very different from the first one,first of all the story revolves around two young men who are married to
1,i have n't even seen any of the other comments on this film,i am sure that he will get a lot more screen time
1,i 've seen a lot of people talking about the lack of imagination in this film but i did n't know it at all,i was a little surprised that i did n't get the dvd and the cover cover was not a bit different from the first movie
1,there 's a good deal of humor and some really cool scenes that keep you watching until the,there is a bit of blood in it that makes you want to vomit and then laugh
1,it 's not all a comedy and is not even funny,it would have been a much better choice if they have n't
1,one day she meets and falls in love with a beautiful woman and falls in love with him,one of the most underrated movies ever made and i think the film is n't a total rip off
1,meanwhile a bunch of friends get killed,meanwhile a bunch of people find their jobs
1,ever since he made a name like that and it is a great actor,ever since this movie is the only film i 've seen that is so bad
1,my only regret for this film is the fact that it did n't,my only complaint is that it has no plot and no tension
1,i 've always thought that the film was great the best thing that,i have n't laughed so hard since the beginning of this movie
1,but this time it 's not,but the film 's biggest flaw is
1,definitely the worst movie i 've ever seen,definitely one of the best movies i have seen
1,i do n't think it 's the greatest,i have to say the movie sucked
1,the movie is not for everyone who does n't like to be scared by this movie,the story is about four friends trying to find the missing child and to live with them
1,pretty much a story of a young man who is a woman who is,pretty much a bunch of people who have no idea about their relationship
1,i am not a fan of the movies,i saw a few films in the past and
1,i'm glad you could n't find a good,i'm not even sure what to expect
1,there were so many great films made in the 1930s and 70s,there is a scene where they have been on a train for a
1,there 's an attempt to be a sequel to a classic film that i think that this was a,there are two things that are so bad they 're good but they just do n't make sense
1,i am not going to go to the movies that this movie is n't but the story was a,i saw some of the other reviews on this forum that i had n't heard of this film
1,i do n't think this movie could have been done as,i was really disappointed when the first episode was canceled
1,well the first movie in my opinion was a lot of fun,well the story is pretty good and the story line is interesting
1,at least it would have a much more enjoyable ending,at times the film does n't have a lot of violence
1,but then the film goes downhill,but this one is n't a complete
1,the acting was good but the acting was so horrible it was,the story is simple and it is easy to follow it
1,an interesting premise to the film is that it is not as,an example is the way the character 's motivations are presented
1,giant chicken is the worst show of the series,giant robot is a pretty good film and i think
1,this movie was a waste of my time,this movie was a very good film
1,ostensibly he 's a very good actor,ostensibly the movie is a waste of time
1,as the first half of this film was n't a,as i said it was a waste of time
1,the story and characters do not make much sense at all,the plot is so simple it 's a mess and not a
1,is there a plot in a nutshell,is this a good film or a good
1,another reason why this movie sucks,another problem in my opinion is that
1,i have seen a lot of movies and i have not seen the first film i have,i was expecting a lot of the movie but i had never heard of that one
1,i 've never seen a movie before but that,i do n't know whether it should end
1,he is a good actor but the rest of the cast is just not very good,he 's an actor that makes a great villain and he gets involved in a pretty well
1,and that is the only reason why i did n't give it an extra,and the film is very much in love with the other two movies
1,but if you like the book you have not seen this film yet,but the movie has some good moments and a lot of fun
1,jd is a little too much and it does n't seem very realistic,jd is a young man living in a large mansion in america
1,this is a very good film that i highly recommend,this movie is one of the most disturbing things in my
1,hillary swank and john mctiernan are great in their roles,hillary jovovich and michael dudikoff are the only two good actors
1,this is a good movie and worth watching,this is a film that has the capacity to
1,roger kelly has the same role and the same cast in the show has no chemistry and it 's a bit odd to see,roger is a young woman and the mother is the daughter of a rich man who is a bit of a social worker
1,although i am not a fan of the original series i think this film is very,although it does get a bit repetitive the overall effect is not very well done
1,this film is the first of its kind to be a comedy about a serial killer who was sent to prison for a,this is the best movie about a group of teenagers that are n't afraid to spend money with a group of kids
1,the first part of the film was so boring that i could n't figure,the acting is pretty poor but there 's nothing to redeem this film
1,one of the best parts of the movie is,one thing that is missing is the acting
1,tomorrow and i was surprised to find that this film is an excellent example of that,tomorrow and i was in a state of awe for the time when i was a young
1,this movie is a very funny and funny comedy,this was the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,it 's the best of the series,it 's just so bad and that i
1,it 's an odd film to say the least and it 's a pity,it 's not as though it was n't a big budget production but an enjoyable
1,some of the other scenes are so boring that you ca,some of the scenes in this show seemed very contrived
1,he 's got a few seconds in the end that he is not a great actor but i did n't care for,he 's an amazing actor and he plays a very straight man but his acting skills are n't too bad either
1,only one man who had to do was the one,only the film is n't a very bad movie
1,this is what happens to the characters of the first film and this,this was one of the worst movies in my opinion ever made
1,ok so it was not a very good,ok let 's say it 's good
1,this is a good movie for anyone who is a fan of the book,this was one of the most original and enjoyable movies i 've ever seen
1,big brother is a good film for those who think it deserves the credit,big budget is the kind of thing that makes movies like the big studios and
1,most of these are not funny and they were both funny and the whole family thing was,most of the film is shot with an exterior shot of a small town 's home
1,it also had an interesting plot line and,it 's not a bad movie either
1,ito also had a lot to talk about,ito 's acting is not the best
1,when the movie ends you can see how it will end in an eternity,when they do they have no real reason to go in the woods
1,the only reason i can watch this movie was because of the acting of the two,the movie is about the life of a young boy with his family and friends
1,what the heck was this movie,what is this with the other actors
1,by this time the audience was not impressed,by the end of the film the movie has
1,i have seen a lot of movies and this one is a waste of time to see,i have seen it twice and have to admit that it was a very enjoyable movie that i
1,but if you 're an ardent fan of the original then you should definitely watch the movie,but the real thing i have to say is that it is a very funny film
1,i have n't seen it before but the original and my,i 've seen some really bad movies in my time
1,and what does it 's shortcomings do with the original and the original,and there are a lot of things to like about this film
1,you 'll see a lot of the same things happening in this movie,you 'll see a lot of these people who have n't been in a
1,why is this the only way to get out of it,why did it have to be one of the most beautiful of
1,guy pearce and the guy from the original film are a great choice for this,guy ritchie is n't the greatest actor of course and he does n't seem to be
1,it has to be the only saving,it is a very bad movie
1,there are some good parts to be found in the,there is n't an entire clich' of this film
1,in one of his earliest scenes the camera is in a room,in my mind this movie is so bad that it 's not even
1,feast of blood and blood is a film that,feast on the other is a wonderful film
1,sheffer is the only character that is really good and that,sheffer 's performance is the worst of all the movie
1,this is the first time we see that the movie is about as good as,this film is the most disturbing movie i 've ever seen in my life
1,from there they are just plain annoying,from then on it goes to another ridiculous
1,there was no need to use the word to describe this,there is nothing in this movie that makes me feel that any
1,the film has a very strong and very interesting feel to it,the acting is horrible the script is poor and the characters are just
1,too bad the story is n't a complete mess but the film,too bad it was not a movie about the real world
1,they all seem to have lost their ability to make the most serious,they do n't have any idea to have a movie like this
1,maybe that 's why the movie is so,maybe the film is n't that bad
1,the story is not bad enough,the film has some good points in
1,but i guess it does n't make,but it 's a great movie
1,oh yeah so i 'll be a little surprised that the story does n't seem to have any,oh dear the whole thing was shot in a cheap video camera which was obviously a joke
1,i do n't think i have ever seen the,i have a problem with the plot line
1,i was n't sure why this was so funny,i have to say i am very disappointed
1,even though the film is set in the present day the action is very different,even the actors and director of this film should 've made a movie about the evils
1,where did the cop come from,where is the plot and the script
1,the film is a complete failure,the first half of the picture is
1,from start to finish i felt like i had a good time watching it,from the beginning i could n't believe that it was so difficult to watch
1,from the very beginning there were several twists to the movie i had to keep watching,from the moment the movie starts the movie becomes a little too long to be interesting
1,everything in the film is a joke,everything about this movie is awful and pointless
1,it 's a very bad movie,it 's the story of a young
1,this is a really great documentary that 's just as entertaining and memorable as i 've seen in,this is a very bad movie with a very good cast and a very believable story line
1,there is a very interesting and original score by john cusack,there are some funny moments such as the scene where the two
1,they do n't have to be the worst movie ever to come out,they 're all very interesting and believable and have the power to be true
1,they have no choice but to make the film better,they were all the characters and the actors did n't have
1,franco 's acting as a young man who can be found by a man is a very funny scene in which the main character 's daughter,franco nero and his wife were the only two films i saw in the cinema that i saw as the worst film i 've seen
1,it 's a very good movie,it has a great deal of suspense
1,but then it 's not that bad,but i would n't even bother with that
1,to sum it up it 's a great movie,to my surprise the director is so much fun to
1,also the film is so badly written that it makes it hard to watch because of the fact that it 's supposed to be a comedy it fails,also a lot of scenes of violence and nudity were done with such a good script it seemed like it had been shot in a real school
1,yes it 's a little too slow to be funny but the characters,yes it 's a good movie and that 's what it is
1,do n't watch it if you want to be,do n't waste my time on this movie
1,very much a film of this type,very little action and just plain bad action
1,it seems that a lot of people do n't understand that this is a movie,it 's a shame that the producers had such an eye for making a movie like
1,milo and his friends are not a great family or their parents or a parent,milo 's wife and his friend decide to get rid of a couple of the other
1,just as the story unfolds and the ending is just the same as the rest of the film,just when he is in his late twenties and he takes him to his home to the town it
1,some of the characters are so real that you have to suspend disbelief at times,some people are saying that this was a good movie and a good one for me
1,louis gossett jr was also excellent as,louis malle 's direction is excellent
1,my advice is to stay away from seeing this film,my advice do not go see it if you have a
1,burgundy 's new york is the most important thing in this country,burgundy is a very good film but the acting is bad the dialogue
1,it 's the kind of movie you like in every film and you 'll get,it 's a shame that the film is so badly written and poorly acted
1,we are left wondering what is going on at the end or the end,we have to wait to see more of these two people and the way the
1,there are some interesting characters and the story is a bit confusing,there were also several characters in the movie such as that of the
1,what makes these movies great is that,what was the purpose of that
1,this is the best film of the year and a half of the best,this movie was made for tv at the time and i would have liked it
1,i think the reason for seeing this is when the film is on tv and that is it is so great it has been released for,i was expecting to watch a lot of movies and not just for a few hours but in my opinion that was a good idea
1,when she is in love with his father he is confronted by a,when a movie is made a film is n't a bad movie
1,the first half hour of this film is just as good,the movie starts out very well and it is very well done
1,as the movie progresses you 're left with a great feeling,as an aside this film has some flaws to it
1,a lot of the time the acting was n't good and i found it difficult to understand how this could,a lot of people have mentioned that there is n't a bad film and there are some good ones
1,still the film is quite good with a great performance by peter ustinov,still i was able to sit through this movie and i was so glad
1,do n't expect any kind of action to be,do n't waste your money on this one
1,my advice is to avoid this,my favorite line is when the main
1,it 's not a good horror movie but it 's a good movie for you,it is a shame because this has been released on dvd as one of the most
1,when i saw the trailer i thought this was going to be another,when she is not a bad person she has a heart attack
1,a good idea of this film is it was made for about a dozen thousand dollars,a lot of the dialogue is not funny either but it is funny and i have to
1,shepherd 's performance is a bit heavyhanded in the part she plays her,shepherd 's character was the most irritating and stupid character i 've ever seen
1,all in all it is an excellent movie,all of a sudden the actors are all excellent
1,but it 's so bad that you ca n't help but laugh,but if you want to see a movie like this you will be
1,and it is n't a film that is supposed,and the whole movie is like a dream
1,another thing is the music score which is so much more than a,another great thing about this movie is it 's a good story
1,thus i thought it was a very bad movie but the rest of the movie was just plain stupid i mean the movie is about a guy that has no idea about the world that he was doing,thus i do n't want to give the plot away but the plot is n't that interesting and it makes it hard to care for these characters and that it is a little too long to care about
1,hell i do admire the actors for having their own work in this film but the script is very good and,hell it is so boring and it 's a shame because i am not a big fan of the movie
1,whenever i watched this film i thought it was a joke,whenever you watch this movie for yourself it will keep you guessing
1,the film is a real treat and the story is,the plot is n't even remotely good at all
1,with a great cast the film does have a good deal going,with all its bigbudget technology this is n't a bad film
1,particularly the scene where we get the impression that the movie was made to be a bit contrived,particularly the scene when the two men are killed by a maniac is a classic moment in which one
1,stiller plays him and he is very funny,stiller 's character is a bit of a brat
1,so i was surprised to find this movie to be a good idea that the film is a bit over,so what is it a movie that is so bad and so bad that it 's hard to believe
1,kevin bacon plays the part very well as the lead,kevin costner as a police chief is also good
1,i am glad i did it for,i would n't recommend watching it
1,all in all a very entertaining film,all the actors are great in this movie
1,and that 's not all that happens to the characters,and it 's not even the same old man
1,the movie has the best of the best and best,the film is not so bad as a bad film but
1,it seems that there were some things that were just as good,it was a very nice film to watch but not as much of
1,this show was a waste that it could have been called in the first place,this is the type of film where the viewer has no clue what it is all
1,with the same amount of people and same votes,with his trusty wife he 's been diagnosed with a
1,there are so many great things in this movie that,there are two very funny scenes in the film
1,that 's the best part of the movie but not a good thing,that 's why i love it so much and that 's a reason why
1,even if the movie is n't funny i think it 's just a,even if this is a movie it 's not a bad film
1,like i said before i 've read some negative reviews and comments on this forum i,like a lot of people said it was the only way to get the dvd
1,the acting is horrible and the dialogue just makes no sense to me,the film also features a very interesting and interesting ending with the hero and
1,probably the best movie i have seen in a long time,probably a little of what it was meant to be a movie
1,i was hoping that the movie would end,i have never been a big fan of any
1,i'm afraid this is the most expensive movie,i'm not one person who likes the film as
1,oddly the scene with the dog and the lion and his girlfriend 's death is very touching to watch and,oddly enough it does n't matter that the director has a lot of money but this film has nothing
1,but the movie 's only purpose is the story itself,but if it were n't for the fact that it was
1,this movie is a complete waste of time,this movie is a must see for all lovers
1,it 's a shame that this was n't a movie for its release,it seems to me that he 's a good guy but not that good
1,it was n't a total waste of time,it has no plot and is n't funny at
1,on one level it is not as bad as it is,on top of that he has a very strong face
1,tempo is the only thing to make a movie like,tempo is the key thing to the entire movie
1,for example when you are talking about what you think the director is in the audience is a,for me it would have been much more effective if he had n't been a bigger star
1,the only good thing here is that i did,the acting is horrible the story is awful
1,alert to the end of the film and i was a little surprised by what i 've heard,alert by the way this film was filmed and it looked like something was made on an budget and
1,i would love to see a sequel to the original film,i think they are going to be a good film
1,i was hoping it would have been a good movie,i was expecting to see something more like it 's an
1,after the film was over and over and over again i was n't even thinking that it would end,after seeing the trailer for the first series of films i can see why they have to make it a
1,this is not a film for kids,this movie does n't really seem to get
1,but i guess the only problem with this movie is the fact that it 's supposed to be the movie and it 's not,but i think it is a bit of a bore to say that this is what i would call the same thing over all
1,as a movie buff myself i can tolerate the story of the story of two,as far as i am concerned this movie is a total waste of time
1,moreover the acting is n't all good either,moreover i ca n't imagine how this movie got
1,a lot of the acting in the film is the best i 've,a few scenes of the show are the best in the series
1,dull and boring but i guess this is not the type of movie that,dull and lifeless and not even funny at all but a good movie
1,the film is very well done,the movie is a bit long and
1,after all the movie is set in the near future and the people in the town come to life with the exception of the devil,after the first hour of the film i was n't really able to figure out who the killer was or what happened to him
1,lana turner is a fine actress as she has a very good,lana parker is one of the worst actors of all time
1,ken is also quite the opposite of the two main characters,ken russel and john cleese were excellent as the main character and
1,the acting was ok but i did n't see the real story line of the movie,the acting is horrible the plot is weak the acting is bad and the story is so
1,in the first half of the movie they were very good,in the case of a great story it is not
1,the film is a bit of an action packed,the acting and the script are just bad
1,for all of the other comments about what it is like it was a good show,for me a film about a group of people who do the same and who can act
1,the first is a little slow in the beginning but it is n't enough,the movie does have a few scenes that are so funny that it 's not
1,but the best part of it has to be,but then again it 's a great show
1,when it comes to movies they are all a bunch of crap characters,when i saw it at blockbuster i was n't expecting anything more
1,in fact he was a real person and that was a mistake,in the end he realizes that he is a little more than a
1,i do n't care what the critics were saying,i do n't know what else to say about this
1,heck the ending was really great,heck it 's not so great it
1,sure there were a lot of bad things to say about this movie but i guess,sure they have some great fun but some of them are n't funny or entertaining
1,if you do see the film for yourself i think you will probably love the book,if you 're a fan of the genre you 'll love this movie but you should n't
1,this is the only real thing that i do n't like about the movie as it did n't really have to do,this is not only the funniest film ever made but the fact that it 's not a great film is a very enjoyable
1,it 's like a bad film that is,it 's the worst movie ever made
1,bunker has a few good moments but overall it 's just not worth your time,bunker is not only a film of this era with its immense success of its time
1,i 've seen many bad movies but this was a waste of your time,i was a huge fan of the show but i do not think it is
1,the only redeeming quality of this production is the cinematography,the movie is not a complete disaster but i would like
1,this was probably one of those shows where the characters seemed to be a bit of a joke as it became annoying for me to be more interested in the characters,this has been a very low budget tv production and has been done by the same people who made it on dvd and was looking for something to do earn a copy
1,all in all it is a good movie and is a good example,all the while it was made by a group of friends and the other
1,look and feel like a good film,look for a few of the actors who
1,i do not know how many times i have ever seen this movie,i was surprised that the film had a good story and was n't too
1,the only real drawback in the movie was the ending which was pretty cool too,the film is set in the future but the action scenes are very slow
1,there 's a lot of action and a good plot to tell you the truth but this film does not make,there is one scene in which a man is a member of the team and he is the target audience
1,this movie is just a good film,this movie is a must see for anyone
1,the film starts with a man getting shot by a car,the film has a very nice cast which is not really the
1,possible spoiler alert there are some interesting points of view that i have seen in other films such as the one where the main characters are in the movie,possible spoilers below this movie is about a young boy named angus whose mother and father and sister are trying to convince him of his son who is a true
1,in this movie the characters are all so real,in my opinion it 's a good movie
1,the story and the performances are great but the movie has,the plot is about a woman who kills her husband
1,on the other hand it 's a very good film,on a side note the acting was very good
1,from the opening shot of a scene to the scene in the dark and dark woods where,from the first moment we meet the young woman we see a young man named ben
1,four men in the movie who were supposed to get into their way and were,four people who live on an upscale planet that is not a big one
1,the movie 's plot is a bit too thin for me to,the movie starts with a bang of a couple of friends
1,a good cast including john cusack and john wayne,a lot of people seem to be enjoying this movie
1,the film is about a bunch of men who live in an isolated apartment,the plot is a bit thin and the plot is n't really that easy
1,the script is very good and the performances are superb the story is very good but the,the movie is about the power of a man who is trying to find the truth
1,sure they 're in this movie but they are the only one who is very good,sure it is a comedy but a lot more than the sum of the parts
1,and i have a very strong opinion of the story and the movie,and the ending does n't seem to have any relevance at all
1,but it 's not that it has a lot,but this is what i would call it
1,trying to get back in his youth is a big mistake for me,trying to find out if the girl is going to die but the killer
1,oh yes but the story line and the plot,oh dear god it 's a bad movie
1,even the worst of the movie,even if you like this show you
1,from a very low point of view the film is not only a comedy but a comedy,from the beginning of the movie i was expecting to see an old fashioned horror movie
1,immature characters in this movie are all very annoying but,immature characters from the movie are n't even funny
1,i am glad that i did,i saw this movie when i first
1,for all of you who have n't read the book and have read the book it is not,for a film of this caliber i would rate this film a zero but it 's not
1,the only thing good about this movie was the acting it 's not bad at all,the story of the movie is about a man trying to get her out of the home
1,this movie is a complete mess,this is not the only way i
1,this has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever,this is a good movie for anyone who wants a good thriller
1,at least the movie would have been good,at least in the last few months
1,just because the story was so bad and the characters just,just as you get the chance to watch this film
1,of course the movie is about an american woman who goes to a mental institution to search for her,of course he is a little too old to play the role as the main character and his character is
1,he 's a very funny person but not in a funny way,he 's a great actor as well as a good actor
1,the acting is very poor and the story line is weak,the movie is about the family of the young couple who have
1,the script is a joke but the script is just as awful as the movie,the only thing that made me jump out of the movie was seeing a little girl
1,for all its flaws this film is very good for its time but the rest of the movie has a bit of an odd ending which does n't really make up for that,for a film with such a bad reputation the film 's impact of what is going on in the story was not the result and the story was not really the same for that
1,not a good film but not as bad as the first,not that it did n't have to be one of the worst
1,this movie is so bad that it is almost,this movie was so bad it was funny
1,needless to say the story has a good story but the script is so awful,needless to say this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,i was expecting a lot more from this film,i think the movie 's main problem with this movie
1,do i have to agree to the people who do n't,do n't be fooled by a friend of a film
1,it 's not the type of movie,it was n't funny or interesting
1,now that i 've seen the movie and i do n't know that i 've,now i 'll be a bit prejudiced and the film is not for everyone
1,i would like to see a sequel to the original,i 've read that this movie was released theatrically
1,makes you wonder how many times i have seen this,makes you feel like you are watching a tv show
1,the plot of the story is a bit weak,the only redeeming factor about this mess is that it
1,towards the end we get a glimpse of her,towards the end of the movie we 're left with
1,when i watched it i thought it might be a good movie,when a little girl is killed by her father it 's not even
1,when i first saw it i was very excited,when you 're on the fence the plot is pretty
1,using the word of mouth and the words of a woman who does n't want to kill him,using a very small budget that 's really bad and the acting in this film is so bad that
1,the script was written on the basis of a movie called the,the only thing that made this movie interesting was the music
1,i 've seen a few movies with similar characters that were so bad they could not have been worse,i have n't seen this movie since i first saw it at the age of 15 and i am not
1,shirley maclaine is excellent as the lead character,shirley 's character has no depth and is just
1,you know what the real thing is going to happen and the film is just a tad more than an hour long,you will see a lot of the same thing but i do think that the movie is a little too much to list
1,this movie has a lot of good acting and the story is,this is a pretty good movie and the acting is great
1,carlitos 's role in this film is also very good,carlitos is one of the most beautiful actors ever
1,a few scenes where the movie just does n't,a good movie is a very good movie
1,kirk douglas 's character is a bit too unlikable to be a good actor,kirk douglas is a genius but this movie is one of his best
1,the acting is terrible and the plot is so contrived and so lame that i could n't stand it any more,the film does n't make much sense and is a real shame as the plot was very confusing and not believable
1,eastwood plays a young boy who is in love with a,eastwood is a good actor and a very good actor
1,part of it is that the characters do n't seem very real or,part 1 has some of the best music i have ever heard
1,unbeknownst to the writers of that film i thought they were trying,unbeknownst to you the movie is an excellent piece of cinema
1,i was very interested in the plot and the way the movie ended,i do n't think i 'll give it a 1 because it would have
1,so the movie is n't about the story but it is n't,so it is a very good family movie and it is not the
1,terrence howard and david niven are great as always,terrence malick 's direction is the most beautiful aspect of
1,there were also many other things i thought the movie was supposed to,there is nothing in the film that makes it work in fact
1,it is an insult to the intelligence and innocence that it 's,it is a great film and should be seen by all
1,a lot of the movie is just a collection of random events,a very funny film with some good acting and an awesome ending with
1,first i was n't expecting a lot,first off he 's an alcoholic
1,it 's just an old movie,it 's a great movie that i
1,although the movie is a bit dated it 's a great show that i enjoyed it very much as well,although it is still a bad movie and the acting is good i have seen better acting in porno movies
1,no one has ever heard of any of them,no one is able to get to a point
1,the plot is not really that bad,the film was directed by roger corman and
1,and that 's what it 's all about,and the film is a bit too much for
1,now if you 've read the other reviews on this board and you will want,now if you want to see something like this you should definitely see this
1,having said all that you will find something to watch,having watched a lot of movies and television movies this one
1,why not just make a film,why did n't she kill him
1,and the movie is n't that bad,and the scene with the girl in the
1,at first i wanted to see the movie for the first time but i did n't think the end was too bad and i could,at first i thought that it was going to be a spoof but i think it was a lot better than it could possibly
1,while i am not a huge fan of the original the movie was still a,while this is not a good movie it is still a waste of time
1,or perhaps it 's not that the movie is n't so bad that i actually think it,or the fact that the movie was shot in a very tight and very grainy way
1,he 's not a bad actor and he was n't even good in the,he 's not even a very handsome woman but that was a mistake
1,at least the movie could 've been better,at a certain point you know what 's happening
1,maria is a very good film and has been very popular and has a lot,maria and rebecca are the two leads and their relationship is not entirely believable
1,yes you guessed it to be a movie,yes there 's plenty of nudity and nudity but
1,a few people in the theater are the most ardent fan,a good movie to watch with someone with a brain
1,the film is very good but the story is,the movie is a bit over the top
1,there was no need to give a film a,there is one good scene in the film
1,mean to the point that you just,mean the movie was so bad
1,without any hesitation i was n't sure what to expect,without the benefit of the doubt a film is a very
1,the movie is a total waste of time,the story is about a man who kills people
1,though it is not the first of the many movies it has the feel to it the film is,though the movie is not as bad as its predecessor it is a good film to be sure
1,the movie does not even try to be,the film is very good at that
1,clark gable 's character is a little too passive to be believable,clark gable is a great actor but i was n't really impressed
1,this is not a bad movie,this is a movie that is not
1,all the actors have their own problems with the material,all of the acting was superb the actors and actresses was
1,6 this was a good movie with an incredible cast,6 out of 10 because that is why i gave this
1,the story is very basic and i think,the film has a lot of fun
1,after reading the book i read the summary of the book and the movie was based on the novel and was completely faithful to the book i think,after the first two thirds that i have had the misfortune to see again the first time i see a film where i was looking at a movie that
1,i have n't seen many movies like this one that are so terrible,i have to wonder why this is not released in the us in the
1,i do n't think this could be as bad as they did,i have to admit that i am a big fan of the tv
1,but this one did not really have,but this one is the worst
1,but this is one of the best films that i have,but the movie does n't have anything new to say
1,much has a lot of fun to watch,much of the film is spent in a small
1,no matter what so many of the actors are not in it they all seem to be playing themselves with the script and the actors,no one has ever been told to have any idea about what is happening in this film or how a young man has been a victim
1,depending on your expectations to the fact that the film is a little bit of a letdown,depending on the same story and a few clichs and the occasional humor the plot is a joke
1,like the first movie it 's pretty obvious that it 's not even a sequel,like the other reviewers said i was a bit shocked at the ineptitude of this production
1,it 's a good film to see but it 's not the best one in this film,it does n't make sense that they are in trouble because they 're not really the same
1,the movie was shot in the middle of the,the story and character development are pretty good
1,but it does have a good time to it,but the best thing about this movie is that it
1,imagine the film is a very good example of what a movie can do and it 's,imagine it was a movie and that would probably be the only reason to watch it
1,snitch and a little girl is a movie i have not seen so many times,snitch and the beanstalk is a wonderful film and i recommend it to anyone
1,the movie was very well made,the film 's title song is the
1,they all seem to have no problem with the script or the actors,they are all very good in a way they were able to create a
1,the movie is very well directed and acted,the film also has some good scenes in the
1,this is the story of two people and their love,this is the first time i 've seen a movie i
1,this was one of my favorites,this movie was a big disappointment
1,the only thing that i can remember is that it was,the acting is good and the story was pretty good
1,she 's just not a bad actress,she is the one who has to deal
1,while it is still not a film for kids it 's a very good film for children,while the plot was not as good as the original i was n't disappointed with the movie and
1,overall this is a good and good movie,overall this is an excellent little film that i
1,ten years later he is able to convince his friends about what,ten months later i was a bit puzzled by this movie
1,the film has its moments and a good story that will help you,the plot is a bit farfetched but that the movie is n't
1,also the movie was shot in a cheap studio style,also the ending is the most satisfying of the movie i
1,in fact the whole idea of the film was very,in short this is probably a very good movie
1,the only way this movie is a,the movie is about the same
1,if it does have an intelligently constructed plot line it 's the best film ever made and that is what it,if you have n't seen the film yet you will like the first one and i will watch it again
1,when the film was released in the late forties and early 1980s i did not like it,when the girl in black is supposed to be her sister and she is a woman she is
1,it is the most interesting movie i 've ever,it was a very interesting film for me
1,light on his screen he has no idea how to,light hearted in the way she was in it
1,so the movie has a lot of action and lots of action and lots of action,so i guess they 're trying to get rid of this movie as a warning
1,this movie is a waste of time,this is a great movie to have a
1,come on you 're in for a treat and that 's all,come back in the middle of an interview with a woman
1,i was surprised by the way the,i 've watched it countless times
1,the film is a little slow at times but it still makes the movie fun,the movie is a complete waste of time and should have been nominated for a academy
1,at the end of the movie there is a scene where we see an attractive woman running through a forest,at first it was n't so much of a stretch as i would have thought it was going to be
1,i have seen many of his films and i,i have seen it a million times now
1,if you want to see a movie that makes you want to laugh at the characters,if you 're into this genre you 'll find the funniest thing about this movie
1,i have seen a lot of people,i would have loved this film
1,a great movie that is worth the price of admission alone,a few weeks of the day i was watching a film called
1,i was surprised to see the film,i think it 's worth seeing
1,i think that 's the only reason to watch this film,i was surprised to find that this film was n't the worst
1,saw this in the theater and it was not a total,saw this in a theater and it was very good
1,dracula is n't the best film of the,dracula has a good sense of humor
1,they are both a perfect fit for a movie that makes you,they are all a little too old to make this movie
1,but the real reason is that it 's so,but the movie is very much like it
1,for the first time in a long long time he was n't able to play an important part of the film,for a film about two men who go in search of their husbands and their lives in their lives and their relationships
1,when the movie started i was hooked in the middle and i was just bored,when she gets a chance to be the one who 's the daughter of the man
1,tilda swinton plays her usual self with the role and,tilda swinton is perfect for what she was in
1,the acting is n't as bad as the script although sometimes it 's a bit uneven for a movie like this but,the film opens with the man getting killed by a werewolf and he kills a young man who is a werewolf
1,in short the only way to make this film is to have to be a good movie and a,in this film it was a little too hard to find a film that i had n't seen
1,you can see why this film has such a high rating for imdb rating it deserves,you can see the actors and actresses in this movie but they were just not as good
1,figure it out in the middle of the day the movie is a very different one but it 's a movie that is so,figure out the mystery and the mystery that the killer is trying to kill his wife and her friends is a nice touch
1,dog and mouse are the only two characters that are all likable,dog and mouse are the only things that could match the way the
1,adults are not the best part of the movie and the plot is just plain bad,adults are advised to have some sort of mental institution but this movie is a very bad
1,his father has a very good body,his wife 's daughter is a rich and
1,if that was the case the film is a very bad one,if you 've seen it i would say that it was n't bad
1,this time he is the first to get,this is a very very funny film
1,first off this film has a very low budget and,first off this one is just another bad movie
1,ignore that the movie 's plot is not a bad one,ignore this film you 'll probably be disappointed with the movie
1,the movie starts a little slow and drags the plot along nicely,the film has a few funny moments but it 's not a good
1,this movie was so bad i thought it was the best i have ever,this movie was one of the funniest movies i have watched to name
1,and what 's worse is that it is just,and that would be all i can say
1,the plot is n't all that bad it 's just the story and,the acting is horrible and the plot is n't even remotely interesting
1,i am glad that i will be able,i would love to see this again
1,much of the movie takes place in a small town with,much of the action takes place on the big screen
1,a good premise for the film is a little,a great movie that has some interesting moments
1,this is the type of movie you,this is just a great film
1,with the first two films this one is pretty bad,with all the hype on the dvd extras and the movie
1,by now it would have been a better movie for the younger generation,by the end of the movie you will have a good time
1,the film has been released several years in a row where the two stars,the story was good but it was just too much of a drama
1,low budget and not a very bad movie are n't the worst movies i 've seen but it 's definitely not worth,low budget and well made but it is a little slow in that it has to be seen to be believed
1,as i have said before the acting is superb,as a result of the fact that they were the
1,i'm surprised that this show was canceled,i'm sure it will make a good movie
1,no matter how many times it took place this film could have been a lot worse,no wonder he did n't have the money to get to work out in a few more
1,the film is a bit slow but the performances are good,the only reason i gave this film 2 out of ten was
1,sorry if you have a yen for watching this movie,sorry to say that i was disappointed by this movie but
1,in the end it 's a great family drama that should be enjoyed to everyone with an iq for,in the end he was a little bit over the top but the character was very different and the acting
1,this was an excellent show and it was fun to see a,this is one of the most beautiful movies of all time
1,my friend and i rented this movie because it was an extra and a half hour,my friends and my children had watched it with my kids and laughed at it
1,fans of the book should read that the film is based on the book,fans of this genre will probably want to check out this show as one of
1,beverly hills cop 2 is not the worst movie ever,beverly hills cop is a great example of why a film
1,this is n't one of these movies,this movie was a complete waste
1,this film is a must see and,this is a very bad movie
1,the acting is n't as bad as the other actors but it is good,the acting is terrible with the exception of a very talented director who has done
1,christopher eccleston does a decent job with his role as the detective,christopher plummer is a good guy but he just does n't seem like
1,reportedly he was a bit of a jerk,reportedly it 's not the film to be made
1,he 's a man who has a very small crush on,he does n't seem able to be a good man
1,this is one of the finest movies i 've seen this,this is a very interesting movie and a good one
1,it 's a good thing that the film did not win awards,it 's the same thing that the movie does not have
1,ever before seeing an episode i felt that the series was a great series and i would recommend this series for anyone who is interested in the subject matter and the people of the family,ever since that film 's release it was a little too long and was the last film to be released from the library and that 's why the movie is so much better than it is
1,if you want to see a film that has been in the works of the original then you will like this film,if you can sit through this movie and get hooked up with your own life you have to go to bed
1,unfortunately the only reason why i have been in a theater,unfortunately it 's all very well executed and it works
1,the movie was just as bad and i was hoping the movie would improve the book,the plot has a couple of twists and turns and a good script and great performances
1,because of the fact that it is the only movie i have seen from a similar audience that has a very limited budget of about the same,because they had the same idea and did n't seem to be able to pull this off and it was just boring and the story just does n't
1,i think they could 've done a much,i do n't know what to expect
1,and then we get a movie about a bunch of people who have no idea of who they are or why the bad guy was killed or,and there are some nice moments but not enough of the story that the characters are forced to speak and the story is not very good
1,finding a new home and his new wife,finding an abandoned man 's family in the town
1,to sum it up this film is a mess,to be fair i do n't know where to start
1,if you want to see a film that will make people think that this is,if i had seen it i would n't have been able to watch it
1,george romero has always managed to do this,george is a great movie for everyone who is
1,so if you 're a big fan of john carpenter 's classic,so much of the action is n't very exciting or exciting
1,i saw this movie on the shelf and i loved it so much,i 've seen a lot of movies in the past but this one is
1,this film is just plain bad,this movie is about a group called
1,the film has a very dark feel to it that makes it a real treat,the story is about a group of teenagers who have no scruples and who have a
1,anyway a few minutes later i was in tears for the entire film,anyway the movie starts with an interesting premise but it is n't
1,once the camera switches into a world of music and dancing it 's the,once in awhile you realize that this is the worst movie ever made
1,a lot of people have complained about this film as the,a few things i did n't get into the movie
1,timberlake is also excellent in this movie as it is his acting career,timberlake 's performance has to be the weakest i 've ever seen
1,a good film is n't for you,a great cast of supporting cast members with
1,but if you are a fan of hers and want to see a really good movie that is worth renting this one,but the movie has some of the worst acting of all time and i was impressed with the poor acting and directing
1,if you have never seen it you can find yourself in the theatre and enjoy it,if this was a true film and was n't in the realm of the film i would
1,it does n't work because there is a bit of a,it 's all pretty good but it is also not
1,i do n't know what this movie had going,i was really looking forward to this movie
1,all in all an excellent movie worth watching,all in all it 's a great little film
1,therefore the movie 's not good or funny,therefore it was very funny and it is a
1,but this is a great movie,but it really was a bad movie
1,normally the movie is not as bad as you,normally i was not impressed with this movie
1,the script is so predictable that the plot is so contrived and the characters are so ridiculous that it 's almost impossible to care,the script was a joke that could n't have been written in a movie but the director and writer were so much in the film
1,for a movie that 's really bad,for me the best of the lot and
1,this is a great movie for the ages,this movie was a waste of time to see
1,in fact the movie is a little long in places,in fact the only thing i can appreciate is a very
1,this movie is a complete waste of,this movie is not for everyone
1,cause it 's a little too old for me,cause i do n't see how much of this movie
1,it 's all about the fact that it does n't have to be made in time,it is a shame that the film does n't get the proper votes it deserves
1,the script is n't really very funny,the movie does have a lot of good
1,this is a really awful movie,this is a movie for everyone who
1,he 's just a little bit too,he 's just a bad actor
1,she has to be one of the most talented actors ever,she was a little bit too old but she was n't the
1,anyway there are some nice twists and turns in the end but i did n't care when,anyway this is one of those films that i think i 'd like to see again
1,but that is a good thing,but it 's a shame that it
1,to begin with the movie is pretty bad,to me he 's not even remotely funny and
1,the movie itself is a bit slow and too dull,the acting by the entire cast is good but that does
1,i think the director 's intention was to be the one that made me,i have n't seen the first two movies but that 's the case
1,she 's also a very talented woman and her daughter is so,she is also one of the best actresses of our generation
1,spoiler after a series of bizarre coincidences and a couple of gruesome moments it 's almost,spoiler the plot is so weak that there 's hardly any tension and no tension
1,think of this as the worst film ever made,think of the first film that 's the best one
1,louise is a young man and a woman of the same kind but in a very different form,louise brooks has a wonderful turn as the mother who does a wonderful performance as the mother and mother
1,everyone who saw the movie knows what they should do,everyone in this production is either a bad guy or a
1,one of the few movies that has made me laugh,one of the most memorable scenes of the movie
1,damon wayans plays a cop who is,damon crowe is a great actor
1,the movie was shot with a lot of handheld handheld cameras and some grainy digital camera shots which were so obviously filmed in the film that,the story is a bit of a mess but as a result of its own the film has its fair share of humor and suspense
1,i have to say this is one of the best movies i 've seen this year,i have to say if you want to see some pretty bad movie go check this one
1,this movie was a waste of time and i,this is what makes this movie so special
1,look no further than a few hundred years,look at this movie that it 's a little
1,not only is this movie an action film it,not that it does not make any sense
1,while the film does have one redeeming feature to it it does n't even have the same urgency that a,while i have n't seen the original film i can safely remember that the original was an awful film
1,it is not only a comedy it,it 's just an old movie
1,besides it 's not the best movie it 's not even the worst,besides the fact that i did n't think that it was a comedy and
1,it is a film which has to have been a success of many years,it 's the story of a man who has to deal with the system of
1,since this was one of the first episodes of season 1 it is a bit long to make up for the lack of originality but it has some great actors,since i have been living in the us the past year and so many times i was very impressed by this film as well as a wonderful musical score
1,sixties was a little too much for the younger generation,sixties the film follows and is the story of the same
1,the story of the kelly gang' is very interesting,the plot has a lot to live up to but
1,joanne whalley plays a character who is very much a part of what is happening to her,joanne is the only one who has the guts and she 's just a little less fun than
1,there are no surprises in this movie,there 's a reason why there were so
1,it is not only that the film is set up in a way it,it is a great film to see and i recommend it for all
1,add in a dash of a female character that is the most interesting thing about the movie but this is the best,add to that the excellent and funny dialogue the acting and the directing by the great cast and a great cast
1,it has no point in the film that is not a good,it is one of the finest movies i have ever seen
1,mgm was a great movie director,mgm 's best picture is one of
1,when i saw it at the sundance film festival i thought that this movie was great,when a movie about sex and sex the plot is about a man who is a woman
1,he was a little stiff and the acting is bad,he was a quiet man who loved the world
1,i do n't remember much about his character and the story was not a little bit predictable,i was so impressed that i was subjected to it i thought i was watching a movie about
1,unfortunately this is n't a great movie to be taken seriously,unfortunately the story is a bit weak the acting is worse
1,i would love to see it again and again,i think you should have done the same thing
1,inland empire is one of those films that is so good it 's good,inland empire is a movie that has a certain charm to it and that the
1,then again what is the point,then there 's this little kid
1,richard widmark was great too the movie is very good with his character and the,richard burton 's acting in the movie is not as good as it is
1,someone else is so much like me,someone who has a heart and soul will
1,it 's a shame it is n't even available to video,it is one of the funniest and most underrated horror movies
1,richard chamberlain is one of those who have n't yet been given much to work with,richard widmark plays the main character and he seems more like a character than the villain
1,the plot is n't too much but i found this film to be a bit of a mess,the film 's climax is that there is no suspense in the plot and the movie is not even
1,except the acting by all of these actors is pretty bad and the script is terrible,except in the final showdown between the two brothers in the end it 's hard to believe
1,like a lot of the movies i saw it is a bit too long,like i said before i do n't think it 's a good thing that the
1,the plot is pretty good but the acting,the acting and story are very good
1,start with this show and the first episode of 'the last three episodes of the series and,start in the middle of nowhere and we never really care about any of the characters
1,i have a copy of the dvd which is the worst link to it,i have seen this film twice and it has been my favorite book
1,however the story and dialogue are all over the,however i was really impressed by this one
1,i do n't even think the director could be the one interested in seeing a movie,i think this movie will be on forever soon and it has some funny moments
1,before the movie ended it was a little slow,before i wrap it up i 'd like to say
1,poor direction and poor camera work and lighting that is n't enough to make me feel as though i was sitting through it in one of the,poor script bad acting poor directing the worst is that it 's not so bad as you can get it to be the only good movie
1,what a wonderful movie this is,what a wonderful movie it was and
1,all of the characters are very likable and,all this was done with the film
1,it 's a shame that this movie did,it 's all so funny and funny
1,she is also a very beautiful person,she was also a good actor
1,the film is a very moving portrayal of what a young man is capable of,the only problem i had with this was the way the story was presented
1,i 've seen this movie several times over the years and still have n't,i saw this film at the sundance film festival when it was released
1,it 's a shame that this movie is n't shown on a shelf,it 's a shame that the producers decided to put the film together in
1,you will never forget that you 're watching the movie,you have to wonder if the director was aiming to create
1,i do n't know if the film makers were so much,i do n't know why the movie is so bad
1,russian films that have been made by hollywood 's and they can have a lot more,russian soldiers in the film are all good but the story is not that bad
1,even the most ardent fan of the genre could n't possibly be disappointed but this movie was n't a big deal at least in my opinion,even though i was watching this movie for a few years i was n't really surprised to find it to be so bad it was n't funny
1,this film has no story no acting no,this movie is a very bad movie
1,i was surprised when this film was on tv,i think it should be more a comedy than a
1,please do not watch it unless you,please do not rent this movie
1,the story is a joke but it 's a lot more than that,the film is also very entertaining in its own way but in this case
1,in fact this movie was n't so good,in my opinion it would n't be a great
1,probably because this is not the worst film i 've,probably one of the worst horror movies ever made
1,this film is a great tribute to the great,this movie is just a waste of time
1,the acting was so good the characters were good and the characters were great,the acting and the plot were horrible all around but the movie was pretty good
1,in fact it is a bit of a shame that the film,in fact there was no real reason to watch this movie
1,scott bakula is excellent as the troubled father whose love,scott bakula is also excellent as the main character
1,killing is a very bad movie,killing the president of the united states
1,by far the worst film i have ever seen,by the end the story of a young woman in
1,and that is n't a problem,and what is the deal with the
1,you have to think what 's wrong with this film,you do n't have to be one to figure a movie
1,this was the first time i saw,this movie has no redeeming qualities
1,in one episode the characters are a joke,in the end the main hero and the rest
1,he has been a staple of this film but has a very unique and interesting view of his life,he 's the perfect foil for the role of the villain but it 's all here the film is really
1,i have to say that i'm glad it 's on the air and the dvd cover is,i would like to see a sequel to the film the original version of the movie
1,they were all in the same room as the first one,they should be able to keep a sequel from the original
1,the film is also about the love that is lost in this world and the way it was made,the first time i saw it was in the trailer it had the look and feel of a lot of
1,and the movie does n't seem to,and i really enjoyed the movie
1,at least it was n't for the rest of the movie,at the end it 's all about how the real murderer is
1,they have n't done anything else to,they were just the same characters
1,however i think that the only positive comment to this film is that a bunch of people get involved with the,however i have no clue what this movie was like for all the people who gave it the highest score
1,as the movie went on i could not,as for the film 's technical merits
1,he 's not the most interesting person,he 's a very good character
1,what is this movie that makes us want to see the movie and the movie,what a great surprise to watch a movie that has such a funny premise
1,in a world where people have no choice of their own they have,in fact it has all that it 's a good story line
1,i would n't have been much more into the movie as well,i would have been a fan of any of the characters if i
1,just like the other two thirds it is the worst,just as the film begins with the introduction of the protagonist
1,the only redeeming feature of this movie,the movie does have an intriguing plot and
1,no it 's not that the film did n't have to be,no i do n't know the plot but it 's not
1,you 'll never be in the same place as you did it in the same breath,you can get a sense of the plot the acting and the story is just plain horrible
1,it 's a movie that has some funny moments and is,it was a very moving film and a good one
1,never before have i seen a film with such,never mind this movie was a total disaster
1,as far as i can tell the story is n't all about the characters and how they 're about the story,as an avid fan of his film i was impressed with the portrayal of this movie as the main character
1,as a result this is the first time you saw the same film,as for the acting well let 's get back to the movie and you
1,i have no idea what it was about,i am glad they did n't use it as
1,so it was a good movie and i think,so i do n't know where to start
1,in the end i found it interesting to see how the movie was going to end with me as i said it was a bit boring,in the first of course they 've been on a similar situation to other countries in which there are a few good scenes but the script is
1,especially the scene where he is in a mental institution with him and his wife is a joke,especially in the final fight scene with a young woman that is so stupid that you ca n't help
1,this movie should never be forgotten and it,this movie is a very bad movie
1,when i was a teenager in a film school in connecticut i was looking for an old film that,when the film was released on video the video release was not available on dvd in the us
1,it 's a shame to think that this film has been released on dvd for the first few seasons and it has,it is a story about the struggle between people who have to deal with each other and overcome their own lives
1,i 've seen better acting in a kindergarten student in general but this one is not the one,i do not remember seeing a single episode in the series that is n't even remotely entertaining
1,no matter how hard he tries to,no other person can be faulted
1,i was surprised by this movie,i saw this movie and i loved
1,some people do n't know what i do,some of the scenes are not so much the
1,but if you like the genre then watch it,but the rest of the cast does their best
1,he was a bit too old for his part,he is the only character that has been able to
1,how could the director and director have the audacity of,how many times have they been so much more
1,he does n't have any real talent,he does n't even get the chance to
1,the movie was a complete disappointment for me,the film is a very slow and tedious attempt
1,the plot of this movie is a complete ripoff of,the plot is simple but the movie is not
1,its a great movie with a good cast and a good script and some nice actors,its just too bad that there are a few of the scenes that do n't make a
1,you can do better than this,you can tell that the director was
1,a movie about a bunch of people trying to save one of their jobs,a few scenes of the movie that were shot in the back of a 747
1,bud the ripper is a movie that is,bud and hare is a good movie
1,i have n't seen it since,i do n't know how many times
1,elfen lied was n't really an original movie and it was,elfen lied is a story that should not be missed
1,i do n't know why i did n't,i was n't surprised by this movie
1,the first part of the movie is a little slow and the characters are so bad that it is n't even good or bad,the movie is about the power of war and how it is in the us and how many times we are treated to the fact
1,its the first time i saw it and it was so funny i was laughing out loud,its like watching a bunch of people who have never been able to find a new life
1,some parts of the movie are so funny they,some of the characters are not the same
1,basically it 's not worth it,basically it 's a great movie and
1,all the characters are just stupid,all that is happening is just a
1,brendan filone was one of my favorite actors and the only thing,brendan filone is also a great film for the whole family
1,yes the story is n't really bad but,yes it 's a bit of fun
1,sometimes the story is a little too predictable for me to handle,sometimes the film 's main character has a very difficult task but the
1,5 this movie is so bad that i,5 the plot is n't that great
1,3 the film has the look and feel of a movie,3 i was n't expecting much more from this film
1,eventually the story is about a group of young teens who decide to move to a small town and spend the night at a local resort,eventually he goes into a world where he 's a coward who tries to be a little more than a little smarter but is nonetheless a very
1,the film is also quite entertaining in its presentation,the script is not a very original one
1,and that 's the only redeeming part of this film,and the movie is not about sex sex or sex
1,it is the first time i have ever walked out of a movie and this is,it is not a movie to watch for all the good points of the movie
1,two stars in my opinion are the two,two of my friends are the ones that are
1,it was a waste of time to make this one and i do n't know where,it 's like watching a movie that has nothing to do with the first one
1,mostly because the movie is a complete mess of a film,mostly because of that the movie does n't get a point to
1,she has an uncanny sense of humor which is a shame because,she is the only person who has ever seen a movie
1,jane curtin is a great choice for the character of the movie,jane wyman has a few lines that seem to have been written by
1,even the soundtrack is a complete ripoff of the original the film is not,even if you are n't into a good film i have no idea what you
1,the film is a good film that makes it interesting that the film is made,the film is also a very dark tale about a young man named amir whose life
1,even though there were a couple of funny moments it 's still a very good show,even with the exception of a few scenes and a long shot of the movie this movie
1,i was n't really interested in the film but i thought that it was a great movie,i 've seen a lot of horror movies in which the characters are supposed to be funny and
1,lemonade to the heart is a movie that should have never been released,lemonade is a movie that has been released in the past few years and
1,the film is a great example of how a film,the acting is horrible but the actors are good
1,the film is a real treat to watch,the movie is a bit like that
1,this movie is so bad you will be,this is one of my favorite movies
1,i have never heard of this before but it still holds up very well in the,i do not believe that a person like this would be such a bad movie
1,a lot of people are talking about this film,a film to be avoided at all costs
1,this movie is not even about the first time,this is the first film i 've seen
1,to make matters worse the plot is a mess,to me this is a very good movie
1,the first time i saw this i felt like,the film is not so much a movie
1,but if you 're looking for the best and worst i 've ever seen and,but the movie was not bad and so is the way it was made
1,there was also a good supporting cast in the film and that was a great shame,there is also the same thing that i mentioned before that in the beginning of the movie
1,there is a lot of the film,there was no way i could possibly have
1,first there is a few scenes which are so,first of all it was a good movie
1,the only saving grace in the whole movie is the performance which is quite good,the only saving grace is the performance of the supporting cast of the movie
1,why do they want a sequel so miserably,why do n't you try to make a movie
1,hitchcock is in love with her but she is the perfect man to marry her in the end,hitchcock 's direction is quite impressive but the rest of these films were not as good as this one
1,since it is a remake of the story of a woman who 's got a chance to live in new orleans city of her own and her life in her new life,since i have n't seen a more serious approach to film and other than the original and i 've seen the movie i 've always been a fan of the genre
1,doctors have been killed by a killer and they 're trying to kill him,doctors are not even shown at a time when they are all very good
1,this is a film that will not appeal to all ages,this is one film that should be seen for any serious reason
1,a great film that will appeal to all those with a sense of humour,a few scenes of the film are filmed by the very same studio
1,he has the most important and unique part of his,he has a great voice but is very weak
1,i have n't seen this film in any way but it was a complete waste of time,i was a little confused at the time and found myself laughing at the movie and the characters
1,the only thing to say about this movie is the fact that this film is,the first half of the movie is really bad and the ending is ridiculous
1,now that i have n't seen this movie i am not a mormon person,now i know how to do this in a different movie i do n't think
1,this movie has everything that made me dislike it and i think that it is,this was not a film to be missed and it was not for everyone
1,despite the title it 's a good movie to watch,despite the fact that this movie has the same basic premise
1,the only redeeming feature of this film is its ability to get out of the mire and the movie,the film also does a pretty good job in showing what a good movie should really have been
1,so i do n't think so,so if you 're a fan of
1,he had no choice of his own to,he 's got it in his face
1,to be fair i did not know what i,to me it 's a very bad movie
1,it was the most boring movie ever filmed on film,it 's an odd movie and not a very good one
1,this is an excellent film that i recommend,this movie has a lot of fun
1,if you 've seen the film you know you know it is not,if you can make a better film in your life you can do worse
1,he is an amazing actor in a film that is so much more than a real movie,he also wrote that the screenplay was so full of clichs that it was almost painful to watch
1,but if i had seen this film i would have given it a higher grade rating,but i was surprised that the film was so terrible that i could n't believe that this
1,i do n't think this was supposed to be funny and it certainly did n't seem to have,i have seen the film dozens of times and still feel it is very unique and entertaining
1,the plot of the movie is a little,the acting of the leads is excellent
1,nobody seems to know where to start,nobody seems to be aware of the fact
1,well this has to be his most underrated film since the godfather,well worth a watch if one has to admit to some similarities but
1,all in all this has to be the finest animated series ever,all in all i thought it was a very entertaining movie
1,the acting is very good especially the characters,the film is very funny and it makes no
1,it 's a very funny film,it 's just too bad it was
1,there 's an excellent scene where a group of people take their craft and,there are no surprises or surprises or surprises in any of the plot
1,although there is some good acting there are a few moments that are very good and some of the lines are funny,although the movie is n't as bad as it sounds i have n't seen anything else in the past 34 years
1,apparently this is not a bad movie,apparently it has a little more to do
1,george clooney was good as a man but the film was so horrible that i wanted him to,george kennedy as the cop is also the only reason i gave this movie 2 of 10
1,the acting was bad and the story was n't as good as it,the story is simple and the characters do n't have much depth
1,why is it so important to say,why the hell was the predator
1,empire of the opera has a very interesting plot line that is almost impossible to find anywhere in this,empire of the zombies is a film about the human condition and the struggle that is taken by the people
1,felt that the movie was going to be,felt like i was watching a cartoon
1,on a positive note the cinematography was good and it was a nice movie to see,on the other hand it 's a very poor performance that really makes the film seem like
1,and that is the main reason i even bothered to watch this movie,and the ending of the movie which i did n't really like
1,no matter how much i love it i ca n't,no one else could have made this so bad
1,drew barrymore has to be seen as a young woman with a healthy attitude and a willingness to get away from it as she,drew barrymore is perfect as the conflicted mother she has a beautiful and seductive body that is n't only one of her best
1,for example the scene where the killer is shot in a,for those interested in this series i recommend the film
1,this movie is not for everyone,this is a film i would recommend
1,for example a group of people are invited out from the war on a remote island,for some time i had to watch a movie that did a lot of things
1,he is a great actor and he is perfect in,he 's a real man and a real jerk
1,all these are a very good way to get it,all the characters in this movie are very likable
1,after a while i could have been watching the movie,after seeing the movie i thought it was going to be
1,perhaps this film could have been made with more money,perhaps it 's just the story of the man and his
1,and the ending is just stupid and pointless,and the ending is a real surprise to me
1,he does not make any sense,he 's a very talented and loving
1,when the main character dies he 's a bit disturbed but that 's all,when he gets the hang on him the film begins to go nowhere but when
1,in my opinion the best film of the year is the best of all the,in the end there is a reason why the movie works as a thriller
1,i have seen this movie several times and i really want to laugh,i think the film is a great piece of work and i would highly
1,when i saw it in the theater i thought it was a joke,when the film is finished there 's not much action there 's not a
1,do n't worry to see that it,do we really care about them
1,the first one is the best,the movie is n't so good
1,that 's why it 's funny,that 's the way i feel i
1,i saw the movie in the early 80 's,i think this film is the greatest of all
1,haggard should be ashamed that they do n't know how to get the money to see this thing but they do n't want,haggard is a classic film that has some good acting but the acting is so bad it is almost embarrassing to watch
1,there were a number of other movies that i,there are many great examples of this film
1,the acting and writing and acting were excellent,the only thing that kept me watching was the
1,this is a film that you will see for,this film has no real story or plot
1,i'm not sure why it was so bad but i think i should,i'm sorry but i do believe that this is a good movie
1,luckily there are a couple of funny moments which are,luckily the movie is a bit of a letdown
1,yet they 're not in the movie and,yet this show is just plain stupid
1,johnny and his wife were also very funny as well and i thought that it had some,johnny 's character played by the great leslie nielsen is just a very good character actor
1,oh my god i ca n't wait to see this movie,oh and the scene with the dog with a white rabbit was
1,they do n't really know anything about it but they 're just not as funny as some of the other reviewers,they 're a great actor who 's a great actor and i hope they do n't get a job in the future
1,as a result the movie is a complete bore,as with the previous films they are not as good
1,this movie has been done in such a way,this film is the worst of the bunch
1,i 've watched some of the recent movies that i have seen and,i have seen this film countless times and i still love it
1,the acting is terrible the plot is awful even the music is awful,the only way to make it is a great performance is that of denzel
1,the plot of this movie is a joke and the actors who play the bad guy,the movie itself is not for the faint of heart it is a very good movie
1,does n't anyone know how to get the money,does n't she think he 's a werewolf
1,so many other comments here that this film has a good story,so if you want to laugh a lot but do n't let it
1,scenes like the one which is a real hoot,scenes are n't bad and it 's not even a
1,the movie itself is a lot better than i could possibly imagine,the story is very simple the characters are believable and the story is
1,james cagney 's portrayal of a young man who has to overcome the obstacles of,james stewart is a great actor as the lead character and a good actor
1,the acting of the characters in this movie is terrible,the film has the look of a stage play
1,but i do believe that the movie has a lot more going for it than it deserves,but i have to say that the only thing that kept me watching was the acting and directing
1,let me say that this movie was very entertaining,let me get it out of my mouth and say
1,the acting is horrible and the script is just awful,the script is a bit of a mess but the story
1,alas the film is a very different film,alas this is not a movie about the life
1,kurtwood bacon plays his usual tough guy and his character is well tailored as well,kurtwood spacey is also very good as the lead actor who is a real pleasure in
1,the movie is n't as great as the original but,the film does n't even try to be scary
1,needless to say i am so glad it was available,needless to say that this one is a great deal of
1,how the producers managed to capture this is,how did this movie manage to be
1,the story is so thin that there are n't any twists that are n't really,the first thing i did was that it was supposed to be a comedy
1,now i am not saying it all is just a little overrated and that,now i am not sure why the film was so bad and why
1,all in all an excellent film with good performances from everyone involved with the cast,all in all if you like this kind of thing then you should definitely enjoy this
1,if the story was so bad the characters were just plain bad,if you 're looking for a good film with an intriguing plot line
1,well that was the whole point of the movie,well the movie is not a good film it 's
1,a movie with a lot more of a good cast but it has its moments,a few weeks later i got a chance to see it again recently in my life
1,it is one of the most memorable moments of all time to be in the last,it is one of my favorite movies ever and it was one of my favorites
1,this movie is the worst film i,this movie was one big disappointment
1,for all its faults there 's some really good moments,for those who enjoy movies that are not so bad i
1,karwai 's film is a masterpiece of a film,karwai also has to make a great movie about him
1,taylor 's portrayal of the world is so far from his finest and he makes the film a little,taylor has a great performance in the movie as a character actor with his portrayal of the character
1,he is the only one who knows what he 's trying to prove,he 's a man of a good time and it 's always his life
1,i saw the first episode with two episodes,i have to admit that i am glad i
1,the plot line is pretty basic and there is no plot and,the movie also stars anthony quinn as well as john garfield
1,all the characters and situations are just so real and the characters,all in all i think that it is a good film
1,confused to the point of insanity in the film is that you,confused and confused this is the worst movie of all time
1,instead it was a little bit overdone,instead of watching this movie i was surprised
1,two of these guys have done their jobs in the past but it 's just a pity,two of my favorites have been so far since the first one of the two movies that i
1,every once in a while someone gets killed with a machete and then kills it,every episode is just another example of how a film about this show is
1,jeremy northam plays the part of the young detective who is in love with a,jeremy piven plays an interesting guy who is the best character to play in
1,this is the only way i would have been able,this is one movie you can watch out for
1,this is the only film that made me laugh,this is a great movie that is worth seeing for
1,seated back on the streets and the world of the dead people who have been born for a past,seated on the floor and the movie is about an alcoholic and an alcoholic woman and the woman who has
1,at least i can tolerate this film,at least the actors and actresses are able
1,i would say this film was a huge waste of time for my time and i have to say it was a waste of money,i was surprised how this movie was released on dvd and i think i should have known that it would be an enjoyable movie if i
1,referring to the story in the first place and the fact that it 's a,referring to the movie is a very funny scene and a really good one
1,all of the actors were very good,all in all the film is a complete
1,the movie is also very very good,the script by robert altman was very good
1,marilyn monroe has done a great job of,marilyn monroe has a very nice cameo
1,this is the best of the bunch,this film should not be seen as one
1,the movie has a great cast,the only reason i gave this movie
1,right now i have a fondness for the film,right up until the last 20 minutes this movie has
1,miyazaki 's direction of this film is,miyazaki has made a good film
1,gore is also a good thing,gore is not always the most extreme
1,later on he finds a map on a river in which he is sent to a,later when the young son has to go for a swim she is a waitress
1,it 's a pity it is n't,it is n't even that bad
1,but this is one of those movies that you will enjoy and watch if you want to make fun of it,but there is a very subtle and interesting aspect that is very effective and the film also has very few scenes
1,creepy scenes with the actors and the acting by all involved,creepy and unsettling and the movie is not that bad but it
1,this is the only film that is n't even close to the original and that is n't what i expected,this movie is about the adventures of an old man who lives in his house in a remote town building
1,there 's no real reason to watch this,there are some very memorable scenes and some great
1,murder is the most important aspect of his life,murder of the dragon is a very good film about
1,all the characters were likable and the movie also was pretty funny at least,all the while it is in the background that is the main reason to watch
1,see it for yourself and if you do n't have any expectations on the subject you 'll have,see this movie and you will find yourself wishing you had n't been so bored by it
1,described in the movie it is a great movie and one of the funniest,described as the first film in the series the best of which it is still
1,if you want to see a movie that is a little more of a,if you want a real good scare then try to watch this movie
1,i do n't see that the film is a total waste of,i was n't sure how much the film would be good
1,and then the scene is just a little,and the film is very well photographed
1,that is the only way i would describe it and it is one of my favorite films of the,that was a huge problem with this film but that 's about how you should look it up
1,if you 're going to watch a movie where a movie is supposed to be a,if you 're a fan of the series you 'll find the film pretty good
1,indians were n't the best of them but the story was good,indians are the only ones that have the power to be willing to
1,i have seen better acting in a movie with a script that is,i would like to point out that the acting was very good
1,is it supposed to be funny,is n't that it 's all about
1,no one is going to get the idea,no wonder i 've seen this movie twice and
1,jeff garlin does a fantastic job as,jeff daniels is a great actor
1,they were also in the same place,they are both good in a lot of
1,though a few years ago i found myself thinking of the same as one of the most famous tv series in history,though i am a fan of his work i think this is not an easy task to make a movie that should be
1,after the first five minutes you 're left wondering why they 're all,after that the film becomes a bit too long for a long run of
1,it is the best film ever made,it was n't the most exciting film ever
1,for a few reasons i found a movie called 'the muppet show',for the most part the actors are very bad but not for everyone
1,nick nolte plays a good guy,nick nolte is perfect as the lead
1,the only reason i gave this 1 star out of 10,the film is set in a small town where we see a
1,the first thing that i did like in this series is that a man who has the most basic problem he is is a very human,the only good thing about this film was the scenery which looks good but the story is so weak that it 's impossible for any viewer to
1,drago plays a man who 's trying to kill a woman in the woods and then a few people,drago 's character is not as good as the character he plays but he 's a good guy
1,in one of the best scenes the scene of the,in fact it 's a little disconcerting to say
1,the plot is simple the dialogue 's the worst it,the script was written by a very young woman
1,again if i was a fan of this film,again the film has a lot of potential
1,the script is so bad it 's unbelievable,the story of the mother being told to be
1,notice to you about a movie that 's about to be a good one,notice to me that a woman who has a crush on him is the daughter
1,the only real problem is he was n't able to play the part of the game,the film is set in paris where the movie begins to be an attempt to capitalize on
1,did the filmmakers think they could be in it,did you think that a film about a serial killer
1,just as a kid who loves his movies,just a lot of bad acting and bad editing
1,just as it was in this series the movie was pretty good,just as a movie about a man and a girl who are trapped
1,my rating of 10 out of 10 is n't a bad thing,my favourite part of the movie is that she 's in it to
1,however the only reason for this film was that there was no story to speak of,however if they have n't seen the first one and the result is that it 's still
1,and what 's with all the bad acting,and what do we expect from a good movie
1,milt and his friends make their way into the wilderness where the owner and his family are in the house,milt is the only one who has to be one of the most annoying actors in hollywood and it is n't
1,the story is simple to be seen as it is in many ways,the film is about a woman named seita who is married to the daughter
1,i was n't expecting a lot of the movie and it,i have to say this was a very good movie
1,the movie is a bit slow but i found it quite,the movie itself is not a very good one either
1,dimwitted people who have no idea how,dimwitted is the only good thing
1,my friend was a little puzzled at how he was so funny he seemed to be trying to make his life as a comedy,my advice is to watch this movie if your a fan of any of the original and you are not looking for any other film
1,maybe they 're trying to remake a sequel,maybe it was just a coincidence that the director
1,i have been searching for some time since i saw it,i saw this movie on the scifi channel when i was a
1,i was really bored when this was released on dvd and,i 've seen many movies and this one is one
1,it 's not a bad movie,it 's just not the right kind
1,the story is about a young boy who is born for a living in new york city with a group of friends who have been married to him,the first time i saw this movie on my laptop i had to turn it off and watch the film and i have to give it a 1 out
1,this is what you can expect a good movie to be seen,this was a pretty bad movie but i guess it was n't that
1,i saw a screener of this film in the theater and was surprised to find myself in the cinema,i think that this film should be avoided and it is a shame to see such a bad movie
1,please note i did n't care much for,please do n't bother with this one
1,as for the plot it has a lot of plot twists but it has,as far as i can see the film goes downhill as a movie
1,grownup to the film it is a great film for the ages,grownup and interesting is a film about a young boy who goes into
1,let it be a good movie,let me preface you up by saying
1,a few years ago i was able to watch it on cable television,a lot of people who have read comments are not going to read the
1,also starring the likes of the first two,also it is a little bit of a parody
1,for me this is a movie that should definitely be made,for all the people involved in this movie i would recommend the
1,the first half of it was pretty slow but it was n't so bad,the script is n't bad the acting is horrible and you 're not sure what
1,if you have n't seen the movie yet i highly recommend the original and you 'll,if you do n't believe me you wo n't find anything else to recommend it
1,the acting is n't bad though at all,the film has a very simple plot line which
1,finally the two of them go to a motel,finally this film is n't for you if you 're
1,next thing is i was not disappointed,next up the last scene is a flashback
1,the story is very simple and interesting,the movie has a lot of action sequences
1,jake gyllenhaal is also a fine choice for his portrayal of the mafia in this,jake gyllenhaal is a great actor and he 's always good in this film
1,note that the only one i have noticed is that the movie was shot,note the director and producer have done some work on the other hand
1,of course this has to be one of the greatest films ever made,of course that 's a little too harsh for me and the ending is
1,aside from the fact that it 's the first of two films in the trilogy of the same title it 's not,aside the fact that the story has a plot and the characters do it all make the movie even more interesting
1,i 've never been in a film theater but i have a headache for a,i would n't be surprised if it was n't because he was a genius
1,the story is a little too thin,the movie is also quite entertaining
1,hope lange is not the best of the bunch,hope lange and her friends have been in the making
1,brent and pressburger are the only two people that can do that,brent is the only reason that this film is so bad it is
1,my advice is to go for something like this,my advice is to rent it on video and watch
1,it 's also a movie about a woman who has to deal with her daughter and is trying to find his son,it is a movie that has a few moments in it that are very touching but it 's also not the same
1,although i have read many of the other comments here on this site i think,although the plot is simple it is not all that great to begin with
1,the only reason this movie did n't get me is,the film does n't have a very funny ending
1,after this movie i could have written the story for the film but it did n't,after reading this review i thought it was going to be a good movie that was n't
1,what makes this movie so interesting is that you ca,what i liked about this film was the scenery
1,this movie is a must see,this movie is one that you 'll
1,director john boorman was the master of the macabre,director and writer john sturges who directed the movie and
1,the first time we see the film and we hear about it the next morning is an old man who,the only problem with this show is the way it 's done and it shows no signs at all
1,distributed in the uk it 's not a very good story and it 's the same,distributed in the same year as the bbc remake with the same old formula the first series
1,perhaps it was a mistake for that to happen,perhaps the only thing that was funny was the fact
1,there was no plot to speak of,there is also a lot of footage of
1,i have no problem with a movie like this,i think this is why it is a movie that
1,it 's not that this film is n't so bad,it was just as great as the first two
1,as for the rest of the film i found that a lot of the acting was passable,as an avid reader of the novel it was a bit too long ago but i think the
1,this is one of the few films,this film is a real shame
1,marilyn parker 's portrayal of the mother is a little more complex than she is in a movie like this,marilyn monroe is also a fine actress and a very sexy actress that has no acting talent but she does a
1,also the ending was pretty stupid and the,also the ending is a bit abrupt
1,while i was n't a child i was still waiting for the next scene of the film,while the original is a bit too dark and too violent and a good dose of the film
1,the plot line is pretty bad but the film just does n't seem to,the first thing that made me mad was its utter lack of originality
1,unlike other movies like the first movie this is not one of,unlike the other films this is one of my favorite movies
1,it 's a very good movie and it 's not the best performance of the film,it would be nice to see a movie that could be a bit more entertaining than this
1,and what was the point of this,and the scene where one of the guys
1,actually i would say that the film had a few moments of suspense and suspense but,actually i think the director was trying to be creative and the movie failed miserably
1,the first half and then a couple of characters who are killed off by the,the plot is a mess but the movie itself is n't bad at all
1,maybe this movie was n't a complete success,maybe if you 're looking for something to see
1,i think the best thing i can say about a movie that makes a statement about it is that it has a lot of,i have to admit this movie has been a long time since my childhood and i still have a fondness for the film
1,make me wonder if it 's all about the film,make sure that you 're just watching a bunch of movies
1,jakob 's wife is a film that does n't have to be the most faithful,jakob is a very beautiful movie and the actors are very talented and believable
1,when the two main characters are introduced in a way the characters are,when they were released they were n't even in the same league
1,oh and it 's not that bad as the first time around,oh and the soundtrack is very good as the camera zooms up to
1,the acting was n't great but there are better ways to spend a couple of hours,the first time i saw this film i had heard about this film in 1976
1,this is not your everyday everyday,this film is a total waste of
1,it is a film of sorts,it is also a very good movie
1,it 's a shame because this one does n't have to be a complete mess,it does have a good plot but it has to do with a bad story
1,to me the best performance of this film was the performance from david niven,to me it 's one of those films where you can watch it without knowing
1,not so bad that it 's not even that bad,not that the film did a good job of being the
1,editing is good in this film,editing and editing are very good
1,not even one of those that i 've,not that it was n't that bad
1,metal is the worst movie i 've ever seen,metal is the worst film of all time
1,bruno is a very good actress and,bruno 's wife in the movie
1,the film is about a man who,the movie is a total mess
1,there was a scene where a group of men were talking about their sexual appetites and their relationship is not very convincing but i think that this film has a very good,there 's a bit of the usual suspects of a man who 's a coward in the film and a few scenes where he finds a way to save the day
1,character development of the plot is that there is,character actor john goodman is a perfect villain
1,they are both excellent actors but they are all very bad,they do n't have a single word that has the decency to
1,this movie was a great example of,this film has no redeeming value
1,there is a lot of action and some of the best scenes i 've seen on the big screen,there are two things you will never forget about and why did n't you just like to see the ending
1,in fact i 've always thought that i would have liked it a lot more,in my opinion the movie 's biggest selling point is the acting and the plot
1,it 's a good movie and i recommend this film,it 's like a student 's film and the director has
1,i have to give a few of the credit to the movie,i have seen it many times and have seen it twice
1,he 's a bit of a wimp but he 's,he is not the worst actress on this film
1,not only is the plot a bit weak the story is very predictable,not a single scene in the movie is particularly shocking or shocking but the
1,whilst i think it was meant to be one of the first things i 've ever seen it would have been a lot more interesting if they,whilst i do understand a lot of it is the fact that i do n't think it could possibly have been done with the first one
1,when i was watching the movie i was expecting to find a way of seeing something,when they are all about the size of the film you get to hear the characters
1,if you 're a fan of hers 's and the original you will like this,if you 've seen the movie the shawshank redemption is one of my favorites
1,that being said the only person that was able to keep up a copy of this is,that 's a good thing because they are making the film to a very different extent
1,in the end the film takes the cake and the story becomes entangled in,in my case a lot of the humor is not very well developed
1,it 's a pity that this movie has such a low rating,it 's not so bad it 's good it 's bad it 's
1,it 's an insult that this is only a part of the problem with the film,it 's a pity that the director did n't have to go through all of the scenes
1,the plot is a bit farfetched but the acting and direction is so awful that,the story has the usual clichs of comedy and romance to a good film
1,anyway this film has nothing to do with the first movie,anyway i have seen it several times but i 've already seen
1,season 2 is the best of the three,season 2 has some really funny jokes
1,if you are a fan of the series do n't watch it at all,if this movie had been done with the intention of a good film or a
1,made in a time where the viewer is n't given enough,made me laugh a couple times but not all that
1,norway is the most beautiful film of all time,norway and his friends are all the more interesting
1,the plot of this is the usual cliches that the filmmakers do n't make,the movie does n't have to go for a moment but that 's just a
1,the only real drawback with this film is,the movie is not about the characters
1,spoiler ahead there was nothing in the movie which seemed a bit long in a movie like this one,spoiler the film opens with an intriguing premise and some of the best lines i 've ever heard on film
1,i was very impressed with the ending,i have a theory for a movie which
1,also the movie does n't have that much plot and the characters are not even likable,also in this regard are the ones that have the same amount of depth and style as
1,the story is so ridiculous it makes the movie just like a comedy,the movie was shot in a cheap and cheap manner with the use of
1,in the end the movie was just a bad film,in a movie like this you can tell that this movie
1,i have not seen it since,i would say i was n't impressed
1,if you want to see a great movie with a good cast and an engaging,if they do n't try and be a movie they should be doing something
1,with a little more work i have to add to the movie 's overall rating,with the exception of this show that i was watching it i was n't sure how
1,how do we get to love this,how does this movie get going
1,the film is a very good film but it is not a film,the only problem i have with the movie is that the story was pretty
1,my favorite character is the one that is the only person who can make it through,my favorite line was where the main character says it all and it just goes to show
1,i saw this show on the tv network when i was a,i do n't think that this movie has any redeeming qualities
1,the acting is horrible and the plot is,the plot line is a bit predictable
1,schreiber 's direction seems to be a little too tight but this is a movie for the,schreiber is a master of the spaghetti westerns but is a bit more of a mess
1,and the fact that the main character is,and the ending is just so bad
1,we 're talking about how the world has been in our lives but the reality of the movie is that there is no reason for it to be,we get a glimpse of how the film 's end of the film is going to end the end but the ending does n't make any sense
1,nowhere else is an excellent piece of,nowhere that the movie was made
1,it seems as though a film of the calibre of the great depression is missing the,it is a movie which has been made by the same director as the godfather
1,update of a book i 've read but i was surprised to see it was a film,update is not even worth seeing if you 're looking for something more entertaining and original
1,if you have n't seen this movie do n't waste your money on a film,if you have the opportunity to see this movie you must check out the movie for
1,the film does n't have that much of a plot it does n't even have any suspense and the action scenes are n't very,the only reason this film was being made is because they 're all on the way up the line and it 's not
1,the acting was horrible the plot is awful,the story and plot development was so weak i
1,the story is simple and the acting is very good but it 's just,the movie is not a great film and it 's not that great
1,cimino 's adaptation of a book of the same name is a true,cimino is one of those directors that will never forget his craft
1,i would have given up with it,i have to say this film was a
1,impatient in the world is not even more,impatient the film 's story line is an adaptation
1,this movie is a complete mess,this is a great family film
1,it 's a shame because this sequel is a bit too much,it 's the kind of movie where the viewer feels like a voyeur
1,everyone in it seems to have a lot of fun and the acting,everyone else is just as good as the ones in this movie
1,do n't expect any of the other reviews i 've seen,do you know if he was just a bad guy
1,would n't it be so funny to see the same movie again,would you like to see a movie with a lot of nudity and
1,at the same time it 's a good movie to watch,at first glance i thought the ending was pretty lame as was
1,it 's a shame that such a poor production is n't available on video,it 's not the first movie that makes me want to see the movie again
1,an excellent and excellent film that was made on a low budget in many ways,an interesting idea to show us the world in which he is in love with one
1,after the first two hours of the movie you start thinking what is going on at the end,after watching the first episode it seemed like a bunch of people had decided that they were making a
1,people are not so bad that we have to make you,people in this forum are not aware of this movie
1,the first thing we know is the,the plot is pretty much nonexistent
1,the movie 's climax is a complete joke,the plot is simple enough to make up for
1,quotes are very good but this film does not have any of the charm of the original,quotes like this are supposed to convey my belief that this was a movie about a man who
1,tim robbins is a delight to play a character who is a likable character,tim burton is a great director and a good director who does a decent job
1,but i was very impressed when a movie like this could get the buzz out of my mouth and i do n't,but if you can get hold of it i would have liked to have it done a couple of years ago
1,anyways it 's a good movie,anyways it 's a little too hard
1,from then on the plot moves slowly as a group of teens go along with a very strange ending and end up being stalked by a mutant killer who possesses a serum that is supposed to have occurred,from the opening scene to the very last shot in the movie where a young boy 's mother goes into a house with a woman 's daughter and her daughter who is in love with her the film is
1,it was a very entertaining experience,it was a little more enjoyable in
1,i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart or a heart,i think that this film is very much a bit of a thriller
1,lots to get the message done but,lots of action and action sequences
1,serial mom is a pretty good movie,serial killers have a similar theme of what
1,i think it would be better to see how the movie should be done,i do n't know where the movie ends but i can only imagine how much
1,at first he is reluctant to leave the,at least he was in the film
1,this is a film for those who have a heart and a sense of humor,this movie is the most perfect example of an australian movie in my opinion and that
1,it 's the best thing you can find with a film,it was so bad that it was n't even worth it 's
1,also the scene where she is talking about the death of his parents is just a,also the acting is n't bad the script is bad the plot just plain stupid
1,and i did n't know who the,and the acting was pretty good
1,what is the definition of this film,what is the deal with the character of
1,and the film does n't really have to be,and that 's all i have to say
1,forgotten in the first few seconds that this film is a remake of the first movie i,forgotten the ending is so predictable that the movie is just a little bit too slow
1,i saw this at the boston film festival and have not been disappointed,i was n't impressed to see the movie for the whole family and the
1,enter the world and his mother 's love and his father and their son who are the only ones who,enter a few of my favorite movies and i will always be the same person in the first place
1,i do n't know why but i have the feeling i 'd rather have a vinyl video,i have to agree with those who commented on this movie the way the film was made and
1,however the film was made up for it 's purpose in the first,however this was one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,saturated in a single syllable and the result is a beautiful film which has the potential to be a film that will,saturated with a great deal of action and a few laughs in the end the end result is a classic movie
1,left the movie with the possibility that the director and producer were trying to be more and,left to go to sleep and be left alone in a hospital with one of them
1,finally this is one of the most entertaining films,finally this movie was a waste of time
1,kate beckinsale has a great performance here,kate beckinsale is a woman who loves her
1,i was so excited when i watched the first episode,i think the movie could be a lot better
1,but if i had n't been to the end of the film i would,but the story is n't bad and is a complete waste of time
1,i was very impressed with the story,i have a fondness for the film as
1,do you know that you 'll be able to suspend your disbelief and,do n't get me started on the acting skills of this film
1,the film also features a very funny scene,the acting ranges from decent to mediocre
1,if this is a true story about a group of people who are in,if i can get the point it 's the way it was made
1,the film 's climax is a bit of a disappointment but in the end it was a great movie nonetheless and it 's a shame that the,the plot is very thin and the characters are so shallow and so annoying that i ca n't imagine how they could get away with it
1,in the book the main character is a woman of,in the end you 'll be glad you did
1,we are supposed to be a little too young to be scared but i just do not understand that,we get an endless stream of scenes involving various shots that are so obviously done to make the film a
1,something like this i have not seen the trailer,something is wrong with the movie that has no plot
1,or is it a bad film,or maybe he 's not even a
1,bullitt is a great example of how many movies can become formulaic and the story,bullitt is the best film that i have seen for quite a long time
1,brett is also the best of the two movies and this one is very funny,brett is a very good actor and his wife is a perfect combination of character comedy
1,the story was interesting but it was too short,the movie has a lot of action and suspense and
1,some of the best parts of the film were the clips of the characters and,some have commented on how much more of the film 's budget and more
1,from that point on we are treated to a completely different story,from the opening shot of a train crashing through the desert to the
1,i do n't know how to make a movie,i do n't know how many people on the imdb
1,it is also a very good film,it 's also very hard to find a
1,i have n't seen the original so i have n't seen the original,i saw this movie in the theater in the theater in my hometown when
1,charm is not the most important thing i do,charm and the beast was a great show that could
1,we all know that the movie is about a young girl in prison,we know the film 's going to go down as the most expensive but
1,he 's not as funny and as he seems to have just punched the,he is also an alcoholic who lives at a nearby apartment in london
1,on the other hand the acting was superb,on the whole the movie is very funny and
1,while i do not like the film it was very disappointing to watch as it seemed to have been made with a lot of action,while the movie is quite dated with no extras and the camera work is n't the worst part of the film the acting is pretty good
1,not only does she do so much of that she,not even worth mentioning for the film 's end
1,i am not sure what this film is about the story is that of a woman in the first film,i would like to thank god that it was n't so much of a cult film i do n't know how
1,another thing that is missing is the way the characters are portrayed to be honest,another thing that i did n't like is why the film is so long that it
1,there were many other films that came out of the mouths of the late great american,there 's no way to stop this turkey from being a complete waste of time
1,the plot is about a bunch of friends who are in prison for the murder of,the movie starts with a bunch of people being killed by a group of thugs
1,i was a little disappointed in this movie,i do n't understand how it 's possible to
1,please do n't waste your time on it,please do n't waste your time or money on
1,it was a good idea and i was impressed by the fact that it was a movie in the middle of the movie,it 's the first time i had ever watched it in the theater i have a fondness for a copy of this film
1,there is n't one good line in,there 's a lot of action
1,the movie is a bit slow moving and it 's almost a,the plot is so simple and the characters are so onedimensional
1,i do n't think that any movie can be,i was expecting a lot but was disappointed
1,spoilers the movie is a bit too long,spoilers alert the movie is a mess
1,he does not need to be alone at home,he 's the only actor in the film who has
1,the acting was good the story was good but i liked it,the film is not so great that it is so difficult to see
1,the movie is n't bad enough but that was the only reason i watched it so i did not get to see it in a theater,the script is a joke but it 's a bit of a mess and i did laugh at how many minutes i was left wondering what happened
1,time travel is a good film,time travel is a good movie
1,but the film is a real treat to watch in a theater and a lot of people have seen the film that,but the real world the movie is not that it is not a typical hollywood production it is n't very original
1,a good movie to have to say,a great example of this is how it
1,the movie is a good film,the movie is also a good example
1,it was the most beautiful and beautiful i 've seen to date,it 's not a bad movie but it 's a good film
1,it was the most expensive and boring scene of my life i have yet to see,it does n't make sense and is a real shame because i was n't sure if i
1,it 's the only thing that i liked about the first movie and that was a,it is a very good story and it is the best film of the year
1,i 've seen this movie several times and i still laugh at it,i 've heard the book was published in the us but the acting is
1,whoopi goldberg is one of the best actors on screen,whoopi goldberg is a good actress but she does n't make
1,many of his fans of this movie were obviously trying too hard to make a movie and he failed miserably,many people have complained about this film and i do n't think it 's a good idea to show the director
1,with all the faults of this production it 's a very entertaining film for the whole family it is a mustsee,with this one the only thing that was n't that bad was the acting by everyone involved with the movie
1,i think this film is a great tribute to the original series,i was surprised that they did n't use the word to describe this
1,this movie is a must see,this is one of the most beautiful
1,that was the most disappointing aspect of this film the most memorable scene in the movie is when,that is how this movie got to me and i think it should be a good movie
1,if you are a fan of the original film then this is the movie for you,if you want to make a movie about the real world of the 80 's you might
1,i was surprised that it was not released in dvd format,i have seen some of the other films in the series and
1,the movie was not for the fainthearted but also,the movie is also a very good film
1,quiet and very funny and it 's all so,quiet and simple is a very good film
1,unfortunately the film is not very much of a disappointment and,unfortunately it 's not the same as the other three
1,but it 's a good movie,but the film is a little slow
1,i am amazed at the amount of,i was surprised by this film
1,frankly i was a bit disappointed by the,frankly this is n't a bad thing
1,as the movie opens you 're left with a feeling of dread and joy,as far as i know this film is a remake of one of the best
1,he is an expert of sorts in,he is a very good actor
1,his mother and son are a real boy,his acting is so great that it 's a
1,for the rest of the time it is a film with a strong premise,for example it is a shame that the writers were not able for their own
1,watch the original movie with an extra knowledge of what was going on in the,watch it and you 'll find out that it is a very bad film
1,all the other actors are very convincing,all in all i was surprised by what
1,hollywood does n't make a lot of sense,hollywood should be ashamed of themselves for making such
1,i do n't know who the attacker would really be,i am amazed that they spent so much money and effort
1,on the other hand if you 're a fan of the original then you will probably not be disappointed,on a positive note the film has a very strong and intriguing look for detail which is why the movie
1,i have no respect for that fact,i would love to find out if this
1,in fact if you are a fan of the,in the end this is an excellent film
1,i 've been a fan of the likes of david lean and david cronenberg,i am surprised that he is n't able to make films like this
1,perhaps i missed something and i would n't be surprised that i was in the theatre,perhaps the film is n't worth seeing for the fact that it 's a remake of a
1,it 's not a very good movie,it was the first film i 've seen
1,and it does n't make for a great film,and i do n't know how to explain the story
1,irwin harrelson 's portrayal of his character is very convincing as a man who is determined to go on the lam for the big,irwin allen plays a young man in the early stages of his film who is in the right hands at the wrong moment
1,when it 's over and foremost is going to be the only thing that is,when he arrives to see the movie it 's not a very good movie
1,some of it is a bit corny and some of it is very good but i,some scenes were very funny and the actors were all very good in their roles
1,for the record i was a bit confused and i was surprised at the film,for the first 30 minutes i thought the film was pretty much a little bit too
1,for example the scene where a man eats a,for the record it is not that good
1,so the movie is very boring,so what i found most interesting was
1,i'm sorry but that 's not the case,i'm sure you could have read the book by
1,such as the scene where he is walking in the water,such an issue would be an insult to the audience
1,this is a very very very good,this is a really bad movie
1,the film also features a very interesting performance by john turturro,the first thing i remember about this movie is that the director
1,there was no way that a sequel to the exorcist series would be like this,there is an interesting twist when the movie ends and the viewer gets the impression that
1,this movie is one that i think the,this was a great show for me
1,i was so bored and disappointed in it and i have seen it dozens of,i was surprised how much i enjoyed the film and thought it looked interesting
1,daryl hannah is a good actress and i have to admit that i was n't surprised to see her in such films as the ones,daryl hannah is an attractive actress as the young girl and the film opens with a very touching climax and a very interesting finale
1,is there some kind of a film where,is there a way out of that
1,it 's a pity that this movie did n't get released because of it 's success,it 's a very funny movie about a family of young adults who have a reunion on
1,we are supposed to feel like we 're watching a movie,we see the same guy who is the only one who 's
1,as an adult i am not a parent but this is a great family film,as an avid fan of horror and horror films i thought this was a very good
1,let the audience take a peek on this story,let us know the real life of this man and
1,i am a fan of the original series and i,i would have preferred to have seen it again
1,well it was a good film but i really did not know what a good film it,well i 've seen this movie many times and i think it is a must see
1,one wonders why i was not laughing at this movie and did n't want,one of my favorite movies i 've seen in quite some time now
1,he 's a good guy but his wife has nothing to do with him,he is a great actor but he never really shines in this film
1,this is a film that is worth watching,this was the worst movie i have ever seen
1,she has to go to the house and she is forced to do what she can to avoid herself,she is a great actress and it is a shame because she 's a great actress who is a real
1,the movie is a little confusing but the acting was so good it was really funny,the movie is a very boring affair with a bunch of characters thrown together at the same
1,the only thing that kept me from watching this movie was the fact that the actors,the movie was very bad the acting is pretty bad and the story is bad
1,i have to say that this was an excellent movie,i was surprised that this film was made in the near
1,the movie is a very entertaining action comedy,the acting is so terrible it was painful to
1,she does n't get a chance to go to a party,she is the one who does n't want to be
1,i think i 've seen worse acting from steven segal,i have no problem with the fact that the characters are
1,but if you do n't mind watching this movie i recommend you see this one,but i do n't know if they were or not the movie was not the first
1,a movie to watch for the kids who get the chance,a movie is made to be viewed by many people
1,true the movie 's plot is so ridiculous but it 's so good it,true the movie has the worst editing and production i have ever seen
1,and what 's with the whole idea of a woman being impregnated by one woman and her mother,and then there 's a lot of people in the theater saying hey i do n't get to say
1,the story was a little farfetched but it was a,the plot is not a good idea at all
1,she 's a little too old too young to,she was the best part of the film
1,1st watched this movie for the second time,1st watched it 4 out of 10 receptive to
1,the plot twists of the story and the plot of,the film is not so bad it 's funny
1,unfortunately it is so poorly done and acted that it 's not funny,unfortunately he never really does that he is a very bad person
1,i 've never seen a more beautiful movie and i would love to see,i 've seen the trailer for this movie and it 's so bad
1,they have a few good moments and the acting,they 're the ones who have made a few changes
1,at the start of the movie there 's a little boy who is a witch and,at one point he 's a victim of a film he 's supposed to be
1,i do n't know if they are making movies,i was a big fan of the book
1,the script is also a little preachy,the first half is a bit slow but
1,there was a little bit of humor in the movie that made the film hard to follow,there was no mention in this movie that you could have a movie with a little bit of
1,the plot is so bad that you ca n't help but laugh,the movie is very very good and very funny but it also fails
1,i am surprised by how much of a story it was,i was surprised at the fact that this movie would have made
1,this film is a real treat to,this movie has no redeeming features
1,when i was a little boy the movie was so funny and so funny,when i saw her at the end and her first film i was in my
1,even the usually mentioned david lynch has a,even the music is pretty good too
1,in this movie he was a great man and he was a great actor to watch,in the end you are left wondering whether or not the characters are going to be real
1,the movie 's only redeeming feature is that it has been released in many,the plot has the potential to be a classic but it 's not
1,i am not sure how this film was going to get nominated for a oscar,i have to agree with some of the other comments on the imdb comment
1,played by a guy who plays him the most,played by michael douglas is the only one
1,like the movie 's a little bit of a good idea and a lot of action,like a child in this movie it is very hard to find anything funny about it
1,if you 're going to watch a movie that is supposed,if you like this movie i would n't be surprised
1,to make matters worse the film is just not as interesting as,to be fair this movie is not even a good film
1,i saw the movie in the theater when i was a child,i have to say i'm going to say that this is one of
1,the only thing that kept me watching is the acting,the plot line is very weak and the plot is not
1,i was so excited by the way that one was left speechless,i do believe that there was a lot more of that
1,was this supposed to be a comedy,was it really a movie about the evils
1,this film is an absolute delight,this is one of the worst movies
1,but i did n't really get to know,but this one is a real stinker
1,the movie is about a man named sam,the film also suffers from a lot of scenes
1,a good example of how a movie is supposed to have made an entire film and i feel that,a movie that should be shown in the theater and a lot of people are laughing at it
1,by the time you see it all the other characters seem like you 're going to be a bit bored,by the time it started i was really bored to tears and not caring about any of the characters
1,oh yeah and a bit of nudity,oh yeah and the fact that i had
1,of mice the only real thing i have to say is the,of course the main story line is a bit predictable though
1,definitely a good film for everyone who loves the genre,definitely not a movie to watch in the theater
1,also the music is very good,also a good movie for me was
1,as a result the movie 's plot is n't really that interesting as it 's the,as far as being concerned this is a pretty good film and a great movie
1,you 're not going to see it,you 'll be glad you did
1,also the film looks like the director of the film,also it 's a shame that they did n't have the
1,i 've been waiting for the video release for the last few years and i 've always found it,i think this movie was a waste of time and it was n't even funny in the least
1,an interesting premise is a very simple idea,an insult to anyone who likes this film
1,there are so many other examples of this film,there 's no reason to see this film but that
1,the film opens as the title suggests the importance,the story is about love in the city
1,only this film has been released in hollywood,only one of the three leads that are in
1,it 's not even worth mentioning the movie,it is a story of two men who have
1,a very good film by robert altman and one of,a movie that will be a success for me
1,however there were a lot of great things to say about this,however the only thing that kept me watching was the acting
1,these are two great stories and a good cast,these guys are the same guys in the same house
1,it 's a pity that the movie,it is a very good film
1,it has the same kind of humor the story and its,it 's just a good movie and a good movie
1,second the movie is a bit too long and it 's almost too long,second the film has a very interesting and entertaining look and a good cast
1,back in the day i was able to find a way back to the first hour,back in the day of my youth we are shown to a very young girl that i
1,a film that has the potential to make a movie about a young,a good movie that has been done many times over the years
1,you 'll be able to sit through it and then get it on,you do n't see any of the characters in the movie either
1,it is a story about the power and tribulations of one person,it would have been nice to see a more realistic character
1,worth watching once if you can get a copy of a copy of it,worth mentioning that the characters were not likable and i would love the director to
1,clint eastwood is the only one who,clint eastwood is a great actor
1,i do n't think that the film was intended to be a comedy in its own right the acting is very good,i am not sure why the director should not get the film to the point of the movie but it will be a
1,also the ending is a little abrupt,also a lot of people in the world
1,and what is the deal with the,and that 's not saying something
1,not only was it poorly acted it also had no suspense and was,not only is it a good film the acting is very good
1,the acting is horrible and the plot is very,the film 's biggest flaw is its predictability
1,made in the early '80s i had seen the movie the first time and was very impressed with the movie,made in 1938 this movie is a great example of how to craft a film that is a real tearjerker
1,finally i have no idea what 's the worst thing i have ever seen in my life,finally the film 's final revelation is revealed in its entirety as a very funny sequence in which
1,yes this show has some great actors and some decent action,yes there 's a few scenes but it is n't
1,some people may find it offensive that this movie has a few flaws but they are n't,some have commented here that this is not a film in a word but i think it is
1,long after the success of the first movie i thought i should say the best,long time dead time is a movie about a group of people who have nothing against
1,emir was not the only one to do this as it was,emir is a great actress that is n't really as funny as the
1,providence is a film where you feel you have to make a good movie,providence 's direction was very good the story could have been great and the direction
1,while the film is a bit slow paced with its relatively slow pace the film is a total waste of time,while the film is set in new york it has the potential of the early 70 's slasher films like this one
1,while the movie does have its moments it 's a bit too much,while i am a fan of the original and i have enjoyed this one
1,it 's a movie with a lot of laughs,it was the first time we had ever given a
1,crap like this is not funny,crap is a movie that should never
1,i 've seen a lot of bad movies and this was a,i would have given this a zero if only 1 star
1,it 's a good thing to watch this movie,it 's a good movie but not a bad movie
1,he 's got a lot of talent and is n't afraid to get into trouble,he has the ability of a new man to make a movie that has the power
1,the film is n't a very good one either,the plot was so weak and ridiculous that i was
1,it is not a comedy to make a movie like these,it 's the worst movie that i have ever seen in my
1,they are all pretty well executed and they are believable to the audience,they have been in the past for years of the living dead and have
1,the acting is pretty good but the,the script is also quite weak
1,those who have the slightest attention and do n't care how you can get a copy of this movie to make a movie,those who think this film is a good thing are the very funny and sad aspects that i have noticed that they are not
1,in a way it reminded me of what happened after watching this movie and not in a movie like it,in the movie she was given the choice of a young girl who was not in the school at all
1,i do n't care for the character of the story but his performance is so powerful that i could n't take it,i was expecting this film to be a little bit of a disappointment but i was pleasantly surprised by the ending
1,in the end the movie just does n't seem to get any better,in the beginning of the movie the director says a lot and it really
1,one of the most memorable moments of this movie,one of the most important movies i 've ever seen
1,i think it is an excellent film,i have n't read the book and was
1,unfortunately he 's not a hero,unfortunately the film has no redeeming qualities
1,helen mirren was great and this has a,helen mirren is a delight to watch
1,add to this a very strong plot and some good performances,add to that the fact that it takes a little bit of
1,surely a bit more of an effort to be a sequel for the viewer the viewer is n't really a bit surprised by the film 's plot,surely not in the same breath as the one with the same but still the one that is so bad that you 'll laugh at it
1,i was really looking forward to this,i do n't want to spoil that but
1,other than that it 's not a bad movie,other than that it 's just a dull waste of
1,the film is very well done and the acting is excellent,the first part of the movie is a little slow at times
1,she also has a nice voice that,she was also in the film
1,go see the movie for your consideration,go see it and then see the real
1,there is nothing wrong with the fact that the movie is n't as,there 's a lot of action but nothing that would have happened
1,but the movie was n't bad,but there 's a lot of the
1,my favorite part of the movie,my advice do n't buy this movie
1,however there are so many good things in the film and it makes the film more entertaining than the first two,however the only reason i gave it 2 stars was because that was the only reason i watched it to the end
1,once i heard it i had a chance to see it again but it,once you see the film you can see the influence of the characters
1,or is he trying to save the world,or at least a couple of years later
1,after all a great film to watch with your buddies you can see the difference and the movie is a lot better than i have imagined that they are in fact the most boring piece of,after a few minutes we are forced to see the final battle in his car which turns out to be a very good thriller with some of the best action scenes of his last years
1,she is a great actress and she 's very convincing but she was very good in the movie,she 's a very nice actress but she did the same with a bit of her hair
1,secondly it 's a bit of a stretch for anyone who has seen this film,secondly if you 're not a fan of the movie i think you should see this
1,they are n't even remotely good either,they did not even know the exact same
1,i 've read a few of his other books but i,i 've never read a book that is so bad
1,a film that is very well written and directed,a movie that is so stupid that i ca n't
1,as a film maker it is n't a good idea at all,as i said this is one of the best movies to come out
1,at one point the audience is treated to the fact that it is a true story,at first i thought that was a bad movie but i did not care about the characters
1,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen,this is a movie that should have never been released
1,he 's a very good actor and he plays it a role,he is a good man and the movie is very funny
1,i am amazed that he did n't get such a big oscar nomination and he,i was very impressed by the fact that it was made by a man
1,he 's the only one that 's not so bad he 's just annoying,he has to be one of the most versatile actors of all time and he
1,with the help of a new agent who is a doctor in his home town,with all of the above the great actors of their caliber have been a big star
1,there is n't a moment in the movie where she 's the only one who has ever walked out of,there was an element of the story and it seemed to be a little too long for the audience
1,the film has a very dark and gloomy atmosphere,the film has an excellent ensemble of characters
1,its very hard to understand how many of,its a shame that it was made
1,for the time this was made up a notch of the first two films and,for example the two women are not in the movie for a long time
1,this film is about how bad it is and what it is is n't an action flick,this is a great example of how to make a movie about a man in a different form
1,if you 're into this show do n't go see it,if you like to think that this movie will appeal to you
1,rawhide is a very good film about the,rawhide 's performance is also pretty good
1,araki does n't want the ending of the film to end,araki has made a great film that is so bad
1,and that 's the problem with the story,and i do believe that the director and actors
1,so much of the story takes place in the middle where you 're introduced,so why not make a documentary about how a person 's life could be changed
1,honestly it does n't work as a movie,honestly if you can get the chance to watch
1,they are not funny but they are fun to watch,they were all very good and the only thing that really
1,please avoid the movie at all costs,please do n't waste your time or money
1,i was a little skeptical when it was a little over the top but i think i was,i was expecting a film from the us so i thought i had to check it out
1,i would n't have had this been a better movie,i am a fan of this type of movie
1,then he is asked to go back with the help of the girl,then i have to admit i was n't impressed by this movie
1,and that 's all the movie does to the viewer,and the scene where he is supposed to be in his
1,the movie also features interviews in the movie with different stories that are so much more than,the film opens with the death of a woman and a woman who is not alone
1,i have a problem with the movie,i have n't seen the original but still
1,as far as the film goes it 's not a great movie,as a film fan it has an interesting premise and it 's a
1,the story is simple enough to make you want to throw,the only redeeming thing about this film is the acting
1,i do n't know how this movie was made,i have never forgotten it but i have n't seen
1,he 's not a very good actor,he 's the best of them
1,i have n't laughed so hard at a film in years i actually,i was very disappointed with the acting but it seemed very good
1,he was just too old for the part,he does n't even have the money to get
1,he has no problems with her and she 's,he was the one who wrote his books
1,stray dog is a wonderful movie that i would recommend to everyone,stray dog does n't mean it 's a bad movie but it is
1,the only saving grace of this movie is the casting of,the film has the potential to be a good movie
1,the acting is n't great though not bad the effects are poor,the only thing that i would give is that it is a complete
1,can they be in the right place,can you please do not watch this movie
1,prints of the original play from the,prints were pretty good as well
1,the script and direction are very good,the film is not very funny
1,ok the film is quite interesting but it has a lot of problems,ok so i do applaud that the acting was n't terrible but it did
1,ben stiller is the best actor in this whole film,ben gazzara is great as the conflicted and determined husband
1,bray sen jr is an excellent actor and he is also quite good as the conflicted father who is also a very,bray vs kramer is a good film for the first half of the film but that 's what made it special
1,other than that the film is n't a total disaster,other characters include the mother and son and the daughter
1,in addition to his acting ability he 's not a,in the end it 's a pretty bad movie
1,the film is a real treat in the storytelling department,the film has an enormous amount of humor and the occasional
1,kay and her husband were both very funny but i think the director should have given him,kay rampling is a great actor and should have won her oscar for best supporting actor
1,he also gets a lot of opportunities for making this movie as a whole,he is a very beautiful woman who is not afraid to make a living life
1,if you 're a diehard fan of this type of movies you 'll probably like it,if you 're not a fan of the genre this movie is n't for you
1,the movie is also about a bunch of people who live in a remote cabin where each one is in a different place and then the two meet a,the film has a very interesting story about a young man who has been sent to the island to find his son and is a very gifted musician
1,you know that the movie has n't got a good story but it does n't take too long,you 'll see a lot of people in this movie who are n't very good or very good actors
1,first off the plot is n't that bad and i think it was made with a lot of effort by a few friends and,first there has to be some sort of a movie about a guy who gets his head on a man and his girlfriend
1,i 've seen a lot of films with the same actors but this one was not,i do n't know what to say about a movie that i did n't care
1,as i watched the movie i could n't wait,as the film opens he 's the only real one
1,let 's face this you will never find out why i did n't care for the,let 's make it clear that i did n't really understand the movie at all
1,al pacino and his crew have to take,al pacino 's direction is also good
1,one of the best movies ever made,one of my favorite scenes of all was
1,i do n't remember that but it was a fun to see,i think this movie should have been a razzie for a movie
1,a few years earlier i had a fondness for the show,a lot of the movie 's characters and characters are introduced and
1,a young girl has to go out of his life to get her revenge on the,a movie that was not only in a sense of humor but to the actors
1,up until this point i thought i was watching something interesting and original but,up until now i was expecting something better than i expected to watch
1,not only is he a great villain he is a real human,not even the actors who are able to make it worthwhile
1,i do n't remember anything of her,i have to confess i was n't disappointed
1,alone a film of a young man in a mental institution who is a woman who 's been,alone a movie that i would recommend only if they were to see the first three hours
1,whenever it comes to a plot and the characters and plot twists it 's all about the real,whenever she is asked that he is a victim of his son the woman is the same
1,vaguely i did not think the director did,vaguely the plot is pretty weak too
1,although it has its flaws and its drawbacks i am not a fan and have not seen it since the first time i was watching it,although it 's the first one i 've been a big fan of the classic film i was expecting to see the first film and i thought
1,supporting cast is fine but the film is very boring,supporting roles are all pretty good and there 's a nice
1,i think it should have won a razzie award for its portrayal of a man who had been born for the war,i would have liked a movie that had a little more depth and the plot was a bit of the first
1,if you have not seen the movie it 's not for you,if i had n't read the book i would 've liked to have
1,it has a good premise and a lot of good things going,it 's a shame because the movie is n't that bad
1,i was surprised how many of those were not even in the film,i do n't think it was ever intended to get a theatrical release but
1,the first time i saw this movie i was not,the plot of this film is n't too complicated
1,i was a huge fan of the original,i am a big fan of the genre but
1,the only good thing about this movie is the music,the plot and characters are all believable and there is some
1,there are a few funny moments but the rest of the film is a bore,there 's also a bit of suspense and a lot of action but this film was
1,this is the type of movie you have a lot of money,this is a movie that i think is supposed to have some serious
1,the plot of this film has been told in many ways by the director and i thought that it was a decent,the plot is about a group of young kids who go to new york to find their parents in their home
1,here 's what you 're seeing,here he plays a character in an
1,kaufman 's character development is a little bit overdone,kaufman 's film is n't a total mess but a
1,where the film is set is a little hazy and the characters,where the hell did they get the money for this one
1,now i have seen a few of the films i like,now the film is about the family life and its impact on
1,honestly i do have a problem with that,honestly the movie was so horrible it 's laughable
1,impressing the actors with their faces and the dialogue,impressing in the film 's a good way of making
1,they did not even try and get the idea they 're trying,they all know how to handle the situation of the characters
1,part of it was that the director did n't make a movie,part of this is the way the movie was set out
1,it is the worst film i have ever seen but it 's not just because it 's so bad,it 's not a good movie it 's just not worth watching if you 're looking for a good horror
1,i have seen the first one so far,i have seen the original movie and this is
1,10 i would like it to be a bit more interesting,10 out of 10 stars and i think they 're a good
1,in the end this is the worst movie i 've ever seen,in fact this is the only film i have ever walked out with
1,and that 's why it 's so funny,and the acting is so poor that i do
1,this is not to be missed in any way,this film has a good story line to work with
1,we have to endure a movie to get some credit,we are shown in the movie that it is a movie
1,if you do n't know how to get you to watch and enjoy it then i recommend,if you are looking for the worst film ever made then you 'll not be disappointed
1,still i would recommend it for anybody with a taste for films that are good,still it has its charms and is not only one of the most powerful films of
1,the only redeeming quality of the movie is the soundtrack,the movie is about a young woman who is trying to
1,the acting is pretty good with a few exceptions,the acting is horrible from the entire cast
1,for the first few minutes of the movie i,for the first hour i was very bored
1,but this time the movie was not so horrible,but i do not think this movie was good and
1,a film to be cherished by people who are not into the history of war or the war,a few of those scenes that were so stupid you could n't help but feel sorry for him
1,director john mctiernan was known to be the producer of the first two films of the series and this is n't one but his acting is not as impressive as a film with a couple,director john frankenheimer has crafted a truly stunning and memorable film about the evils of a young man who 's being driven by a woman who is so much more articulate than she is
1,i have to admit that i was disappointed at,i am amazed how the film was made
1,the film opens with one shot in which a group of men get into their car while a bunch of friends are stranded,the plot of the first film was a bit too thin in places but it 's a good thing and it works
1,afterward it is a bit slow and the plot is so contrived as to be,afterward the film is a total mess and not the best of the bunch
1,i think the film is a very interesting one as it was an attempt at humor,i was hoping that someone would make the movie a little better and maybe i could not
1,the acting is pretty good the story is interesting and is well worth the time,the movie is n't bad at all and the plot does n't work at all
1,but the film is a complete failure,but it is also a great film
1,it does n't matter as much as,it was a very interesting story
1,i was a little skeptical that the show is canceled and the show was canceled,i saw the movie in my hometown and i thought it would be interesting because the
1,which is the most disturbing thing i have ever seen,which was a good idea and the actors were all pretty
1,anyone who has a copy of this movie should see it,anyone who has seen this will be able to relate to it
1,dwight yoakam is a good actor and,dwight yoakam is an excellent actor
1,this movie is just plain funny and you have to be kidding,this movie is so bad i was n't even able to laugh at
1,just the way the movie is set was great,just as it is in this case that this movie
1,my advice is if you 're a fan of the first movie and you want to know about the real world in the middle,my advice watch this film if you are looking for a fun movie that will appeal to anyone looking for a good movie
1,other than some really stupid things,other than that i have nothing against
1,i saw this movie for the first time last night and i was amazed to see that,i was very impressed by the acting and the direction and the cinematography was very good
1,sam neill is perfect and the movie is n't even as good as the first,sam is a great character actor who has been around for a long time as the
1,i was so disgusted to hear the name of this film and i had heard that it was,i have n't seen the first two and i have to say that they are all good
1,we do n't need to have the same reaction,we get some kind of weird guy 's life and
1,i think the movie was a lot better than this and it,i have seen this movie several times since seeing it again
1,this movie has a great cast of,this film is not for everyone
1,too many things that are n't so funny and the story is just ridiculous,too bad they did n't get it for the entire movie and the ending was
1,as a result the film has no sense of reality or atmosphere whatsoever,as an example of how the film 's success would work in this case
1,the plot was a little thin and the ending was very contrived,the movie is about an evil woman who is in love with him
1,i do n't know if it 's supposed to be a comedy,i think it was a very bad attempt to cash in at a
1,look at the imdb user rating that 's the only thing this,look for those who have n't seen it in the theaters
1,its very entertaining and it is a movie about the,its a very bad movie with a terrible script
1,this is one of the best movies i have ever seen,this is a good thing that i will never forget
1,with the same title as the first film it is the same,with the addition of a couple of the movie 's most famous characters
1,here we have to see a film where,here 's a hint of the film
1,while the film does boast an interesting amount of gore and sexual references the film is quite slow and boring as a vehicle for the film,while the first one is a bit slow this is still very good as i was watching the first two games and the first one and the
1,rooney plays a good guy with an excellent performance but it 's not the best of the lot,rooney and her boyfriend are both very convincing in their own right as a young woman who becomes obsessed
1,let 's just say that he is,let me start with the plot
1,bows in the middle of a forest and then there 's no one in the movie,bows up to the first episode of a new series was aired in the same format as
1,john wayne plays his wife with his own eyes,john goodman plays a young woman named benjamin who is
1,normally i do n't like movies that,normally i was surprised and delighted
1,an american film with a great soundtrack,an interesting and very enjoyable story
1,it is the story of a young man named krishna who is sent to live with an old lady,it was not funny at all in fact it was just a little too funny to be true
1,of course i would have to say that this was a pretty good movie with some of,of course i did n't like this movie either but i have n't seen it yet
1,alex 's mother and daughter are married to each other in a very very very,alex has to be one of those who ca n't get up the street
1,if the plot is n't a little bit thin it is also very very interesting,if you 're looking for a fun movie you need to be very surprised by this
1,i was expecting a movie with the director and his friends,i am not kidding that i did n't have any expectation on
1,this is one of those movies you can watch again,this film was made for about an hour and forty minutes
1,when the main villain 's sister is kidnapped by the devil 's daughter 's sister the film becomes more bizarre to the,when he 's a young man it 's a bit like a bad idea and that is n't a good reason
1,watch it and you 'll be amazed by the fact it,watch it if your a true fan of the original
1,they do n't get to the point where the film is supposed to be,they do n't have that kind of thing to do with the movie
1,you can feel that they were the same,you know you 're in trouble by having a
1,perhaps they should n't be allowed to be a part of this film to be seen as the,perhaps the director 's intent of having a good idea was to make it an interesting film
1,the acting is good and the acting is,the movie is not a complete waste
1,the movie is a total waste of my time and time,the film is very good and has very few moments of suspense
1,it 's not a bad movie but it 's a good film,it 's a movie that you wo n't miss but you 'll have
1,a great cast and a good story but it is n't a,a very simple movie that is n't just bad or bad
1,wow this is not a bad movie,wow you 're not gonna be a fan
1,also the film is a bit too long,also the fact that he 's a bit too
1,hunt of the fireflies is another one of those movies you have to see in the theater when,hunt to say the least that the film is set in the same year as the first
1,this movie has a very bad acting and a terrible ending,this film does n't have anything to do with a plot but
1,but it 's not a total loss,but i was surprised that it ended abruptly
1,easily the worst performance of all time,easily the only one who actually liked the
1,by the time it started to finish the story is very predictable with the exception of the main character,by today 's standards it is a film about the lives of people who have not been exposed
1,this is an extremely bad film,this is a great movie that is
1,the movie has the potential to be a classic and it is one of the best i 've ever seen,the film 's climax and the final resolution in the end is a perfect example of what is wrong with the
1,eventually we learn that the real killer has a motive,eventually he gets a job to take the girl to a
1,first of all i do n't know who this is the,first of all i must say it looks pretty good
1,this is one of my favorites to watch,this movie could be a good example of how
1,there is a lot of violence but there 's some gore,there was n't a whole lot of blood but nothing else
1,she has a very small role that she did n't even look at,she 's not the most attractive and most talented actress i 've ever seen
1,in this respect the film was a little boring,in the end it was just the same old thing
1,i have to admit that this is a really great movie,i was so surprised at how good it was and it seemed
1,no one is really good either,no it was n't even good
1,it 's not as if the director has tried to cram,it 's not a very funny and very predictable movie
1,witness it as a documentary for the audience and the audience with an excellent,witness a great performance by the actor of the director and the actors
1,i was so impressed with it i felt the need to get through it and watch it,i do not think that the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for making a movie for the
1,for me the best aspect was the movie,for example the whole idea of the movie being
1,the first thing they did in their life in fact is the way,the story is very interesting and there is a lot of suspense
1,the acting is n't bad but i did n't expect much from this film,the only problem is that he does n't really get the chance to play and
1,penn and her two men are married and they have to fight in a way that makes them feel,penn 's character is a real treat for his character but his performance is a joy to watch
1,it is not that the story line is bad but it 's,it is very easy to understand the characters in these roles
1,de niro 's portrayal of a man betrayed by his own death as an assassin to the death,de niro 's character was just plain dumb and i was not surprised by the whole thing
1,yes the movie was shot in the early,yes the plot is a bit farfetched
1,this is one of my favourite movies of all time,this is the most important movie that i ever saw
1,i 've been looking forward to seeing a movie where the director of the original,i do n't know if i missed something but it is the best one
1,the film was shot entirely in the us,the acting by this film is great
1,the film is a complete bore from beginning to end,the only thing is that he was n't a bad actor
1,as for the rest of the film it is a bit of a shame,as a fan of the book i am not familiar with this film
1,odd to say the least is the story of a woman 's life in the country,odd and stupid and yet the film has no real connection to the book and i do
1,before this movie is made you feel that you should not be in your shoes,before this movie started i thought that it was going to be a great movie
1,it 's a shame that a movie like this has,it seems that he was a very gifted writer
1,how about a woman who has the guts to,how does the movie unravel a little bit
1,as a result the movie has a lot of potential,as a fan of the series i found it very entertaining
1,if you want to have fun with the film i do n't think you will ever want,if you can find something more exciting then you must be the one for the movie
1,it 's an excellent film and a great deal of it,it is a shame that the story is so simple to me
1,tea leoni is the best thing about this movie it 's the worst i have ever seen,tea is one of those movies where the viewer does n't have to watch it for what it
1,if you 're looking for a good laugh out of a few movies you might enjoy this,if you do n't want to see a film like this one you can probably find it
1,they should have been in a relationship and it would have been so much better,they are just a bunch of people who are not trying to do anything
1,comic book star wars is a good movie to watch,comic book style is a good thing but i do n't
1,in short this is probably the best,in my opinion a great movie
1,they do n't really have to be that much of a person,they are so obviously the most talented people in the world
1,i saw this film yesterday and i was impressed,i do recommend watching this movie to a very mature
1,some people will probably find the movie funny,some people have said this is a good family
1,i do n't know why they did n't even make the movie,i am a fan of the book so i'm not saying that it
1,some have claimed it is just bad,some people have commented on this movie and
1,lisa was the one who was n't a great singer and she was also,lisa 's character is a little bit shallow but that does n't matter
1,like all these movies you have a bunch,like a movie you can see it
1,but this is not a movie,but it does n't work as a
1,also i was n't impressed by how many of the episodes were,also the film has the feel of a madefortv tv episode
1,that 's all i can see,that is why i have to watch
1,but this is the worst of the bunch,but it also does n't make a lot of
1,like many of the reviewers i have seen this film,like the first film this is a real treat
1,i have seen a lot of bad movies,i do n't know where it went from
1,check out the cast is great as,check out the cast and crew
1,the acting is superb and the film makes you think and look at a very good film,the story is a bit of a mess but the plot is pretty interesting to follow
1,whether or not he 's the man who he is and what it is he wants to do it again,whether it is the fact that it was based on a true story or the story of a child or how
1,the first film is an interesting story,the acting was n't too bad though the
1,my favorite was the one with the kids in the movie,my only concern to the movie 's success of the fact that
1,your friends are the same ones who have seen it in the first place,your only other gripe is that it 's not a comedy that is so bad
1,flawed is one of the most ridiculous films i have,flawed characters and story development are the main characters
1,the movie 's main weakness of the film is that it lacks any real sense of reality it is,the first time we saw this film in the theatre i had to wait for something to happen
1,i do n't think this is the worst,i think it 's a great movie
1,it 's a shame because the movie is just so bad i ca n't say what 's worse the pluck i 've got myself from,it was a good idea to see a movie like this in the past and a couple of scenes with a lot of them
1,later he has become the most annoying and the most annoying character of a movie that i 've ever seen,later on in the film we are shown to witness an interesting friendship and the film is a bit slow paced
1,none of the characters are sympathetic enough to have been in a relationship and that 's why we have to be,none of the characters seem likable or likable and neither is the girl that she has been trying to do
1,what a waste of time money and time,what the hell were we supposed to say
1,this film is about as much like a movie as it 's a slice of life with a capital e,this is a good example of what the budget of a film can do with a budget a movie
1,the only redeeming feature of this film were the sets and costumes,the only good parts in the movie are when a couple of the
1,it 's not the best movie in the series it just makes me laugh,it 's a shame that such a good movie could have given it an r
1,the movie is about a man who is a thief who is the,the acting is n't bad and the movie is not very good
1,but the movie is a total failure,but this is a movie that does n't
1,the only problem was that it was n't a good film,the acting is horrible and the script is so bad
1,now i have n't watched it since i saw it but it was n't,now i am not alone with this film i have to be honest
1,and it 's a great film,and that 's why i think it
1,the film is also the best thing about the book,the only good part is that it has a few good
1,oh yeah it 's all about the world,oh and the final showdown at the end in
1,it 's an odd story of the hardships and tribulations of a young man who has a very traumatic life,it 's all very good and i can see why it 's a lot more fun watching the film unfold in
1,this film has a lot of laughs to,this movie is an insult to all
1,at one point the film goes to a very,at that point you are a bit prejudiced
1,while it 's been on tv for years the only thing that can be said about is that the film is a total mess and is the only film,while the film is a bit slow moving the characters are so poorly written that the plot is just unbelievable and there 's nothing compelling about this movie
1,when the film is over i was n't sure what was wrong with the characters,when a movie has a plot and a plot it is n't even that funny
1,like the previous films this one is a very bad one,like i mentioned earlier i am not a fan of the original
1,i 've never seen a movie that i had n't experienced or even knew what to think and feeling like i was watching it,i think i should n't be able to get into the game of the film and it certainly is n't worth the effort of a
1,this movie has some great acting and i,this movie was one of those movies
1,at the end of a film there is a twist at the end of the movie where the killer comes into his life and his mother 's,at a time when the story was told to make you forget that it had been a movie it would have been a much better movie
1,the plot is pretty simple and the acting is pretty good,the film 's story is about how the man who lived in
1,i 've never seen such a beautiful,i 've seen many bad movies
1,i'm sorry that i can get my head on a copy of this film and the dvd version of this film on the dvd,i'm not the only person on the show that shows the whole thing and i think it should n't have been made to be a
1,or the way the characters were made,or the scene where a man with the
1,but it 's not a great story as well and it 's not,but the fact that the film is made for the screen is not very
1,why would the filmmakers make a movie that was so,why was n't that one of the greatest ever
1,marijuana is not your typical movie it is a waste of money and time,marijuana and his men are not a threat to the world and the film 's
1,5 the plot was so bad the,5 the plot and the characters
1,the plot is pretty simple but it is n't,the only good thing about this movie is that the
1,i saw this movie on a whim that was in the theater and saw this movie on the sundance channel,i was expecting a lot of the movie but there were some scenes that could have been cut from a real
1,the movie is about the love story between an older boy and his father,the first part of the film is pretty slow moving and not particularly exciting but
1,its a good family movie and you can see the first two,its not just the story it 's a story of a young couple
1,the plot line and the acting were pretty good for a b movie but the movie is,the movie has some interesting moments which makes it more interesting than i could possibly imagine
1,to me this was a bad movie,to me the best of this movie is
1,i think it would be a little better if i had a,i do think that the movie could have been much better
1,on the way home he befriends a young boy and is a bit too reluctant to be a good man but his love of her life is n't really the way she 's supposed to be,on the other hand the film is n't really a complete disaster it 's a good movie and an interesting one but the story is a bit thin and it is not a drama or a comedy
1,the only way to get a better person to do the same is the bad acting,the film has some of the worst editing i 've ever heard the acting is awful and
1,i do n't know if the movie was meant to get,i saw this movie in the theatre in my country
1,i do n't think the movie 's main character,i do n't care what the critics say
1,where was the money and the idea of a movie,where did they get the money to make this film
1,while there are many things that make this film a great one it 's not very well made,while this may have been a great idea to show the world the film industry it does n't seem
1,still the movie has some great points and it does keep me watching,still a lot of people will be offended by this but they do n't
1,in the first episode of this series it,in my opinion the best performance ever
1,steve carell is a very good actor,steve martin 's acting is excellent
1,george sanders is the master of the group and the rest of the story is,george c scott is a good actor and is very convincing as a villain
1,he had no qualms about her but he was also,he 's the only thing good about this film
1,too bad the film is not available in dvd,too bad he has n't been in a film for
1,i was a little confused about the movie and did n't see,i have to say that the ending was a bit weak
1,so many of you will be disappointed by it,so i can understand how this movie was made and
1,david niven gives a solid performance as a cop who is a former agent of the town,david duchovny was in it and i thought that he was the best in his role
1,lee is not an action hero who has a knack for,lee was a very good actor and i loved it
1,any movie that is made with such a low budget is very difficult to,any other person can identify with the subject matter that they have done
1,i have n't seen a lot of movies lately but the ones that,i have to admit that i was very disappointed with this movie
1,character development is nonexistent and the movie is,character development and plot were the same
1,the story is simple and interesting,the film is also filled with symbolism
1,the plot is simple and the characters are not developed to the audience 's interest,the story is a lot less interesting with a few laughs and turns the movie into
1,nevertheless this is a very good family film,nevertheless it 's not all bad but it does
1,this is the kind of film that you,this is a great film to watch
1,i am a huge fan of the series but this show had nothing,i would like to see this movie remade for a long time
1,although i was not looking forward to this film in my collection and it was a lot better,although the first half of this film lacks any kind of sense it is still pretty funny
1,2 it 's a good thing to,2 the story is n't bad
1,if you have n't seen the original version then read a book or watch a film with subtitles like that,if you do n't want to see a movie that has a similar theme with all the characters and situations you
1,although the film does have its moments of humor and some unintentional moments the movie is just a little bit predictable,although this is the first of a trilogy i have seen in a while and was amazed to find that the film
1,what 's even worse is the fact,what is that about the movie
1,there are two scenes where she has an imaginary pregnancy with the young man 's daughter who,there is also a lot of action and a bit of the suspense of the movie
1,with a supposed budget of about 1000000 this is one of the better films,with all the problems that the director has done with this film it 's just
1,the film is a bit slow and the pacing is,the story is very similar to the first film
1,some of it 's faults are the way they are portrayed,some of the scenes are very funny and some of the jokes
1,extremely well done and the film 's climax is,extremely bad film that has a terrible plot
1,somehow he and his friends go to the police and they are on the case,somehow he does n't seem to have much time to do anything to stop him from
1,in my opinion he is not a good actor or a good actor,in a sense the film does n't make any sense to it
1,this is not a movie for you,this movie has a very good story and
1,this movie was a lot like a lot of other movies,this movie is an insult to everyone who wants to watch this
1,in fact the only reason i gave this movie 2 is that i had to watch it to see,in a world war ii film was made by an international director who was involved in the war
1,something about mary lou who has become a star and has been on for over 40 years,something is n't quite as funny as the first two but it 's still not funny
1,his performance is excellent as he plays his role as the conflicted and loving man,his father is a very rich and intelligent person who 's not a very talented director
1,in fact this is not a very good movie,in the end it 's not a bad movie
1,seems like a bad excuse to be a part of the,seems to be the only one that makes it worthwhile
1,and the story of the film is very good and,and i do n't want to give anything away
1,after the movie was over i had a great time watching the movie i did n't think it would be good to see the film,after the movie is over for the viewer to be a little more tolerant i think that it should be a good movie but it is
1,sean connery plays a woman who loves to get the big guns on him but he does n't,sean penn is in the movie and i did n't know that he was in this movie
1,as with the previous film the acting is very good and the story really keeps you on the edge of your seat,as a matter of fact one of the most beautiful films ever made the film is one of the few gems of this
1,on the other hand this has a very good plot,on the other hand you can see the director 's intent
1,the first half of the film is a complete mess,the first is a very funny film from the director that
1,in fact the film was very very bad,in short i 'd recommend it to everyone who
1,to say this would have a little more potential is beyond me,to say that it is a great story is beyond me
1,if you do decide to rent this movie you will not regret it,if there was a movie that made it a good idea and was a
1,regarding the first two films i have the feeling that a lot of people are going to see this film,regarding the acting in the first half of the series i was very skeptical about it and the whole thing seemed
1,alex and ted have a nice chemistry but they do n't do that at all,alex the director has a good idea to make a story about his own experiences and
1,if you 're a fan 's and enjoy a good film you have to be entertained,if you want a great action movie with the usual thrills you can find this film
1,if it were n't for a few scenes of sex i 'd rather see the film in a theater than it was for a film,if you 're a fan of the original series and you want the two hours it 's a bit long you might find it hard you
1,the film is n't that interesting,the film is n't a masterpiece but
1,i have been looking for my life in the past and hopefully more than i can remember,i saw her in a few episodes and she was in a cameo as the girl in the
1,it was just a little bit of an excuse for the viewer to understand how the film was supposed to be and failed to deliver,it 's a shame that they did n't have the budget to make a sequel to a movie that 's so bad that it 's almost
1,all these things are not really explored in this film,all in all the acting of meryl streep is a bit
1,the film is a real treat but it does n't work out as well as some of,the movie is a great deal of fun that 's just the beginning of the movie
1,most of them are very well made,most of it was just a little too
1,about 15 years ago this was not a movie for me it 's the worst movie ever,about the only negative thing is this movie is a total waste of time and money
1,dismissive and the ending is very abrupt,dismissive of the film is about a man
1,i think the director should not be a movie director,i have no idea what the movie makers were trying to
1,the only thing i really did n't like though it was that i did not like to be the last person to be able to identify,the acting in this movie was so good it made the movie even better but it was so bad i just wanted to slap myself
1,a very interesting story about two guys,a lot of the scenes were shot and
1,but this movie was so bad i was,but it 's a very entertaining movie
1,and then i went to the video store and said hey it 's just bad,and if you 're in the mood for a good horror movie this is n't
1,this film is about the power of the man,this is the kind of bad movie that you ca
1,he 's a great actor and is a great actor,he is a fine actor and he is excellent
1,mercer and his wife are all in their element as they go and the movie starts off,mercer is also very good as his son and the rest of the cast is excellent
1,no matter how hard the film is to,no other actor could have been chosen
1,but it 's not even that good,but i was n't expecting much in this
1,in the beginning it was n't even worth it to make fun of it,in a scene in a nightclub the scene where a man is a young woman
1,look like an interesting idea for some time and i think that,look at this show as a child and you will enjoy
1,as a matter of fact this movie does n't do much with me,as for me i would like to know that this film is n't a
1,the plot is not very original but it is n't,the film is a bit of a mess but it 's
1,hooper 's direction is excellent but that does not matter,hooper and his crew have tried desperately to create a movie
1,what 's more the plot and character development is quite simple but as a,what is it with a group of men who are in the woods
1,anyway the story of the movie is,anyway it was a good idea
1,and the fact that he does n't get the same treatment is a real,and if you like to watch this film it 's worth a look
1,if the viewer can see the movie and the fact that they were trying to make the story seem realistic they just succeeded,if you want to see a good movie with a good story good actors and good acting check out the old ones
1,and the fact that this is the only real horror,and it is the best of the three movies
1,his wife is killed by a mysterious maniac in one of the first scenes,his acting is a good thing but the movie is not as good as the
1,the only thing that is interesting about it is the fact that it is based on a book,the film 's plot is about an escaped convicts who are attacked and the leader 's father is forced
1,the only thing that kept me watching was the soundtrack of the music of the movie,the acting is horrible and the plot is so predictable you ca n't help but laugh
1,here the film is shot in two days,here we have an excellent movie that is very
1,its a movie that i would recommend to anyone who loves,its the best thing i have seen since the beginning
1,the first thing that i noticed about the movie was that it was the most,the film 's plot is a little thin and the ending seems too abrupt
1,boy did i mention a lot,boy 's shoes is a good movie
1,i was expecting a good movie with a,i was a bit skeptical and confused
1,the movie is a mess of a movie that is about a,the film is a very funny experience but it 's not
1,but i was surprised by the lack of depth in any of,but it is not that i have to see it again
1,i was n't really sure who to believe and it would have,i 've always loved her in the role of her mother
1,i saw this movie at a screening and was very disappointed that this was not an oscar,i do n't remember it was a good movie it was a waste of my time
1,at a certain point you 're left wondering why this movie has such amazing,at times it 's the most difficult thing to say about the film
1,and the acting was n't bad either,and it was a good movie
1,i was n't sure what to expect from this movie,i think it 's the best movie in the history of
1,inaccuracies like this are not in the book but rather a few more,inaccuracies are not necessarily the only thing to say about this movie
1,in the first half of the movie the viewer is left with the impression that the main plot is n't a very good one at some points but it does not,in the movie the characters are a bit underdeveloped but the actors who are the only ones who have been in the movie business are the ones who are the most talented
1,what i got was a film about,what a wonderful film this was
1,paris city of the spotless and the first world war film is a classic,paris is a beautiful and beautiful film that will be remembered by anyone looking to
1,this is a really bad movie,this movie is a must see
1,even though the movie is a bit too slow paced and too slow for the viewer there is a lot of violence and,even though it does n't look like a movie of any kind or a good movie it still makes a good movie
1,the film is not for everyone but there 's a great deal of humor and some of it is,the only way i can explain that is the scene where the guy is lying through the floor with a
1,this movie is not for the fainthearted but it 's a good movie to watch for the,this is n't a bad movie but it does have a lot of action and suspense
1,they are not just a couple of things that do not add up to much more than the film,they were both in their prime but the way it came out was very much of a problem
1,my favorite part is when one of the guys asks me if i can make you think,my favorite is that of the young girl who played the young girl in the original
1,i have a fondness for the movie,i am a huge fan of the books
1,the film was n't very good,the movie was a great example of
1,guerrilla films have the same effect and are so bad that it 's difficult not to say,guerrilla warfare was a film about two men that were born from the same year of the war
1,it is a film that is a true classic of the time and place,it 's a very bad movie and i do n't care how anyone could get
1,fortunately the only good aspect of this movie are some of the supporting characters,fortunately there 's no need to make this a sequel to the series of other
1,maybe this was supposed to be a comedy,maybe i could have been the one that made
1,there are many things that do n't seem to be in this film but the movie was so,there is a lot of good things about them but they do n't really make a movie
1,the film is a complete waste of time,the acting is good and the script is quite
1,this movie is an insult to anyone,this movie is a real gem
1,i do n't think this is a movie for children and children but there are many moments that are,i was really impressed by the acting by the actors i really liked the movie and the performances
1,val kilmer is a fine comedic actor,val kilmer is perfect for the role
1,not so bad it 's good,not only is it a very good
1,pieces of the puzzle were filmed in a small town,pieces of dialogue are done without any sense of timing and
1,and the ending of the film which,and the movie is really funny
1,this movie is just plain bad,this film is not a masterpiece
1,as for the acting this movie had to be one of his most boring,as for the film 's message it 's a film that makes the viewer feel
1,aside from the fact that it has an excellent story line that 's really good it has some funny,aside from this one 's not the best of the genre but it 's still a good movie
1,and that 's a shame because you know that the movie was n't,and that 's the only thing that is missing in the film
1,given how many people think the film is funny it is a movie to be avoided by all means,given the fact the story is based on real events and that it 's a drama it 's just not
1,by the end i was thinking that it would be a great movie,by a time of the week the film was released on video
1,i have to admit i am a fan of the genre,i was n't sure what to expect when i saw this movie
1,naturally the movie 's title is a bit misleading,naturally it 's a great movie that is not worth
1,first the movie 's main theme song which is so bad is that the film was made to be a little slow,first of all there is an underlying lack of originality and the movie has a lot of action and a lot of plot
1,other times i have watched it over and over again and i can,other than that there are few other movies that are so bad
1,there was no real reason for the existence of these,there is no real reason for watching this movie
1,poor acting bad dialogue bad music and a bad script,poor acting poor script poor writing bad directing and even worse
1,serious plot and characters were a bunch of people trying to be a little more interesting than this,serious characters who are supposed to be likable and have some good lines to work together are just plain
1,while i am not quite sure what i was thinking i was wrong and it would be a little easier to watch,while i 've seen some of the other comments on the site of the dvd this movie does nothing for me
1,he 's not even a good one at all,he is the one who gets the whole thing right
1,this film is one that is not just a vehicle in the world of war but,this is one of those movies that is not so bad that it is good
1,and i really enjoyed the movie,and i do n't know who the
1,i have n't seen a movie that is so bad as,i would not recommend this to any other movie buff
1,while there are some interesting things to say about this movie i thought this was,while this movie does not have a great story it 's still pretty good
1,swindle is another movie that i would like to see again,swindle was a big waste of time and money spent on making
1,marnie is a very good actress but the movie is n't really all that impressive,marnie 's character is a caricature of her own and the film is very very hard
1,overall it 's an excellent movie,overall i would give this one a
1,the script is very good and i liked the way the plot is told,the only way to get the message across is that this movie is not only
1,which is why the film is n't as much fun as its predecessor and it 's not even worth renting,which i do n't know and is certainly a movie that will appeal to anyone who loves good movies or if
1,it does n't take itself too serious and it never really comes,it is also very difficult to get a grip on the story because
1,micheal caine was a great actor and a great actor,micheal dudikoff is a great actor and i have always liked
1,the film also features interviews between various subjects and one particularly crucial sequence which is quite poignant,the movie is about an old man who has an obsession with his daughter and his family
1,a movie that makes you wonder if you 're supposed to be a fan,a lot of the actors are miscast and the characters are all shallow
1,i think he 's trying to be funny but not funny in a movie,i was surprised when i watched this film that it was n't as boring as
1,so it is not a great movie,so what 's with the accent
1,i would n't have had the chance i 'd be able to see the film for a long time and i would have given it a chance,i would recommend this movie for anyone who is interested in the sport or if you can get it in a theater to see it and enjoy it
1,the story is not as bad as it sounds,the film is a real classic and it is not
1,but the story is very interesting,but the real problem with this film
1,everyone in this movie is so good,everyone in this movie has an awful accent
1,as the film goes on there 's the odd and the obligatory and the story the characters,as i watched this film i kept thinking that this was a very very bad film
1,you have a movie that 's so bad it 's almost laughable it 's just bad,you have to wonder what a real person who is a man who wants to see this
1,but the movie was not so bad it 's good,but the fact was that they were all going to be
1,i would say i would like to say that i have n't laughed,i have n't seen the original but it 's a good one
1,john wayne is in the movie,john carpenter 's direction is excellent
1,there 's not a lot of gore and the,there 's no reason to watch this movie
1,it is a story about the difficulty between two people and the,it was a waste of time and money spent watching it
1,i do n't know what to say about this movie because of the title but that 's about,i was surprised when i saw it on the cover and was very impressed by the movie
1,the acting was n't good enough but the acting was n't bad,the story of a woman who works for the family in the past
1,and there are some nice twists,and i 've been to israel for
1,the movie is a bit boring and the acting is not bad,the movie has an allstar supporting cast of young stars that are very
1,it 's not the best movie i 've seen in a long,it 's not even that hard to watch for some reasons
1,it 's a shame they have such a bad script and,it was n't so bad it 's not bad either
1,anything like that happens in the movie,anything is a little interesting but this movie
1,all in all it is a very enjoyable movie to watch,all three characters are all very funny and the film has a
1,as for his performance in the movie the actors are,as for the ending the film is quite entertaining
1,the acting is pretty bad the plot is ridiculous the dialogue is laughable the acting is worse than anything else,the only thing that i have to say about this film is that it had a good cast a very good
1,in one episode the two are reunited in the next episode and,in fact there was a lot of nudity in this one
1,anyone who has seen the film or had an interest in the history of cinema should avoid this,anyone else is the only one in the entire mess who is able to relate the same way that
1,john carradine is one of my favorite actors and i 've seen him in better,john ritter is a great comedian who 's the real star of this movie
1,this movie was a total disappointment to watch,this film had me laughing at the screen
1,i do n't know what to say about this film,i am a fan of the show and i have n't
1,it 's a very interesting movie,it 's not a movie like this
1,hopefully the director could n't be able to get this movie right to the point but he,hopefully i was in a state of shock but i just wanted to see this movie
1,they do not make a good pair as,they are not even funny at that
1,jack nicholson 's character is a stereotype,jack frost was a good movie but it
1,but then there are these scenes which have been added for some,but then again i think that it 's all about this
1,the first half hour of this movie,the acting and acting is horrible
1,everyone is so stupid in their roles that i,everyone involved in this production must be ashamed
1,that was the first time i saw it,that was the first thing i noticed
1,anna is a great movie but is not a great film,anna 's character was a caricature of a woman that would n't
1,written with a lot of money this film is not for all tastes at least not as good or bad as it would be to see the actors in,written by david o selznick who was involved in the production of an original script the movie is very good but the acting and directing is very poor
1,could n't i have bothered to see this movie at the theater when it was released on dvd,could be the main reason to watch the movie but i think that the director has the most important
1,and the movie was not as good as i would have liked,and i do believe that the film is a little dated but the
1,and the story is very good,and the film is also very well
1,black robe and his entourage are both very funny,black and white are the two most prominent characters in
1,this is a movie that is not even worth renting,this was an enjoyable movie to watch for a few years
1,that 's why i did n't want the story to end and i did it,that 's the reason why it 's the greatest thing of the movie is because they
1,however the film has the same charm,however this one was really good

1,this movie is just plain awful,this movie does n't even try to
1,they should have made more films like this,they 're so much better and more interesting

1,now if the movie is really bad it 's not worth renting,now we are given some clues that were not in the film and
1,my only complaint is that it is n't as bad as the other two,my only complaint about this film is that the acting was so bad that it

1,during the movie he meets up with a girl who is in love with his girlfriend,during the course of the film the director has made a documentary of this film and it
1,it is a film that should not be seen by anyone,it is not a film that has the potential to be an
1,it 's an insult to the intelligence and dedication of the filmmakers,it 's a shame to see such a low rating for this piece
1,sometime on the sundance show the two are now a lot of fun as it is the best of the,sometime the two leads have a chance meeting their father to become the mother of his father 's family
1,yet this movie does not work for me,yet it was the best film of the series
1,the only good thing in the movie is the acting,the acting is good but the script is so bad it
1,i have n't laughed so hard since,i was so surprised by the fact that
1,you 'll probably see the movie,you know that you have been warned
1,moore is one of the best actors in hollywood,moore has been in the past 20 years
1,so if you 're looking for a good movie that 's worth watching this one just does n't have the,so it 's just a bunch of kids who have no talent and no idea what they are doing
1,and then you have a guy who is,and the movie was a complete failure
1,it seems the director wanted to be so smart and so,it was so bad that it was just plain bad
1,it is a very bad movie,it 's a shame that the film
1,the acting is very well made and the writing is very good,the film is a little too much for me to enjoy but i
1,this movie was one of the best i 've read,this movie is an insult to the intelligence of the audience
1,the story is about two women who are trying to find the killer who has stolen their lives,the movie is so funny you 'll want to miss every single scene in your life you 'll be
1,it 's not all bad acting bad special effects,it is very hard to believe that a good movie
1,it is a very bad movie,it is not a comedy but it
1,i was n't a fan of the book but this was a great movie,i was a little shocked that it was the first movie in which i thought
1,those who think that there is a lot of good acting in this story,those who have read a good review are not very likely to read it
1,act like a bunch of people who just do,act of the first part is the same
1,a movie that is a waste of time,a good movie for kids and adults
1,but that is the only flaw,but then i have no idea why
1,the story is simple and there are some good twists in here and there,the film is about a woman who is sent to a mental hospital
1,this one is a real treat,this is the type of movie that
1,the plot is a little confusing and the acting by the entire cast is pretty bad and the plot was,the only way this film could be so bad is that it makes the mistake of making a movie
1,the only good thing that was on was the fact that it was filmed in new york,the movie is a good one for all of the above mentioned but the movie is not worth
1,if you 've seen the movie you know you 're going to get bored,if you 're into watching a few episodes i do recommend this movie
1,for a start that is not a comedy it is a comedy of the week,for a film made at mgm i was surprised that this movie was a huge disappointment
1,if you 're a fan of the original you 'll love this film,if you want to know what you 're supposed to have to say about
1,is this supposed to be a comedy but it fails at that,is it a comedy or a parody of the real life
1,his character is so funny that it hurts,his wife and her brother 's son are the
1,thanks for the movie to make sure,thanks for a very good ending
1,many of the jokes were so unfunny that they were n't funny but the jokes were pretty funny,many people will not be confused by this one but there is a very nice story of this film
1,i think the movie could be a bit better,i saw this movie in the theater in the late
1,it 's not that we 're not,it is also an excellent film
1,and the ending was a good match,and that 's where it fails
1,when he gets out of trouble he finds out that the father is a little more,when she is n't as bad as the movie she is the embodiment of her
1,the only good scene comes when the girl is in the room and then gets her comeuppance with him,the acting is horrible the script is bad the direction is bad the story is awful and the acting sucks
1,black and white cinematography is also great,black mask is one of the best movies
1,very good movie with lots of twists that,very few films were available for sale
1,as for the plot itself a good one and the movie is n't very good,as for the movie it was not even so bad i just had to watch this
1,the acting by the actors is pretty bad,the first thing you notice from the first film
1,hard boiled is a classic film and one of the better ones,hard to believe that this is n't the same as in the book
1,unless you want to see the worst film of the last decade or so this is a good example,unless you are looking for a good film about a man who has an obsession with a girl you 'll
1,i think he is n't a talented filmmaker,i 've seen the movie numerous times and have
1,i would love to see another film that has the feel of being a masterpiece of a movie,i saw the movie for the first time in the theater when i was in the theater
1,movie makers who do n't have to do a lot,movie starts off as a thriller that is so stupid that
1,a film that has been a cult classic since,a good idea for a movie and a good action
1,also a very touching ending and the end was so predictable,also the scene in the bar room when a couple of kids
1,also the film is about as entertaining as the original,also the movie was shot in the middle of an ocean
1,i'm a big fan of the original,i'm not sure how much the acting could
1,in fact i was not surprised to see that a movie like this could go on and on,in the end the story becomes a bit weak but i still love the way it was written and
1,in short it 's a very funny little flick with no substance,in this case the characters are a little underdeveloped but the real problem
1,he 's just the kind of person you would want to see in an action film,he 's a little more interesting than usual but he still is not a good character
1,it 's a shame the rest of the movie did n't get better and,it 's a shame because the film is not even a good movie
1,they do n't make any sense and there is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie,they were not just a couple of good movies but that does n't mean they were
1,as for the other actors who are the most memorable of the movie there was nothing in,as a matter of fact the filmmakers do the best they can to make a film
1,its so very hard to understand what is wrong with this film,its not that i can compare it to other movies like it
1,when he gets to know his wife and the other way she has to be a man,when i watched it i thought it was going to be a movie i had seen
1,and the scene where a guy is walking around naked and diced by her own face is priceless and the film 's only saving grace is that it was made,and i do n't think that anyone who has n't seen any of the other movies of the series have had a chance to see this piece of junk
1,but if you 're not the only one who has a chance,but i do n't think that this movie is worth seeing
1,so much so as to say that,so it was an excellent film and i
1,many of the actors have a very small cast,many things are n't explained in this film and the
1,if you are not a fan of this show i would say that i would,if i were to rate a movie a 0 rating this was my first
1,i'm not going to get into the plot and the acting is bad the plot,i'm glad i was n't able to find this film because i did n't
1,but i do n't think it 's a,but that 's not enough for me
1,cable 's the film and his best friends,cable canceled and the other movies are the most
1,as for the story it 's the same as the first one and i think it should have been much better,as i said this is the first movie i have seen in which it 's a spoof of what it is like
1,if there is anything to say about this film it is that the acting is not bad,if you have the patience to watch this film you will be disappointed by the film
1,i am not sure whether it 's meant to be a comedy or a drama but i guess it 's a bit too long,i do n't even think that the director intended a sequel to it 's predecessor but instead it is a very good film
1,with a few exceptions the script could have been better written by the same guy who gave him the opportunity to make a sequel to a film,with the possible exception of that one man 's character and his wife 's daughter who is the one in his life the story is not as strong
1,all this makes a good horror movie but the movie is a mess,all in all the best i have ever seen in a movie
1,revenge is n't exactly a great movie by all means but this one is n't that bad,revenge by a woman of the past is the first film that the censors can actually see
1,the story is about the struggle between two men and their families and their interactions with each other and the relationship they face,the film is also quite interesting but the director is obviously not trying to make an attempt to make a coherent film
1,the film is a complete mess,the film has an excellent performance from
1,i was n't sure what to make in 1968 's the film 's success,i have to admit i have to say the best of this movie
1,i saw this in my local video store in the theater,i have seen a lot of movies that have some very good
1,i was expecting a little bit of the story to be told from the movie,i think this was a very very bad movie and that 's saying much
1,i think this is a movie of the type that is supposed to be,i 've been waiting for a film to be released on dvd but i am
1,some of the scenes are just too stupid,some of the best moments of the film are
1,in fact this movie is a total waste of time and money,in this case the director was trying to make a movie with a
1,hopper is the only actor that could,hopper 's performance is quite good
1,ken 's wife and mother are both,ken russel is a great actor
1,he 's a bit of a caricature but it works,he is so good at the movie that he does n't
1,the movie has a few moments that make sense,the movie also has a few funny moments
1,at first you have n't really noticed that in the film it has been done,at first i thought the movie is a bit slow but it did n't
1,but it 's still pretty bad,but this film was not so bad
1,it 's also a very good story with a good cast and a good script,it 's a shame he did n't get better roles as the director and the director
1,if that 's true i do n't know how it is a good movie for a,if you want to watch a movie i would advise you to watch this one
1,novarro is a wonderful actor who can be very good and,novarro 's character is a caricature in his own life
1,i am a fan of the original film and i am still waiting,i have never watched the movie and it was a huge disappointment
1,like most movies about the injustices they live in,like i said it 's a great movie
1,upon arrival he meets up with the owner of a carnival,upon hearing from the comments i thought i 'd watch this movie
1,nearly no one is interested in this film,nearly every character in this film is so obnoxious
1,eric stoltz is the only actor of any age in this film who does n't look good at all,eric stoltz is a revelation in all his acting ability and the film is a very good one
1,then there are the other characters and their motivations,then again i have seen this movie a lot
1,andr is a great character that 's,andr is an extremely good actor
1,where 's a lot of fun,where are these women in the world
1,no one has a clue about the film and does not have to be too difficult to do anything,no one is able to tell a story of the frustrations and suffering of the holocaust as a result of
1,fourth the ending is a bit ambiguous but i thought it would be better if they had done it,fourth the main villain is a man of a man who kills people and kills a few people
1,i do n't think this is the worst movie i know to date,i was n't expecting too much from him but that was a good thing
1,add to that the fact that you know what you 're getting and then you do n't get much from it that has,add to that the fact that they are in the film the film does manage to make some points in the end
1,what was this supposed to be about,what i saw was an excellent movie
1,that 's how i felt i was,that 's what it is about
1,i would have liked to know more about the story but i do n't want to ruin the movie,i am so impressed with the movie it 's difficult for me to understand how it is in the book
1,mamet 's work is one of his most successful gems of the period and this one,mamet 's film is a bit dated but its still a good and good film
1,overall the film was n't that bad,overall i would rate it as highly as
1,i am surprised that it is not only in the end but it,i have n't laughed so hard since i 've seen this one
1,while a bit of the film 's overall badness is not the best the film,while i was n't expecting much from this film i did have some expectation
1,for all i know there is a reason this film is so awful,for instance the scene where the two men are talking and talking about their
1,the script was so poor the acting was poor the effects,the movie is about a man who is a man
1,hopper is one of the best and most of the movie,hopper and the other two stars have a great chemistry
1,the movie is also very well made and very realistic,the plot is about a bunch of kids who go into
1,ppl who think that this is an important movie,ppl of these films are a real treat
1,when he was the only one who seemed to think that he would,when the movie is about this one it 's just a movie
1,not the worst of the movie but it 's just bad,not only was it not for the faint of it all but
1,i am a fan of the genre of horror movies but it is n't that funny,i am not sure what is worse the acting was bad the plot just plain boring
1,instead we are forced to endure the worst movie of all time,instead we get a film where a group of people are trapped in
1,or if you 're a diehard fan of the genre or the other movies of this type,or perhaps the best thing about the film is that it does n't have the same appeal as
1,let 's face it it 's not,let me say that i 've been a
1,myrtle and her boyfriend are all very good,myrtle 's character is not as good as the
1,d the director of the movie is not really a very good filmmaker,d it has a nice premise to go with it is a movie that
1,i would n't go into it expecting much better,i 've seen many bad movies and this one is
1,i have n't read the book so i ca n't compare the original to any other adaptations,i have seen a few of his films and i have seen him in his better work
1,i was n't really surprised when the movie ended,i saw this movie in a sneak preview
1,i saw this movie yesterday and was shocked by the way the film,i have never watched a movie infuriated by such an awful movie
1,example i did n't care much for the movie,example the movie starts with a bunch of teenagers who
1,after this movie i have to say that this is a,after all he 's got a good job of acting
1,you do not see a single scene that was done in a film that is just plain awful,you know that you are the ones who are in for some stupid reason to make a sequel
1,you can watch it and it 's a lot of fun to watch,you can read a lot of bad press in a bad language that 's
1,the acting was so bad that i could n't help but think of that character in this film,the movie is about an old man who 's trying to get his son back on a vacation in
1,i have never seen a movie like this,i was surprised how they got to play the
1,the only real problem with this film is its title the story is,the movie 's premise is very thin and the film never drags
1,the plot is a little convoluted as the action moves,the acting is terrible the story is worse and the plot
1,however i found this one to be a very good film,however it was not a very good film but it was a
1,but the real reason i do n't give this,but i did n't care about the characters
1,a great cast in a great film,a lot of the time i have seen
1,people do n't know what to think and feel like they 're in the woods but they have a lot of fun,people in their right mind would think that if they wanted to be a bit too old the movie would have been a
1,bringing the characters to this film is a good idea and they 're good,bringing the dead back to life with a few words and a few lines
1,the acting is horrible with some pretty lousy lines and the plot is a little,the film also features an unusual cast and the cast is very well chosen
1,then the film goes downhill and it does n't make sense,then the next scene where the guy says he is in a
1,the acting is horrible and the story itself is just bad,the story is very similar to the usual columbo movie
1,they should have stayed away from this one,they all have to do something with that
1,aishwarya plays a beautiful woman who is a little too young,aishwarya 's character is n't as good or even better than the
1,i am not a fan of the series or even the slightest bit of a puzzle,i think the director is the director and that 's the case with the book
1,and it 's not the best movie ever made but it,and i really did n't care what happened to her
1,what was the point of the movie that was n't supposed to,what i really liked most in this film is the acting
1,all in all a very funny movie,all in his mind and he 's not
1,samantha morton and michael douglas both seem to be,samantha de vaca is a very talented actor
1,if you 're a fan of the original you might find a bit too funny to be taken seriously,if it were n't for the poor acting and a few scenes that would have made the movie better it
1,of course the story is n't bad and it 's not even worth mentioning that it 's a little too long for a thriller,of course the movie is not a bad movie but it does n't have that in the way of plot nor the characters
1,but the movie is just so boring it 's funny,but it has been so long since that it is the
1,sorry but this is the worst film ever made,sorry folks i am not sure if i will see
1,netflix lists this movie on a whim and i'm surprised that i never heard of it,netflix has been released on dvd for sale on ebay in the uk and is one of
1,if you want to watch a really bad movie with a good,if you do n't like it then do n't watch it
1,but there 's nothing wrong with the fact that there is a lot of good action in it,but the fact is this movie was shot in canada so that it was actually released theatrically
1,the film is a great example of why a movie like this has made,the film has a lot of plot holes that are just not explained
1,he does n't do much with his character but is a real person,he is a great actor and a perfect choice for her role in this
1,if you have a choice for that kind of thing you should see this movie,if you 've seen any of fulci 's films it 's hard to know where it
1,the first part of the movie is just a little bit too,the movie was very entertaining and i really really liked it
1,a lot of things happen and they are left to the imagination and not to make you care,a young boy named erik is searching for the woman who he loves to do not know he is
1,but this is the worst film ever made,but the film was not really as good as
1,the acting is so bad it is painful to watch,the acting was good and the acting was good and the
1,the film opens with a couple of shots of the,the first half of the movie is really bad
1,the first half of the film is a bit long but it does n't matter,the movie is not as funny or original as it should have been but it is
1,the only thing that made it worth seeing is the,the acting is good and the story is interesting
1,what a great piece of work and an incredible film,what we have here is the first movie that 's so
1,i have to say that i was surprised to learn that i had to endure a film,i do agree with the other reviewer that the actors are all bad but the actors are so
1,he was the best in all the bad movies,he was a great actor in this movie
1,it is also interesting that it 's not only one thing but it has a few funny moments and some really funny bits but it does n't make a,it would have been better and the movie would have been great if the director had a bit more screen time but instead they were all very poor
1,actors who do n't seem to think they 're,actors do a good job in this film
1,eleniak is the only thing worth mentioning,eleniak 's character in this movie is so
1,i have been looking for a copy for years,i would n't be surprised if i had seen the
1,i saw this film on tv and i have no idea how the people involved in,i 've never seen the original version so i did n't think that this one
1,robert downey jr plays a man who is a cop,robert altman is a master of genius and the movie has
1,the movie is a bit boring and boring but that is not the point in this film,the movie was made for about an hour and a half of the film that is so bad
1,some of the dialogue is so cheesy it makes you laugh out loud,some of the scenes were just too stupid and it seemed like the writers
1,the acting is good but the story is not very good,the film has a lot more to do with the fact that
1,it 's a shame that the movie does not have,it 's a shame it 's never mentioned again
1,no doubt he 's the best actor in the film,no other actor is a good guy but a good one
1,the story is very simple and interesting,the movie is a bit of a disappointment
1,too bad this movie is n't available on video,too bad the film does n't work on the level
1,first off the acting is poor the story is worse with,first off let me say i'm pretty angry about that
1,these are the best i can think of to watch the movie,these days i was very impressed by the acting and the story
1,unfortunately the film is not a good action film or a bad one,unfortunately for the rest of my life i have to say that i'm puzzled
1,liz is a great actress in her first major role in which,liz is a young girl and is attracted to her mother
1,hence i have n't read the book or,hence the plot and acting was horrible
1,just do n't expect anything resembling this kind of movie,just as you have the wittiest film ever made
1,why would a man like a boy who,why does they have to do that
1,it does n't work out as the movie is a little too much of a problem because it 's a bit,it is a shame that the producers and the writer decided to do the best movie possible for the sequel
1,it 's a shame because i think the movie,it has the feel of a great film
1,the acting and writing was superb and there 's a great,the film is a good mix of genres and suspense
1,everything i have ever wanted to do was not funny,everything i 've seen about it is so incredibly awful i
1,when i heard it had been advertised as a serious horror movie i was really surprised,when she gets her head out of her head she has a job for her daughter
1,i would not be surprised if the movie had been released,i would like to see a sequel of the original
1,wow the acting and direction is pretty good and the actors are great,wow i have no idea why they made this movie but it was a
1,every time i watch a movie i just wanted to see the next,every time i watch it i feel the need to be entertained
1,he also plays the role of a woman who gets married in a world of sexual abuse,he 's also the only one who can actually act like he is a bad guy
1,an absolute delight for all involved,an example of how to make a
1,in fact the film is so bad that i actually laughed at it and would n't really recommend it to anyone except maybe one of those,in fact i think it is very hard to find fault in this film it is a film of a film that is n't in the least
1,the story revolves around the same old people who have been married and have been living,the first time i saw it was i saw on tv and i was amazed that it
1,greg kinnear plays a good guy,greg kinnear plays an annoying egotistical jerk
1,i 've watched it countless times and i think that is what it is,i 've read all his films and is so desperate for a movie to have
1,congrats to the writer and director for giving this movie a great,congrats to a number of viewers and audiences of the time
1,he is a very good actor and the actors are all excellent,he also does n't know how to get his hands to the floor
1,the script is n't bad but the acting is bad,the only good thing about it is the scenery
1,so i do n't want to be born,so i can go on with that movie and
1,turkish film is a movie to watch with your friends,turkish movies are a lot more enjoyable than this
1,its a good movie and a good time capsule is,its so sad that i actually watched the movie
1,when it is n't all that funny it makes it all the more enjoyable to watch,when they are being attacked at the airport they decide to take an advantage and turn them
1,i think this one was a huge disappointment,i 've never seen a movie before i did
1,the movie is n't as good as some,the script is n't the worst either
1,the film is about as subtle as a typical hollywood movie,the story line has been done very well to the screen in
1,i 've seen this movie a dozen times already and i really enjoy watching,i have been looking forward to a film in which this movie was released but
1,i was expecting a lot more from this movie but i do n't see it as a movie that it 's not even worth renting,i do not want to spoil it for you but if you have seen the film i suggest that it is a bit of a shame
1,i think this movie will be a waste of time and,i have never seen so many of the other comments
1,revolver 's is a good movie but it was so poorly written,revolver is a story about a young woman who 's pregnant and lost
1,as a fan of the tv series i was expecting to see something new,as for the acting i do n't think there is a single redeeming feature to
1,the story line is very similar to it 's predecessor in the first movie and,the movie is a little bit of a downer and a waste of time
1,it is a pity that they were given a sequel,it 's a good story and one of the best i
1,and if you 're a diehard fan of the original and have,and i do n't think i would have done much better
1,only one of the three main characters is,only the acting could n't save this
1,unfortunately it does n't seem as though he was able to create a new film in his own right,unfortunately he 's not the only one who has a good time at the end and then becomes an idiot
1,in my opinion this movie is one of the greatest films ever made,in fact i have n't seen this movie since i saw it on tv
1,it 's a pity that this movie did not,it 's an example of a great film
1,spade was n't bad at all he was a little stiff,spade plays a young girl who has a crush on her and
1,it is the story of a young girl named erik who has been married and has married,it 's not as though it was a very good movie it was n't that great
1,but that 's not how i felt,but i guess i was a little biased
1,overall this movie is very entertaining and worth seeing for,overall the film has a certain endearingly dull ending
1,there are a few things that make you think and this is the film that i would have known to me,there were several funny moments and one of the most memorable moments of the last 510 minutes and the final showdown in
1,very similar to this film but with a lot of people that are not afraid to make it clear they are not,very disappointing but i do n't think the acting could have done better if they had done a decent job of making this
1,lenny was n't so much better in his later days,lenny is a great actor who is a good actor and
1,its a movie of a young age,its like it 's going to make the
1,i think it would be a lot better to watch it to find out what was the purpose to see it,i would like to say that i was so disappointed that i could spend the night at a film school
1,although there are many moments i have to admit that i 've watched it many times and can still enjoy a movie i would,although the film 's title is the most misleading and stupid it was a very entertaining film it could be a good one
1,the acting is so bad that you 're not surprised to see her act at all in the movie,the film has a lot of action and suspense and the film does have a good atmosphere but it 's
1,there are many scenes where the movie does n't seem to,there are some good performances but that 's about it
1,technical errors are a bit overdone but they are not very well written,technical gaffes are all about the plot of what they were doing and how
1,i do n't think that the film is anything but a good movie,i do think that this film is one of the most underrated films of
1,the movie is just about a man who is a serial killer and is in the same league as he is,the acting was bad the story line was nonexistent the special effects were poor and the effects looked so fake and poorly
1,all this makes this a classic,all in all a pretty good movie
1,this one is a waste of time and money,this film is an excellent piece of work
1,but this movie is one of those,but then the movie is not only the
1,ultimately the film is a bit over the top but a lot of the humor is missing from the start,ultimately this was just a great movie and that 's what it is and that is n't what it appears to
1,the story is a lot better but it does n't matter,the first half of the story is a bunch of characters who
1,nothing like this film has ever been seen,nothing really happens and is not funny
1,in fact there were no other actors who could act like an,in the end he is the most sympathetic in the world
1,just to see him perform an act of his own life,just when she is a bit more of a jerk and it
1,they should have done something else instead,they are all very good actors
1,i have never heard anything of this kind of movie in my life so i do n't,i have n't seen this film since the first time i saw the first two movies
1,this is a movie about a young,this is not a good film
1,as a fan myself i can only hope that the bbc has made,as for the story itself it would be a little too short
1,dennis' mother and daughter are not alone as they are but there is an intimate love,dennis' performance is excellent especially in the scene where the two women find themselves transported
1,typical operating procedure in a film that has,typical operating procedure with a few exceptions
1,the acting was pretty good and i was really impressed by the acting,the plot of an old woman and her son 's husband and their son
1,it was like a documentary that was,it 's a very good film
1,duvall is the most annoying and annoying actor in the movie,duvall is also the most beautiful and beautiful character in the film
1,they 're a bunch of young people in a city,they have to have been a part of the film
1,in fact the movie is so bad that it 's hard to sit through,in fact i would have to say the same for my mother and i was
1,okay i 've got a few problems in it but the movie is just a little too,okay let 's face it the story is a little too thin for the most part
1,i do n't think they did a good job,i was a little hesitant to read it
1,6 this movie has an awful plot,6 out of 10 for the ending
1,this movie is a complete bore,this movie had no redeeming qualities to
1,if you 're looking to laugh at this movie you have absolutely nothing but a bunch,if you are a fan of the first three movies you 'll love this one
1,so much of the plot is that there is no real plot to be had to,so why did the writers of this show have such a good sense of humor
1,few have to rely on a movie to get any better,few of them have a chance to be good and are n't
1,i was a huge fan of the book and i,i 've seen this movie twice so many times
1,the plot and the story are so bad it 's,the first half of the film was quite good
1,it seems that the director 's decision was to make a movie with a script so he succeeded in the book,it is a film that i would n't recommend to anyone that enjoys a film and just want to be entertained
1,too bad he has a lot more time to,too bad he has such a good script
1,you do n't see it all the way through and you wo n't have any idea,you 're just a bunch of people and the movie makers have a few problems
1,all in all a very entertaining film,all in all it 's a movie worth
1,his character and the other characters are so stupid,his character was not funny and he 's not funny
1,the movie is very well done,the movie is a very boring attempt
1,nah the film is a bit slow and slow in places but it is worth it,nah this show was not the best movie but it was a little slow in parts
1,said that 's how this movie gets to the end,said the acting is awful the acting is worse the dialogue
1,he is a master of the city and is the one,he was a bit too busy to be a hero
1,the acting was n't too bad the story was awful the acting was worse than anything,the story of the film is so bad that it makes the movie more watchable
1,you can watch the film for the first time and it will be a good one to see,you 'll be able to relate to what 's happening to you and you 're going to get it
1,at first i do n't think i know what,at times the movie was made for tv
1,why is n't this a movie that has the same name of the,why is it that the film never gets any good at all
1,the only good part of this movie is the music which is a little too old and,the only saving grace is that the characters themselves are not as bad as the ones
1,drew barrymore was excellent in her part of the,drew barrymore plays the woman with her heart
1,lynch 's first film in the series the last seduction of the same director and the same night of the living dead the same year and the equally overrated remake of the classic the hills,lynch 's first effort was to make a statement to a young man that he was the first to use a technique in which he had been used as an alibi to the world
1,the acting is terrible with the exception of some bad actors and the script is so bad that,the story is very thin and the acting is just too horrible to be a good one
1,so why was he not so angry,so it 's not a very well made
1,yes this film is a total ripoff of the first movie in its genre,yes there are some interesting parts of the movie the first one is about a
1,additionally i would have been happy to have,additionally it has a very good cast
1,and then it becomes a very bad film,and it 's not a great movie either
1,as it is this one is so bad that i could n't believe how bad,as an added bonus this one is just a waste of money to get
1,of course he gets his head blown up and does a 180 in the,of course the film has been a staple of the long long run
1,i saw it on the sundance channel in the theater when i was 11 or 14,i 've read this movie and i know what you 're missing from the end
1,here she is a bit too sweet and her acting,here 's a very good adjectives i can say
1,from the very beginning it 's obvious that the director 's cut on the,from the start to the end there is a lot to talk about
1,for the most part it 's not that great,for some reason they just did n't know where to
1,she is an attractive and very young woman who loves to love to love her,she was n't so much of a movie as her role in this film is the
1,still i think the main problem was the fact that the movie,still there was some good music and the soundtrack was great
1,she plays an attractive woman but is n't quite as charming as this movie is,she is the perfect choice to be given such a strong cast and her acting ability
1,i was really looking forward to seeing this movie,i have never been a big fan of the genre
1,neil simon and john cusack are excellent actors but i do n't think they were in the least,neil labute 's film has a very good cast but i think that it was a mistake
1,ron perlman plays dr john gielgud and the film 's climax,ron perlman is the perfect choice for this role of a man
1,interestingly enough it is an insult to both films and this is a real stinker,interestingly it 's a film of its day and its unflinching and powerful and it is
1,and it 's just that bad,and i do not think that any
1,maybe it was the fact that they were trying too hard to be funny and i do n't think it would have,maybe if you 're in the right mood for the ride to get to a end it 's worth a look
1,the only redeeming thing that i can say is,the plot is very weak but it does
1,so it 's a movie with a bunch of people that you know nothing about or do,so the film is very slow but i think it 's a great film to watch
1,essentially a lot of people who are familiar with this movie will not notice that the film is very long,essentially a lot of people have said that they should not have made a movie about them in their life or
1,bo is an actor of sorts and the acting is great but the film just is n't worth the effort,bo derek 's character is the only one i 've ever seen him in a movie that is not a caricature
1,if they did n't have a budget that would be the first time it was,if you 're a fan of the book it 's definitely worth a look
1,the movie is just a mess of a movie and it does have a few funny,the movie is a bit slow paced and the plot is just a tad confusing
1,and i really like the fact that the movie was made in the early 80 's,and the fact that the film was shot in the same time period in that era was
1,it was a waste of time i did n't get it,it 's not a movie about a man 's life in the
1,it 's a very good film,it 's not just that the story
1,it 's the first time i 've seen a film with a very good cast,it 's just a bad movie and the worst acting i 've ever seen
1,this is a very poor film,this is a movie that i can
1,in my case it is a good movie but not very well,in the end you 'll be left wondering what is that
1,the acting is superb with a very good,the film 's story is so convoluted
1,whats the best thing about it,whats a good example of a movie
1,i was surprised to learn that the movie was n't really about a killer who is a werewolf in disguise but he 's not even a werewolf,i do n't understand how the filmmakers could not make a film about a single character that is the only one to be the hero in this case
1,i was surprised that this movie is a waste of money and time,i 've watched this film twice and i have to say that i was
1,a lot of people think that this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life,a few years ago we had the privilege in the movie and had to do the job
1,it is a very funny film with great laughs,it was a great movie and it is a very
1,in the movie there is a lot of sex in it but there 's something about it that makes it so funny,in this movie she plays the part of an older woman and her son of her mother and a young woman
1,the only reason i watched this movie was that the movie 's plot summary was so bad that it was actually a waste of,the only thing this film had was the fact that the movie was made for the sake of being a great horror movie
1,but the real reason is that i did n't care,but the film is also quite good for those who want
1,it 's a very funny film and one of the best movies i 've ever,it is a very moving picture but it is not the best movie ever
1,they all seem to be the same old man but that 's not how it 's,they should n't have bothered that a sequel to the original film would be like
1,the movie is not a comedy or drama,the script is n't bad but the actors seem
1,understated and well written well acted and executed well acted,understated to the point of insanity is a film where you
1,i think they should have made a movie about,i am not going to spoil this movie
1,after the first few minutes of the movie i had no idea what it was,after a while i was surprised to hear that this was the best tv series of
1,also the acting is very poor,also i thought that he was a
1,life is about a bunch of teens who decide to leave their family alone for no,life is about a young woman who lives in a small village in new york
1,one of the greatest of its type that i have seen in quite some time,one of the few movies i saw in my lifetime that i could not stand out
1,from this point on we are left to care for the characters,from the opening shots of the main character 's eyes the movie is
1,what 's the point of this crap,what was the deal with him and his
1,yeah this is one of the best of the 80 's and 70 's,yeah i know this movie is a bad remake of the original movie
1,bruce lee does n't make much in the same role,bruce cabot and michael dudikoff were in this movie
1,it is a movie of course,it 's a very good and very
1,so if you have a chance to see this you will probably love it,so the only thing good about this film is it was a little too old
1,wandering along at a bar and talking about the police and the other one who is the one who does n't care about the other two,wandering around the streets of new york city and the city is filled with a very warm array of scenes that are reminiscent of the film
1,now if this were the worst movie i have ever seen i would be embarrassed,now i 've seen a few episodes of the tv series so i can compare the
1,this is a film that is so bad its,this is one of my favourite tv shows
1,at least i have n't seen him in any other film,at the beginning of the movie the viewer is left wondering why
1,the film has a nice cast of characters and the acting is good but the movie,the film is not very well done and is quite simply a film to entertain
1,being a huge fan of the series i was expecting a good film but this,being a fan of this genre i was very impressed with the first two
1,evidently i was wrong because i was n't sure what to expect from the movie,evidently the producers did n't have that kind of idea to create a character that would
1,there 's a scene where the girl is trying to kill him but it 's just a tad slow moving,there are a few good laughs and i liked the idea of the movie in the beginning and that 's what
1,this was the worst film i have ever seen and i 've seen it dozens of,this movie was not for me but i am not afraid to watch the film
1,so many years later a local family member is sent,so what 's it that makes this movie great
1,i was really surprised at how many of the scenes in this film were so,i 've seen this film several times already and it 's still worth it
1,the story is so full of holes it is n't even worth mentioning that the characters in this show are so annoying they have,the only reason i give it 2 out of 10 was because i thought it was one of the best of the series
1,paul is a little shy and a little too nerdy for his,paul rudd is a fine actor but he 's not funny
1,that is the only reason why i watched this,that was not the point of this film
1,until the very end there 's a scene where they 're supposed to have a,until the end i was surprised to find that i was watching the movie
1,by the numbers i have the impression of being a fan of the book i have not read the book i think this is a,by the way i think the director did not know that the movie was a good idea to have the actors to make it
1,the film has some great actors and actresses and a good,the movie was made for the sake of seeing it
1,the plot is simple but the film,the movie is very well shot
1,at times the film has a very simple plot but the story is about a,at least it is not a good idea that the movie can get worse
1,this movie was made for the purpose of being,this movie is a waste of my time
1,overall it is a good movie for the,overall it 's an enjoyable little flick
