0,the soundtrack itself is what made me
0,dante also does a good job directing about how i managed to see anakin bakula in this film harriet 's life at times so bad that

1,well i guess it 's not a bad movie but it 's not
1,it 's just a shame that this
1,or maybe it was a good idea for the movie to be made
1,overall i 'd say that this film
1,i was n't expecting much but i was n't expecting much
1,sometimes the film is a bit of a stretch of
1,why do they make a film like this that
1,george lucas is the only one who has ever been able to get the money back
1,brian yuzna was a very good filmmaker and this film is not for me
1,our heroes are not so bad they 're just bad
1,that is the only thing that i could n't
1,the movie is not about the people in the world or the way they are portrayed in the film
1,highly recommended for those who love the genre
1,finally it 's not even that funny
1,and it was the first time i saw this movie
1,i have n't seen it since i saw a clip of this film and the only
1,luckily it 's a good movie but the story is so weak that it is n't really scary

1,i was surprised to see that it was a film that i would n't even
1,she was a little too old for her role and i do n't think that
1,the film is a bit of a mess and a bit of an allout thriller but the
1,unfortunately the movie is not a good one
1,and the film 's main flaw was to make the audience feel like a voyeur
1,renting this movie if you want to see the mst3k version
1,it 's a shame that this movie has n't received
1,but the film is not a good film
1,the movie is about a group of people who go to a small town to get their money back
1,evie is a very beautiful and loving woman
1,and it 's not that i do

1,but this is a film that has no
1,thank goodness for the acting of the
1,darr is a film of the highest caliber of the genre
1,my favorite parts were the ones that did n't make me laugh
1,how can i not get into the movie
1,his character is the best character ever to grace
1,one can only wonder how the director could have
1,they are not the ones to blame
1,because it has the potential of a good movie
1,she 's a very nice woman but she has no talent whatsoever
1,you 'll have to see it to
1,could n't they have done a good job
1,this movie is so bad it 's funny
1,it 's just so bad that it 's almost impossible to watch
1,this is a very good movie
1,a lot of the movie is about a young woman named anna who has to deal
1,it is a very funny movie
1,so what 's the deal with this movie
1,ps the movie does n't have a lot to do
1,first of all it was a very bad film
1,he is a good actor but he 's a bad actor
1,i was surprised that the film was n't so bad
1,they are not in the film at all
1,i was n't really sure if this movie would have been a
1,this movie is so bad i ca n't remember anything worse
1,i do n't think i have ever heard of this movie
1,other people are n't even aware of the fact that the movie has no redeeming qualities
1,this movie is a great example of how a film can be
1,anyway i think it 's a good film
1,first off i have to admit that this movie
1,this is a very good show
1,it 's not a bad movie but it is n't
1,i was n't expecting a great deal of the movie but i was pleasantly surprised
1,crystal has a great voice and is the only one who has a voice
1,there are some great scenes in the movie
1,gay people are the only ones who do n't like it
1,i do n't want to spoil it
1,such as a few of those movies that are so
1,aware the film is not a good film
1,this movie was so awful that it was actually painful
1,first of all the acting was horrible and the plot was just plain awful
1,i have n't read the books but this is the best of the series
1,the film is a bit slow at first but also it 's not as bad as the first
1,but the movie is not about the war and the
1,this is a movie that you can watch and enjoy
1,race is a very bad show
1,the movie was shot on location at the time
1,on the other hand i have seen the movie numerous times and it 's not even that
1,i was so impressed with the story and the characters and the story line was
1,i do n't think that the director was trying to make it to the
1,it 's the same old movie that has been made in the past
1,no matter how many times he is in a film he is a master of his craft
1,i was expecting a lot more from this movie and i did not think it was good
1,as for the story the acting is very poor
1,both of the two men have been married to each other and the
1,i was n't expecting anything more than this
1,and i do n't think that the director was able
1,while i do n't think the movie was intended to be a comedy it 's still pretty funny
1,however i think it was very well made
1,i have seen this movie several times and i still love it
1,spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead i saw this movie when i was a child and i loved it
1,jesse is the best of the bunch
1,she is the only reason i have to watch the whole movie and i do n't think i 've seen any other
1,clichd characters and situations that are so poorly
1,thank god i have n't seen this
1,nothing really happens in the film
1,a very good film and a great film
1,to say it 's not a bad idea is beyond
1,the movie is about the struggle between two men in the same way
1,but the film is so bad that you ca n't help but
1,we 're supposed to sympathize with a bunch of
1,looking at the cast and crew of this movie i was very impressed
1,the acting is good the plot is good and the story is a bit farfetched
1,it 's a shame that the film has n't received any recognition for the entire cast
1,all in all this is a very
1,interesting and exciting but the film has
1,claudette colbert is a good actor and is the
1,but the real star of the film is the presence of a young woman
1,this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,but the movie is a bit too slow and
1,they are all very good and have
1,for a film about a woman that has been murdered by a man she
1,for the first time in a while i was a little surprised by the fact that the
1,she 's not the least bit attractive she has to be
1,the film is a complete waste of my time and
1,we are not told that the story is not the same
1,as for the rest of the cast i
1,the acting is pretty bad but the script and direction are all very
1,although this is a good film it 's not as good
1,this is a movie that you will
1,do not be fooled by the critics on the dvd cover
1,there is a lot of action and suspense in it
1,however the movie has no plot and no real plot
1,it is not a movie for kids or adults who want to see it but
1,one of them was a great actor and a great actor
1,i was n't expecting much from this film
1,the film is a bit too slow and the acting is not good but the story
1,it 's not that bad but it is n't that bad and that is why i ca
1,john goodman was a good choice for his role
1,all i can say is wow
1,the story is about a group of friends who go on a mission to find a way out of their inheritance but
1,she 's a great actress and she is perfect
1,a few scenes of the movie are just a little too long and it 's too hard to be sure that the director intended a bit of humor in the film to keep you watching and wondering what the
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
1,i was so bored that i could not even finish the movie
1,the movie is a little bit of an exercise in the genre
1,he was the most popular actor in the film and he was very good in
1,in the end it 's a great film and i recommend it to anyone who
1,it is a movie that will appeal to everyone who loves to be entertained by their intelligence
1,we have to watch this film for a long time and it is a great film that
1,i think that this film is a must watch for all fans of the genre
1,the film is a little slow paced and
1,some people may have been so offended
1,the acting and the script is very good
1,it 's not that i think that the actors were too good to be a great
1,please do n't waste your time on
1,kathy bates is a wonderful actress
1,the movie is a bit too long and it 's not a great film but it is very good
1,all in all i think this film is a must
1,the film is a very funny movie that is a delight in the genre but not in a good way
1,this is a very funny and funny movie
1,i was n't sure what to expect when i watched this movie
1,in the end i was n't sure if the film was intentional or what
1,confused and boring is a film that is n't worth watching
1,ok i have to say that i have n't seen a movie that is so bad
1,scary movie 3 is one of the best movies ever
1,the film is a very good film and the actors are very good
1,but it 's just not a good movie
1,too many times when the movie 's first half hour is
1,for a movie made in the early 90s i found the
1,he is a very talented actor
1,coincidentally the movie has a lot of problems
1,but this film is a must see
1,while i was n't expecting a good movie i was n't disappointed
1,then i saw the movie and i think that it was the funniest of the
1,i have seen this film several times and still ca n't believe it
1,cushing is a great actress and i have always been one of the few people who
1,the film is not about the war of war or the
1,plus the acting is n't bad either
1,i was surprised to see this film in the theater and it
1,beery 's portrayal of the president of the united states is so palpable that i could
1,along the way we learn that the man who killed the girl in the end is a man
1,they are all very different and they 're not just a bunch of kids
1,both of them have a lot of screen time
1,the film is a little bit of
1,some of the acting is good but it 's
1,so the movie has a few moments where the characters are so stupid that i could n't help but laugh
1,so i was surprised to see this movie
1,united artists of the time and their ability to create a new
1,the film is a little slow but i do n't think the movie
1,how can you have a movie that is so bad that it
1,the acting is good but the script is so poor that you ca n't even tell what is happening
1,i have never been a big fan of the genre of the series but it 's still fun to watch and the movie is still very good
1,recently i saw this movie and i must say i
1,also the movie is n't as bad as the first
1,we are not supposed to care about any of this
1,as for the story the acting and the directing is very good and it is
1,worthwhile to see a film like this that is not only a good film it is a good
1,cutting it down and then get the movie
1,a few years ago i was able to watch a movie that is a bit more interesting than this
1,all i can say is that i was n't disappointed in seeing this film
1,maybe it would have been a little more interesting
1,without the aid of a man of the age it 's a very good film
1,if you are looking for a good film to see in a theater this is not for you
1,after a few seconds of watching it i was wondering what was the purpose of it all
1,then again i have seen it
1,with the help of a few other people who were involved the movie could n't have
1,it 's a pity to see such a bad movie
1,why do n't you think the story is
1,the film is a bit slow moving and the ending is too predictable but it 's still
1,but the movie has a lot of fun
1,i have n't read the novel but i think it would have been
1,it 's the kind of movie you would like to watch and enjoy
1,his performance is so bad it 's almost laughable
1,another thing i did n't like was that the film was so bad that i had no idea
1,its a very good movie with a lot of action and great performances by everyone involved in this movie
1,but i have to admit that i am not a fan of the book
1,look for a good cast of actors
1,i do n't know why i did n't watch it
1,rich and beautiful the film is a perfect example of why
1,stop the movie and save yourself the time to watch it
1,a few years ago i was a bit skeptical of the movie and i
1,my advice is that if you 're looking for a movie that is a bit of a comedy
1,i'm sure it would have been better
1,they are the only ones that really do n't have the same level
1,it is a shame that this film was released on
1,yet the story is not that bad but it is not
1,ok i have n't seen it yet
1,this movie is not worth the price of admission
1,its the kind of movie you would like to see again in your lifetime or maybe it
1,spoiler ahead the movie starts out with the girl getting shot and the head is in the background
1,the movie was a bit slow
1,apparently the movie was made for the sake of the viewer to identify with the characters but i
1,my only criticism is that the film was shot in a time where it was
1,ok so i guess i 'll be honest
1,with the help of the two leads the two of them are in the movie
1,and that does not mean that it was n't the worst movie i 've seen in a long time
1,just as the film is a bit too much to ask for a
1,it is a very good film
1,taken from the original the story is told in a flashback and the story is about a man who is in love with a woman and
1,whenever you 're watching this film you will have a good time with it
1,the film has a very interesting story
1,after seeing this movie i thought that it was a good movie
1,i do n't think that a good thing can be said for this movie
1,i have to say that i was impressed by the fact that
1,while i do n't know what to say about it i was n't impressed
1,they have a lot of fun to watch
1,after a while i thought it was a
1,the film is about a young woman who is attracted to a young man
1,this film is not a good film but the
1,now i am a sucker for the fact that this movie was made by the same director as it did in this movie
1,oh and the music is very good as well
1,composition is a very strong one
1,mike binder was a great choice for his role as the conflicted father and his father
1,further it was a great show for me
1,don knotts is a fine actor but the movie is so awful
1,all in all i think it is one of the best and most underrated movies
1,it 's the kind of thing that you would like to see in the theater
1,redcoat is a good actress but it
1,it is n't the best of the series
1,either way it is a movie that will appeal to anyone
1,the film is about a man who is a woman
1,and i do n't know why
1,my favorite parts of the movie are when the girl is trying to kill her and the girl who has her mouth ripped out
1,it 's a pity that the film is n't as bad as the first
1,this is a very good film
1,at the end of the movie the audience is left
1,artie lange is excellent in this role as the young woman
1,there are many many things that i 've seen about
1,the film is about the power of the characters
1,the film is a bit too slow but it does n't really matter
1,however the film is n't really a comedy
1,i have never seen a film that has a
1,in the end it is not a bad movie it 's a good movie to watch
1,i was so impressed with the story and i could not help but wonder what was going on and what happened
1,that is what this movie has going for it
1,these are two of the best movies ever made
1,when he is in the hospital he is forced to go to the police
1,once again this film is so bad that the only thing i have to say is that it is not even worth the time to view it
1,the film has a very interesting and interesting story
1,not only is the story of an interesting love triangle between the two leads but they are also quite
1,nowadays it was a good film but it did not
1,this was a very good movie
1,at one point i was thinking of the first movie i saw the trailer for this movie
1,every character was a real jerk
1,did i mention that it is a film about a young woman who is a little
1,on the other hand the movie is a complete waste of time and money
1,janmichael vincent plays the lead role as the evil and vengeful man
1,imagine this film is a very good film
1,for the first time in the movie i was a bit confused about this movie and i was surprised at
1,then the film is a bit too slow and boring and the ending is a bit unsatisfying
1,thank you for allowing me to watch this movie and you will see how many people have seen this
1,slow motion is a little bit too much for me but i do n't think that
1,well it 's not a bad film but it is n't bad
1,kudos to the director for putting the blame on his face and his own vision of the
1,still this movie was a good idea to make a great movie and
1,the movie is about a group of people who go to a small island to spend a weekend together in
1,and the movie is so bad
1,it is a movie that you should see
1,this is a very bad movie
1,what 's the deal with the story of the man who plays a young man who has no qualms about the past
1,the acting is horrible the story is bad and it is n't even worth mentioning
1,i do n't know what to say about the
1,during the course of the film the viewer has no idea who the culprit is
1,there is a very funny scene where the guy says
1,i was n't impressed by the film
1,i have n't seen this movie in my entire life so i ca n't wait until i see
1,since i was in the mood for something more interesting to watch i could n't help but wonder how the movie
1,land of the living dead is a film that will appeal to everyone involved and should definitely not
1,blatant spoilers ahead of the story
1,the acting is horrible the story is ridiculous and the acting is horrible
1,this movie is a must see for anyone who wants to watch
1,but the movie does not make much sense and the characters do not really care
1,take it from me and give it
1,if you are looking for a movie about a young man you should see this movie
1,the film is very well made and the actors are great
1,characters are n't developed to be believable
1,set in the present day globalization of a young woman 's journey is a little too much for her own
1,it 's a shame because i do n't want to spoil the movie for
1,i was n't impressed with the movie because i thought the ending was very predictable
1,russia 's first feature is not the greatest movie ever made but it 's still a
1,i was expecting this movie to be good
1,pilots and gentlemen are a bit of a nuisance and i would n't be surprised if i could n't have done a little bit more
1,night of the demons is a movie that should be seen as a
1,i do n't know what to say about this movie
1,all in all this is not a
1,for the rest of the film the acting was terrible
1,this is not a movie about how
1,the story is very simple and the
1,this is a very good movie
1,lenzi is a master of horror cinema and this is a
1,the film is about a young woman named caroline who is a young woman
1,there are some great moments but it is not a film that i would n't recommend it to anyone
1,movies like the texas chainsaw massacre and the exorcist are all pretty funny
1,some people have commented on this film but i have to agree that this is a
1,when i saw it i could n't help but laugh at it
1,it 's just a bad film
1,it 's a very bad movie that is not even worth renting
1,i have to say i was very disappointed in
1,for a movie that has a few redeeming features to be made it is a film
1,it 's not a bad movie either
1,the movie was a complete failure
1,but the film 's biggest problem is its
1,considering how bad this movie is i have to say that i was a little disappointed
1,i have to admit that i was a little surprised at the amount of time i spent watching this
1,definitely not the greatest film i 've seen in a long time
1,over a year ago i was looking for a good film to watch
1,when the movie ended you 'd think it was the best
1,the movie has some of the worst acting i 've ever seen
1,if you 're not a fan of horror films and are interested in the
1,will the director please explain that he is a talented director
1,sadly the film 's plot was n't that good
1,part of this is how the director 's character is so unlikable that you do n't have to be a fan to understand this film
1,congrats to anyone who likes a good story
1,kate beckinsale is the perfect choice for this movie
1,one can only imagine that the movie was made
1,it was a great movie and it was a great
1,viggo mortensen is the only actor who can
1,i was surprised to see that the first film was not so bad
1,crispin glover is excellent in this film
1,but i was n't disappointed with this movie
1,she is a good actress and she is very good as always
1,handsome and intelligent and very funny
1,james woods 's character in this film is
1,it 's not a bad movie either
1,i have seen it many times and it 's still very good
1,and it was a very good movie
1,and the film is not a bad film
1,overall i would recommend this film to anyone
1,lots of people have to be killed by some kind
1,but i have seen it many more times
1,bet is that the film is n't so
1,police detective is the best film i have
1,if you 're a fan of the original you will love it
1,we are shown a very different perspective
1,and i do think that it was just
1,pilot 's character is a bit of a jerk
1,the film is not about the evils of the war or the war but it is a very very bad movie
1,but the film has a very good cast and it has
1,while the movie has a few moments that are n't funny and the ending is a bit too predictable it is not
1,one thing the film has going for it is the fact that it is based
1,but i think that the film was a little bit of a
1,if you 're looking for an intelligent and intelligent film about a group of
1,but i have to admit i did n't like the ending
1,as a matter of fact there 's a scene where the killer is trying to get the
1,the film is not a comedy it
1,want to be a part of the world and a movie like this
1,the movie is very well made
1,greg kinnear was a great actor
1,you can tell it is a movie that is supposed to be a comedy but it is n't
1,my favorite parts of the film are the ones where the two are talking about the
1,let me tell you that i am not a fan of the genre
1,there is a very funny and funny scene in this film
1,if the film had a chance to make a good movie about it the
1,i was n't expecting much of a film
1,the film is a little bit slow moving but the film is a great piece of work
1,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,at first i thought i 'd give it a try but i did n't
1,she is a very beautiful young woman
1,the film has some good points but the plot is so weak that it is hard to care
1,parts of the film were just too much to make me feel like i was watching the movie with a
1,but it was n't a good movie
1,with a cast of characters that are supposed to be the main character 's wife 's daughter
1,and i was n't sure why i was n't in the mood for a movie that was n't funny or interesting enough
1,a lot of things happen in the movie
1,unfortunately it 's not a bad movie
1,she is the only person who is a good
1,i was so impressed with the story that i was surprised at the end
1,but i think that the best part of the movie was when it was shown in the first place
1,although it was n't the worst movie i 've ever seen i was n't sure whether the
1,someone who has a copy of this movie has no clue what it is
1,though i was n't expecting anything much from it i did n't expect anything much from the film
1,even if it was a good movie the
1,blaine and dunne are the best actors of the film and their performances are superb
1,nick nolte is a fine actor and is always underrated
1,no matter how many times it 's been done and you have to see the whole thing you will
1,what a shame that i did n't get
1,two men in a different world and the other
1,there are many scenes where you can see the director 's cut and the camera shots are so bad and the lighting and editing is so amateurish that
1,leaving the room for a while is
1,as a result it 's just a bad excuse for a movie
1,in the meantime it was a little too late and the movie did n't get much better
1,i was surprised by the way the director and director approached a movie that
1,the story is simple but it does n't matter
1,the film was shot at a time in the west and i was n't sure why it did n't get released on
1,yet the movie has a few faults
1,it 's just a bad movie and
1,i do n't think it 's that bad
1,the movie is a complete bore and it 's not even worth the
1,i was n't expecting much from it at all
1,but i think the director should be ashamed of
1,and i think the movie is n't bad at all
1,but the film is n't that bad
1,i do n't think i can ever watch the whole film again
1,the film is a very good film and the performances are excellent
1,how could they make it a good film
1,there was a lot of action and a few scenes of violence but it did n't matter that much
1,i have seen a lot of movies that have been made in the past
1,did n't they think the film was going to be a
1,it was so bad that it was funny
1,as the story unfolds the film begins to unravel the plot and
1,i do n't know how many times i have seen this movie but i have to say
1,i was so impressed by this movie that i was n't even sure
1,some of the actors in the movie are very good
1,andy garcia is the most underrated character ever in
1,and the ending was a bit abrupt and i did n't really understand why the movie had so little
1,do n't get me wrong i love the movie but i think it was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
1,because the film is a little too much for the genre
1,could have done a better job
1,for me the most important part of this movie is the music
1,i do n't think this movie has a
1,khorda 's character was the first one to
1,but i was n't sure what it was
1,for the first half hour i thought it was going to be a good movie
1,why do they keep making movies like these
1,but it 's still pretty fun to watch
1,you can watch it and you wo n't regret it
1,only one thing that i can say about this is that the film is very good
1,i was expecting a lot more from the film but it was not as good as the first film and i
1,i think that the film was made for the sole purpose of being a
1,rudy vallee was the only one who could have played the part
1,i was expecting a movie that was a little bit too long for
1,it 's just not a movie for kids who want to
1,what a shame that the film is not a total waste of time
1,they 're just so funny they 're all funny
1,the film has no real plot and is a complete waste of time
1,i was n't sure what to expect from this movie
1,i think the film 's biggest problem with the film is the
1,her character was so annoying that it was almost unbearable to watch
1,by now the movie has a good cast
1,certainly the worst movie i have ever seen
1,the acting is horrible and the script is a joke
1,the film is a very good film
1,it 's not even that funny
1,jessica alba is a delight to watch
1,when the film 's main characters were revealed the audience would be left to care for themselves
1,no one has ever seen this movie
1,but i do n't know why i have never heard of this show and have n't read the book
1,so the movie is a bit of an exercise in logic
1,so the film is not a complete waste of time
1,here is the story of a girl who 's been kidnapped by the devil
1,in this case it is the best thing i can say about this film
1,steiger is a fine actor and he does a good job as a man who gets to know his wife
1,peter o'toole plays his role perfectly and is a joy to watch
1,thanks to the cast for the role of a young girl the story is very interesting
1,marilyn monroe is a very good actress
1,limbo was a very funny movie and it was a great movie
1,nothing happens and i do n't want to spoil anything but i 'll say that
1,i do n't think i 've ever heard of this show before
1,if you want a movie to make you laugh then go ahead
1,lost highway was a very good film
1,one thing is that it 's not even funny
1,i have never been so compelled to sit through a
1,gangsters who are n't in the military and do n't
1,sonatine is a very good film with a great cast
1,and the ending is very predictable
1,so if you are a fan of
1,that is a great thing to say about this movie
1,i have n't seen this film in a long
1,troy is an old guy with a heart of gold and he 's a good guy
1,the film is a complete bore
1,i have n't seen the movie in my entire life
1,is the story a bit of a mess
1,this is a great movie for everyone who wants to see a
1,in this movie the characters are so stupid that you can almost feel sorry for them
1,of course there is a scene where the two brothers are talking to the camera in the
1,janet gaynor plays the young woman who is a little bit too young to play
1,i was n't sure if the film was intentional or not
1,director robert zemeckis is a master of his work and is a great filmmaker
1,they were the best and most of the
1,now i have to say that i was
1,lauren bacall is a wonderful actress and i really
1,why is it that the movie does n't have
1,we have the movie on the whole
1,plenty of blood and nudity and gore
1,regarding the movie i found myself wishing that it would have been released
1,and it 's a shame because it is a great film
1,the movie was a bit of fun to watch and i really enjoyed that
1,therefore the story is a bit weak but i think the movie is a bit too long
1,while this movie has a lot of problems it 's just plain bad
1,5 a few scenes are just plain
1,the acting was terrible the story was awful and the acting was bad
1,martin scorsese is a master of the
1,instead it was a complete waste of time
1,i do n't think it 's a good idea to write a script for this movie
1,in a way the movie was so bad that i could n't even watch it
1,but i have to say that i was very impressed with how the movie was
1,on a technical level this movie could have been a lot
1,obviously the director of the movie has n't seen
1,john wayne was a good actor but he was not the worst actor in this movie and it was n't
1,so i have to give credit where i went
1,then again i was a bit skeptical of the movie but
1,as the film opens you can see how the director 's vision of the film can be interpreted
1,the film is about a group of people trying to find their way home
1,this movie is a great piece of art
1,what i did like was the acting the
1,unfortunately the film is so bad that i could n't believe it
1,i was n't expecting much but the film had some good points but it was not enough
1,bottom line it 's a great movie
1,when i saw this movie i was very impressed and i had never seen it in a theater
1,i have seen this movie several times and i still love it
1,but i think it 's the worst movie i have ever seen
1,it 's not even the kind of movie where the hero
1,he 's a great character actor and he 's a great actor
1,cheapjack action sequences and the occasional action scenes are not very memorable and the ending was just too predictable
1,all in all it was a very
1,the film is a little slow but the ending is a bit unsatisfying
1,on a technical side note the film has an interesting story
1,its a good film but it 's not
1,sherman 's evaluation of the film is not only a
1,first of all this film is not worth a look
1,that 's the way it is presented
1,seriously i think this is the best movie i have ever seen
1,in fact the whole thing is a mess
1,overall the movie is a waste of time
1,not only was it a very bad film but it was n't a bad movie
1,mr blandings is the perfect person to
1,it is the best of the three
1,ayesha takia and her husband were also good in this movie
1,now i do n't know how to describe it
1,this film is not for everyone but if you
1,and it does n't work for me
1,a good movie for a sunday night
1,shoddy acting poor script and bad acting
1,you have to see it for yourself
1,toth 's film is an excellent film and it 's one of the most
1,she is the most talented character in the film
1,watch this film and you 'll be hooked
1,tom hanks was the only actor i had
1,do n't be fooled by the cover of
1,and the acting is n't bad
1,in this movie the characters were so real they were
1,the film 's plot revolves around a group of young men who
1,the film is a complete waste of time and money
1,but it 's not a movie
1,let me say that this was not a great movie
1,first of all the acting is terrible
1,moronic movie that was so bad it was funny
1,death bed was a good movie
1,watching this film i was reminded of the real life of the characters
1,why did n't he just kill the president
1,after a few years the movie was a flop
1,although i do n't understand how it was made and i thought that the movie was a bit too slow
1,i do n't know why the director was able to make this
1,she was so cute and so cute
1,she 's a very beautiful woman
1,the film is a little too talky and too predictable
1,his wife has a onenight stand with him
1,more like an extended version of the book
1,mcclane is a very funny character and he 's very believable
1,there is a lot more to the story
1,i was n't expecting much from this movie
1,i was so bored by the movie i had to
1,there is a scene where he is a victim of the movie and
1,instead of a good movie i just saw this movie
1,the film was a little too long and i did not expect much from the
1,the film is a complete failure and it is not worth the time
1,i have to say that it 's a great film
1,it is a shame that the movie did not receive a wider audience in the us
1,it was a good idea but it is not a good one
1,it is not that i think it is a good movie
1,if you 're a fan of the original and have seen the original you might want to check out some of the other films
1,i was so impressed with the story and the story
1,he is not the only one who has the slightest amount of
1,mick cain is the only actor who is very good as well
1,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,instead we are left wondering why this is not a sequel to the original
1,the film is a complete waste of time
1,except for the fact that it has a few good points it 's still a pretty good movie
1,i think it 's the funniest of all the batman movies
1,the movie is a little slow paced but it 's still a very
1,snakes and monsters are n't as bad as they are
1,this is the first time i have
1,i think it 's the best of the three movies
1,but the story of the movie is so simple that it makes the story
1,the film is very well directed and directed by michael winner
1,the film is not a complete mess
1,a lot of people have already commented on this film and i have to say
1,i was surprised to find that the story was not so much more interesting and interesting
1,the movie was shot in a small town in mexico and it was filmed in the
1,executive producer john hughes is a director who is
1,to me this movie is a masterpiece of the art of art
1,the acting is horrible and the plot is just plain stupid
1,but it 's not that good
1,and the film 's ending was so
1,it was a waste of time
1,lorenzo lamas was the perfect choice for a movie like that
1,as for this film it 's not a bad movie
1,the film has a very good cast including a young man who has
1,though i do n't know what the movie is supposed to be i just do n't know if it is the same
1,the film is about a young man named luis who has an accident with
1,this movie is not a bad movie
1,i do n't know what to say
1,i think that the best way is the way the characters are portrayed
1,i have never seen the original version and
1,hymer is the only reason why she is so great and the rest of her life is so beautiful that you ca n't help thinking that
1,upstairs is a very good film
1,make sure you 're a fan of
1,i was so disappointed with this film
1,he is a great actor but he 's not a great actor
1,the film 's main drawback is that it
1,i have to say that this is the worst
1,to be honest the movie was n't bad
1,the acting was terrible the script was horrible and the acting was bad
1,overall this film is not a bad
1,i was n't impressed by this film
1,too bad the film is n't so long as a film
1,everybody else is just plain bad
1,but it 's not a good movie
1,i have never heard of this film before
1,the film 's plot is a little confusing and it 's not a good movie
1,the movie has a few funny moments but it is just not worth
1,this movie is a must see
1,so i was expecting something like this to be a good movie
1,i do think that this movie is a waste of time and money and time
1,yet it is a film that will be remembered
1,sit down and watch this one with a smile and laugh
1,i have never been more impressed with such a bad
1,the story is a simple one
1,this is a movie for everyone to watch
1,mercifully the story is not that good but the actors
1,sometimes i have to say i was a little disappointed with this film
1,perhaps this was the first time he was in his prime
1,where was it that i 'd never seen in a movie
1,as i said earlier the film has an interesting plot and is n't a comedy or a comedy
1,this movie was made in a hurry in the early days of the 20th century
1,both the story and the characters are very well developed and it 's a shame that it has
1,i was surprised by the ending
1,much like the film the story of this film is a
1,the acting is good and there are a few laughs
1,i have n't seen this movie in years
1,several of the scenes in the film are very funny
1,perhaps the film is n't as good as the original but it is n't as bad as
1,get a lot of people to watch the movie and
1,zizek has made an interesting movie that is a great example of how the film
1,but the movie has the same problems with this film
1,they are both funny but they do
1,some have commented on the film 's plot and the acting
1,even the music is n't very bad
1,at least the film is n't that bad
1,perfectly acted and directed and produced
1,it 's a pity because it is
1,in fact i would have given the show a higher rating but the acting and direction
1,the acting is pretty good and the story is a bit too contrived for a thriller
1,when the movie starts it 's not a bad thing to begin with
1,alan rickman is excellent and his character is very interesting and believable
1,thinking about the movie and you will see how the director managed
1,he is a very good actor
1,denzel washington is a great actor
1,there is no real reason why the movie is called the
1,but the story of the movie was just so bad
1,in the end it 's a very good film
1,but it is a very good movie and a good one at that
1,his character is the only character who seems to care about him
1,rowan atkinson is great as always
1,where was the gore and the blood
1,why did n't the director make a film about
1,here 's a list of things to make a good movie
1,he 's not a good actor but
1,but the film is not as good as the first two but it does
1,the movie is a little bit of an insult to the
1,even the actors who played the main character were
1,watch this film for a laugh
1,the acting is pretty bad and the plot is pretty weak
1,there is no way to get a copy of the original
1,this is a great movie for those
1,this is one of the few films that i would recommend
1,sawyer is a very nice movie
1,however the film is a complete mess
1,there are some good scenes in the film
1,this movie was so bad that i was actually
1,as the movie progresses the story develops slowly and slowly becomes increasingly confusing
1,funny how i can get a copy of this movie
1,amos is not the only one to die in the end but the rest
1,the story line is very weak but it 's still pretty good
1,there are some good scenes in the film but the film
1,it 's just a shame that it has n't made any difference
1,the film 's premise is that of a man who has a wife and a son
1,although i was impressed by the acting and the direction it seemed to drag on and on
1,his performance was so bad that i had to watch the whole thing
1,now this is a good example of the genre
1,not to mention the lack of a decent story
1,i was expecting a lot from the first movie but this
1,and the movie has the best of all it has
1,example the fact that it 's just a bunch of random characters
1,i was n't really expecting much from this movie and it was n't a good film
1,only a couple of scenes that are n't even close
1,fighting of wits and the beast and it 's a great film to
1,like the other reviewer said i was n't disappointed
1,i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie that is so bad
1,i was surprised that this film was n't released theatrically in dvd
1,tom is a good actor and he plays the part
1,and i was n't impressed by the fact that the story of the movie
1,on the other hand the film has an odd plot and the acting is
1,and the movie is so bad that it
1,some of the other actors have some good
1,too bad it did n't make a movie
1,good thing about it was that there was no real story line and the movie is just plain bad
1,dept is a movie that should be watched by everyone who
1,it was so bad that it was funny
1,ben stiller is the best in this movie and he is very good at
1,it is n't a bad movie
1,slowly he is able to get a little of the same kind of man in
1,the acting is good but the script is n't very good
1,really it was a great movie and it had a lot
1,adora 's character was so unlikable and
1,the acting was n't bad either
1,the film is a bit too slow and slow but the story is very simple and the acting is excellent
1,but i have to admit that this is one of
1,with this film the film is very well done and the director and director have a great eye for the story and the characters and the characters are believable
1,another thing that is missing is the lack of originality and the lack of any real emotion
1,there was a scene in which he 's talking about his life and the film is a bit too long
1,then the story is about a man who
1,when the film is finally released it 's a very good movie
1,bates plays the part of a young woman who is a little
1,overall it 's a good movie but not
1,it 's a shame because the movie is so bad it makes me want to
1,this film is a must see for any serious film buff
1,or is it a coincidence to be a part of the film
1,as a result the movie is a complete failure and the acting
1,on a positive note the acting was good and it was a good film
1,romasanta is one of the best films i 've seen in a long
1,the movie starts off with some good
1,an excellent cast and a very good cast
1,entertaining to watch and a great deal of time
1,garbo and the others are both very good
1,sexy little kids who have been a big fan of
1,buscemi is a great actor and is the best thing about this movie
1,this is a movie about the evils of war and how the war
1,definitely the most memorable film i 've ever seen
1,one of the most memorable films i 've seen this year
1,charlton heston is a fine actor
1,there is a lot of action in the film
1,in the end it 's not a movie that you should see
1,mckee 's direction is very good and the story is a bit too predictable for a horror
1,i was surprised to find this film to be a complete bore
1,i do n't want to spoil anything but the plot is a little confusing
1,so i was expecting a lot of fun
1,not to mention the acting is horrible and the acting was bad
1,and that 's the only reason i
1,the story was a bit weak and the characters were not developed
1,this movie is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen
1,this is one of the best movies
1,next the film has a very interesting story and a very good story but
1,this movie has the worst special effects i 've seen in
1,even though the story was n't as bad as the book it still is not the worst movie ever
1,bad acting bad script bad acting and a terrible
1,i was n't expecting anything else to be said about this movie but it was n't
1,in the end the story is a complete mess
1,she was a very good actor
1,often the film is not for the squeamish but the
1,if you 're looking for a fun movie that is a mustsee for any fan
1,i was expecting the worst movie ever made
1,i was n't expecting much from this movie but it did have its flaws
1,i'm sure the film is going to be a little more realistic but the movie is n't
1,this movie was a waste of time for me and my mates
1,the movie is a little bit of a
1,a few minutes later i had to watch it
1,she 's a very nice guy who has been a very successful actress in the past
1,some of the scenes are pretty funny but
1,it 's just a bad movie
1,the film is very well made and is a great film
1,the film has a lot of good things going for it
1,a good cast is wasted in this film
1,and the film is not a complete
1,connolly 's performance in this movie is a little overdone and i would n't be surprised to see him
1,wendigo is the worst movie ever made
1,i think that 's why the movie is so funny
1,but it 's a good movie and a good
1,the movie is a little bit of fun and i think it would have been much better
1,the movie is very well done
1,one day i have a crush on the director and i can see
1,davidson and his wife and father are a little too eager to be a good person
1,spoilers ahead the plot is pretty basic and the acting is bad
1,you have to be one of these people to make it through
1,so the movie was n't that bad
1,especially when the film 's main focus on the
1,the film was a bit slow but i liked it
1,why does n't he just go to
1,and the ending was a complete copout
1,i was expecting something like this to be a little bit of an exercise on the genre
1,something that i have seen in my life and i have seen
1,but this movie is not a bad movie
1,or the fact that it was made by an outsider
1,the film is not as good as some of the others but it does n't have
1,here 's a few examples of this film
1,if it 's on tv you can see the whole movie
1,similar to the first one but this one is just plain awful
1,as the film opens it 's not even a movie
1,he was the most talented character in the film as a young boy who was in his early twenties
1,the movie was a complete waste of
1,no matter what it takes on the screen
1,as a fan of the genre i have n't seen the original
1,basically the movie is a little slow but
1,it was so bad i could n't help but feel like i
1,he 's a good actor and is the only good character in
1,fifth i have to say i have n't seen a movie that i
1,within the first ten minutes of the film i was wondering what would happened if they were making the sequel to the first one
1,the story is about a bunch of young men
1,now that i have read the book i think the
1,so the film is not about as good as the
1,whoever wrote this script is the writer of the movie
1,this is a very bad film that i could n't even finish watching
1,this movie is a waste of your time
1,when the film 's title suggests that this is not a horror movie
1,one of the best things about this movie is that it has a very good cast
1,he 's a great director and a good actor who can play a good role
1,set in the future the story of the film 's main character was a little too ambitious for a young woman
1,and i do n't want to spoil it for you but it
1,that 's what the movie does
1,i was n't expecting much but this was a very
1,i do n't know what to say
1,while the movie does n't have a plot to begin with the plot was pretty good and the acting was excellent
1,kirsten dunst is great as always and she
1,always a pleasure to see the movie and it is n't the
1,and the acting is so bad it hurts
1,perhaps this is a film that will appeal
1,first off the acting was horrible
1,shelley winters is a fine actor and i think that he was
1,i have to admit that i am a huge fan of this movie and i have n't
1,damn the acting is terrible the script is bad and the acting is bad
1,the movie has a few good points but the plot is
1,de toth 's film is an excellent film that is not only for those who love the work of
1,it 's a shame that it is not available on video
1,i was expecting this movie to be a good movie but
1,there was no real chemistry between the two main characters
1,the acting is good with a few exceptions and the
1,we are supposed to believe that the main character is not a good guy
1,john wayne was a great actor and
1,as i mentioned above i have to admit that i
1,the movie is not about as good as the first one but it
1,problems arise in a way that is a bit confusing
1,greetings from a haunted house is an excellent film with a lot of great acting and an intriguing
1,as a fan of the original series the film was a little bit of a disappointment
1,do n't waste your time on this
1,i'm not sure whether this is the worst of the movie or not it is
1,there is a lot of good acting and a great story line
1,trained to be a little too old to be a
1,there 's a lot of good action in this film
1,if you are not into the subject matter you will find it very
1,thematically the film is a bit of a mess
1,it 's not a bad film
1,the movie is very good and is very funny
1,chow yun fat plays a very likable character who does a good job of portraying a character that is so bad that it
1,the film has an underlying theme that makes
1,the movie starts off well with an intriguing premise
1,wow the movie is a complete waste of time
1,this is a very good movie
1,so i guess it 's a bit too much to be true to the book but it 's just
1,scarecrow 's story is about the same thing
1,this was a very good movie
1,but it 's not a bad movie it 's a
1,in fact the only redeeming feature of the entire movie is that it is
1,when you see this movie it is n't
1,soon the film begins to unravel the story of the man and the
1,this was one of the most boring
1,the film is about a young woman who is attracted to her husband by a mysterious old man
1,ultimately it does have its moments
1,from the very start of this movie it 's all a dream
1,they were the most interesting and most
1,must have been a bit more than the sum
1,bert is a great actor and i have always been
1,i have to wonder why the film makers chose such a
1,years later the film is a complete mess
1,simon is a very talented director
1,we have a movie that has a lot of potential and
1,utterly unbelievable but i think that the
1,and it 's not a bad film
1,if you have a chance to see this film and are in love with the other reviewers
1,this is a movie that i can watch for
1,after a few episodes the film begins to drag downhill
1,the acting is pretty good but the story line is n't as bad as i expected it to be
1,there 's a lot of gore and gore
1,the movie is a bit too much for me to like
1,just as you would expect a movie that has a lot of good action scenes and
1,it was n't a good movie and it did n't really have much
1,i was n't expecting much from the movie
1,he 's the only person who knows how to handle
1,the film 's plot is a little convoluted
1,whether it 's the real world the people in the movie or the fact that there
1,this is a movie that i can watch over and over again
1,the film 's plot is a little confusing but the characters are likable
1,however the movie is a complete mess
1,kidman is the perfect choice for her role in this film
1,there are some good moments in this movie but it does n't
1,taking the film in the first half hour to get it to a climax and then the plot is revealed and the characters are all over the top and they
1,during the first half of the movie the viewer is subjected to an uneasy and unsettling ending that
1,at one point i thought that this was going
1,why did n't he just go into the woods and get the girl to sleep
1,what i got is a movie that
1,i have seen this movie and the first time
1,this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen
1,there is nothing to spoil it for you
1,i'm glad that i have seen it
1,i was n't really sure what to expect but i did enjoy the movie
1,i do n't want to spoil the movie because i do n't want to be so harsh
1,frustrating to say the least but the acting is pretty good
1,this is a very good film
1,rhys meyers is a great choice for the role of a man in the movie
1,in fact the only thing good about this movie was the fact that it was made by a bunch of kids
1,the movie was a waste of time
1,the film has an odd ending that is not surprising to me
1,some of the scenes in the film are
1,the acting is horrible and the acting is horrible
1,it was n't the first movie to be made
1,it 's not a movie that you can watch
1,wow this movie is so bad it 's funny to watch
1,i do not know why i have never heard of the
1,i was expecting this to be a great movie
1,it 's not that i do n't know the plot but i do n't
1,so i was n't expecting anything more from the movie but i was n't expecting much
1,the film 's plot is a simple one but the film is a very enjoyable film
1,there is also the scene where the two lovers have their head bashed in a car and
1,in the meantime the film is a bit of a mess
1,the film 's plot is a bit of a mess but the
1,the story of the kelly gang' is the
1,the movie is very funny and it 's not even the typical action movie that is
1,the movie is about a man who is trying to get his hands on a man
1,not only was the acting horrible the script terrible
1,so if the director was n't a bit prejudiced he would have
1,putting it on a dvd of the original is that i have to say it is a movie that
1,john goodman 's character is the only person who can be
1,the acting was good and it was a great movie
1,it is n't that the story is n't
1,you know that this film will appeal to everyone who
1,misty mundae is a good actress but she is very good in her role
1,this is the best of the series
1,this film was not a bad movie
1,then the film switches into an interesting premise
1,quite a bit of action in the film is n't the case but the fact that the film is a
1,i do n't want to spoil the plot for you but i do n't
1,i do n't know how many times i have seen
1,this is one of the most boring films i 've seen in a long long
1,alonzo is a great actor but he is not a very good actor
1,fans of the original series have a lot to say
1,true the story is a bit farfetched
1,though the story of the story is not as good as the first film it was very good
1,you have to see it for yourself
1,after all the film is a complete mess
1,the film is about a man named melvin who is diagnosed with
1,a lot of the movie was made in the early 80 's but the acting was horrible
1,leading lady helen hunt has a nice role as the mother of a young boy who is
1,again the movie was a bit of an insult to me but
1,my favorite part was the one where he 's trying to kill his mother
1,along the way they find themselves in the desert of the world of the dead
1,the film was a little slow but i was really impressed
1,but this one is a complete waste of
1,why did n't she just have to go through the same motions
1,generally i think the film was a waste for the whole family
1,i have seen this movie several times and it 's still a great film
1,the acting is horrible the plot is bad the special effects are bad the special effects are bad
1,the film is about a man who
1,i was expecting a good movie
1,and that is the only reason i gave this movie a 1
1,superimposed on the wind the two leads are the best
1,but it 's a good movie
1,chris farley is a fine actor and is a very underrated actor
1,vincent cassel is the only actor who
1,the film is a very good film
1,i have n't read the book so i can read it
1,and i do n't think that it was a great film but it 's not a great movie
1,apparently there are some very good actors in this movie
1,one of the best films of the year and one of the funniest
1,many of the actors in this film are very bad
1,i do n't know why this movie is so much of the
1,the movie starts out as a very funny movie with the main character getting a little bit of trouble and
1,his character is a little too old for
1,this movie was so horrible it was painful to watch
1,but it 's not the worst movie i 've ever
1,the film is about a group of people who are trying to survive and get killed in a remote cabin
1,anyway i have to say that this film
1,and i do n't think that it would have made a great movie
1,i was so impressed by the movie that it 's so
1,patrick swayze is a great actor
1,i was surprised to find that the story was not as good as
1,all in all a good movie
1,how did the director think he was the best director of the
1,i have n't seen this film yet and
1,when he is in the movie it 's hard for him to be the
1,let 's face it it is n't a movie that i would n't
1,the film is a complete bore
1,it 's just a bad movie
1,more than a few things i liked the first half of the movie
1,both of them are a little different
1,she was the most beautiful woman i 've ever seen in a horror movie
1,the acting was good the story was good and the acting was good
1,you know the drill was going to be in the middle of the road but the movie is n't so bad as
1,the unguarded world' is a great film
1,the acting is pretty poor and i have to say that i have n't read the novel and i
1,why is this film so popular
1,nightbreed is one of my favorite horror films
1,the film is a very good film
1,back in the late 1800s the film was a success of the time and it was released in the
1,the film is not a comedy
1,yes the movie is n't as good as the first one but it is a bit too long
1,one of the few movies i 've seen that has a few funny lines
1,peter cushing is a great director and the movie is a great example of how to make a movie
1,directed by the director of a classic movie the movie is not about
1,even when the story is n't that bad it is just too bad
1,i'm a big fan of the series of films but this
1,with the help of his mother the daughter of a man named seita who is now married to a young woman in the city
1,yes there is a lot more to the plot than it is
1,you have to see it for yourself to find
1,the movie is about a man trying to save his wife who
1,its a good movie to watch
1,joline is a very nice actress who is a very
1,during the first half of a movie i had no idea what was going on
1,freddy 's father is a very creepy and very very good film
1,words cannot describe the movie 's appeal
1,it is a movie about a woman who is not only a child but
1,freedom is a very very very bad movie
1,after a few minutes of this movie you get to the end
1,as a result of this the movie is very good and
1,the story is simple and the story line
1,once the first half of the story unfolds the film slows down
1,yet the movie is not a comedy it is a comedy
1,director john mctiernan is a master of the macabre and this film is a perfect example of why the film is rated r
1,i do n't know how to describe it but
1,an excellent movie and a great film
1,anyway the story was n't bad
1,you know it 's a bad movie but it 's not a good movie
1,lauren graham is a great choice for the film but her role is not
1,dear the movie has a very bad script and is n't even close to a classic
1,the acting was good but it was n't enough
1,this is the worst of the worst
1,i was so disappointed that i was watching a
1,disaster is the most important aspect of the story
1,this was the first time i saw the movie in
1,this was a very good film
1,this movie is a complete waste of time and money
1,i do n't know why i have to write a review of this
1,i have to admit that the movie is very good
1,the movie is not about a group of people who are trying to survive
1,two men are the only ones who can find the killer
1,but it 's not a bad idea to be a good thing
1,and it 's not that bad
1,yet i still ca n't believe that it was a good film and a very good one to be seen
1,my favorite scene is when the girl is lying in a room and
1,i do n't want to give away any of the plot points of
1,the film is a very good film with excellent performances by all involved in the cast
1,it is a shame because the story is not a good
1,viewed it on the big screen and it 's still very entertaining
1,i was surprised at how bad it is
1,probably the worst film ever made
1,it is a great film to watch with a group of friends and a couple of mates
1,the film was a bit slow but the story is so interesting and it is a real treat to
1,it 's not even that bad
1,and it is n't the same
1,if the director of the book is a bit of a good idea to be honest and he does not have the guts to do so much of it
1,the movie is a bit slow and the plot is n't too bad
1,i'm sure that this film was meant to be a spoof of the classic classic film noir
1,why do n't we have to see this movie to see how bad
1,its a good thing to see
1,anyway i think this movie has a lot of fun and i have to agree
1,it is a movie about a man
1,the film is a bit too long for the story but it 's a little too slow
1,some of the other reviewers have commented on the movie
1,the movie is a complete mess of a movie
1,this is a very bad movie
1,joe pesci is a genius as his wife
1,every time i watch the show i will never forget it
1,the movie is a very interesting one
1,so the movie is a bit of an excuse for a movie to be done
1,but the story is n't as bad as it could have been
1,but i think the movie is a great deal of fun and a
1,but i was n't impressed with this movie
1,kincaid is the only one who has ever seen him
1,i do n't know what to say
1,like the rest of the movie i was expecting the worst movie i 've seen in my life
1,i do n't know if this was a bad movie but
1,and that 's why i love it
1,i do n't think i can see the point of the story and it
1,tyne daly plays the role of the daughter of her mother who is in
1,i was expecting a good movie
1,some have commented on the acting in this movie but it is not
1,they are all in a bad movie
1,here 's the spoiler it is a movie about the evils of a young boy
1,it is a very good movie and
1,as a result the movie has no redeeming qualities
1,calvin is a good guy but he has a good time
1,i have seen it several times
1,in this case the film is about as
1,the movie is a bit too long and too boring for its viewers
1,this is a great film for everyone who likes
1,at the end of the movie the only thing that was going on in the movie was the
1,although the story is very original and the acting is good the script is very good and the actors are good
1,it 's a very bad movie
1,many people have commented on the film as
1,such a shame that the film is n't even close to being a good
1,for the first time i was a little skeptical
1,family guy has a lot of potential
1,it is the story of two men who live together in their
1,i was n't expecting a lot from this film
1,at one point the film was a complete waste of time
1,a very good movie with excellent acting
1,normally a film that has the best intentions in its history
1,get to know the characters in the first
1,what a waste of time this film is
1,he 's a good man and he has a good job
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,i'm not sure what to expect
1,i was expecting something more from a movie but it was n't that bad
1,this is the kind of movie that i would recommend watching it to see if it is worth the rental or rent it
1,arms and geeks are the only two examples of the film
1,the film is a complete bore
1,bumped in a little over two weeks of the week
1,perhaps this movie was made by someone
1,the movie was a waste of time
1,how did this guy get into the car and the police
1,the acting is horrible the story is bad and it 's a little boring and the acting was
1,overall this film was a complete waste
1,i was n't impressed by this one
1,ed harris was a great actor and
1,the acting in the movie is excellent
1,unlike most of his other work i was very disappointed
1,rupert everett is a great actor and i do n't think he is
1,a few of these actors are n't really the same as they were in the movie
1,overall this is a very good movie and
1,oh and the music was n't as good as the original
1,few of these movies are made of the same caliber as the
1,well it was a good movie
1,some of them do n't have a
1,this was a great show for the
1,overall this is a pretty bad movie
1,just a few examples of the film
1,as i said earlier the film was a complete failure
1,then there are some scenes that are very well done
1,i was expecting something like the movie
1,he is the one who is in love with her
1,her performance is a joy to watch
1,as for the story it 's a bit of a mess
1,it 's a shame because the film is a bit long
1,also the film is a complete mess
1,50 minutes later the two of my friends are going to see it for a long time
1,but i think it was n't a bad idea for a movie
1,the film was shot in a very
1,the movie is very good and is very
1,her performance in this movie is excellent
1,nick stahl is a great actor
1,god bless the world and then you
1,it is a shame that this film is not available on video as a vhs copy
1,both films were a lot more interesting to watch and i think that the
1,although the plot was a bit thin i could have had the movie explored more
1,head of the living dead is a film that has a
1,this is a movie that i would
1,the film is not a documentary but a very interesting one
1,if you want to make a film about the evils of physics you should see the film
1,so if you are looking for a film
1,i was so disappointed with it that i was n't expecting a movie that is n't
1,the film has a very good soundtrack and it has some nice songs
1,anyway i do n't think it was that good in my opinion as it is a movie
1,i was expecting a movie that was a little
1,mildly recommended to anyone interested in the subject
1,mann 's film is a very moving and
1,for a while i have to wonder if i was
1,does n't he do it for the sake of his own life
1,but i have to admit that i
1,it is a movie that is not a complete loss to me
1,it is n't a bad movie but it is n't bad
1,for those who have never seen the film i would n't have
1,i was surprised that i had n't seen this movie in my lifetime and it was n't even
1,not only did he have an affair with him but he was a little more
1,every time i see it i think it will be a great idea
1,it 's not even that bad
1,i have seen this movie and i can honestly say that it 's a good film
1,i have to say that it is the best movie that i can remember
1,wonder if the movie has a good story and some good acting
1,scotland was the first of the three and the second series of the series
1,benjamin button is a very good movie with some good acting
1,it is a movie about a young man who has been a struggling father
1,the movie was shot in a time where people were looking for
1,being a fan of the first movie i have to say that i was n't expecting a good movie but it
1,monster vs python is an excellent film that is
1,in fact the film is a little too long for me to get bored
1,this movie is a must see for any
1,this is not one of those movies you have to watch with your kids
1,it has the same kind of thing that is used in the original
1,with a few exceptions i was able to get to the end of it
1,so the film is a bit too slow
1,however it was a little bit of a stretch
1,just do n't expect a lot of action
1,such a film is so bad that you ca n't help but feel that it 's not even worth watching
1,but the movie is a little slow
1,what is the deal with the girl who is so much of a jerk and the other characters
1,directed by a great cast of characters and the characters that make you laugh
1,okay so i do n't know if i can get the chance to view it again and it is n't a good thing
1,towel is the best movie of the year and i have seen the movie dozens
1,overall i think this is one of
1,my favorite scene is when the girl is walking in the car with
1,as a result i found it hard to understand why this was made
1,even though this movie was made in the seventies and was the first of the many films that i
1,the film is a bit slow but it is a great story
1,quinn and his friend 's wife are the only ones who can find their
1,i have seen this movie several times and i still love it
1,you have to see this movie to believe the
1,i have n't seen a movie in my
1,in the end i found the movie very entertaining
1,it 's a shame because it was a little too long for me
1,i do n't know how to describe the film
1,this was one of my favorite films of all time
1,first of all the movie was a complete mess of a movie that is just plain bad
1,the acting was horrible the story line is bad the acting worse than the worst of the movie
1,four years later the film 's first feature
1,the movie is a bit long and i
1,one of the best films ever made
1,i do n't think i 've ever been a big fan of the genre but this is a very good
1,all in all a fun movie
1,rohmer is a master in a film
1,very funny but not a bad film
1,shots of the characters in the film are very different from the other films of the same ilk
1,as for the acting it 's very bad
1,i was n't expecting anything from the movie to be a horror film but it was very good
1,the movie is very well made
1,i was surprised by the fact that this movie was made in the first place
1,james woods is one of my favorite actors
1,characters are introduced and the story is very simple and the characters are very
1,the film is a complete mess of the first two
1,if i could get my hands on a copy of this film i would be surprised to
1,you have to see this movie to believe it
1,but it is not a bad movie
1,on the plus side the film is a very good movie and i recommend it to any fan of the original
1,we have to see this film to see if it is worth watching
1,i was n't expecting a lot of this movie
1,i was n't impressed by a film
1,to say that i have a soft spot for this movie is a great understatement
1,hell this movie is so stupid and so boring it 's almost funny to watch
1,i do not know if this is a bad movie or a bad thing
1,what is the point of that
1,also the ending is a little too long and the ending is so predictable and so contrived that i
1,it is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,i was n't really impressed with the story
1,winner is the worst movie of the year
1,not that i did n't like this movie and it did n't even get me interested
1,the film was shot in the same location as the old west
1,a lot of people are killed by this movie
1,the film was shot in the early seventies in the early 1950 's
1,i was n't expecting anything else but i did not expect
1,house of wax is a very enjoyable film with excellent performances by all
1,the film 's premise is to be a little more
1,the film is not as bad as it sounds but it does not have a
1,likewise i was n't impressed at all that
1,then the film is a little bit too long for its own good
1,all the actors in the cast did a good job and the movie was a good movie
1,you 'll never get to see the movie in any way
1,one of the best of the series
1,spoilers ahead the movie was made for tv
1,kevin spacey is a great actor and i think he is
1,the movie is about a young man named krishna who
1,this is a movie that i would recommend to anyone
1,one of the best movies ever and is the best of
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,it has to be the worst movie
1,it is n't a movie that is so bad it 's good
1,i do n't think i 've ever heard of
1,along with his wife and the two men the film has a very strong and interesting plot and some good acting
1,sorry to say this movie was n't bad but it was n't
1,this is the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,anyway the film is a bit slow moving and the story is a mess
1,in the meantime of the movie the director and the actors
1,but i was not disappointed in the film
1,i do not think i 've ever seen a more beautiful movie
1,however the movie is not so good as a film
1,she 's not a good actress she is n't good either
1,the film has a lot of action and a few scenes where the hero is killed
1,yes i know it 's not a bad movie and the acting is pretty bad but it
1,despite the presence of a few other characters the film does have some of those qualities
1,ps it is a very good movie but it
1,in the end it 's a very good movie
1,a very funny movie and a must watch for everyone who loves a good story but it is
1,i was n't expecting much from it at least
1,up to the end i found it to be very entertaining
1,that 's the way it is
1,i do n't know why the director did not get the point of this movie
1,this movie is a waste of time
1,my only criticism is that the film was shot on video and it is a very poor movie
1,i was n't really sure what to expect but i was n't sure
1,seeing the first film was like a bunch
1,in fact i have no idea how many people have seen this movie
1,in fact i think the director should have done more research to make it more believable
1,i have seen a lot of bad films
1,now this is a movie that is so
1,those of us who are not familiar with this movie are not afraid to watch this
1,not only is this a very good movie but it is a good movie
1,the film is very well made and the characters are believable
1,well i do n't think it 's a bad film
1,here we have a movie about a young woman who is a teenager
1,i do n't want to spoil anything for you but i 'll never forget
1,louisa is a very good character actress who is a real witch
1,sometimes it was a little too long
1,i have to admit that i am not one to say this film was a waste of time
1,and the film is a complete bore
1,the film has a lot to offer and i think it 's worth seeing
1,but i do n't know where to begin
1,i do n't know why the movie was so good
1,it 's a shame that the movie has n't been released in
1,george lucas was a genius as a director and
1,it 's a shame that the movie was n't released theatrically
1,most of the film is spent on the
1,the movie is a complete failure
1,next time i have a friend who 's a fan of the original series and the original version of the original series i think that it was n't as good
1,all in all this is a very good film
1,zero mostel and matthau have the right amount of screen time and the film
1,well this was a great movie
1,we are not sure what to say about this movie
1,i do n't want to give away too much but i think that is why it was n't
1,even if you do n't like it it is a great film
1,spoiler spoilers spoilers spoilers ahead spoilers alert i did n't care for the characters
1,good acting by a few cast members but this is a
1,there are many things that do n't make sense
1,oh yeah and i do n't know how to
1,susan sarandon is a good actor
1,there is nothing inherently bad about this one
1,the film is a complete waste of time
1,one of the best films i have ever seen the acting is excellent the direction
1,and the ending was so stupid and predictable it 's
1,they 're just not funny and they 're all very funny
1,in the end it 's a great movie
1,i was n't sure what to expect from this movie but i did
1,blazing saddles has a very good cast
1,the acting in general is pretty good but it is n't a bad performance
1,this movie is a great example of how to make an epic movie
1,simple and very simple and very funny
1,the film has a very interesting plot and the acting is good
1,yes the movie is a bit slow but i do n't think it would have been much better if it had been more
1,it is a very good movie and it 's very well done
1,openly the film is a bit slow and boring
1,i think that the movie is a great deal of
1,naturally the movie is n't really a comedy
1,this is one of the best films i
1,i do n't know how this movie got made but it was a great movie
1,before the movie 's over the top i could n't get enough of the movie 's plot and the plot is
1,my only problem was that there was no plot and it seemed
1,to make matters worse the film fails miserably
1,especially the scene in which he is in a wheelchair with a car and a couple minutes of his life is a little
1,the movie is a bit too dark and
1,this is a very good film
1,i was surprised that the movie was made and the actors were n't even nominated for their acting
1,r ali erbil was the most prolific actor
1,but the movie is n't bad
1,voted for the movie for the film and a bit of
1,i have to say that i have n't seen it yet
1,i was surprised to see that this film was made in the first place
1,for the first time in the film there 's a little bit of suspense
1,dennis quaid was a great actor and he was a great actor
1,they are not the only ones who have to deal with the same
1,and that was the most ridiculous part of the film
1,if you have n't seen it you will probably be disappointed
1,the film was a complete waste of time
1,dumbing down the film and it 's a great movie to watch
1,yes there were plenty of movies in the world where the characters and situations would be
1,the film is a bit of a mess
1,i was expecting a good movie but this one was not bad
1,the film is not a comedy
1,it 's the only thing you will
1,whether or not it was true to the story of the first one it was n't the
1,two years ago he 's been in a mental hospital for the first time in a while and he has
1,the film is about a man named benjamin who is sent to jail for his family in the woods
1,you can tell they 're going to be the next elwood and jerry and the director of this film
1,when you watch the film the first time you see it
1,i was n't expecting a good movie
1,i was surprised that the movie was not released in theaters
1,thankfully i do n't know why this film is so good
1,watch out for the scene where he is in
1,avoid this film like the plague
1,the film is a complete mess
1,but i think it 's a good movie to watch with your
1,surely the film has a very good story but it 's not
1,well the film is a bit over the top but it 's still a very good and enjoyable thriller
1,downside the story is very weak
1,bikers do not have any of these things
1,its not a bad movie it is a waste of time
1,the film 's plot is a mess of a film
1,guinness and his wife are the only two characters that have ever
1,this is one of my favorite tv
1,nothing happens to be seen as a comedy but it does
1,filmed in a very tight manner the lighting is very poor and is the only thing that makes
1,well i guess that 's what it means but i guess it 's
1,the film is a very good film
1,amazingly it is a movie of sorts and it is a great movie that is not only a very good film but it 's very
1,and the ending is a bit abrupt
1,it is a very good movie that i can watch over and over
1,jesus christ was a great movie that is n't a
1,hedorah is a great movie that has some good
1,the acting was horrible the story was weak and the
1,i have seen the movie and i have n't seen it since it was made
1,the movie has a lot of potential but that is all
1,i do not recommend this to anyone who has
1,any other film i have seen that has a similar theme is a little too much
1,i think this is a great movie to watch
1,it 's a very good movie with a good cast
1,the acting was horrible the plot was awful
1,such a great movie that i would like
1,now i am a sucker for the film and i have to say i was n't impressed
1,that was the only reason i watched it
1,but it 's still pretty good
1,with a few exceptions the acting and directing were very good
1,the movie is a complete mess of mine and the worst of all the bad movies
1,lemmon 's character has a lot to do with
1,only the most ardent fans of the original will be disappointed
1,named john wayne is a man who has been sent into prison by his
1,willis 's character has been a little
1,but i have to say that i was very impressed with this movie
1,20 years later i had to watch this movie for
1,now the story is about a man who gets a chance to get a job in the world
1,we have a movie about the lives of two people who do their
1,i was so impressed by this movie
1,there are a few good moments in this film
1,yeah this is a great movie
1,the acting and script are all very good and the actors are good especially alexandra patrick
1,so the film is a bit too long and the ending is not even remotely satisfying
1,then again the movie has a very good story line and some good
1,the acting is pretty good but the script is just plain
1,aside from the fact that the story is a little
1,does anyone know where to go
1,the film has a very good story line but it 's not as good as the book and it does n't make any
1,at least the movie is n't as funny as the original
1,i was expecting this to be a good movie but i
1,i do n't think this movie would have made a great film
1,if you want to see a good movie that is good and good
1,some scenes are so funny that it
1,jason statham was great as the sheriff
1,i was surprised to find that the movie was made by the same director as the
1,the movie is about a man who has to choose with his own life and
1,realistic to say the least with the exception of the movie
1,this is not the case with the movie
1,i'm sure the film was shot in the same locations as it did in the first film and the acting was very good
1,he was the only one who had been able to make his own
1,the story of a man who has been in his life and is now
1,i was n't expecting anything else but the film
1,wow it 's the best movie i have ever seen in my life
1,and the movie is not as good as the
1,it 's a very funny movie and the whole thing is just so funny and funny that i ca n't even think of anything else
1,clive owen is the perfect choice for this film
1,but the movie is a good example of how to do so
1,not that this is a bad movie it is a good film
1,a few years later i was looking for something to watch but it
1,we have a very good story about an old man who is sent to prison and sentenced by his
1,the film is very slow paced
1,suddenly the movie ends with a couple of random shots
1,if it were n't for the fact that i was n't a little disappointed i
1,the acting is horrible the story is bad but the acting is bad and the script was horrible
1,nice to see a film about a woman who is a little more than a little bit of a
1,i was expecting a lot more from this movie
1,even if it was n't a total failure of a film it 's not a
1,i have never read the book but i do n't think that this is the
1,well it 's a good thing
1,a few scenes were filmed in the same way as the ones
1,what 's worse the story is a complete mess
1,string of clichs and jokes is the key
1,throughout the movie i was reminded of the story
1,hundstage is a film that is a bit long but it is still very good
1,a lot more of the movie is a little bit of a stretch
1,vincent cassel is a great actor
1,i have seen this movie and i have to say
1,all the while the film is a complete bore
1,there is no real plot to speak of
1,the movie is a bit too long
1,highly recommended to all fans of the genre
1,and i do n't know how to make a movie that has a lot of good points and good
1,soon after the first two minutes of
1,then again i was n't sure what to expect from this show
1,if it 's not so obvious that the film is a little bit boring it 's not a great idea to make a film
1,this was one of the best movies ever made
1,a few scenes were cut out of the film
1,and the ending is a complete copout
1,like the first one the characters were very interesting and the story line
1,i do n't know why this film was made and why the hell was the last time i saw it
1,this movie is so bad i do
1,the acting was n't bad but the plot
1,the film was made for television and it shows
1,finally the story is a lot like the first film but it
1,avoiding the film 's flaws and the fact that it 's a film of a certain genre it
1,sadly the movie was n't even close to being a good movie but it 's a good movie to watch and i think it 's
1,this is a very good film that will keep you on the edge of your seat
1,you have a good time and place
1,weldon and his friends are not the same
1,the movie is a very interesting one
1,the acting is horrible the script is bad and it 's just bad
1,during the movie i was looking at my watch and wondering why i was n't laughing at
1,if you are looking for a movie that is a waste
1,i'm sure this is not the only
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,ms smith 's performance was a little overdone
1,that is the best way of saying it 's the
1,or maybe the movie would have been better had they just had it done without
1,i do n't know if it is the same movie that i
1,some of the scenes are just so funny
1,ok the movie was pretty good
1,the film is a very interesting and interesting portrayal of a young woman who is
1,i have seen the original version of the
1,the film has a very good soundtrack and a very nice
1,this movie was a complete waste of
1,maybe it 's because of this film that i have seen in my life and it is a shame that the film
1,too bad the film is not as bad as it
1,we get to see a very young corey feldman playing a man in a suit
1,definitely worth a look if you are looking for a
1,similarities are the only redeeming qualities i have ever seen on the big screen
1,is it the best of all of his films and the fact that he has a
1,this is a great show for everyone
1,anthony minghella is one of those directors who can make a good film but he does
1,i think it 's a very funny
1,not that i would want to see this movie
1,the story is a bit confusing but there are so many holes that i ca n't
1,okay it was n't a bad movie but it was n't
1,that is why it 's a good film to watch
1,do n't get me wrong i love the fact that this is a film that is a
1,daniel 's performance is a little stiff and he does
1,screws up with the other two thirds of the movie
1,the film 's plot is a mess of a film that is n't even
1,these guys were n't funny and the movie was n't funny
1,this is a very good movie and the actors are all
1,it 's the same old story that is told by the same man
1,as for the rest of the cast i think it would be better to see a movie that has been better
1,very few of the actors are very good
1,likable and funny is the way it was made
1,these guys have been a lot better
1,as for the acting i think it 's not that bad either
1,as for the rest of the cast the script is pretty weak
1,you can tell that the actors are n't going to get a good idea of how they 're going to get
1,if you are a diehard fan of the genre and you 're interested in the
1,harpo 's character is the only one that is able to make the character believable
1,not that i would like the movie
1,an excellent movie that should not be seen by anyone interested in the
1,after seeing this movie i thought it would get
1,i have seen this movie twice and it is still a very good film and i will say
1,outside of the fact that the film was shot in
1,unless you 're looking for a good movie with the usual suspects of a great director and a great cast this
1,all in all this movie is a must see
1,lets start with the plot and the plot and it 's a good movie
1,the acting was horrible and it was not funny
1,this movie is a complete waste of time
1,my friend is in the mood for a laugh
1,babban is a very talented actor who plays the character of the first film and does n't have the charisma to pull off the character in the first movie
1,this is a movie about a young woman named caroline who
1,and i do not want to spoil the plot for you to watch it
1,4 the acting is n't bad but the story is just plain boring
1,i think the film 's greatest weakness is the way the film is presented
1,the film has a great deal of humor in it
1,hyper the film is a complete mess
1,the film is not as funny as it was in the
1,a lot of the movie is about the characters and the story line
1,the movie was a little too long for me to get into the movie and
1,although the film has a bit of a lot of problems it 's not a bad film
1,we are shown to be the only one who is the hero of the movie
1,when you watch a film that is so bad you ca n't even tell if
1,he is a good actor and a good actor
1,i have to say this is a very good film
1,watching this movie i had no clue what to expect
1,it was the worst movie i have ever seen
1,i have to say i was impressed with the movie
1,as a result of the movie 's title it is not even close to
1,i was n't impressed by the film 's plot
1,john wayne 's character is a bit too unlikable and i was surprised to see him in
1,the movie starts out well enough but
1,basically it was a great show that i had never seen before
1,darth leachman plays a woman who is a little too old
1,he is not only the best but the
1,whitney houston is the only one who has a role as a woman
1,this is one of the worst films i 've seen in my life
1,i do not know how this movie was made but it was the worst film i 've
1,it 's not that i have to admit it was n't the best movie i
1,however the film is n't really worth the
1,the film is not a complete disaster
1,physical tension was the key to this film
1,in fact the only good thing about this movie
1,as a result it is a very good movie and a good movie to watch with your friends
1,the acting is horrible the plot is awful and there is no real acting talent whatsoever
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,the movie is about a man named benjamin who is sent to a mental institution to retrieve a house in the woods
1,i was surprised by the fact that it was made in the early 80 's when a young woman
1,but i think that 's the point of the movie and it 's a shame that the movie is so
1,the acting is very good and the script is a little too weak
1,i'm not a fan of the genre but this movie
1,the film is not about an ordinary person and his
1,robert downey jr is excellent here as he 's the only one who can play the part with his character and the movie is a
1,with the help of a young woman who 's a bit too
1,the acting is pretty good but the story itself is so bad that it 's
1,the acting is horrible and the acting is bad
1,here 's a list of events
1,how could they not have the audacity to make a film
1,by all means the best of all the bad movies that are made for a few
1,they are both funny and funny and the acting by the leads is good
1,he has a good voice and is very convincing as a character
1,this movie is so bad it 's funny
1,the film is a very moving and moving film with a very strong plot
1,go see it if only for its myriad of flaws and the acting is
1,citizen kane is the best of the series
1,we are supposed to believe that he is a good
1,in fact i would have given this movie a zero but i have to give 0 out of 10
1,plodding and dull and the movie has a lot going
1,it was n't a bad movie
1,ps i do n't think i have seen the first movie so i can say it 's not one of the worst i have ever seen
1,you know that the film is not a comedy but a very funny one
1,instead the film is a complete mess
1,so if you 're looking for a good
1,it 's not even the same thing that i
1,having a great cast and a good storyline i still ca n't help but wonder if the writers had
1,what 's with the whole thing
1,disney is a great director who has done a good
1,i do n't know how this movie got made it 's just
1,the acting and directing are excellent
1,this is not an easy movie to watch
1,the film is about a young man named krishna
1,do n't worry about this film
1,the film 's premise is that the filmmakers were not able to do so
1,it 's not a great film
1,space maggot is a great film
1,no matter where you 're going to see a film that has to be the
1,first the film is a little slow but it 's a very nice
1,is it a comedy about a young man
1,so the movie starts out as a comedy with a bunch of characters running around in a forest
1,i do n't want to give away too much but if
1,but i do think that it is one of the
1,the film is a complete waste of time
1,years later i was looking for something to watch and i was very surprised
1,it 's a great movie and a must see if you 're into the genre and
1,my favorite part of the movie was the scene where
1,i do n't think this film has a
1,we are supposed to be rooting for her
1,one of the most interesting movies i 've seen
1,the film is not a comedy but
1,it is the story of the life of a
1,but this movie does n't really do it justice
1,the film has an excellent cast and a great cast that is
1,like the other two films i had seen it
1,mcmahon 's role is a joy to watch
1,had the director been able to make a film that could have been made in the early 90 's i would n't have been able to suspend disbelief
1,why is it that this is a very poor film
1,it 's just a bunch of people talking about the same old thing and then you get to get
1,do not be fooled by this movie
1,much of the film is shot on a small screen in the same location
1,anybody who has seen this movie knows how to get a movie that will make a
1,the movie has a lot of potential
1,the movie is about the struggle of the two men who
1,another thing that makes it worth watching is the way it 's presented in the
1,anyway it was not the worst movie i 've seen but it 's definitely not
1,i have n't seen this movie since the first time i watched it
1,not a single solitary point in the movie
1,after seeing this movie i can safely say that the film is a complete bore
1,how did this movie get a pg rating
1,when the film finally gets to the point of the plot the characters and their actions are revealed
1,well this film is a great piece of art that is guaranteed to be watched by everyone
1,rather than a movie about a man who was born to be his wife and the
1,one of the best of this film
1,however the movie is n't really about the characters or plot
1,this is a movie that is n't
1,it was a waste of my time
1,it 's the story of a man who 's a man of his time and a man who has been living
1,i do n't know if it is that bad or not but i do n't care
1,what 's more it is not a
1,take the time and place on your
1,the film has a few moments that do n't make much sense
1,2 it 's a good thing
1,watch it with the lights off
1,robert englund was the perfect choice for this role
1,the film is a bit slow and
1,this was a good movie for me
1,but i do not recommend this movie to anyone who wants the movie to
1,this is one of the worst horror movies i have seen
1,i do n't know how this got a pg rating for the
1,sounds like a good idea to make a
1,truly it is the story of the life of a man who is in
1,charles durning is a fine actor but he 's not as good as his other films
1,it 's a shame because it has been done before
1,the movie is about the power of
1,sadly i did n't know what to expect from this movie
1,i'm not sure why i did n't get this movie
1,only one person who could not find
1,the acting is good the script is great and the story is great
1,an excellent movie that is not for everyone but it 's a fun movie to watch
1,it 's a shame that the film never gets a chance to be
1,and the movie does n't have to be
1,not only did he not have a lot of screen time but he also did
1,to me the movie is a very good example of how to
1,the film has a lot of problems but
1,here 's a few examples of how a movie can be done and the
1,it 's the story of a young girl named seita who has a crush on her and her mother 's life
1,it 's a pity that the director and writer have n't made
1,nick nolte is a great actor
1,sure it 's a little bit of a parody but it is a bit slow moving for the sake of being too long and it does n't even
1,the movie is a little over the top
1,a lot of things are missing but they
1,i was surprised by the amount of detail that was left to the audience to be
1,if you 're looking for an interesting story with a good story this one is
1,and i was so impressed by this story that i was surprised
1,this movie was a waste of time and money
1,the film is not a complete mess but it 's a good one
1,even when the story is n't as good as the book it is
1,students of the age of 13 will be able to see it as well as the original series
1,but i have n't seen this movie in
1,as a result the movie is not as bad as
1,that is a very sad thing because this
1,maybe he was the first to die but the
1,evil dead ii is a very good film
1,you know the drill was going to be a little bit
1,the acting in this movie is so bad it hurts me that this was a good movie
1,come on guys who have a good idea of
1,anyone who has seen the original will find this film enthralling or
1,everything about him is just so awful and the plot is so ridiculous
1,first of all the acting and script is terrible
1,given that this was a good movie it was n't that much of a surprise
1,then the movie is a little too long for me
1,everyone involved in this movie is just plain
1,on the other hand if you 're a
1,it 's a great movie to watch
1,this movie is not for everyone but
1,the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever
1,it 's the kind of film that makes it a
1,joe is a great actor and he 's great in his role
1,already the film is n't as bad as some have
1,this is a very good movie
1,this is a very good movie
1,unlike most other movies of the period and the early 70s it 's not as good as
1,but the film is a complete failure
1,they were so bad that it was hard to believe that they were making a movie about a bunch of people
1,also a few of the scenes where the hero 's character was introduced in a scene of
1,to be honest i did n't know it was a comedy but it was a good show
1,the film has a very nice atmosphere
1,sadly the film 's biggest flaw is the lack of a
1,clearly the movie 's only drawback was that the director was trying to make a point about
1,the movie has a lot of good points but it is just not enough
1,she 's not a bad actress
1,i have never been more disappointed by this movie since it was released
1,but it is n't a good movie
1,the movie is very well done
1,george lucas 's direction is the best i
1,another thing that makes me laugh is that this is not just a movie for the sake of the director
1,and the ending was so bad that
1,but the film does not make the film much better
1,even the acting was n't good either
1,i was so excited that this was n't a movie
1,i was n't impressed by the story line and the characters and the story
1,great acting by all the actors and actresses
1,anyone who has ever seen it in the cinema must be aware
1,and the ending was so predictable that you just want to slap
1,nothing happens in this film and it
1,have i seen a film where the characters are all so different from the other movies
1,but the film is not so bad that it 's funny
1,this is one of the most boring
1,the acting is pretty good with the exception of a couple of good
1,the film is about a young woman named seita who has been murdered by a
1,then the movie switches gears and the story is told in flashback
1,as for the story it was very good and very entertaining
1,yesterday the movie was made to be a movie
1,the movie has a very good soundtrack
1,nevertheless this movie is a must watch for all fans of the genre and
1,all the characters were likable but the story line was n't as bad as the book
1,this is one of those movies that
1,in fact the movie was a bit too long and it was a little too long to keep it together
1,and the acting is n't bad at all
1,and it was a bit too long
1,did anyone else notice that this is the worst movie ever made
1,no one could possibly have pulled this off
1,i was n't expecting much from this movie but i did n't expect a lot from
1,thanks to the cast of the film the actors are excellent
1,as a fan of the series i was very impressed by this one
1,some of the scenes are just a little jarring
1,wow i 've heard that the film is a bit too bad but it 's
1,if i was a little bit prejudiced i would not have been able to watch this film
1,it 's a pity because it 's not a
1,ideas of the film are so much more
1,and the movie has no redeeming feature
1,if you want a good laugh at the movie 's expense you 'll probably enjoy this one
1,the film is a very good one to watch and i think that is the case
1,a few years later the two main characters are a
1,howard hughes is the most convincing person in
1,ryan gosling is a great actor but the rest of the cast is not very good either
1,johnnie is not only a little more than an average character but a very likable and interesting character
1,while the plot is not a little original there are some very funny moments
1,please do n't watch this show
1,but the movie is n't that good
1,i do n't know if it was the director or the director but i
1,goldie hawn 's acting career was a bit too bad
1,this is a very good movie and it has a great cast
1,not only was the acting terrible the acting was terrible
1,poelzig and his men are a little more than a couple of people who
1,the film is about the man who was a little too young to live in the united states
1,much of the dialogue in the movie is
1,as the movie goes on we get to see some
1,overall this film is not as great as
1,i was n't expecting a lot from the movie but i found it to be quite entertaining and enjoyable
1,on the whole the film is a complete bore
1,a very funny scene in which the main characters are introduced
1,if you want to make a good movie about a group of friends who can act
1,the film is not a complete disaster but it is not
1,wow i do n't think i 've ever seen a film that i have
1,the film is not a documentary but a documentary about the lives of the characters in the story
1,they are both funny and the story is a little too
1,the film is very good and the acting is good but not bad
1,this is a very funny and very entertaining show
1,however i have to agree with the previous reviewer
1,i'm not sure why i was n't laughing so hard
1,eric stoltz plays a young man who is a little confused by the fact that his wife 's father died
1,its a shame that such films as this one did
1,110 for the first 10 or 10 minutes
1,in the end the story is a very good one and a great deal of fun
1,the film 's plot is so simple and the acting is so bad it 's almost laughable
1,he 's the best actor in the film and i do n't
1,the film is about the struggle between the two and a new wave of the events of their lives
1,what i did n't know was that the
1,seeing the movie is a good one
1,interestingly it 's not as though they were trying to make a movie that was a bit too long
1,the movie is very slow and boring
1,in this one the characters are all very believable but the story line is so predictable and predictable it is impossible to follow
1,i was expecting this movie to be a great movie
1,nobody seems to know what to expect but it 's a great movie
1,the movie is very well written and well
1,the film is a very moving experience of what
1,apparently the filmmakers were n't trying to get a lot of
1,gingerbread man was a great movie
1,the acting was horrible and the story was a bit weak
1,there is also a lot of action in it
1,another thing that makes the film is the fact that it is a complete waste of time
1,by the end of the movie i could
1,so if it is n't for its technical flaws it 's
1,this is a very good movie
1,omg what a waste of time and money
1,it 's a shame because it was
1,this was one of the best of the series
1,the movie was a waste of time and money
1,the acting was horrible and the script was awful
1,i do agree that i have to agree with the reviewer who
1,i do n't want to give anything away but it is not a
1,i do n't know what it is but
1,and the film is a little too long and the ending is a
1,most of the film is about the family 's relationship with each other and the consequences of
1,but this is not the case
1,heist is the most interesting aspect of the whole film
1,however the movie has a lot of potential and it 's a
1,this is the kind of movie where
1,you have a movie that you have not seen before
1,i was surprised to find that this movie was not only
1,the film is a little slow at times but the performances are
1,the film is a very good one
1,trust me i do not think that i 've seen any of them in a film
1,possible spoilers the plot is simple and the movie is a bit
