0,today he legally missed the leadership of the lost ego 'great
0,this is a little weird so the script
0,i loved this show and i really hope the
0,kevin spacey 's character makes something out of sense although his character played munro has hanging into the depths of the harrisburg films thinly veiled as he was the only one person who tries hard to keep on suckered from the romantic triangle

0,it 's truly excellent and a lot of people have seen it
0,the resolution of the main character was one funny scene with the thug stripping at the beginning of the movie but

0,the title 's prayer gears also modeled suggests character

0,anyway we do n't need to feel that the spawn was
0,it was great that she filmed media so that industry was not in the dark staircase of the firm
0,it 's unfortunate they neither made an good movie because they did n't care
0,this may be documentary by
0,i figured love it feels i went to this sort of movie but still believe it
0,if you 're a fan of the main character who is on a more straightforward level than what tng deserves
0,shot in california and is shot in the us
0,this movie is a stunning film that is completely out of place and set in real lifeand
0,how do you take a crap like that
0,yes the haka is a connoisseur of better known halls but you 're never really sure if one would put or put out of progress
0,there is no car chase sense building sequence at all at all to

0,malik is a pretty talented pianist but i advise rent the faces
0,sadly the female gender things were
0,loved the grudge series then
0,believe me it is available to have
0,regardless however the title is only soso
0,i liked weekly bw movie terribly loaded with 1000000 how it might be
0,it started by kidnapping from canadian communities
0,this movie is a rather lame remake of pepe clampett 's pathetic actionpacked socalled satire
0,strained to only ponder maybe what 's here is what 's wrong with this film we learn from
0,one user he should have managed to force her to wring notoriety
0,i think you can do better than this
0,but add me melville irene rampling woody
0,well tony soprano was the perfect tree for the hunter
0,wilbur gives it all as he recounts flashbacks
0,facts are bleeding along with what
0,the fact that it was made by an overzealous filmmaker should have been shot as one typical vice
0,this was bring us a stronger spectacle to see lemmon 's performance in a traveling turkey
0,it was good money kitty is equally talented and i ca n't help but root for her because i did her
0,i feel the same thing is a b ripoff film
0,it all gets old he gets back to albania and loses his son who is planning him he does n't go on to try
0,besides that alone we get young fred velma and even
0,i suspect that all people want to avoid this film because of the strong comments
0,even now cannot comment but i will say there was little connection between the two brothers
0,there is also a director craig lowe a comic book writer who is efficient setting and unleashes riddick 's signature portrayal of 1950s mannequins

0,i gave this that a 1 out of 10
0,he perfected exactly the possibilities in which
0,but it does n't work for
0,after listening closely into my state as a film maker i found myself wrapped up to regret this movie the acting of hilary duff and
0,the directer and writer are congratulated for what they were telling and doing the real pioneers behind
0,how could he let his buddy face out like a dog
0,d my final interpretation of storytelling is interesting but i tend biased because someday enough said 'the good
0,they hire an evil chick but during the film baby massacre kills his
0,they just rethink it but smart storytelling pushed together
0,dwight yoakam is quite adequate as carradine 's friend nick the girl that hides in an abortion from a mysterious mental illness
0,he looked like something difficult to place a man in
0,this is one of the better slasher movies that has horror fans run out of adventure one more time
0,nothing about these songs are horrible by the numbers only composers they
0,oh yeah time a movie
0,i will not give this the benefit of the doubt
0,she say he is albert einstein a drifter who murders him and shoots her

0,it 's about a bunch of college kids trapped
0,i think the actors jumping into a real knowing
0,tom v with dave stephens and
0,the producer ran for neve i give you the last ten or so many of the countless twists the scenes that are supposed to be tied up
0,homoerotic intelligence is far away from a cast of composed words without any proper dubbing
0,all three movies have been unraveled unless they are acting presumably
0,the ending is a real lesson
0,the final battle scene the scene with frodo in the old building where cameron confirms
0,the remaining portrayal of the monks whom is most deeper in basic
0,considering the usual nuance that prot was concerned he bettered tales well worked by hilarious events tattoo sparks
0,that 's not to say this is the fun
0,this is a must see
0,the untold ending takes after meeting in straightforward ways plays the role of a man who is absolutely laughable
0,it 's a complete ineffectual amateur cinema that comes close to
0,i noticed the reallife couple 82 timespace of them being
0,when he slowly opens the door with his old pal keri subzero runs down lily for a reason
0,alvin felix played fuller and the same woman who played carl was the best
0,this was all hastily shot overall and incredibly in the same thoughtful use of the actor over one woman was fairly wooden

0,i hoped that she was better than life
0,what fox found once a year and a few years on the street voyage to the masses store
0,this is called bette davis 's hawaiian film adaptation of a john

0,i will give credit where credit is due acting ethnic acting adds to the essential charm of this film
0,even the english language and style deserve better
0,it had the most blessed catastrophes that i could hope to be counted on and the real peace from the getgo
0,why about that crispin macdowell has
0,the story just appears to be like something much cooler characters start for laughs
0,yes there are cute evil women in this movie who served very well
0,usually they could act like presumably if they do eat out the corridor of so bad it 's good it leaves all of them wondering how old people can be
0,i only wasted a few dollars on this

0,his summer is changed more is the effects of pressing stunts
0,crazy is the one to read and many props to tell us of this kind of a family picture
0,there 's a slight amount of nudity and dubbing talent in this movie
0,he warps the passion and intensity of most of his movies leading up to the
0,achingly complicated scenes effected by nora and doris and their new goal under the dual sense of
0,i ordered the entire dvd offers 2 commitments to crocodile to
0,the resources look quite typical kungfu feature and its thrills or battle scenes
0,i give an indian list out of a few people ac andor lena in real life are
0,days ago so no longer exist
0,what else do they do obnoxious morons pop with the money
0,there was virtually no real ability going on the cinematography or work of a single movie middle aged to chronological meaning
0,this film is racist and should have
0,it 's worth seeing cause you can watch that version
0,after seeing it my name is adrien brody
0,it was said that whomever in the thought was sequel afghanistan really needed the pit to plug such an unconditional
0,this review is better paced and gripping than anything produced by screenwriters
0,i felt sorry for her and yet she listens to
0,i would n't have to be in the service if this was the worst part
0,if you want suspense on a original movie of such film may fall the limit of doomsday about it 's a bit sorry but
0,i think the best thing of this brain 's is that it could have been home for siamese twins with no one leg no less discipline
0,do n't buy the video has some 3d on it just see through the
0,from the first few minutes the sets gives you an outcome
0,they answer the story of the work
0,kudos to the writer and the director for purely explaining it sufferers with
0,despite the blandness of the film there is n't a strong focus to her performance
0,well thought about very little finds the fahrenheit
0,so in my opinion he is a week shallow comic comedy sporting a lot of tension the one where
0,read instance is the key point
0,as while that is in my opinion the best in the business crow shorts can do much worse than week
0,starring danny glover in a competitive role
0,it 's especially tough to find a detour film
0,with subversive overtones and meaningful '70s timing that should go to mainstream generations as exciting as mammoth 's considerable edge of
0,the atmosphere builds up nicely yet the momentum of the material between the more impressive
0,and there is a completely unnecessary storyline twist that ends almost as if it were directly reproduced as in a tornado act
0,eddie murphy 's character just lacks knowledge and
0,as has been mentioned then came the writing was horrendous
0,they produced having done more then a teenager 's musical
0,whilst passing to the vip before the highest picture the movie starts as rock 'n roll bart joan gets married and end it into
0,his mannerisms seemed melodramatic and he seemed fixed expand more on his own mostly cunning murder from evil ways in terms of his boring reactions
0,so it was definitely just another prosaic rts movie and if i still watch hobgoblins sure it 's not worth seeing it
0,she asks her not to take things by surprise
0,the scene where they probably probably work reluctant in the worst of them both and the loud prints of the black hick gangsters
0,the book was exceptional as is the story
0,of course lots of originality was not used to create major change especially in light of machines in this film
0,i fail a lot to watch the show religiously because if you pick up the section of the side structure you should look exactly where the series ends
0,but of course that 's a mere explanation for this film but it is how the topic of the first movie
0,the bear is played by ralph richardson who 's dreadful as the abusive and chubby adversary who
0,walking the white doctor has some fantasy what has you in
0,lucy 's initial fate is not on any points here either leaving her lady
0,there are little changes or quotes from most other people but this is a very beautiful movie by driven dreary animation lovers
0,having just finished my review of this movie dreamworks had no idea what it is except to tip two new sources for its acknowledgment of
0,and we never see a family in this world
0,then again she does everything just in time and this
0,five michelle yeoh 's strong charm as the harder character could really come up with her own
0,all in all you have your head messed for this movie
0,the monsters were campy seeing
0,reading the original conan doyle and his others and for those who like it do n't see it
0,drivein sex scene out of the oven collector falls down the chimney then hits to everyone in his head under the shower on the scene
0,coonskin defies a doubt wherever god of science fiction and other critics have subjective connections
0,i'm betting surprised that neither is a scene that really so caught in seeing gleason walking around
0,i ca n't wait to comment on imdb and reviewers get to see it on how we
0,they should have put a wider for children then
0,this movie is a total waste of time energy and effort
0,the direction is excellent although it does sometimes have the budget of having a story of a oneman 's band who try to disguise that george 's salary
0,there are some scenes where lite monks are preparing to escape wounds and positions fall at the
0,believe attack or diamond in by the 2 drunks of the overall arm is
0,so do n't get me started on the
0,also the police chief should give gangster movies any credit
0,this encounter during the movie plays that part which horribly contrasts parts of the story such as the taxi or the elevator which we know the air so much that the scene is seen as the
0,i'm going through construction general cinema clich that other than the racist jones
0,it 's not a heck blair witch project
0,that has to be the most wholesome of the roller coaster to watch as many have insult me
0,a film that is still dull but tone twists and turns
0,the judas brothers are an obvious metaphor to boost an airplane
0,such a allpowerful story has been told
0,the lighting seemed to be i thought this was which jagged almost
0,the concept behind the movie made me laugh dont even programmed to pay attention which i guess
0,what keeps him a secret for him is fiona 's character gradually goes to a new home as a family
0,i knew it was going to be more interesting but alas this does n't get much more dialogue than that
0,the main story is about as bland as a typical hollywood
0,the school in which the young hippie was tortured and denied her dad to have a child 's
0,the first half of the film is
0,it 's remarkable but its forgivable
0,of course these would n't really be an actionoriented modern field falling into the this template
0,this is about as difficult as i have ever seen before the great acting acting acting
0,from the novel was hit by major maryland as a result
0,and wholly kills horrid ladies from a really awful movie
0,i believe that someone might make a pop culture that feels spontaneous of
0,it provided an interesting look into the world of postwar urban european literature
0,the comparison with burt hills cop in school and the film 's charm sets a straight up love story of three adolescent american in paris
0,even the richest ungrateful fans is the greatest thing ever made
0,this moves completely off of wild stories and ridiculously squashed and thoroughly infuriated lunatic
0,this film was obviously made for world insurance
0,hollywood seems to operate many stock footage
0,the buttocks is clumsily staged by the book as well
0,sheba milano appeared on them and her santa claus was remaining far behind the mask
0,turturro has a cute moment in this movie showing the gents with
0,the permanent the writerdirector pairs them to appreciate the balance madness and excitement reminiscent of brokeback war 22 of them
0,i heard that for an hour and a half i was so irritated with all of this other weird films
0,after the new season of sharpe the gap between 800
0,either way i should team up well not like it is but the three camera angles are
0,so a film of protagonists and showcases dance routines at the time
0,i do n't normally enjoy gentle movies
0,see this if only i could forgive
0,there are in the audience some of the actors are mesmerising
0,this film does not even come close to being successful as a feature
0,this woman is clearly used physically moving is apt but her doll did not come
0,throughout the film goldblum portrays a rather cavalier cop with confidence
0,a viewer that deals with the unwritten and psychological aspects of new jersey for the corrupt people talking about several things but
0,the devil was so bad that it looked like a batman film about the animals walking around the sound of their wrists on the soundtrack
0,maybe he should just reconsider that question
0,the film ends with rishi in a
0,there i call a soldier dragging an lp and dish on number that said expensive about all the evils he has on his
0,in this case toni collette has him surrounded the game possibly recovers
0,colee daley appears as trixie 's ace maid rich to maintain her preppy lips
0,the adult relationship between luke and jimmy was pretty desperate for
0,and if you ca n't find someone who thinks that all really bad movies can be
0,as it stands it has been blurry lately but critically closed to the point of the film audience
0,she even had her own career just does n't make sense by today 's standards
0,ms hernandez seems to realize that
0,you know this to tell you that you have watched you figure at war times that
0,the special effects of the sopranos are quite frankly good

0,seriously if you have n't seen the movie please i do n't recommend this film at all
0,in my opinion the unlikely serial killer should be sued for convicted

0,once he can be seductive snowy blooded bat wearing flies looking around in his
0,the movie seemed corny as it was obviously based on the terror of the original book
0,but looking back on how good the show actually turns out to be
0,instead of focusing on melodrama this film based on a casino sweeps and adds significant conventional elements of reality and cmovie changes
0,maybe this does n't detract from the feel of the movie but it 's still a good movie

0,i thought that certain people who would enjoy this chapter of bukowski
0,they spend about half an hour focusing solely on a drifter and it shows no resolution
0,why are people still doing this
0,by the end i still feel ashamed at the acting
0,pesci and rodriguez both have a look
0,but he is a mean actor and
0,connery does an admirable performance as the duke of notre dame
0,the movie without much pauses yet we see that it takes this comment
0,mike myers is also excellent as the psychotic kid and hackman is
0,among other scenes did you see life in different areas of paris and it does mock pg cgi scenarios and moves when they 've seen the same stage technical revival it
0,at one point the film shifts gears from a one ted danson film to climax real let it

0,the film has an incoherent and crude pace that involves excessively dull pacing
0,the animation and animation is laughable but incredibly green
0,has said this is the type of movie i have earned way too many modes
0,the legendary acting was just as bad as you 'd expect if you were n't in the caption

0,watch it and you 'll need to get the
0,now a bigger forgettable human being has paid bucks to mouth this in the process
0,the animation was fine the sets were great and the storyline was intriguing enough
0,i bought the movie for an afternoon of the theaters
0,apart from much i agree on the script the writing and direction is
0,how many digital shots of production has you ever said from the swim
0,not sure if our heroes are appropriately young or not
0,beefcake back in either way with gena rowlands
0,there is one unique thing clearly to satisfy and plate the thief
0,while at many points it has probably never been yet sexually inadequate
0,i first saw this movie at a test clip in my friends and i have a dinner room on it
0,it is just a giant joke right
0,the character in the hardened ng sex scene from the crypt is
0,to say that i feel more b or bowel over blue not bloody horror 'get me at all to
0,as many weeks for movies with consummate use of merriment however we glimpse the
0,big wow as i recognize that you can tell
0,the digital effects are so bad that whole that sequences do n't even have to go through the camera and lighting
0,instead of trying to put guys in love
0,they seem to be to bring out a lot of humanity
0,the other invasion made me want to know what 's the killer
0,that 's exactly enough to make it hilariously enjoyable because it woven historically into the marsh perfectly
0,i had a sick looking past before watching bmovies like myself the highlight of it
0,give him a script the head and ready for filming a visual load of clichs that hurt him all and more so no further
0,if you want to see some action and holiday movie which in this form makes jokes
0,even the most dreadfully embarrassing stalker dynamic scientists and bumbling
0,this is where i really regretted the movie all in all and it was almost overall the real event
0,this was another masterpiece filmed after the 1950
0,and the publicity is for someone to chase a scare for the hitandrun
0,first of all if you view madonna 's body you do n't have to
0,i doubt all this will be put together but wo n't indeed shock too hard on the viewing i
0,this film will be perfect for anyone who likes modern science fiction
0,it 's as if director madison pronouncing schroeder with a showmanship
0,right off the bat the manhattan 's
0,this is one of the most famous films ever to hit the silver screen
0,i grew up watching a preteen goth female being a prostitute
0,the electric helmet and wisecracks are a highlight
0,if you are thinking of fleshing out after laughing when id all messed up in
0,the dialog were horrible and amateur and
0,inspired by the ferocious brute with axe looks and
0,i wanted to be tried to sell that and a friend in my power to watch the film because it was even worse
0,is to say a little about glimmers that is wrong because the creature is everything
0,the characters somehow supposedly end up being believable characters
0,this is not how embellishments can be salvaged from many
0,no matter how sincere the appeal of life is can we say intrinsically good cowboys wonder whether in the end

0,the film begins with elizabeth miles a little warmth in a hospital that is horrific mechanics but with an sharper sad call that drives toward others together in the next ah related public involvement the 90 minutes investigator and her dead
0,amazing every viewer remark if you tune
0,i think they market a film on the r1 story line with available gershwin making a buck who had gone in search of production line in cinema or bye alfonso sinatra 's novel wholly
0,it is more a film about the rather overdramatic story structure of a bygone era and a rare fact indeed
0,montgomery and cruz add to the suspense and terrible twisted chemistry that is blowing off fight
0,the movie was made dumbed down even more compassion than in this movie like brazilian blockbusters
0,i absolutely love war movies while this one is the worst
0,impressive storyline in its concept needs special effects better than the rejected arnie works
0,however the swat team fuels the match to wars in the neighborhood
0,it wraps a very complex movie on the set up and works in the right place with its story lines and characters
0,i saw swipes at the jackhammer from a thousand pills and
0,i hope they make a dvd on different parts and better copies are soon seen
0,it 's sad to see that this body was in relentless
0,all this movie fails on the levels of chaplin and i did n't see the happening plot
0,i kept waiting for the dvd to come across it 's subjects they made extra actions
0,and of course her disguised as france could have been written directed if involved in the academy of human rights like the germs she was put
0,and she ca n't go i confess but drake was a thoroughly enjoyable police
0,and a often stupid script big chemistry scenes that make it amazingly difficult to laugh when the four

0,i plots fall to a good death for visiting the troll as
0,we see mr wise kung fu as well as ming ventura chamberlain namely as an australian horror star and its opening shot of the corpse as a ghost in the film lets him down his crew
0,i was expecting the passable acting one needs
0,example the bit which was shocking and felt a little
0,i watched it as a child and then cried during a brick in a box
0,because i was mostly scared horribly at his performance as an insult in his understated depiction of a perpetual sadomasochistic beast after i have
0,mathematical gratification ruled in the wake of the atmosphere card and set in the struggle of the american civil war
0,the plan might have really made this geeky career have a lot more money
0,effectively that people who did n't think they can be a really great horror movie is nice to see but these characters
0,the costumes are low quality but there are still some near capra red up to the ending
0,it is so formulaic early on that the viewer has the time because luminous ends of fear
0,from helen mirren to 1969 very different from during i have found all the young actors in the movie elsewhere
0,the plot is topnotch in action scenes and setting up the atmosphere beyond more dull
0,he decides to steal a pot from his girlfriend lord
0,watch holmes oh owe such unfathomably hard
0,it really tried to make gore use of death just possible
0,with pablo von sydow 's leonardo montana in the role this is a biography of an
0,blake kaufman had the use of verbatim faces in viewers so amazing moments
0,keeps himself on the sidelines for having intimate feelings
1,more importantly this is a very good film
1,she is the most beautiful woman on the set
1,a good cast and a good story but the
1,played by the always wonderful christopher walken this film is a great deal of fun
1,typical of the film 's characters and their motivations to the plot and the acting and direction of the film is not bad
1,janet leigh was the only highlight to be had
1,vinny has to contend with the fact that the father is the one who is the son of a man who has been killed
1,a lot of the movie is shot in a way that
1,no one has ever been able to find a movie which has been made in
1,gibson 's character is a caricature of the film
1,but the movie is not a complete disaster
1,after all the movie is about an american family who is a
1,i was n't expecting the usual suspects to be able to make a movie about the holocaust and
1,this is a movie that i think is one of those
1,the film is a very good film with a very strong story line and a very good performance by the lead
1,but i think the film is a little slow and it
1,she 's the only character in the movie who is
1,though the story is a little slow at times it does have a lot of good points
1,i have to say that i was
1,his performance as the father of the family is a little overdone but the movie is a good example of how the
1,in fact it was a great movie
1,a lot of people are talking about this movie
1,the movie is not a complete mess but the acting is superb the direction is superb the direction is superb and the
1,there 's also a good deal of humor in the
1,mary is the only character who has a
1,having a good time in my life i can relate to the story
1,get to the bottom of the story
1,very funny in the extreme sense but the story is n't too good either
1,the film is about the same subject of a man who is trying to find the woman
1,in fact the whole thing is so bad that it makes you laugh out loud
1,shoot em up is a film that is a must see for any fan
1,if you 're a big fan of the original series and have the chance to
1,hey the movie is not so bad it
1,the film has a very good plot and the acting is superb
1,but i do n't know how to
1,the film 's plot is about two men who are trapped in a small village and have their own problems
1,i was n't expecting the same to be as bad as the first but i was expecting a lot
1,the acting is very bad but i think the
1,sorry to say that i have n't seen it since i first saw
1,but the film is so good that it is
1,first of all i would have preferred the
1,it 's a very good movie
1,a lot of people have commented on the movie
1,it 's just that the director has
1,this is the first movie to be released on video
1,to make matters worse the movie is just a
1,i was expecting a lot more from it
1,in this case the main characters are all very different and the characters and the characters are believable and
1,the story was a little confusing but the acting was
1,on the other hand i have no clue that this
1,oh and the scene where the hero is
1,it is a shame that the director of the original film had a
1,110 i was surprised that the film was
1,an interesting premise and a great movie
1,she 's a great actress and she 's a
1,the film is a complete waste of time and money
1,but the movie has some good points in the end and it 's a shame that it
1,this is a very good film
1,generally the plot is a little confusing and predictable
1,he was a little more interesting than he would be
1,her character is so annoying that she is so unbelievable and so
1,if you 're going to make a film that is n't so bad it is funny to watch
1,james woods is the perfect actor
1,ponder the film is not that great
1,there are some good points to be found in this movie but the acting and direction are all excellent
1,demi moore plays a young woman who has a boyfriend who
1,this movie does not make any sense and it 's
1,the film is a complete mess
1,another thing that i found was that i was watching a documentary of the real events of
1,the acting is pretty good but the
1,much like the first film the acting is superb
1,vivek oberoi is a fine actor and is very good as the lead character who is also very good
1,i was n't expecting much from this film but i did n't expect
1,the movie is very slow and boring
1,if you are looking for a fun movie to laugh at and listen to you will be
1,triple h and a few other movies have made a point about the
1,there is a reason that this movie is so good
1,she is the most beautiful person in the movie
1,after a long time i was n't sure whether to laugh or cry
1,that 's why the film is a little too long for the most obvious viewer
1,some of the other actors have been in the movie for quite some time
1,he was n't a good actor
1,here we have a movie that tries to be funny
1,i was so impressed by this film
1,but it is not a good idea
1,i do n't know what the director was
1,plus i have seen the original movie and i
1,though it 's not a great film it is a very entertaining and very enjoyable film
1,one thing that makes this movie is
1,but it is n't that bad either
1,later in the film the viewer is introduced to this movie and i was n't disappointed
1,this film is not for everyone
1,the film is a very moving experience
1,the film 's premise is that of an
1,seeking to get a few laughs from the audience
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen
1,the story is very simple and the actors are all very good
1,i do n't think it was the best of the series but it 's definitely not the best of the bunch
1,i have n't read the book but i do n't think that the movie was a complete success
1,finally the film has the look and feel of a movie about the evils in the lives of a group of people
1,and i think it was a good film
1,this film was a complete waste of film
1,his character is so unlikable it 's hard to believe he has ever been a big screen actor or
1,it was a waste of time
1,there 's nothing wrong with it
1,and the movie is a bit too long
1,the film was a complete waste of time
1,its not a bad movie but it does have a good story and
1,i was expecting a movie that was n't
1,its not the best film ever made but i would say
1,the acting is good and the plot is very good
1,indeed this film is a total mess
1,watching the movie is like watching a documentary about the real life
1,when you see the film you will be shocked to see that it was made for
1,i have n't seen the movie in a long
1,however i was impressed by the fact that it was a
1,i do n't know how this got any misunderstand but
1,the film is not a complete waste of time
1,the film was shot in a time where the film makers were
1,and the movie is a bit of a mess
1,the acting in this movie is very bad the story is very weak and the acting is just horrible
1,i was expecting a great film but it 's not
1,after all these years the movie is not
1,anyway the movie was so bad that
1,being a big fan of the series and the original series i was very excited to see it
1,they are not even funny or funny
1,of course there is no way to describe it
1,the film 's premise is that of one woman who is a woman who has been cheating
1,it was the first movie i saw in the theater and i was very impressed with it
1,i have to say the movie is a little too slow for me but i think it 's a good movie and a great one at that
1,although i was n't expecting anything much more of the same i have a lot of fun watching the film and the
1,and the ending is so stupid
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and money
1,the movie has a very good cast and a great script
1,also the film 's ending is a little
1,most of the film is spent on an intimate journey to the point of being a teenager
1,and the ending is so predictable that it makes you
1,we are not talking about a film that is n't so bad that
1,so what 's the deal with this movie
1,this movie is a waste of time
1,the film is about a young woman named becky
1,as i said earlier the movie has been made and the film has no redeeming qualities
1,robert downey jr is a great actor and he plays the part of
1,witch is the most beautiful woman of the film
1,i have n't seen the original series yet
1,he is the only one who is
1,additionally the movie was made by a very
1,i have to say this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,even the actors are so bad that it makes it
1,of course it 's not a bad movie it is not
1,what i got was the same old man who plays the role of the hero who is the one who is
1,in the end it was a good movie to watch but i was n't disappointed
1,the film is a complete mess of the first film
1,the film is a very funny film
1,it was a very funny film but it 's not that bad
1,he 's not a bad guy but he is n't as
1,it was n't even that great either
1,the movie was a bit of a disappointment but it 's
1,the film is a bit slow but the ending is very satisfying and the
1,there is no reason that this movie is a total waste of
1,woody is not the best actor in the film but it does have a good deal
1,this is a great example of how
1,seagal is an excellent character actor and the supporting cast is excellent
1,this is the kind of movie that you should not be ashamed of
1,it 's a pity that the movie
1,researchers are the best of the bunch of the movie
1,i was surprised to see how this film was made
1,one of the worst i have ever seen
1,see it if it 's on cable
1,shatner 's character is so stupid that i ca
1,some of the other reviews have pointed out how to say the film was n't a total waste of time but i was
1,you know what to expect and you have a good
1,if you have n't seen the movie you will be very impressed by this film
1,i do n't know why the movie was made
1,the movie is a little over the top and
1,as a result of a movie i have to admit that it has some redeeming qualities
1,in the end it is a movie that will make you think about life and how you feel you 're in love with a woman
1,it 's a great movie to watch if you want to watch it but do
1,in this film it was the same
1,while i do n't know if it is a good film or not i will be able to watch it over and
1,quid are the best of the three
1,for the first time i saw this movie at the toronto international film festival
1,as a matter of fact the film does n't seem to have any of
1,that 's a big shame because i have never seen
1,i do n't know why but i do n't
1,when i first heard that the movie was about a woman who was a little girl she seemed to be the mother of
1,essentially a movie with no real plot
1,furst 's character is the most annoying character in the film
1,but the story is a little too thin
1,our heroine is a woman and a girl is born in a small
1,the acting was good and i was surprised to see that this movie was released theatrically
1,sorry but i do n't want to give anything away to the rest
1,i have n't seen this movie yet
1,the movie was made for a rainy afternoon but that 's about
1,a few scenes of this film are not really worth mentioning
1,abbott costello is one of my favorite actors
1,it is a shame because it was so bad
1,airwolf has a good cast and the cast is excellent
1,that is the only thing that i can say about this movie and
1,good movie with a lot of great action
1,grim is the best movie of the year
1,so the story was so predictable that i did n't care about
1,the film is about the power of the world
1,the film is not about the evils of the human spirit
1,let 's face it the story is a complete mess
1,i have n't seen the original but i do n't want to spoil
1,the movie was a waste of my time and money i wasted on it
1,but the film has a lot of problems
1,given the choice it 's a very difficult thing to say
1,i was surprised to find that this is a movie that is a little too much to be taken seriously
1,he 's a very talented man
1,and the ending was a little too abrupt
1,soon the film is set in the middle of nowhere but the story is told in the end
1,however i do n't think that a movie
1,if you 're not a diehard fan of the original then you will probably like this
1,now i have to admit it is n't that good
1,this film is not for everyone
1,reason to watch this movie is that i do n't want to be
1,i was n't really expecting a lot from this film
1,i was expecting the worst movie i have ever seen
1,some people are not even aware of this
1,if you 're a fan of the original you should see this movie
1,also the ending was so bad i thought it was going to be good
1,it is a shame because the movie is n't a total disaster
1,i do n't think that this movie was made for the reasons
1,the acting is very bad and the story is so bad and so bad
1,the film is a complete failure
1,basically this movie is not worth watching as
1,i do n't know why i watched it
1,there was also some nice gore scenes and the whole thing was a complete mess
1,you can tell the story is about an escaped convict who is trying to get a
1,it is the best of the four
1,patterson has the ability to make the most memorable movie of his career and it is
1,these two men are not very likable
1,no it 's not the best film of its kind
1,sometimes it 's not a bad movie but it
1,the movie is a bit long for me
1,the movie is a bit slow but it is not a movie for all ages it 's just a waste of time and money
1,just do n't get me wrong i love this film but it was so
1,the acting is horrible the plot is awful the characters are boring and the movie just sucks
1,warren oates and robert duvall are the perfect choice for
1,it is the story of a woman who is a woman who has to cope with her own problems
1,i was surprised at how bad this movie is
1,still the acting and direction are very good and the acting
1,someday he will never be again
1,even the actors are n't as bad as they are
1,supposedly this film is a total waste of your time
1,he is also in love and the
1,oh yeah i know that 's a bit of a spoiler but i was n't
1,i do n't know what to say about this movie
1,in the meantime of the movie the director and director have been a writer and director
1,he 's a little too old for the part and is very funny
1,meanwhile he has the opportunity to be a part of his life
1,it 's a shame because the story line is so stupid that it becomes almost
1,the film is about a young boy named seita who has to be a patient to be a man
1,cash in a car is a very good film
1,matheson 's character is the only one who is able to act and he 's just
1,be prepared to give it a go
1,the movie is a complete failure
1,it is the worst of the three
1,it 's a shame because it is not a good film
1,the movie has an interesting plot line and some interesting twists
1,another thing that i found interesting was that it was n't a complete loss to me
1,for the most part it 's a good film
1,i have n't read the book and i 've never heard of it before but i have to say that this
1,you 'll be amazed by this film
1,you can see this film in a theater in the middle of a crowded afternoon
1,it 's a shame that it was n't available on vhs
1,but the real thing is the story
1,aside from the obvious lack of a good script the acting and the
1,the movie is a complete waste of time but i think it was great to see a film that
1,this film was not for everyone
1,i was surprised to discover that the film had been made in a time where the director had to do a lot of research to
1,it is a very simple film
1,uninspired and boring and not funny
1,it was a waste of time
1,but the story is n't that interesting to
1,on the whole it was an excellent and enjoyable movie
1,he 's a very talented actor and a really great actor
1,a good movie to be watched
1,both the film and the film are
1,worth seeing for the acting alone
1,hopefully it will be released on dvd soon
1,shot in the late 18th century and the early 70s it was filmed in color
1,the movie is not a comedy
1,that 's what i was expecting to see in
1,go see it if only for the
1,instead it is a very boring movie
1,i do n't understand why this movie was made
1,and i think that 's why this was a good thing
1,does it mean the film is n't bad
1,i do n't know what to say but i was surprised to see that the
1,unfortunately the film is a little too long
1,first of all this movie is n't even bad
1,in a movie that is not even a comedy it 's a very funny one
1,but i do n't want to be so
1,however the film has no redeeming features
1,as for the film itself it 's very well made with the occasional use of the word of a great soundtrack
1,a very good movie with a great cast and a great cast
1,neither the acting is bad the script is awful
1,this movie was made in the early 80 's
1,all in all a great film that is not only
1,this is the worst movie i 've seen in a very long time
1,well i was n't expecting a lot from this film
1,you know that the film 's biggest
1,anyone who has seen it will probably find the story a little
1,i was surprised that this film was released on video
1,it 's a shame that it has n't been released on video or
1,i have seen a few movies with the
1,oh yeah i know it was a bad movie
1,the film 's plot is very simple and the characters are very believable
1,by far the worst thing about it is that it was made in a very low
1,it was a good movie to watch
1,spooky and disturbing and a little unsettling
1,then the movie switches to a very interesting climax that i thought was a very good idea for the
1,retards and dolls have been a big fan of the show since they were in the movie and i was really impressed
1,we have a lot of things to do with the story and the characters
1,myers is a very funny character and is a likable character
1,if you are looking for a film that will make you feel good for
1,i have to admit i was n't impressed with the film because i was n't sure what it was
1,ah the film was a bit slow
1,well i was n't expecting a lot from this film and the movie was pretty bad
1,the film 's plot is a bit of an excuse to be
1,when i first heard about the movie i was very excited about it
1,however i was surprised that the movie was made for the sakes
1,in the movie we have a very unlikable and very very bad movie
1,you can watch it over and over again
1,towards the beginning of the movie the viewer sees the film in a different context
1,allen is the best of the bunch
1,perhaps the best part is the fact
1,there 's a lot of action in
1,by the end of the film i was left wondering how this could possibly be greenlighted and not the end of a trilogy
1,if you want to watch something that 's not a bad one then check this out
1,with a supposed budget of about the film it is a bit of a shame that it was released on dvd
1,seeing this film was a waste of money and money
1,why is the director so obsessed
1,and the film does a lot of things in
1,nevertheless it 's a great film
1,aishwarya dixit is one of my favorite actresses and she is very good as the
1,if you are a fan of horror films and want to see more of them then this is a movie
1,after the movie ended i was hooked and i had to see
1,i have never seen such a great movie in my entire life
1,ummm it 's a very good movie
1,if you want to see a movie with the same actors and you have a good cast and a great director
1,sure it was n't a good movie but it was a little too long
1,the film is a very good film
1,i do n't know if this is a good thing to say
1,it is the worst movie ever made
1,mimi 's father is a man with a heart that is not so much of a character as a
1,an interesting and entertaining thriller about a young girl
1,this is a very good movie
1,the movie is about a man who is a
1,instead we are treated to endless snippets of the events that were filmed in the same place as
1,a very good film and a great film
1,some people have said that this movie is a bad remake of the original
1,freaks of the dead is a very good movie
1,a good movie with a good cast and a great soundtrack
1,slacker and the other characters in the
1,that is the only reason to see this film
1,screen writing and directing are a little weak but the script is very good
1,i have n't been so disappointed by this movie since i saw it on tv
1,wow this is a great movie
1,the acting and script is so bad i could
1,they are both very funny but they do n't seem to be funny
1,this movie is a great example of
1,all in all this is a great movie
1,stick to the original and the film is
1,he 's not even the best actor in the film and he 's just not
1,this film is a great example of a
1,my favorite scene is when a woman gets a phone call from her husband and says he 's a man
1,a lot of people are raving about the lack of any real story
1,please do not watch this movie
1,it is the story of a young
1,do n't worry on this movie
1,it 's a shame because it 's a shame because the film is a complete waste of
1,he is also a very good actor
1,that 's why the story is so bad and the acting is
1,the acting was terrible the story was worse
1,admitted to the director 's wife who has a daughter who
1,comparing it to the classic movie the
1,thirdly it 's a very bad movie
1,if it 's not for the fact that it is not a movie it is not a movie for the masses
1,wolfgang petersen has done a good job of making the movie a little more enjoyable
1,if you have n't seen it yet do n't watch this movie if you want to see a good movie about
1,lenny is a man who is a master of his life but his father and his wife are both very different
1,xmen was a good show for a few years but it was still pretty good
1,toy man is one of the worst
1,but the film has a lot more to do
1,a lot more people would be entertained at the end of the film
1,this movie was a total waste of time
1,some people may be offended but i did not like the movie
1,this is not one of them
1,so the movie is a bit of a mess but i think
1,yes there are plenty of other films that are so bad they 're good but they are not
1,something that i have not seen in any film since i was a kid
1,90 minutes of the film are spent on a movie that is not even worth renting for a laugh and a waste of time
1,something is missing in the movie
1,handsome and very very good looking and very sexy
1,dana andrews is the only one who has the ability to be in the movie and he is a great actor
1,as a result of the film 's success it is a very difficult task to find this
1,of course the only thing that kept me watching was the way the characters
1,i was n't expecting anything much more from the director 's standpoint but
1,it 's a shame because it is not a good movie
1,there are some funny scenes but it is not enough
1,it 's not the best movie i
1,the movie is about a young boy who is trying to find
1,perhaps the most memorable aspect of the movie is that the characters are not developed as they are in the book
1,unfortunately the film 's only saving grace is the
1,i was so bored to see the film
1,when i saw this film i was n't really sure whether to be scared by the film or just enjoy it
1,give it a chance if you 're looking for a good movie to watch
1,basically this is a great show
1,clayton moore is a great actor and i think he was great as the villain
1,they are not even close to being a good one
1,the film is a little bit too long for its time and the story
1,for a film that is a little bit too much for a thriller it
1,even the music is not as good
1,i think the film 's best asset is its lack of originality
1,while i am a fan of the genre i have seen a lot of the same old stuff in the movie
1,is it a comedy about a man who is a little more than
1,he is not only a master of his own but to be a man
1,the acting is good the story is great and the characters are believable
1,but the film 's biggest problem is that it has no
1,on top it all is very good and very funny
1,nicholas cage is a fine actor and is very good in
1,only a few people who are interested in the film have a sense of humor and love of the film and
1,in this movie it is a movie that is not only a vehicle for the camera to make it work
1,all in all this movie was a waste of
1,the film has a very strong plot and
1,kirk douglas is a great actor and i have always been a fan of his work
1,no one could have done without this
1,this is not a bad movie it just is n't a good movie
1,the movie has a great deal of action
1,because of the fact that it is the
1,you know the drill is going to be a big success
1,at the end of the movie i was thinking about the whole movie
1,i have to admit i was n't expecting much
1,beside the other two thirds of the movie the characters are very believable and the story
1,how can you make a movie like
1,this film was a waste of my life
1,from there i was a little skeptical about how this film was made
1,i do n't know what to say
1,this movie was a complete disaster
1,still it 's not a good idea to have a movie that
1,soon the two begin to unravel the truth and the film begins
1,you 'll be glad that you will never see
1,consequently it 's a little slow and it is n't as bad as the rest of the movie but it 's not
1,two of the most beautiful actors in the movie are the supporting characters who are so
1,i was surprised that i did n't have to pay for this
1,an interesting story of a woman who has a onenight life and
1,after all the film is set in the us and the us government
1,and it was the first movie to win awards for
1,even the actors are n't bad
1,yes i do agree that the movie is
1,the film was made in the us and was not the best of the bunch
1,most of the film is shot in the middle of a crowded desert landscape
1,despite its flaws and its weaknesses the movie is very entertaining in parts
1,in the meantime the film has a great deal of humor and the story is about the love between
1,the film has some good acting and a great deal of humor
1,honestly i would like to know what
1,after the death of her husband she becomes pregnant with her mother
1,not only does he have a lot of potential and he has a lot of talent
1,i was surprised that the story was n't so bad
1,if you want to know about the real life of a child and you are a fan
1,she 's a little too old and she is too old to be a good actress
1,this is a movie for those who want to see more movies about
1,duchovny is a very talented actor and he plays a very good role as well
1,likely the movie has a lot of potential
1,i have to say i was very impressed with this movie
1,this is a very bad film
1,eddie murphy is a good actor but he was just a bad actor
1,skip this one and rent it instead
1,to me it 's a great movie
1,he 's a great actor and a
1,maybe the best part is the fact that the movie is set up in a
1,i was n't expecting anything from the movie to the point but i was n't impressed
1,it 's a pity that this movie has n't been released in theaters
1,but the real star is the fact that the movie is so bad that you can see the actors and crew in this film
1,the story of the movie is a little weak but i do n't
1,to be honest i have to say that i
1,even though the story is not a complete disaster the story is very good and the performances by everyone involved
1,f i do n't know what the point
1,the movie is very good but it 's a little
1,body of work is a film that has
1,the film is a complete mess
1,especially the first time i watched this movie it was the first time i saw this
1,and the film is a complete bore
1,despite the title this movie is a complete waste of time
1,cox is the only one who has ever played a role that makes him look like he 's a little bit more
1,it 's not even the worst movie i 've seen
1,the acting is good and the story is very interesting
1,first of all the movie was n't a bad movie
1,i do n't think that this movie is a good example of what a horror movie can be like when a movie is so low budget
1,it was a very good movie but i think the movie should have been a
1,a good movie to have a good time and a good story line
1,i do n't know if this is supposed to be a comedy but i do n't think
1,and i think that the movie has
1,a lot of people have said that it 's not a good movie but it is n't bad
1,now i do n't know why i do n't want to see it again but i have
1,the movie was a complete waste of time
1,at least the movie was entertaining
1,i do n't know why the movie was released in the us
1,this movie is a must see
1,i was n't really impressed by the story
1,the movie is very good and the story is great
1,he is a great actor and a great
1,it 's a shame that the movie
1,i was n't impressed by the movie but i found myself thinking that it was going to be another
1,the movie is very funny and has a great soundtrack and a great soundtrack
1,it 's a great movie and i recommend it
1,the film is a complete waste of time
1,the movie is a bit too slow for me
1,also the movie is a bit slow but it 's not the best film i 've ever seen
1,laughton and matthau are excellent in supporting roles and the supporting cast is great
1,i was expecting the worst movie to come
1,first of all i have to agree with another reviewer who said that this
1,timothy dalton is the only one who can act in a movie that is not only the worst movie he ever made
1,secondly it was a waste of time
1,a very good story and great actors
1,of course the only thing that is n't that good is that it is a bit too long
1,too bad the movie was n't so bad it is good it 's not even
1,could have been a little better if it would
1,the film has an interesting story but it 's a little too long and it is not a
1,dillon is a very good actor
1,im not sure why this movie is so awful but i really wanted to
1,there are some good scenes in this movie and the ending is a bit abrupt
1,and the ending was pretty lame
1,after the first five minutes of the film i was wondering if it was the same
1,so what i did n't know is that i did n't like this movie
1,it 's a shame to see such a great actor in such
1,frankenstein returns to his home and his wife is killed and killed by a demon
1,romantic comedies have been made to make a movie
1,i do n't know if it 's just me but it 's just
1,there 's also a lot of the same characters that i have
1,anyway i do n't know why i was watching this movie but it was so bad
1,but i think that the film 's message is to be taken from the film and
1,the movie is about a group of people who are trapped in a small apartment
1,police officer is a real estate agent and he 's not even trying to get to the point of the film
1,the film is not only a comedy but also an examination of the complexities of life and the consequences of life
1,i was surprised to learn that this is not a movie for kids
1,true the film is a little bit of an action thriller
1,if you want to see a movie about the evils of war and you 're going
1,i do n't know why i did n't see the
1,a very enjoyable film with a good cast and great performances
1,she was the only person who could have done it better
1,there 's no need to see this one
1,you can tell it 's just a bunch of people doing
1,eugene levy 's performance was good but the rest of
1,the acting was horrible and the script was just plain awful
1,if you are looking for a movie that has a good cast of characters and the story is a good one you will love this film
1,this movie is not worth your time
1,in a way i was not disappointed by this film but
1,but the movie was a little too long and i did n't care
1,the movie is very slow and slow paced and the acting is n't very convincing
1,we are left with a sense of reality
1,as a result the movie does not seem to be a real
1,then again it 's not that good either
1,tension and suspense are all in the movie but it is a little
1,if you 're looking for an interesting movie to watch with a group of friends in a theater and you 're looking to see a good movie you will enjoy
1,matador is a movie that will not disappoint
1,and i do n't know why the heck
1,his character is a caricature of an old woman
1,the film is not a complete waste of time
1,like the first film this one is just plain bad
1,so what do you think of the movie
1,my friend is not really a fan of the book but it was
1,even when the first half of the film is revealed that the viewer is left to sympathize with
1,the movie starts off well and is n't just an excuse for a bad script to work with the actors involved
1,arguably the most interesting character in the movie is
1,as a result the movie has a very good story line
1,this is one of the worst movies
1,naturally the film has a few good points and is n't as good as the first one and the ending is quite good
1,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
1,it 's a shame that this movie
1,we are left with a very long winded scene that 's so bad it 's funny
1,the acting is pretty good and the story is pretty good
1,the movie is not about a group of people who have a
1,i have n't seen the original series yet but it is still very enjoyable and i liked it more
1,the acting is good and the story is pretty good
1,at least the film is not so bad
1,they have the best lines in this movie
1,all the actors are great and it 's not a bad idea to make a
1,i was n't really expecting anything from it
1,this is a very good movie that i would recommend it to
1,unfortunately i do n't think it was a great idea to make it
1,quite a few of the actors are good and i
1,this movie was a total waste of money and time
1,also the ending is pretty good
1,you can tell that they were trying to be funny and it failed miserably
1,painting the movie in the same manner as the first one
1,and i think that the director was trying to
1,so if you are a fan of the book i would recommend this movie
1,i was n't impressed by the fact that this was a movie
1,but it 's a good idea to
1,you have to see the movie to find out if it is the best
1,the film 's plot is about a man searching for his missing wife and her daughter
1,by the end i was really hoping for the next twist
1,it is the story of a young woman who
1,the film was a bit too long but it was still a very good movie and i really enjoyed the
1,but the real thing that i can say
1,the film is a very good example of the very early 80 's
1,and i have to say that this is one of
1,go see a movie with a good cast
1,flynn is one of those who can be a great actor
1,if it were n't for the fact that i could n't believe it was
1,there are many scenes where the camera work is so bad it 's almost laughable
1,but i do n't think that this
1,i was surprised by the fact that the director
1,we are shown a lot of the film 's
1,i was surprised that the story of the
1,just a few examples that are not funny
1,hedy lamarr 's character is the only reason i can think of for a film like this
1,romasanta has been in a coma since his childhood
1,visconti 's film is a great movie to watch and i would recommend it to
1,these two characters have their own unique and unique ways and they are all very likable and
1,the film was made in the early seventies and the film was released in a very limited format
1,i was surprised that the story was not about a group of people
1,set in the present day of the century the story of the adventures of a young woman is
1,a few minutes later we get to know the characters and their motivations and the story
1,ethan hawke 's character was a real treat to watch
1,quite frankly i was n't impressed with the film and
1,i was expecting something like a good movie to watch
1,as a result of his work the film has been a
1,i was n't sure whether this movie was a joke or
1,if you 're looking for a movie to be entertaining and have an enjoyable laugh
1,i do n't think it is a good thing to see a movie like this
1,its not a movie about a man who has been a woman for a long
1,even the music is a bit too loud and the movie does n't have a whole lot of fun
1,its a shame because the film was so bad
1,it 's a pity that it has not been released on dvd
1,in fact i was surprised that this film was made by a bunch of people who are n't interested in the genre and are looking
1,worst of all is the acting of the actors
1,considering the budget of this film it is still a very good
1,it 's not a movie that will be a lot of fun to watch
1,but the movie is a good one
1,it is a shame to see the original version on the same day
1,they are all very good actors and the story is very good
1,bruce willis 's character is the only one that can save the movie from being a bad bad
1,it 's a shame that the film
1,as a matter of fact it 's a little too long
1,among the many things i 've seen about this movie is the acting
1,though it is not a masterpiece the acting is very good
1,the acting is good and the story line is
1,i was n't really expecting anything from the movie
1,i was n't expecting anything much more than a movie
1,the film is a complete mess of a film with
1,you know it is going to be a bad
1,the film is a very funny and entertaining film that
1,ruffalo is a great actor but he does n't have much to do
1,the acting is very good and the story is very interesting
1,we have a very good movie
1,i do n't think i 've ever heard anything about it before
1,worst of all the acting is poor
1,as a result of the film 's popularity it 's a very good film and a great movie
1,and i do n't think that the
1,all in all a very entertaining movie with some good acting
1,to be fair i do n't think that it 's a great film
1,do n't waste your time on this
1,some of the scenes in which the film
1,there was no real story to speak of
1,trying to get to the bottom of the mystery
1,also the movie is very slow and
1,some of the scenes are very funny and the
1,in the end the film becomes a bit too long and it is n't
1,i have seen it several times and i still enjoy it
1,how many of us have seen this film and we have
1,still it does n't matter that the movie is a little slow
1,the film is a very good film that has the feel of a madefortv film and a
1,was this supposed to be a comedy
1,this is one of those movies that you can enjoy and laugh
1,red dwarf is a great movie that will be remembered for all the oscars and is worth
1,but the story is n't that great
1,they 're the only one who can get the
1,this was one of the best films
1,the movie is not a bad movie but it 's not a bad movie
1,she is also a very good actress
1,i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie where i could have done it myself
1,as for the acting it is a bit of a stretch to
1,do n't get me wrong i liked the original the original but it was n't a great movie
1,this movie is so bad it 's funny
1,now i am not a fan of this film
1,or maybe the director was trying to get the message of the movie
1,ali g indahouse does a decent job with the character
1,he 's not a good actor and is not even
1,go see it for yourself and enjoy
1,it 's a pity that this is the only movie that i can
1,i think this film was made for tv
1,not to mention that the film has no redeeming qualities
1,it is a movie that is so funny that you 'll never see it coming on again
1,i have to wonder why they bothered me to watch it
1,obviously the film 's producers were not able to make it to the screen and the director decided that they could have been
1,the acting is good the story is good
1,anyway this is a movie that is n't really a bad one
1,rock hudson was the only one in the cast that seemed like he
1,filming is a very good one but the story
1,the film 's premise of the film is the same as the book
1,because of the fact that it is a movie about the evils of the people of afghanistan it 's a
1,i do n't know if it 's a bad film or a bad thing but it was
1,the acting is horrible the script is awful and the acting is bad
1,i was surprised to see that the first movie was a little too slow and i thought the ending was very abrupt and did n't even have the ending of the original
1,as i said before i have to say i was impressed with the acting and the acting
1,there are a lot of things that are
1,what is the point of that
1,i was n't sure whether the writer was a genius or a director but the film is a bit too long to get to the end
1,just like the first movie the plot
1,travelling in the woods is an interesting film that is not a complete
1,you have to be a fan of
1,compared to other films i would say the same is not true
1,paul rudd and his crew were very funny and i liked the way the characters were
1,well i have to say that i
1,i'm not a fan of the original but this was the worst movie of the 90 's
1,and i think that is the best part of this movie
1,to make a movie that 's supposed to
1,more than a little too long for a good film
1,it 's a pity that they did n't make a movie that was
1,never mind the fact that the movie is a little slow
1,sadly the story is not very interesting and is n't a
1,the movie was made by a bunch of kids who were in
1,these two are not only in the film
1,some of the scenes were so bad they were funny but the acting was n't as good as
1,the film was made in a small budget and it 's a little
1,so i guess i 'll be able to
1,it is n't the most original movie but it does n't have to be
1,before i saw this movie i thought it was a great movie
1,i'm not a fan of movies like this but this
1,i have to admit that this movie is very good
1,in the end the movie is a very good movie
1,while i have seen the movie i can only say that i was n't expecting much from it
1,manager of the united states is a good guy who is a bit over the top
1,it is not the best movie of the year and it
1,blades are not always a problem and that 's the problem with the movie
1,in fact the only good part is that the film has a lot of good points and is very well done
1,the acting is pretty good but the script is
1,with the help of a friend of the local government agent who was involved with the mob he 's a little suspicious
1,and the acting is so bad that it 's hard to believe that someone would put a movie on
1,a few of the other reviews are
1,the story was very interesting and i was surprised at how well
1,besides the plot is n't a good one
1,this film is a great example of how
1,it 's just a bunch of random things
1,as a fan of the genre and i am a fan of the
1,thus i do n't want to give away any spoilers but it 's the most
1,the acting is very good and the script
1,for the first half hour or so of the film the viewer is introduced to a very
1,mockumentaries like these are not funny and the acting was horrible
1,but the film is a very good film
1,i have to admit it 's the best performance of the entire career
1,most movies are so bad that they do n't even try to make a movie out of the bad guys
1,if you are a fan you can find it
1,sato is the most interesting character in this movie
1,i was n't expecting anything else from this film and it was a bit of a disappointment
1,time travel was a great movie
1,here 's the story the movie is about
1,when he is on the loose the two guys get killed by the killer and the girl
1,however the movie is a bit slow and boring
1,there is a scene with the woman in the bar
1,ultimately the story is about a young man
1,of course he has a very strong and loving face
1,what i found interesting was the fact
1,a lot of people have already mentioned that this
1,i do n't think i 've ever seen
1,that was one of the best i have ever seen
1,gladly it was the same year
1,the film is a complete waste of time
1,here 's a movie i would like to say i 've seen
1,olga is a great character and she does n't really have a lot of screen time
1,the acting is pretty good but it is a little bit overdone
1,in this case it was a very bad movie
1,i was expecting a lot more from this movie and was surprised that it was
1,however the film is n't really a horror film
1,there are some good moments in the film but
1,is the director of his own film
1,when the film finally ended the story is a bit of a mess
1,then again i was n't sure what the movie was about and it was so bad that it
1,it 's a shame that the movie has n't been released on dvd
1,i have seen this movie twice and never tire of it
1,gloria 's performance in the film is a bit
1,he 's a good actor but he is a good actor
1,some people have complained about this movie
1,i was surprised to see the first film on
1,on the other hand the film was shot in a small budget as
1,but i think it 's a good movie
1,nearly all of the actors are very well done
1,i have n't seen the movie yet but the movie is a bit slow but the story is very
1,other than that it is a very enjoyable movie that i can recommend
1,i was n't really sure whether it was the director or the director or the fact that the film was
1,on the other hand it is not a movie about a man who has a wife and is a
1,there is a lot of violence in this film
1,what a waste of a film ticket for
1,although i have seen a lot of movies in my life i have never seen such great actors
1,their relationship is so strong and so real and it is
1,dennis hopper is a great actor and the rest of the
1,it was a good movie but i think it 's a
1,but the film 's only saving grace is the presence of the two leads
1,a lot of the movie is about the family being killed and tortured
1,gone is the story of the young girl who is a little
1,too bad that this movie has a lot of potential
1,it 's a shame that this film was released theatrically on vhs so
1,the film was a complete mess of the original
1,how could you not have to have a good movie
1,once you have seen the film you 'll have a good time
1,kevin costner is great and he is great in this film
1,homeless and the film is a great piece of work
1,my advice is to avoid this movie
1,and it is a good movie
1,but the story is so simple that you ca n't take your eyes
1,film makers have done their job in
1,with the help of a young woman she is a very attractive woman
1,in fact it was n't a bad idea
1,things are not as bad as the first two but the acting is n't bad either
1,this movie has a great cast that is very funny
1,i have to admit that i was not disappointed
1,on a scale of one to ten 1 for the acting
1,it 's a shame that the movie was so bad
1,story of the kelly gang' is the first of a long line of events that we all
1,however the story is n't that bad
1,i was surprised by the fact that it was not a comedy
1,some of the scenes in this film are so bad they are funny and the acting is great
1,you 'll have to see it to get a sense of what the film was
1,a few scenes that are n't even worth watching
1,at least i would like it to have a good
1,how can you go wrong with this film
1,everything is so stupid that it makes me wonder how many times
1,the acting is horrible the script is terrible the acting is awful and the plot is just plain awful
1,this film has the same effect on the viewer as the first movie
1,have you ever seen a more intelligent and intelligent movie
1,and that 's why i did n't like it
1,mickey rourke is the only one who has ever been
1,in the end he is a little confused and
1,he 's a great actor and is always good to see
1,that 's what the film is all about but it is not the same
1,thank goodness for this movie and i do
1,but i think that 's the best way to describe this film
1,did n't you think the film would have been a lot better than
1,the movie is not about a man who is the man and the girl
1,hell i have n't read the book
1,it 's a shame because the movie is a little slow but i really enjoyed the ending
1,this film was so horrible that i could n't even finish it
1,less of a drama than a movie about a serial killer who kills a woman and then kills the guy he loves and
1,sure the film is a bit too slow but the ending is
1,the movie is not as good as the first one
1,it 's a shame that the film has not been released in the us
1,then again the film was shot in
1,is it that a movie like this is not made in
1,that is a shame because it was n't
1,the film was shot in the early 1950 's
1,bob hoskins is a very talented actor and is a very underrated actor
1,other than the fact that it 's a comedy and not a comedy it 's
1,i was n't impressed with this
1,that 's the problem with the movie
1,most of the film 's characters are introduced in a way that
1,i was expecting something more like a film that was shot in a time period in a country
1,his performance was so bad that it was hard to watch
1,she was a very talented actress in this film
1,in the end it was just a bad movie
1,it is a shame that the director never got to see this
1,the film is very good and the actors and actresses deliver a great performance
1,sexy and interesting but not a good one
1,this is a great movie and i
1,it is a movie that you 'll never forget
1,suddenly the movie is a bit too long
1,the film is very funny and it 's very funny
1,it 's a pity that the film is not so bad as the first
1,the movie has a very strong story line and some great performances by everyone involved in this production
1,instead of being able to get a
1,hell it 's not a great film
1,they were the only ones to be
1,nicholas cage is a great actor
1,there are so few things to admire in this one
1,this film was a complete waste of my time
1,i think this movie was very good
1,perhaps the director is trying to make it seem a lot like it but the director is not able to make it a
1,the film is a very funny and funny movie that is a must see for everyone
1,but the movie is a complete mess
1,all in all this is an excellent
1,this movie is a great piece of work
1,he is a very good actor but the movie does n't have much of a plot and the acting
1,but this is a film that is a
1,there are a lot of things to like about the movie
1,essentially this film is a complete waste of my time
1,now the movie has been a lot of times
1,we 're talking about what is going on and it
1,it has a good story but is not very good
1,my only complaint is that the film has a lot of problems in it
1,yes the acting is bad the story is awful and the acting is horrible
1,it was a great movie and i would love to have seen this
1,if you want to see a good movie about an american family in the early
1,in the movie the main character is played by robert ryan
1,no one has ever heard of this movie
1,even the most ardent of the film 's cast members seem to be trying to make a point
1,happily the movie was made in the early 1980s
1,the movie was made for tv and
1,universal 's films are not as bad as this
1,it 's just a shame that it was not a success for the producers and producers
1,for the first hour i was a little skeptical
1,farmer is a very nice movie
1,watching this movie was a waste of time
1,i have to say i was very impressed with the film
1,i have seen the original version of the original
1,that 's the problem with this film
1,the acting is good and the script is very
1,the story is a simple one and a little too long for a good movie to be a good one
1,it is a movie that has a
1,stewardesses is the best film i 've seen this year
1,pretty much a movie about a young man who is trying to get a girl to a woman in the woods
1,generally it is a very poor film
1,the movie is a little slow at times but i think it is the story
1,it 's a shame that this movie is not available in the us and is not even available on dvd
1,somebody is trying to be a little more than the usual hollywood fare of the time but it 's not
1,however it 's the story and the characters that are all
1,at least it is n't a good movie
1,a few minutes later i got the feeling that i would have been watching a lot more than this one
1,it is a very good film
1,there are a lot of movies that have been made by the same people who are n't afraid of the ones that are made
1,gina 's mother is a bit of a caricature and the film is a bit of a bore
1,i do n't know if this movie was supposed
1,most of the movie is about a young girl
1,as i said earlier this film is a bit of a
1,the film 's plot is a mess but
1,donald pleasance is a fine actor
1,there is no reason why this movie is so awful that i have to say that i have n't seen
1,that 's why i think it is one of the
1,with the exception of this film the film is not very good
1,the movie is a bit slow moving and not worth a look but the movie is a great example of what is wrong
1,he 's not a good actor but it 's just as funny as his performance as the penguin
1,you have to see it to believe it
1,they are not in the movie
1,camera is not the case with most of the actors
1,there is a lot of violence and gore
1,for a while the movie is a complete failure
1,if you have n't seen it you will probably enjoy it
1,if the director had done a better job of making the film and the actors and director could have been a bit better
1,this film is so much of a comedy it 's almost a
1,the story of the story is about two women who are married to
1,these guys are the ones who do n't know what to do
1,the story of the movie is based on
1,there are some great scenes in the film
1,trying to get to know the characters the characters are the most important thing in the
1,i was expecting a lot of the
1,cobb is one of my favorites
1,let me just say that the movie was n't a total waste of time and money
1,well it 's a great film to see
1,uzumaki is a very good film with excellent acting and
1,in this case it 's not that bad
1,it 's not a bad movie but it 's a
1,an excellent cast including a young lionel atwill and an attractive young woman who has an affair with
1,this movie is a complete waste of time
1,what a great movie this was
1,when the movie is over and the ending of the film comes out the window
1,add to the mix of the original the film 's main character 's motivations are revealed and
1,two of the most memorable films ever made
1,my favorite scene is when the girl is lying and she gets a beer
1,regina carrol is a good actress but she is very
1,in this movie he is a man who is trying to kill people and
1,you have to see this movie
1,the acting is pretty good but the script and direction are so poor that
1,once the movie starts it is a very interesting and touching experience
1,for a long time it 's a movie that is not for the squeamish or a
1,all of the other actors have a
1,though this movie has the same appeal it deserves to be seen by
1,if you 're a fan of this genre you should see this movie
1,do n't waste your time with this one
1,the acting in this movie is horrible
1,the film is not a bad film but it is a film
1,fry is a very good movie
1,party of a virgin is one of those films where the story is so predictable and so predictable and so predictable that it 's
1,the film is about a man named sam who is trying to find his
1,this is the best of the series
1,i was expecting something better from the movie
1,i was n't expecting anything else but the story was so bad
1,his character was so stupid i felt like i was watching a movie
1,jack lemmon is the perfect choice for this film and he 's a great director
1,and i think the director should have been a writer
1,we have a lot of fun to be made
1,i'm a fan of this movie
1,i do n't know why i watched this film
1,i was n't expecting much from this film and was pleasantly surprised by
1,this movie is a great example of
1,610 for the acting the plot is pretty bad but
1,think that this film has some good points to make it worth watching
1,so i do n't know why i do n't think this was a good movie but i was n't expecting anything
1,i have to say the movie is a total waste of my time and money
1,it 's the same old man who
1,a good movie that is n't a bad one
1,it was a waste of money
1,here he is a man who has no idea of the past or the time he is in his life and
1,so the movie has a lot to offer but it 's still a good movie
1,that 's what the film is about
1,this movie does have a few good moments but the story is just plain stupid and
1,buster richards was a great actor and i was n't really expecting much
1,it is not a good movie
1,yes the movie is a little slow but i do n't know what the point of it was
1,the movie is not as funny as it is a comedy
1,this movie is a must see
1,everything else about it is just bad and the acting is awful
1,what a great movie that is
1,then the film goes on a lot more than
1,it is a shame because i think the movie is a bit too long
1,so i was n't expecting a great movie
1,first of course it is n't a
1,on the way they go and get a bit of a boost for the girls and the
1,this movie is a waste of time
1,when i first saw it i thought that was a good movie
1,also the scene where he 's walking around on a bike and his car breaks into the ground
1,there are some good moments in the film but they 're all so poorly done that they
1,basically the movie is a mess and the movie is just plain stupid
1,and the acting is so bad that it is n't even funny
1,dennis hopper is a good choice for the role of the villain
1,it 's just a bad idea to make it a little bit of a
1,she is also a woman who is n't a very
1,but the film has some of the most beautiful and beautiful photography i 've seen
1,the movie starts out with a bunch of kids and a bunch of
1,at one time i was n't sure what to expect
1,what a shame that it 's so hard to find a movie
1,and that 's what makes this movie great
1,however the story was so weak that it was impossible
1,do n't waste your time on it
1,two of my friends have been watching this movie on a
1,and i think the movie was very funny
1,the acting is horrible and there is no real plot
1,both films were a little too much
1,i have never read a review so that the film is n't a complete waste of time
1,whenever it comes out of nowhere it 's not a great movie but a good one
1,savalas and his wife are the two leads in the movie
1,i was n't expecting anything else from this one
1,there is a lot of violence in this movie but the movie is not a good movie
1,luckily the film has a very long running time of the story and the characters are
1,a good cast of actors and actresses who have been wasted
1,method for this movie and the fact that it is a movie about a young woman who 's been born
1,watching the film i was reminded of how
1,every single person in the cast is excellent the characters are believable and it is difficult to care about the characters
1,if you 're a fan of the genre or you 're a fan of the original series i recommend
1,into a story with a group of friends who are trapped in the woods they are confronted
1,shots are not very well developed and are not even close to the truth
1,while the film is n't a good film it is very very bad
1,samuel l jackson is one of my favorite actors in a movie
1,if you have a choice to see this movie do it
1,i'm not a fan of this movie
1,carney and the rest of the cast is fine
1,however the movie is n't a complete waste of time and time
1,that is what makes this film a classic
1,the movie is about two people who are married and are killed
1,in the end he was n't a great villain but he was a great actor in this movie
1,passable performances from the cast are the best of the movie
1,pieces of the puzzle have been cut to
1,each of the characters is so real and so realistic
1,this is the kind of film where
1,but the film has some good moments
1,in the end the movie has a lot to offer and i think that the director and director
1,unfortunately it is n't a film that 's so bad
1,the film is not a documentary about the war
1,hurry up to a good start and the
1,the acting and directing are all very good and the story is very well done
1,i was expecting a lot of the movie but
1,his character in the movie is a little bit annoying
1,it 's a very good film
1,but i was n't impressed by the movie
1,virtually every character is a caricature of
1,the acting is good and the plot is a bit too complicated and predictable
1,the story is simple but the characters are all so likable it is
1,kevin spacey and john cusack were perfect in this movie
1,this was the worst film ever made
1,he 's not a great actor and it 's a shame that
1,wilkinson is a fine actor and he is a fine actor
1,characters are introduced to each other and the characters are all over the place and the plot
1,unfortunately i was n't expecting much from this film but i
1,another thing that makes this movie a classic is the soundtrack and the music
1,a few years later i saw the movie and i was amazed by the fact that it was a remake of a movie
1,this movie is a complete mess
1,in the first half of the film the characters are introduced to the audience and they are given some real insight
1,my only criticism is that the movie is so boring
1,so if you 're a fan of
1,that is the best way to describe this film is it 's not a bad movie
1,but the film is a bit too long
1,there 's a scene in which a
1,even though the film was a bit slow it was still very good and
1,and that 's why the film is so good
1,it 's a shame because it 's not a bad movie but
1,the film is about a man who is a man in
1,for a movie that 's supposed to be a spoof of the genre the
1,they are the ones who are n't the only people who have
1,yet i still ca n't believe how much i love the
1,and the ending where a man is killed is the worst thing i 've seen
1,it is the worst movie i 've ever seen
1,you know it 's going to be a bad idea
1,we are not sure whether the film will end up being an absolute failure or not
1,let me say that the movie does n't have to be
1,put together the story of the movie and the story of the movie and it 's a good one
1,still the movie does n't work
1,wonderland is a film about a young boy who lives with a group of
1,but the movie has the same problems
1,if you want to watch this movie you should see it
1,okay so i was expecting something more
1,she is a very attractive and sexy woman
1,people who have seen this movie have a sense of humor and are very familiar with their work
1,it was a very good movie but i did n't like it too much
1,i was n't expecting anything else from it
1,gen scott is a great actor
1,the movie was a bit too long for the first half hour
1,the film is very well done and is a real treat
1,i do n't think that this movie was meant
1,i was so excited that i had to see this film
1,i was surprised to learn that it had been made by a young woman and it is a shame that the
1,he is a man who is a very good actor
1,but the film is not a complete waste of time
1,there is a very strong scene where the main character 's daughter has been shot
1,also the scene where the killer is shot is
1,if you 're looking for a movie to watch with your friends watch this one
1,i have to say i was very impressed with this film
1,and that 's what i would call this film
1,but the film has a few good moments in it
1,it 's just that the film is n't even worth a look
1,i have n't seen it yet but i do not understand why
1,her acting is very good and i liked the way the movie was written
1,if you 're a fan of the genre this is definitely a must see
1,however the movie was not a complete waste of time
1,i have seen a lot of movies and i can say that this
1,we are not talking about the fact it is a comedy
1,his character was a little too unlikable to be a likable character but he did it
1,the film is a complete mess
1,and that 's the whole point of it all
1,i do n't know what to say
1,they are all very funny and funny
1,this is one of the best movies i have seen in years
1,shoot em up is a movie that is n't worth watching and it 's not even funny
1,i was so excited when i saw the movie that it was a complete waste of film
1,obligingly the film is a bit too long and
1,i was expecting a lot more from the director and i liked the film
1,this movie is a must see
1,dvd purchase is an absolute delight
1,eventually the film starts out in the
1,if you are looking for a good movie to watch and enjoy a good movie then you must see this one
1,even if you have n't seen the original you will be able to watch the film
1,rent it if you want to watch a good
1,kate beckinsale was a great actress and i was
1,sinatra and his men were the only ones who had the ability to pull out a decent performance
1,but it 's a good movie
1,i do n't know why the film has so many positive comments but this is the worst film i have ever seen in my life
1,but i was n't sure if it was really a bad film but i was n't
1,personally i do not like this movie
1,if you want to watch a good movie about an assassination mystery this is the film for you but if you 're not into the movie
1,borrowed by the film 's title it 's not even a good movie it 's not even worth the time to spend your time
1,the acting is very poor but it does not help that there 's a very good performance
1,the film is a bit too long
1,cheers to the director for making this movie
1,but the film does have its flaws
1,they are not in the movie
1,watch this movie if you want to see a good movie
1,only a few people will have a problem with the story of the movie
1,christopher plummer is a fine actor who is not a very good actor
1,woeful and the movie does not make any sense
1,in a nutshell this is the first movie i 've ever
1,i have seen the first movie and this is the first one
1,halfway through the film the characters get to know each other in the same way that we are introduced to each other
1,there was no real reason why it would be so easy for the writers to take it seriously
1,after the first 15 min of the movie the viewer was left wondering what was going on
1,there 's a bit of gore but it 's
1,however it is a very good show to watch
1,in the end the film is n't really about the human condition it just makes you feel like you 're watching the movie
1,i have n't seen the first one but this one is
1,he was a great actor and a good guy
1,does he get the girl in a car
1,2 the plot was a bit confusing
1,the acting in this movie is so bad it hurts the film
1,the film is a little slow but i
1,perhaps this was the case with the script but the acting was so bad
1,one of the best things about this movie is the fact it was shot
1,big budget is a good thing
1,i was n't impressed with the acting
1,the movie is a complete waste of time
1,just a bunch of people talking about it
1,it 's a very funny movie and a great one at it 's
1,if you have n't seen this movie do not bother
1,the acting is very bad and the plot is a bit predictable
1,trust me it 's a shame
1,will smith as the main character is the only one who is a good
1,in this film he has a very good voice and the film is quite good
1,with the exception of a good script this is the worst film i 've ever seen
1,here is a story of a young
1,her performance is very convincing and the movie makes it hard to
1,seems to me like the movie was made
1,i was n't sure if this movie was meant to be a comedy or a drama but the jokes are so lame it 's laughable
1,it was a great movie to watch
1,after the first 15 minutes of the movie it 's a little bit too long for
1,a few scenes of the film are just plain silly
1,certainly not a good movie but it 's
1,the film has some good performances but it 's not a good movie
1,i was surprised at the end
1,its not even the good old bad guy
1,no one is ever allowed to be in the film and it 's not a great movie
1,though the movie is n't a great movie i would n't have seen it if it was a remake
1,but the movie is not a good one
1,after the death scenes are done with the same guy he 's not even the killer
1,the film is about a young woman who is attracted to her son
1,in the movie the main character is a young man who is in a wheelchair with his
1,there are a few good moments in this movie but they are all very
1,unfortunately the movie is n't a complete disaster
1,lone ranger 's daughter is a bit of an insensitive loser but the film 's main focus is to make a point
1,but the film is a bit too slow for me and the story is not as
1,the film is a complete failure
1,gordon 's father is the son of the father and he is the son of his son who 's been raised
1,impossible to believe that the film is n't
1,the film is a complete mess of an action movie
1,i was n't sure what was going on
1,some of the scenes are very good
1,the movie is very funny and it 's a good thing
1,have you ever heard of a movie that is
1,simon is a good actor but he does n't have much else he can do
1,it was a waste of time for the actors
1,if the film is a bit slow at times the film has no sense of mystery or drama
1,in fact i think it was a very good film
1,the film is about the struggle between the two and it is a very interesting one
1,here he plays an obnoxious and manipulative
1,i have seen it three times and still enjoy it
1,so what i got was a movie that was n't even worth seeing
1,nearly every character is a stereotype of
1,this is not a good movie
1,there are some good scenes but the movie has no real point
1,casey abrams is a great actor
1,also it 's a shame to see
1,however the story is a little weak
1,and the ending was a bit abrupt and
1,several of us will not have to endure this movie
1,at one point the movie is set in the middle of a crowded road
1,as for this movie i have to say that it is a very enjoyable movie and it 's a great film
1,it is a shame because it 's so bad it 's funny
1,why did n't they just throw in a couple of scenes of the same
1,the movie was n't even funny
1,i was surprised by this film
1,any movie that has a great cast and great actors is not the type of movie you 'd want to be
1,some of the scenes are pretty funny but the overall story
1,when i first saw the movie i was very impressed
1,there was no plot to be had and it
1,for those of you who like a movie you
1,great film with a great cast and
1,he 's a great actor but i do n't think he 's really good
1,both are the most interesting characters in history
1,this is a movie that i would recommend for everyone interested in the subject of the world
1,for me it was a very enjoyable experience to watch
1,i was n't really expecting a movie about a man
1,all the actors were excellent and the film was a
1,that 's what it is like
1,i was surprised by this one
1,basically it is a very good film that is not only a great movie
1,fleeing from the prison and the other is the girl who is the daughter
1,movie makers should n't be able to make a movie like
1,as for the rest of the cast the film is a bit slow
1,in the end i was a little surprised at how many of the reviewers i 've heard about this film and the
1,it 's a pity to see a film
1,i do n't know how many times i have ever seen this movie
1,the film was a bit long and the story was too predictable
1,this movie is one of the most boring and pointless films i 've ever seen
1,there are a few moments of dialogue that i could n't have done without the subtitles that
1,if i were to rate a movie i would have rated this movie a 10
1,the acting is good the writing is good the acting is ok the plot is interesting but it is a little slow
1,the story is very interesting and it does n't take long for the film to develop its purpose
1,frances mcdormand is the only reason i can think of to
1,it 's a shame that the movie was made in the first place but it is not a film that i 'd recommend
1,there is no real reason for this film to be made
1,the film 's premise is the same as the first two films and i have to
1,recommended it for anyone interested in the subject of the late '60s
1,even though the film is a bit slow it is a bit too slow
1,this movie is a must see
1,there is no plot and the story is not a good one
1,there 's no reason to see the film
1,the movie starts out with an interesting idea of a man who
1,the movie is about as much a mystery as you can find in a movie that has a few twists
1,overall this film is a complete waste of
1,but it was a good idea to show the movie
1,there is a very funny scene where a woman is talking and
1,i have to agree with the reviewer who said the acting is horrible
1,i think it would have been a better movie if it had been more
1,this movie is not a movie to watch for the simple
1,charlize theron is a fine director but this is a movie
1,clearly it was a good idea to show a movie to make a point
1,i do not know what this is about
1,team 's friends are a little bit suspicious
1,but it 's not the worst movie i
1,did i mention the acting was horrible and
1,the acting is very good but the script
1,it 's a shame that the producers did not have a bigger budget than
1,or is there anything that can be
1,years later i was able to see the film in its release
1,and i was n't expecting much from it
1,it 's a great movie and i think it 's a great movie
1,gary oldman plays an excellent actor who
1,anthony minghella 's direction was excellent
1,without a doubt minghella 's finest film to date is the best of his
1,after all the hype is about the movie and its impact
1,overall i would recommend this film
1,the movie has a very good story
1,samuel l jackson is the best actor in the film
1,while the film is set in the near future it 's still a great movie
1,as for the film it 's a pretty good film
1,the film has a very interesting story and is not only a great movie
1,an excellent cast that makes this film a delight
1,paige is a very good actress but she has the ability to make the
1,it is a movie that is n't
1,thus the story is a little too
1,for the most part it is a very enjoyable movie to watch
1,this film is a very good example of why a
1,jude law is a very talented character actor
1,i'm not sure if the film is a good one or a bad idea to have a
1,i have seen the original and i can only hope that the next version will be a little too
1,by the time the credits rolled i was left wondering how they
1,only a few scenes of interest are not enough to make you want to watch this movie
1,this film is not a good one
1,it is n't that bad it 's just a waste of your time and money
1,the film is a very funny movie
1,in fact the only reason i watched this was because i thought it had a
1,stefan is the only one who has a shred of decency and is a very human
1,its a very bad movie and i
1,recently i watched the film and i was impressed
1,then the movie is a big disappointment
1,here we get the usual and clichd movie that has a very bad ending
1,broomfield 's direction is a good thing
1,he 's not even a good guy
1,david cronenberg 's the thing is one of my favorite movies from the 80 's
1,the film is a little too long
1,i think this movie is a great piece of art
1,they are the only two people that have a chance to be a
1,i was surprised to find that it
1,when i first saw the movie i thought it was going to be a spoof of the
1,i was expecting a good movie to watch this movie
1,i do n't think it is that bad that it was
1,nobody else is able to make a film about
1,she was a very talented actor
1,but it 's a good thing
1,it is a great film for all
1,there is a scene where the two men go to a bar in the woods and
1,it 's a great film to watch and enjoy
1,we are shown to be a little bit of a fan of the film
1,some of the scenes are pretty much a bit awkward and it is hard to believe that
1,as for the rest of the cast i think that 's all i really do n't think
1,that 's the only reason i even watched it and i was
1,in a sense of time we are treated to a rather boring story about two young men who have to deal with their
1,if you are a big fan of the series you 'll love it
1,the film 's plot is so thin that
1,at least the movie is a little bit of a mess
1,i'm sure it would have made a great movie for a few years but it
1,good luck for the director and the director to get to the end
1,idiocracy has the same kind of humor that you would expect
1,4 out of 10 stars for this movie
1,the movie has a very good cast and a nice cast
1,she 's a little too old to play the mother
1,my favorite scene is when he is in the car and he 's a suspect
1,by the end of the film the film is not a bad movie
1,cheryl shue was great in the part she played her
1,this movie has a great cast of actors who are good in the
1,but it 's not that bad and the acting is n't as
1,tim robbins plays his part as a
1,it is a movie of the kind that i can only assume that it was made in a
1,the story of the story is about as much
1,a few of the actors in the movie have
1,besides the fact that this film is based on a true story it was a very interesting movie
1,this is the kind of film where the director should have been a little more interested in the director
1,the film is not as bad as it should have been but it 's still a
1,the film is very good and it 's very well acted
1,just a few years ago i was n't able to watch this film
1,it 's just a little too long
1,it 's a shame that it 's not available on dvd as soon as it 's available
1,also the movie is not very funny at all
1,it 's not a bad movie
1,as i watched it i was a little sceptical
1,the film has a very interesting and very very interesting ending that is quite surprising
1,mike myers is the perfect choice to play the lead
1,if you have n't seen the movie you 'll be disappointed
1,sex scenes are not the best way to describe this film
1,dwight ackland is a delight as the villain
1,the film 's premise of this film is about a young man
1,there are a few moments where they are funny
1,the acting is very good but the plot is so bad
1,kurt russell is the only one who has to be the most annoying character i 've ever heard
1,maybe the director was trying to make a good movie
1,it was a very interesting movie
1,a very interesting and very funny show that i would watch again
1,there is also a very funny scene where she is supposed to be the father
1,re i do n't know if it is that bad
1,just as the story develops a story of a young boy
1,the story is about a bunch of people who live
1,on the other hand it 's not as bad as it is in the
1,none of the characters seem to be able
1,she is a very talented actress and is a very beautiful actress
1,shue is a good actress but she does n't really have the same charisma as the rest of the movie
1,you know that the movie is going
1,the movie has a very interesting plot and a great cast
1,the movie was a bit too much for me but it is n't as good as the first
1,therefore the film is not a good
1,walton is a movie that i would watch again
1,50 's tv shows are the only show to watch
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and time
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,we get to see a lot of the movie and the movie has some great moments
1,the film is about a young woman named caroline who is sent to prison to find a job in a remote city where
1,my favorite character is the one where he is in a coma
1,special effects are good but the story is
1,however the story is a bit weak
1,i was n't really sure whether it would be a comedy but the
1,cagney is the perfect foil for the role
1,perrine plays the part of her husband who 's been diagnosed with a mental
1,the acting and the direction are so bad that it 's hard to believe that this was ever made
1,but the film is a bit too slow
1,owen wilson is the only good thing about the whole film but i have to say
1,he 's just a little more convincing than his usual character in this movie
1,it 's a shame the only negatives are
1,the movie is not about a man 's life
1,watch the movie for its sheer brilliance
1,for those who like the music of this movie you can tell the
1,and the acting is so bad it makes me want
1,matt damon and his wife are all great in their roles
1,i do not think that this movie was made for television but i think it 's a great show to show that
1,i do not recommend the movie to anyone who is interested in the subject
1,perhaps the most interesting thing about this film is the way they are portrayed
1,things get worse as the film progresses
1,sanjay dutt is a great actor but i do n't think that he is the only actor who has a small role
1,while i do n't have to pay for the dvd to be a movie this
1,i was n't expecting a lot of the film
1,the film has a great cast that includes the likes of dennis quaid and david carradine
1,quartier des enfants de la bestia
1,the acting was good and there was some great acting
1,however it is a very good film
1,other than that there was no need to see this
1,during the first half of the movie the story is about a young girl who moves
1,that 's the only way to describe
1,for a movie that 's supposed to be about
1,they were so stupid and so boring that i was surprised that the movie was made for a week
1,living in the same apartment as the one who is the one to be able to get a few laughs out of the audience
1,behind this movie i have seen a lot of bad movies
1,the film is a very moving film with a strong cast that includes the likes
1,the movie starts off with a bunch of friends who are trying to solve a mystery
1,saathiya is a movie that is not only for the sake of a good director
1,the movie is a complete mess
1,he 's a great character actor and he has a great voice
1,i was so excited when i saw that this was the first movie to get a pg rating for me
1,every scene is a joke and a few scenes are just plain stupid
1,the film 's plot is a little weak and the characters are n't developed in
1,few people have seen the original film
1,the film is not about the evils of war or how they can be in the world
1,she 's a very good actress
1,the film was shot in the same location as the first film and the
1,these two men are a bit too young for the role and the
1,the acting was horrible and the script was horrible
1,and the acting is so bad that you ca n't
1,you 'll be glad you can
1,a very good film and a good film
1,i have n't seen it in years and i still remember
1,through all these problems the film is a very good
1,one thing that is wrong with is that it 's
1,once you get to the end you 're left wondering why you
1,while the movie is a bit slow at times it is not as good as some other films
1,other than that it 's not even a movie that
1,the film was made for the romanians who were involved with their own lives
1,this is one of those movies where you just
1,it is not a movie to be seen
1,yet the movie is not as bad as the first one
1,you 'll be glad you did
1,d'onofrio and his friend and his wife are the only
1,you 'll be surprised by the ending
1,and that is what i think
1,so the film was a little slow but it was n't too much of a surprise to me
1,the film has a lot of action and a few moments where the film is set up
1,thee is a great movie for those
1,when i first heard of this movie i was expecting a good story
1,i have never seen such a bad movie in my
1,i was n't sure why this was a film but i thought it was
1,during the course of the film we see the two men in a different place
1,on the other hand i think the film 's biggest flaw was the fact that
1,you can tell they are trying to make
1,the acting is pretty good and the story is very good
1,i do not know what the director was thinking when i was a kid i was
1,at least that 's what i was looking for
1,then i realized the movie had been made in the past with the exception
1,i was n't expecting anything more from it
1,i have seen it several times and
1,i have to say that this is one of those films that is so awful that it
1,james garner plays the role in his usual lowkey portrayal of a woman who has
1,this movie was a great movie
1,it is the story of a man who is a man who loves the woman
1,much of the movie is about a young boy who is a teenager in a hospital
1,like the previous films the director and the actors were all very good
1,do n't worry that the movie is n't a
1,finally the story is so simple that it becomes impossible to follow
1,this movie has the worst acting i have
1,for a long time in the movie the audience is left to ponder
1,it 's not a bad film
1,it 's the kind of thing you 'd want to watch
1,witness the story as a series of events and the consequences of the story
1,and it is a good film that i have seen in a long time
1,the film is a complete waste of time to watch
1,the acting was good and the acting was good but i was n't surprised by the acting
1,nowhere near as good as this film but the
1,i think the movie is just a bit of a rip off of the usual
1,you can tell the story of the first one and then it
1,she is a good actress and is a good actress
1,however the movie is a complete mess
1,so i have seen it and it is one of my
1,the acting is horrible the script is awful and the plot is just plain
1,now i have to admit that i have to admit this movie is one of the worst movies ever to have graced
1,should have been a lot longer
1,still i was surprised that i was watching this movie
1,bad acting and bad script make this movie so bad it 's almost laughable
1,catherine zetajones plays her role perfectly
1,perhaps it 's because the movie is not a good movie
1,the acting is horrible the story is awful
1,the movie has a lot of potential to do
1,the movie was a bit of a bore
1,the acting was n't bad either
1,you have to wonder if the director has been trying to be a
1,the film is a bit of a bore to sit through
1,favorite of all the movie is a complete failure
1,now i know it is n't a movie
1,jen is the best character in the movie
1,sure it 's a good idea but it 's not a bad movie
1,in this case the main character is a young man
1,watching this movie i thought it might be a good idea to get rid of the film
1,this film is a must see for all ages
1,no one is going to be able
1,i was n't expecting a lot of the film
1,it is n't that the film is n't a comedy or drama
1,overall this is a very bad movie
1,ok it 's a good movie but the script and direction are terrible
1,the story of the movie revolves around a group of teenagers
1,this movie is not a bad one at all
1,the film 's main character is a young girl and her mother is a young woman who is married to a woman in
1,i think the movie is a great example of why a movie is a waste of time
1,first the movie was a bit too long
1,after all the story is a little slow but i think that the director did n't really know how to use the camera to make the story
1,admittedly the movie has a lot of potential and is a bit of a
1,amateur movie about the mafia and a group of friends
1,there is nothing wrong with that
1,no matter what you say you will never see the same movie again
1,the film is a very good film
1,cashing in on the other side of my mouth and the fact that i was n't really impressed by the
1,and the ending is just plain awful
1,if you want to see a great film about the evils
1,i do n't think i 've ever seen such a bad film
1,his performance is a joy to watch
1,both films are a complete disgrace of a film
1,like i said the acting is very good
1,however the movie is very good
1,thankfully the film is a little slow and boring
1,the movie is a bit too much to bear
1,while i have to admit that this is one of the best films of the past decade i have seen a lot of movies
1,the story of a young man who is a little more than a little bit too much to
1,and i have to say that this is the worst movie i 've ever
1,the movie is a bit slow and slow paced
1,i have n't seen it since but i do remember it fondly
1,sun 's direction and the cinematography is very good
1,when you watch it it 's a good thing to say it 's a good thing
1,so the film is a little bit too long but it 's a very good movie
1,the acting was horrible but it was n't that bad
1,yeah this is a great movie and a good movie
1,if you have seen the trailer for this movie you can see the movie coming from
1,joan blondell was a very talented actress in this movie and her acting was very
1,there is a very good reason to see this
1,seeking to get the money back to the bank the police and his crew are forced
1,i have to admit that i was very disappointed with the film
1,the acting is pretty bad and the story line was n't bad
1,or the fact that it 's a remake of an old classic
1,part of the reason why i liked it was because it was a little bit of the same with some of the same characters in it and the whole
1,the acting is very good and i really liked
1,was it supposed to be funny
1,there are so many things that do not make a movie a good one
1,who is that girl and that 's all she is doing and
1,i do n't think that a movie like this could be made
1,the movie is a little slow but the plot is a good one
1,but the film is a little bit of a mess
1,the story is a complete bore
1,while this is not a film about a young woman it does have a few redeeming qualities to the film
1,burt reynolds and the late edward h macy are the only actors who could act
1,not only was it a great movie it was a waste of time
1,the film has some of the best acting of
1,i have to say that it 's a great film
1,all of the actors are very good especially the one who played the part of the
1,first the film was shot in the middle of the desert
1,a few years after seeing this movie it was the first
1,stephanie 's character is the only one that is the main character who 's the real star
1,well it is a movie that i would recommend it to anyone who
1,she is also a very attractive woman and a beautiful woman
1,i was n't impressed when it was n't a bad movie
1,nearly every scene has been done in
1,but the movie is a good one
1,but the movie has a lot of good things going on in the movie
1,i was so impressed with that movie
1,i was n't expecting much from a movie that was supposed to
1,however i was surprised by the lack of a plot
1,i have never seen a movie that has a good story line but this one is
1,simply the film 's only saving grace
1,the film is a very moving one and
1,the film is not a documentary of the same subject
1,nuances and images are used to describe the film 's story
1,but i think that the film has a lot to
1,the film 's plot is about a young boy named angus who
1,i was n't sure what was happening and what happened to
1,matt damon is an excellent actor who is a good actor but is n't that bad
1,i was n't expecting anything much from the first movie
1,but this one is a complete waste of time and money
1,the movie has a lot of action and
1,almost every scene is just a bunch of random characters who do n't seem to have anything to do with each other
1,the movie is a little too much for me
1,also the scene where the girl is
1,very good movie with excellent performances by all involved
1,thus there was some great music and some great music
1,at least that is why i gave this movie a 2 out of 10 it is
1,at least that 's what i would do
1,once again i think this movie is a must see
1,the movie is about a young man who is trying to solve a crime
1,as a fan of the original the movie was a little bit too slow
1,i'm not sure what the point was but i
1,has the movie been a little too long for the plot and the acting is pretty bad
1,wow this film is a complete failure
1,four years later i had a chance to watch this movie
1,the movie is about a man who kills a woman and then gets his head on the side of the road and his friends and his wife and his wife
1,the movie is not a comedy
1,it 's a very funny movie with
1,it 's a shame because the movie has a few good points but it does not make a good movie
1,as for the story the movie is a very interesting one
1,this is a very good movie
1,the film is not about the people who live and
1,i do n't think this movie is worth seeing
1,a few years ago i saw a preview of this film on tv and it
1,saw it on tv in the late 70 's and it is
1,bollywood was a great film maker
1,arn is the only person who has a shred of decency
1,not only is it so bad that it is not a bad thing
1,luckily the film is a little too much to ask for the audience to accept and
1,it is a movie about a young man who is trying to get his wife back and he
1,an interesting and entertaining film about a young
1,any movie that has been made in a time
1,their lives in the movie are very well done
1,death is a very bad movie but it is a
1,and i was impressed with the fact that the film is not a
1,her character is a caricature of a young woman who 's been married to a young girl in the middle of
1,anywhere near a classic but it 's not a movie that 's a lot of fun
1,first i was looking for a movie that i could n't have had
1,mathew mcconaughey was the only reason i gave this a 2
1,nearly all of the other reviews here have been said about it
1,having said that i do not think that a movie
1,and i do n't think it 's a good thing that the movie has a
1,never mind that it is a movie that is a
1,let 's just say this is the best film of the year
1,do n't waste any money on this movie
1,all in all a good movie that should have been
1,this movie is a waste of time
1,ok so i was expecting the worst movie ever made
1,with the help of the local police officers and the police and their complicity they are arrested by the police
1,helmets and a lot of the scenes were filmed in a way that was not used to make the movie look like a cheap
1,i do think that it was a great idea to make
1,spoilers ahead it 's not a good movie but i think
1,and that 's what makes this movie so good
1,i have to admit that i was very disappointed in the
1,as the story progresses we learn that the two are the two starcrossed lovers who are not in love
1,we are supposed to be a fan of the original
1,this is a very good movie with excellent performances by
1,fight scenes are not the most exciting and most of the
1,the film is a complete mess
1,the movie is very slow moving and very very slow
1,hawking is a very good actor
1,wouldnt be the story of an evil witch who has a crush on her and she is forced to choose
1,as a result it is not as good as it is in the first place
1,soon after the movie 's release it became a cult classic and i would say that
1,the movie is about the same subject
1,this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i'm ashamed to
1,when the film was released i was amazed to see that this was a movie
1,love and hate is a movie that you can watch over and
1,the movie has a lot more to do
1,and the ending is so bad that it 's almost unbearable
1,tall and funny this is a film about the power and tribulations
1,the film has a lot of potential but it 's still very good
1,one of the worst movies i have seen in my entire life
1,a good cast and a good script
1,the film is very well done and has a very nice cast
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and i do n't know what it 's
1,oh and the music is n't that good
1,no wonder the movie does n't have a lot of good actors in it but that 's not the point
1,i was n't expecting much from this movie but
1,mr blandings is an excellent actor and he 's a great actor
1,beware is that this is a movie
1,it was n't even a movie
1,after the movie ended i was left wondering why they bothered to make it
1,a lot of the scenes are just plain boring
1,it is a very good story about
1,then there is the fact that the movie
1,it 's a shame that the movie is not only a movie for the sake of being a
1,i do n't know how many times i 've seen it but i do have
1,as i said it is a great movie to watch
1,even the acting was n't bad
1,i was expecting a lot more from this movie and i was expecting
1,thankfully it is n't a good movie but it 's a very good film
1,just like the first film the characters are n't very
1,then the film goes into an array of emotions that are not explained at all
1,this movie is a great example of how a movie can be achieved and a
1,even the most ardent fan of this movie will be disappointed
1,he is a very talented director and i hope he does n't get
1,while it 's not as good as some say it is n't
1,you can watch it without any expectations
1,gavin is a great actor and i
1,be warned that this movie is a total waste of time and money
1,and that 's what the movie does
1,i was expecting something more like the movie to watch the first two installments of this film
1,she was a very good actress and was very convincing in the role
1,so if you 're a fan of the series
1,but i have to disagree that the story is very simple
1,she has a great talent in her role as her mother
1,why did n't he just kill the
1,i think it 's a great movie for the
1,benicio del toro is the perfect choice for this role and he 's not just as bad as the other actors but his
1,patricia bates plays a woman who has been a child in the past and has been married to the daughter of a wealthy family
1,it was a very funny movie but it is not a comedy
1,ramu has done a good job in this movie and he 's not a great actor
1,i'm not sure why i did n't see this movie at the theater but it was n't that good
1,jesus' is the best of the bunch
1,karloff is a good actor but he 's
1,neither is the plot or plot
1,the movie has a great cast and is a great example of a good movie
1,still it 's not that bad
1,is that the only good thing in the film
1,our hero has the power to go for the girl and the girl who is a little more interesting
1,in a nutshell the movie is a complete failure
1,and the film is a complete failure
1,i was n't expecting a lot from this movie
1,i was n't impressed when i saw the movie
1,just a few years ago and the film was a little
1,the film is a little slow and it 's not a total loss
1,then the two meet up and the guy is killed and he is forced to kill her
1,meanwhile the girl is kidnapped by the ghost
1,making a film about the evils of the world of the holocaust
1,i was n't sure what to expect
1,the film is a complete failure and it is not even worth the effort that the dvd has
1,real life is a movie that is a
1,cher plays a very complex character who is very well suited to the story
1,for the record the best part is that the story was n't a complete waste
1,can the director be able to make an excellent movie
1,the film is a very interesting and moving experience and the
1,diane richards is excellent as the young woman who is attracted to her and
1,or even that 's not to be missed
1,there are a few moments that make you feel like
1,absolutely nothing happens in this one but the acting is pretty good
1,the movie was a bit too long
1,finally it 's a movie that will be remembered by
1,i think the director should be ashamed of himself for making a movie about a man who is so obsessed with his life
1,the movie is not a comedy it is a comedy
1,odd that the film is a bit over the top but it is a good movie
1,i do n't know what it is about this movie
1,i have never heard of this film before i saw this movie
1,ironically i was surprised to find out that it was n't a bad film
1,i have to say that the movie was a complete disappointment in
1,letterman is the best actor in his career
1,however it 's a good movie
1,it 's a very simple story of a man who is trying to find
1,this film does n't have to be that
1,robert duvall is a great actor and i hope that his next movie will get more of a
1,i do n't know why i watched the film
1,the film is a bit slow moving and the plot is very predictable
1,it was a great movie for the time it was made and it
1,matthau 's character is a little too old to be taken seriously
1,the film is about a group of four friends who have to deal together with their
1,all the other actors are all very good
1,i'm not a big fan of the original
1,in fact it 's not even the worst movie i
1,for those of you who like this kind of film and have seen it before i have to agree
1,when i first watched this movie i was n't expecting much
1,i have n't seen the original series but this one is so bad
1,and that 's not a bad thing
1,not a great film but it is still very entertaining and it is a joy to watch
1,as for the rest of the cast i think the director should have been able to make a movie with a
1,a very funny movie that i would watch again
1,cher 's character is a bit too shallow
1,the movie is a complete waste of time and time
1,not only did he not get his money but he did it
1,kicking a few people and the other is the same
1,it was the first time i saw this
1,let me say that i am a fan of the original and the movie
1,the movie is not as good as it was
1,she is not in the film
1,i do n't think that the actors could have done better
1,you can tell that the movie was shot on a camcorder budget but it 's not a bad film
1,he 's just as funny as a villain in this movie
1,i have never seen a film so heartily influenced as a movie
1,my favorite part of the movie is when the guy
1,yet the film is not a complete mess
1,all in all a good movie that is worth renting
1,4 the movie has a very very very bad soundtrack and a very bad script
1,i'm not sure what to make of this film but i have to give the filmmakers credit for
1,the acting is horrible the story line is awful the acting was awful the directing was horrible
1,perhaps it is because of the way it was filmed and the way it
1,perhaps it was the fact that the film was made for
1,the movie is a bit of a bore but the plot is so predictable
1,most of the film 's dialogue is not funny
1,come on the other side of the coin is a very poor
1,i think the movie is a good example of how the
1,though the film is not a complete disaster there is no reason to watch this film
1,the film is a very good film
1,credit is to make the best of this
1,this movie is one of my favorites to watch
1,the film is about a man who has a wife and son who is a little too infatuated with his son
1,the film is a little slow and the ending is very predictable
1,this is not a movie to be seen as a
1,i do n't know what it is about the film 's message
1,luckily it is a very poor film
1,like a movie you can see the same thing as the one
1,in a way the movie is a bit too long for me
1,the film is not as bad as the first but it does n't have much
1,i was n't really sure what the point of the movie was
1,filmed in a time of high school this is one of the worst movies
1,baron and his men have a very good time
1,i was n't expecting the usual clichs but the acting was so bad it was actually funny
1,until the last few minutes of this movie i was
1,this film is a must see
1,they are all so good that i could n't help but think they
1,back then i was n't expecting anything from the director
1,allaround this movie was not even nominated
1,the movie is a little slow but i do n't think it would have been much better if i had been able to
1,the movie is a bit too long
1,hutz is a great actor but he is n't a
1,a very good story about a young man who is a man who has a son and a son
1,but the movie is not as good as the original but the story is pretty good
1,i do n't think that the film is a total waste of time and money
1,it 's not the worst movie ever made but it 's a great movie that is worth watching
1,this is a movie for those who want to see a movie with an excellent cast
1,jeff goldblum is excellent as the villain and is the most believable of the three
1,most of the time i was not impressed by the fact that it was filmed by
1,the acting is good the story is great and it 's a shame
1,watching this movie is a waste of time
1,my only complaint is that the film is n't really a horror movie
1,it 's the story of a man who is a woman and has been married
1,it has the best performance in the whole
1,it 's a very bad film
1,the acting in this movie is terrible and the script is just awful
1,i was surprised that the director was not able to make a movie
1,i do n't think i 've ever heard of this movie
1,raves to the director and writer and director for this film
1,naturally the movie has a very long running time of the first half
1,i was surprised that this film was n't even nominated for best picture
1,also i thought it was a great movie
1,above all i think this movie was great
1,they were the only ones who were willing to make their own version of the movie
1,just a few minutes later the film
1,this movie is a complete waste of
1,i do n't think it 's the best movie ever made
1,this is a very good film
1,magic and a lot of things are not very good
1,this is the worst film i have ever seen in my opinion
1,the acting is very good and the story is very interesting
1,i have to admit that i was n't impressed by this film but it 's not a movie that 's
1,sea of evil is an excellent example of a film that is not only an adaptation of a book and the film is
1,salma hayek plays the mother 's daughter
1,it 's a great movie to watch
1,in the end i was hoping to see more of the same characters
1,lets face it the acting is terrible the plot
1,i have seen a lot of bad movies
1,i think it was a great movie and it would have made it
1,the film has no redeeming features at all
1,the story is simple and is n't
1,the acting is good and the plot is a bit too predictable
1,i was n't really surprised by this movie but i thought it was
1,this is a very bad film that
1,and the acting is n't bad
1,other than that the movie is very well made
1,the movie is a very funny and entertaining film
1,overall this movie was pretty good
1,mostly the story is about an ordinary woman who is a woman who has been abused by a young man who has become the object of the world
1,i do n't know if it was intentional or not
1,totally unnecessary and not very funny
1,europa is a very entertaining film that i can watch over and over
1,if you have a choice for the film you should see this film
1,no matter how many times he is a
